<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I N RECENT years, the collective behaviors of multiagent systems have attracted extensive attention due to the growing interest in animal group behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Numerous issues have also been addressed such as consensus problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, formation control <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and so on. A fundamental approach to make the states of multiagent systems reach an agreement on a common value of interest is consensus analysis. Roughly speaking, the consensus problem generally means how to design network interaction protocols (or called algorithms) based on local information of nodes' dynamics such that all of the agents asymptotically or even exponentially reach an agreement on their states. At present, the consensus problem has attracted extensive attention in different research fields due to its broad applications in cooperative control of unmanned air vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, formation control of mobile robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, control of communication networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, management science and statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, system and control <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, flocking of social insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, swarm-based computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and so on.</p><p>In the past decade, numerous studies had been conducted on the consensus problem for multiagent networks with first-order linear dynamics, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. A framework of consensus problem in networked dynamical agents was established in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> by Olfati-Saber and Murray. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, Jadbabaie et al. further discussed the linearized Vicsek's model and obtained that consensus can always be reached as long as the switching topology is periodically jointly connected or ultimately connected. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Ren et al. extended the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and presented some more less restrictive conditions for reaching consensus of agents under dynamically varying interaction topologies. However, when the driving force (acceleration) is introduced as the control input in practical systems, each agent should be modeled by a double-integrator dynamical system. Moreover, in reality, a broad class of harmonic oscillators <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and pendulums <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> is second-order dynamical models, which are governed by both position and velocity terms. In contrast to the first-order consensus problem, it has been shown that consensus may fail to be achieved for agents with the secondorder dynamics even if the network topology has a directed spanning tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The consensus problem of double-integrator agent systems has also been studied extensively in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, to name a few. By the existing literature, we know that consensus of the double-integrator agent systems depends on not only the topology of the network but also the coupling strengths of relative position and velocity states between the neighboring agents.</p><p>In real communication environment, dynamical behaviors of agents in networks are determined by the interactions among them and their intrinsic dynamics (disturbances and unmodeled uncertainties of agent) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Protocols dealing with second-order consensus of multiagent systems with nonlinear dynamics have not been involved until the recent works <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, a kind of measurement for directed strongly connected graphs, i.e., general algebraic connectivity, was first introduced by Yu et al. The authors built the bridge between the general algebraic connectivity and the performance of reaching an agreement of the second-order multiagent systems with nonlinear dynamics. A similar problem has also been studied by <ref type="bibr">Song et al. in [19]</ref> through the use of pinning control technique, and it is worth mentioning that the restriction on the aforementioned approach in which the interaction network is strongly connected is removed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. There exists a common drawback in the literature, i.e., the network topology under investigation is fixed. However, practical networks are usually in uncertain communication environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, so the information flow between any pair of agents may be subject to failure with a certain probability in the real world. In such cases, the network topology is constant in some time intervals and randomly jumps to another topology when certain occasional events occur at some random moments. Therefore, it is important to study the system with random network topology, the existence of whose edge is probabilistic. Moreover, the dwell time of each topology is unknown in advance, and the weighted adjacent matrix is not necessarily nonnegative due to the probable existence of deteriorated communication channels in reality. Mathematically, dynamics of agents in such kind of networks can be modeled as a kind of arbitrarily fast switching nonlinear systems. As described previously, the study on the second-order dynamical consensus in multiagent systems with arbitrarily fast switching topologies is complicated and challenging, particularly when there exist isolated agents in some topologies in the switching sequence.</p><p>Motivated by the aforementioned discussions, this paper will focus on the second-order locally dynamical consensus of multiagent systems with nonlinear dynamics in the directed networks with arbitrarily fast switching topologies. In our designed framework, each link in the network, which represents the information flow between any pair of agents, could be subject to failure with a certain probability. Moreover, it is assumed that the dwell time of each topology is unknown in advance and the corresponding adjacency weighted matrix is not necessarily nonnegative due to the deteriorated communication channels. By the orthogonal decomposition method, the state vector of the resultant error dynamical system could be further decomposed as two transversal components, one of which evolves along the consensus manifold and the other evolves transversally with the consensus manifold. Thus, the problem to be solved is simplified as analyzing the locally asymptotical stability of a fast switching dynamical system with respect to the component that evolves transversally with the consensus manifold. The difficulty using Lyapunov theory is that there is no general method on how to construct a suitable Lyapunov function for such kind of fast switching systems. In what follows, by introducing the generalized matrix measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, we instead make use of contraction and circle analysis methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> to study the second-order locally dynamical consensus of multiagent systems with arbitrarily fast switching directed topologies in detail. Several easily verified criteria are also derived for reaching the second-order dynamical consensus. From our main results, to verify whether the locally dynamical consensus in a multiagent network with arbitrarily fast switching directed topologies can be achieved, we only need to validate the obtained criteria along each cycle which consists of some specific topologies. If all of the values are negative, then the consensus can be guaranteed. Moreover, we also find that, only if the position and velocity coupling strengths are sufficiently large, the arbitrarily fast switching can be tolerated. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our theoretical results. Moreover, the obtained results are quite powerful and can be further used to explore various switching cases for complex dynamical networks. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Some necessary concepts and knowledge with respect to random graph theory are given, and problems are formulated in Section II. In Section III, the main results are provided. A numerical example is presented in Section IV to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results. Finally, this paper is concluded in Section V.</p><p>Notations: We use the following notations throughout this paper. Let R + be the set of positive real numbers. R n and R n×m denote the n-dimensional Euclidean space and the set of all n × m real matrices, respectively. For a vector u ∈ R n , its Euclidean norm (or called 2-norm) is defined as u = (u T u) 1/2 . I n and O n denote the n-dimensional identity matrix and zero matrix, respectively. Let e = [1, 1, . . . , 1] T . For a symmetric matrix A ∈ R m×m , the minimum and maximum eigenvalues are denoted by λ min (A) and λ max (A), respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Random Graph</head><p>A graph consists of a set of vertices, each pair of which is endowed with an incidence relation represented by an edge. The set of vertices and edges of the graph G are denoted by V and E, respectively; in this case, we write G = (V, E). In our designed framework, for a random graph on N vertices, the existence of an edge between a pair of vertices in the set V = {1, 2, . . . , N} is determined randomly and independent of other edges with probability p = 0.5. The sample space (the set of all possible topologies) of such a random graph will be defined by M . Let m(t) be a topology indicator, i.e., m : R + → M . Let t k 's be the switching moments appearing in the running process of the time-varying dynamical network G(t), where t k ∈ R + , k = 1, 2, . . .. Thus, m(t) is a piecewise left continuous function, which keeps unchanged when t ∈ [t k , t k+1 ) and randomly jumps to another topology in M at t = t k+1 . Since there are totally 2C 2 N potential directed edges among N vertices, the cardinality of M , i.e., |M |, is bounded, and its upper bound is 2 2C 2 N . In this paper, we use the tool of random graph to describe a multiagent network whose directed topology switches arbitrarily fast. Specially, the existence (nonexistence) of a directed edge E ij ∈ E in the random graph G(t) is represented by an ordered pair of vertices (i, j), which practically means agent j can (cannot) receive the position and/or velocity information from agent i in the network. For a dynamical network G(t) with N vertices, we assign it an adjacency weighted matrix W = [w ij ] N ×N . Negative weights may also exist in W , which means the probable existence of deteriorated communication channels or natural disagreement of the child node over the information obtained from its parent node. If the one-way information channel between agent i and agent j is established successfully when t ∈ [t k , t k+1 ), the edge E ij exists and is naturally assigned a weight w ij when t ∈ [t k , t k+1 ). Meanwhile, the effect on agent i by the information received from agent j is a positive correlation with</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">w ij when t ∈ [t k , t k+1 ). Supposing that W = [w ij ] N ×N is the weighted matrix of random graph G(t) at time t, we use L(m(t)) = [L ij (m(t))] N ×N to denote the corresponding Laplacian matrix of G(t), where L ij = -w ij if i = j and L ij = N k=1 w ik if i = j. The Laplacian matrix L is a zero row sums matrix; therefore, e = [1, 1, . . . , 1]</formula><p>T is an eigenvector of L associated with the zero eigenvalue <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In addition, the rank of L is equal to N -1 if and only if, for an undirected graph, it is connected; for a directed graph, it contains a directed spanning tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Let t k s,i and t k f,i denote, respectively, the kth starting time and the kth ending time of topology i in M . Furthermore, suppose that 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">&lt; Δ 1,i = inf k {t k f,i -t k s,i } ≤ sup k {t k f,i -t k s,i } = Δ 2,i &lt; +∞, i.e., the dwell time of topology i is in the interval [Δ 1,i , Δ 2,i ].</formula></div>

One component evolves along the consensus manifold s(t), and the other evolves transversally to the consensus manifold s(t). Due to the fact that e ∈ R N , we denote its spanned subspace by A. On the other hand, each subspace of R N has only one orthogonal complementary subspace, so the orthogonal subspace of A uniquely exists. Suppose that this orthogonal complementary space A ⊥ is the column space of matrix V ∈ R N ×(N -1) that satisfies V T e = 0 and V T V = I N -1 , where V = (V 1 , V 2 , . . . , V N -1 ) consists of an array of N -1 basis vectors in R N . Obviously, R N = A ⊕ A ⊥ . Similarly, we also can expand this decomposition into R nN , i.e., R nN = B ⊕ B ⊥ , where B is the subspace spanned by e ⊗ I n and B ⊥ represents the orthogonal complement space spanned by V ⊗ I n .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>The problem of second-order consensus of multiagent systems with nonlinear dynamics, especially with random switching directed topologies, is very difficult. There are still few works involve in the second-order nonlinear consensus of multiagent systems with arbitrarily fast switching topologies. The traditional Lyapunov stability theory may fail to analyze the stability of such kinds of fast switching nonlinear systems. By using local linearization technique, generalized matrix measure, contraction analysis, and cycle analysis methods, the secondorder locally dynamical consensus is investigated. From our theoretical results and simulations, it is found that, under sufficiently large coupling strengths, the arbitrarily fast switching can be effectively tolerated. It is worth mentioning that the global consensus of second-order agents with nonlinear dynamics over random networks by time-delay couplings is still an open problem. Further work also includes the boundedness of the agents' state of the whole coupling network.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
