<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Wireless sensor networks (WSN) play important roles in the Internet of Things (IoT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for collecting large-scale physical data that can be further utilized in various fields such as environment monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, intelligent transportation system <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and industrial control <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In WSN, a great number of sensor nodes with limited energy are self-organized in a vast region, thus the data collection in large-scale network meets the challenges of scalability and energy efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Dynamic clustering provides a promising solution for data collection in large-scale WSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Sensor nodes are grouped Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. A sample of dynamic clustering into clusters which have a leader called cluster head (CH) and a number of cluster members (CM). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the data are firstly collected by each CH from its cluster, and then forward to the sink through multi-hops routing. Moreover, the cluster-based topology is reorganized periodically in order to balance the heavy traffic load of CHs.</p><p>Due to the advantages of scalability and energy efficiency, dynamic clustering has attracted considerable attentions from different research communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and has been implemented in various applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. However, most previous works deal with the dynamic clustering without indepth consideration on the impact of inter-cluster routing. We argue that there are tight relations between clustering and routing that may influence the performance of data collection in large-scale WSN:</p><p>1. Energy Efficiency of inter-cluster communication: The inter-cluster communication is built among CHs, therefore, the efficiency of inter-cluster communication depends on not only the node placement, but also the CHs selection. Take an example shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, for the unreasonable CHs selection, the edges among CHs in round 1 is much longer than that in round 2.</p><p>2. Network Connectivity with limited transmission range: Most dynamic clustering protocols assume that the nodes have enough transmission power to keep the network connected <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. For example, in LEACH <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, it is assumed that every node should have enough power to communicate with sink directly. In HEED <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> which has considered multi-hops intercluster communication, the inter-cluster transmission range R t is assumed to be R t &gt; 6R c , where R c is the transmission range for intra-cluster communication. These assumption are hard to be satisfied in large-scale WSN. The node has maximum transmission range R max which is bounded by its hardware capability. If the network exists any edge that is longer than R max , the network will be disconnected.</p><p>Motivated by these observations, we propose a joint clustering and routing protocol (JCR) which adopts backoff timer <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and gradient routing <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> to generate connected and efficient network topology for data collection in large-scale WSN. Specifically, the major contributions are summarized as follows.</p><p>1. Detailed analysis on the relations between clustering and routing are provided based on several typical dynamic clustering algorithms. The results show that, if the clustering and routing decisions are made separately, the clustering range R c affects both the connectivity and energy efficiency of the network. In this case, the energy efficiency can hardly be achieved with the constraint of network connectivity.</p><p>2. The JCR protocol is proposed to build the framework of joint clustering and routing design. Taking advantages of the traffic pattern in data collection scenario, the JCR protocol establishes the gradient field to present the direction through which the sink can be reached. Then the gradient can be exchanged among one-hop neighbors for making the decisions of cluster head selection and routing discovery. With the help of gradient field, JCR ensures the network connectivity with any value of R c . Therefore, in JCR, the R c can be freely adjusted to achieve energy efficiency.</p><p>3. The relations between clustering and routing in JCR are further exploited by theoretical and numerical analysis. The results show that the multi-hop routing in JCR may lead to unbalanced cluster head selection. Then the solution is provided to optimize the network lifetime by considering the gradient of neighbor nodes in the setting of backoff timer.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a brief survey of related works. Section III provides the network model and evaluates the clustering and routing problem addressed in this work. The details of the JCR protocol are provided in Section IV. Then we evaluate the network topology generated by JCR in Section V, and the energy efficiency of JCR is further analyzed in Section VI. Finally, Section VII concludes this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RELATED WORKS</head><p>Dynamic Clustering is firstly proposed in LEACH <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The basic idea is the periodic re-clustering with a randomized CHs rotation such that energy consumption of CHs can be balanced all over the network. Due to the advantages of scalability and energy efficiency, dynamic clustering has considered to be a promising solution for large-scale data collection in WSNs, and it has attracted considerable attentions from various research communities.</p><p>Since the network topology is built based on the set of CHs, the CHs selection is one of the fundamental problems in dynamic clustering. HEED <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> proposes an iterationbased algorithm which considers both residual energy and communication cost in CHs selection. The algorithm improves the CHs distribution in the network and hence has better efficiency than LEACH. Observing that HEED suffers from considerable overhead in the iteration, BSC <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> uses the random backoff timer to control the process of CHs selection. The node with smaller backoff time has greater probability to be CH. BSC can generate well-distributed CHs while the overhead in CHs selection is greatly reduced. LEACH-SWDN <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> sets up a sliding window to ensure that the number of cluster heads is maintained in an optimum range. It improves the energy efficiency after some nodes runs out of energy. Different from the distributed algorithms given above, the research work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> uses harmony search algorithm (HSA) to select the CHs with centralized optimization. It is expected to minimize the intra-cluster communication cost and optimize the energy distribution of the network.</p><p>Cluster formation is another important issue in dynamic clustering. A reasonable cluster formation algorithm can balance the traffic load in different clusters, and eventually prolong the network lifetime. EECS <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> considers the difference of the distance between CHs and the sink, and then proposes a novel cost function for CMs to select proper CHs based on their locations. The unbalanced energy consumption of intercluster communication is balanced by intra-cluster communication in EECS, and the network lifetime is significantly improved. A similar cluster formation algorithm is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, where the cluster size is balanced by two threshold: the distance of intra-cluster communication, and the number of cluster members. Different to the design of cluster formation algorithms, many research works have provided mathematical analysis on how to determine the clustering range in different scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. EC <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> considers the multi-hop data collection scenario, and formulates an optimization problem that determines suitable clustering ranges depending on the hop distance to the sink. The research work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> provides a mathematical framework to determine the optimal number of clusters by minimizing the energy consumption in both singlehop and multi-hops scenarios.</p><p>Almost all the aforementioned works deal with the dynamic clustering without in-depth consideration on the impact of inter-cluster routing. Our work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> has a preliminary study on the relations between clustering and routing, and propose a solution to keep the network connectivity in multi-hop data collection. However, it does not consider the impact of intercluster routing on the balance of energy consumption, and hence has poor performance in network lifetime.</p><p>Compared with related works, this paper distinguishes them in two aspects: 1) We emphasize the relations between clustering and routing in the large-scale data collection. The JCR protocol is designed to select the CHs with joint considerations on the inter-cluster routing efficiency. On the other hand, we also analyze how does the multi-hop routing lead to the unbalanced CHs selection, and provide the guideline to balance the energy consumption. 2) We consider the limitation of transmission range in the design of JCR. Most related works, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, assume that all sensor nodes have enough transmission power to keep the network connected. However, the limitation of transmission range becomes non-trivial that may impact both the connectivity and energy efficiency in large-scale WSN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PRELIMINARIES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Network Model</head><p>Considering a set of nodes and a sink deployed in a sensing area, we assume that the sensor network has the following properties:</p><p>1) The mission of the sensor network is to collect sensing data from sensor nodes to the sink, such that the destination of every sensing data is the sink.</p><p>2) The network is organized into clusters. The cluster member (CM) sends sensing data to its cluster head (CH) directly with the clustering range R c , and the CH forwards packets to the sink via multi-hop relays with the inter-cluster transmission range R t . The connectivity problem discussed in this paper focuses on the connectivity among CHs.</p><p>3) Every node has a maximum transmission range denoted as R max . This motivates the requirement of keeping network connectivity with the limitation of R max .</p><p>4) The critical transmitting range (CTR) is less than R max . The CTR is defined as the length of the longest edge of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> built on the nodes. If this assumption is not satisfied, the network will be doomed to be disconnected even if every node is selected as CH and uses its maximum radio power for data transmission. This assumption can be satisfied by reasonable node deployment <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>It is worthy to note that there are no assumptions on:</p><p>• Physical location-awareness;</p><p>• Distance estimation among nodes;</p><p>• Specific node placement;</p><p>The energy consumption follows the popular model given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. To transmit an l-bit message within distance d, the radio expends:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E T x (l, d) = l • E elec + l • ϵ f s • d 2<label>(1)</label></formula><p>and to receive this message, the radio expends:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">E Rx (l) = l • E elec (2)</formula><p>The CH executes data aggregation after collecting data from its CMs. The size of aggregated data is formulated as <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">l CH = l(β • n CM + c) (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where n CM denotes the number of CMs. c corresponds to the overhead of aggregation, while β is the compression ratio.</p><p>In most related works on dynamic clustering, the aggregation model is set as β = 0, c = 1. Thus we use it as the default setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Problem Statement</head><p>As we introduced in Section I, most related works have not considered multi-hop routing issues in CHs selection which may lead to the disconnection and inefficiency of the intercluster topology. To verify these problems, we use some simulations to study how does the cluster range assignment impact the network topology and energy efficiency in LEACH <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and BSC <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>There are 400 nodes randomly deployed in an area of 200 * 200m 2 , and the sink locates at coordinate [0, 0]. The setting of Since both LEACH and BSC do not include multi-hop routing protocol, a greedy routing algorithm is adopted in LEACH and BSC. In the greedy routing algorithm, every node is assumed to know its distance to the sink. The CH i selects the closest CH which is closer to the sink than itself as its relay. The algorithm can be formulated as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">r(i) = min{d(i, j)|d(i, 0) &gt; d(j, 0), j ∈ H} (4)</formula><p>where d(i, j) is the distance between node i and j, and d(i, 0) is the distance between node i and the sink. H denotes the set of CHs. At first, we evaluate how does the cluster range assignment impact the inter-cluster topology. The length of edges among CHs (LEH for short) is used as the metric to measure the intercluster topology. Each simulation runs 50 times with different node deployments. At each deployment, the protocols run 20 rounds for selecting different sets of CHs. The results are given in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. When R c grows from 20m to 70m, in BSC, the average LEH grows from 24.92 to 75.96 and the maximum LEH grows from 53.87 to 138.31. While in LEACH, the average LEH grows from 19.35 to 59.34, and the maximum LEH grows from 91.68 to 211.05.</p><p>Then we study the impact of R c on network lifetime. Each simulation runs 50 times with different node deployments. At each deployment, the network runs until the first node exhausts out its energy. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. In LEACH, the network lifetime grows from 96 rounds when R c = 20m and achieves maximum at 569 rounds when R c = 50m. Then the network lifetime slightly drops to 539 rounds at R c = 70m. On the other hand, in BSC, the network lifetime monotonically increases from 65 rounds to 584 rounds when R c grows from 20m to 70m.</p><p>There are two important results we can derive from the simulation results:</p><p>1) The average and maximum values of LEH have great difference. It demonstrates that the inter-cluster topology is variable due to the randomness of CHs selection. The variance of LEH in BSC is smaller than that in LEACH which proves the CHs selection of BSC is more reasonable than that of LEACH. Nevertheless, in BSC, the maximum LEH is still over 150% compared with the average LEH.</p><p>2) Both LEH and network lifetime have tight relations with the clustering range R c . For the network connectivity, R c should be small enough to ensure the maximum LEH is smaller than R max . However, the maximum network lifetime can hardly be achieved when R c is not large enough.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, few works have considered the routing issues in the CHs selection, which leads to the variance of LEH shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. It is harmful to the connectivity and energy efficiency of the network. In this paper, our goal is to design a joint clustering and routing (JCR) protocol which can generate connected and efficient inter-cluster topology. Specifically, the design goals are given as follows:</p><p>1) The clustering and routing are hybrid, i.e. after executing the JCR, each node is either a CH or a CM, and it has selected a node as its next-hop node.</p><p>2) The LEH should be well-controlled to ensure both the energy efficiency and network connectivity with the constraint of maximum transmission range R max .</p><p>3) The algorithm should be completely distributed with low overhead. the distance between node i and j d(i)</p><p>the distance from node i to the sink ∆d(i)</p><p>the shortest distance from the node i (g</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">(i) = k) to the edge of R(k -1)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. JCR PROTOCOL DESCRIPTION</head><p>The JCR protocol is described in a typical dynamic clustering scenario <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> where the network operation is divided into rounds. Each round is composed of set-up phase and data transmission phase. In the set-up phase, every node begins with the status of candidate (CA) and then chooses to be a cluster member (CM) or a cluster head (CH). In the data transmission phase, each CH periodically collects the sensing data in its cluster, and then forwards the aggregated result to the sink by inter-cluster communication. After that, each node retires to CA status, and a new round begins.</p><p>The goal of JCR is to select the set of CHs that not only organizes well-balanced clusters, but also builds up the connected and efficient backbone for inter-cluster routing. The basic idea of gradient routing <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> is adopted in JCR to provide a simple and efficient solution for distributed routing among CHs. In the gradient field establishment algorithm, every node obtains its gradient to establish the gradient field that presents the direction through which the sink can be reached. Then the gradient information is exchanged distributively among the nodes for making the decision of cluster head selection and routing discovery.</p><p>In order to control the topology, each node has two transmission ranges: the clustering range R c and the inter-cluster transmission range R t . How to determine the value of R c and R t will be discussed in Section V.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Gradient Field Establishment</head><p>To realize the joint design of clustering and routing, some information should be obtained at the beginning of network operation. To clarify the description, we provide several definitions as follows: Definition 1. (Gradient) Given a transmission range R t , the gradient of node i, which is denoted as g(i), is the minimum hop count by forwarding a packet from node i to the sink with R t . </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">R(k) = {i : g(i) = k, i ∈ S} (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">)</formula><p>where S is the set of all sensor nodes. Definition 3. (Distance) Given node i with gradient k, the distance from the node i to the sink is denoted as d(i). The shortest distance from the node i to the edge of R(k -1) can be formulated as ∆d(i),</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">∆d(i) = d(i) -(k -1)R t (6)</formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref> depicts an example of neighbor nodes. Based on the definitions of the gradient, the neighbor nodes can be classified into forward nodes, equal nodes and backward nodes according to their gradient. The definitions are given as follows.</p><p>Definition 4. (Forward node) Given node i with gradient k, the node which locates within the range R t of the node i and has gradient k -1, is the forward node of node i. The set of forward nodes of node i is denoted by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">F(i) = {j : d(i, j) &lt; R t ∩ g(j) = k -1}<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Similarly, we have the definition of backward node and equal node, Definition 5. (Backward node) Given node i with gradient k, the node which locates within the range R t of the node i and has gradient k + 1, is the backward node of node i. The set of backward nodes of node i is denoted by, </p><formula xml:id="formula_10">B(i) = {j : d(i, j) &lt; R t ∩ g(j) = k + 1}<label>(8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">Q(i) = {j : d(i, j) &lt; R t ∩ g(j) = k} (9)</formula><p>Based on the definition of equal node, we define equal clustering nodes which will be used in the analysis in Section VI. </p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Q c (i) = {j : d(i, j) &lt; R c ∩ g(j) = k} (10)</formula><p>In JCR, the goal of gradient field establishment algorithm is to obtain the gradient g, the number of forward nodes N f and backward nodes N b for every node. These information will be used in the CHs selection algorithm.</p><p>The initial value of g, N f and N b is set as 0. According to the definitions, the gradient field can be established by flooding a gradient field establishment (GFE) packet generated by the sink. The process of gradient field establishment is divided into frames: At frame 0, the sink generates the GFE packet message with its gradient g = 0, and then broadcast it in the range R t . The node received this GFE packet reads the g F E and sets its gradient g = g F E + 1, i.e. g(i) = 0 + 1. Then it broadcasts the GFE packet with its gradient g = 1 in R t at frame 1. The nodes with the same g should broadcast GFE packets in the same frame, hence the length of the frame should be long enough to ensure that the nodes have enough time to broadcast their GFE packets. The broadcasting process repeats until all nodes have received GFE packet and set their own gradient.</p><p>A node may receive more than one GFE packets. When it receives the GFE packet at the f irst time, it sets its gradient g = g F E + 1 and set its N f = 1. After that, at each time it receives a GFE packet, it compares g F E with its own g. If g F E = g -1, a forward node is found, and the N f should plus 1. Similarly, if g F E = g + 1, a backward node is found, and the N b should plus 1.</p><p>If a node broadcasts GFE packet in frame k and does not receive any GFE packet in the frame k + 1, the node will transmit a report (RPT) packet back to the sink. By receiving the RPT packets, the sink can obtain the maximum gradient G in the network. The value of G depends on the node deployment and R t . At the end of gradient field establishment, the sink floods another GFE packet with maximum gradient G over the network, such that every node can obtain G.</p><p>The packet collision during the gradient field establishment may lead to the miscount of N f and N b . The CSMA is used to reduce packet collision in the gradient field establishment. Moreover, in JCR, each packet has to carry the gradient of its transmitter. The node can use them to upgrade its N f and N b during data transmission.</p><p>It is worthy to note that, the gradient field establishment operates only once at the beginning of the network operation, thus it does not impact the complexity of JCR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Cluster Head Selection</head><p>The cluster head selection algorithm is driven by the backoff scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The node decides whether to be CH or CM according to its backoff timer T b and the advertisement (ADV) packets received before T b terminates.</p><p>At the beginning, the CA sets up a backoff timer T b according to its gradient g, the number of its neighbor nodes N f ,N b , and its residual energy e,</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">T b = { [(G -g) + α( E-e E ) + (1 -α)( NF -N f NF )] × τ g &gt; 1 [(G -1) + α( E-e E ) + (1 -α) N b NB ] × τ g = 1 (11)</formula><p>where G is the maximum gradient in the network and E is the initial energy of the node. N F is the maximum number of forward nodes, and N B is the maximum number of backward nodes. Both N F and N B can be approximated by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">N F = N B = ρ • πR 2 t 2 (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>where ρ is the node density of the network. According to Eqn.11, the process of CHs selection breaks into G frames whose length is τ . The set of CHs in Ring k (R(k)) are selected in the (G -k)th frame. The first set of CHs are selected from R(k), and then go through the gradient field until reach the sink.</p><p>For the nodes in the same Ring, the node which has more forward nodes or more residual energy has smaller backoff time T b . The α which is set in range [0, 1] is the parameter to adjust the weight between the number of forward nodes N f and the residual energy E r . The impact of α on the network performance will be studied in Section VI-C.</p><p>For the nodes with g = 1, all their forward node is the sink, thus the factor of N f can not be used to adjust T b in R <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Therefore, for the node in R( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>), their T b depends on the number of their backward nodes N b .</p><p>After setting T b , the CA listens to the channel for incoming packets. There are two kinds of ADV packets used for CHs selection: the ADV packet for clustering (AC), and the ADV packet for routing (AR). When the CA is determined to be CH, it broadcasts AC packet in R c and AR packet in R t . Both AC and AR carry the following information of the transmitter CH: ID, gradient (g), residual energy (E r ), and NEXT flag which denotes if the transmitter CH has found its next hop relay. Based on received packets, every node updates the following data lists:</p><p>• JOIN list: records other CHs with clustering range R c ;</p><p>• SERV list: records the requests for relay from CHs. When the CA receives AC packet, it records the information of the transmitter CH to the JOIN list. The JOIN list will be used for the node to select its CH when it is determined to be CM. When the CA receives AR packet with g AR &gt; g, it will check the NEXT flag in the AR packet. If NEXT=0, which means that the transmitter CH has not found a forward CH, the CA will record the transmitter information to the SERV list. If NEXT=1 and the transmitter information has been recorded in the SERV list, the CA will delete the transmitter from the SERV list. The setting of T b (Eqn.11) ensures that the CA can not receive any AR packet with g AR &lt; g.</p><p>When the backoff timer T b terminates, the node checks the JOIN and SERV lists. The CA will be selected as CH if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:</p><p>• The JOIN list is empty. It means that the node has the smallest backoff time compared with its neighbor nodes (i.e. more forward nodes or more residual energy).</p><p>• The SERV list is not empty. It means that the node is required to be a relay for another CH. Otherwise, if the JOIN list is not empty and the SERV list is empty, the CA sets its status as CM. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Routing Discovery</head><p>The goal of routing discovery algorithm is to find a path to the sink for every node. For simplicity, in this section, we only describe how does every node select its next-hop node. We will prove that this algorithm ensures the network connectivity in Section V.</p><p>For the CM, the next-hop node is its CH. The CM with g(i) should continue to receive AC packets until the end of G -g(i) + 1th frame. Then it selects the CH which has the highest residual energy in the JOIN list as its own CH.</p><p>For the CH with g = 1, its next-hop node is destined to be the sink. For other CHs, the relays are selected based on the following algorithm: According to Eqn.11, the CH i can not find its relay in the (G -g(i))th frame, hence the first AR packet is broadcasted with NEXT=0. Its forward nodes will receive the AR packet and record it to the SERV list. According to the CHs selection algorithm, the forward node j with the smallest T b becomes CH when its timer terminates. Then it broadcasts AR packet in R t . In this case, the CH i receives the AR packet with g AR &lt; g(i). Thus, the CH i selects CH j as its relay and broadcasts the second AR packet with NEXT=1 to announce that it finds a relay.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. NETWORK TOPOLOGY ANALYSIS</head><p>The JCR protocol organizes the network into clusters whose size is determined by the clustering range R c , and the CH uses the transmission range R t to forward its data. According to the results obtained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, to minimize the energy consumption, every CH should use its maximum transmission range for inter-cluster communication. With joint consideration of </p><formula xml:id="formula_16">R c ≤ R t = R max (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>Assume that the Eqn.13 holds, the network topology generated by JCR has the following properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 1. Each node has at least one forward node.</head><p>Proof: In the gradient field establishment, the GFE packet is flooding over the network with range R t . Since the CTR is less than R t (Assumption 4 in Section III), every node can receive the GFE packet. The gradient of the node is set as the g F E + 1 when it receives GFE packet at the first time, hence the node has at least one forward node which is the transmitter of its first received GFE packet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 2. At the end of the set-up phase, each node is either a cluster head or a cluster member.</head><p>Proof: A similar theorem has been proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Therefore, the proof is omitted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 3. At the end of the set-up phase, each CH has selected a forward CH or the sink as its next-hop node.</head><p>Proof: For the CH with g = 1, its next-hop node is the sink. For the CH with g &gt; 1, it firstly broadcasts AR packet with NEXT=0 in R t . According to Lemma 1 and Eqn.11, there is at least one forward CA that can receive the AR packet. The CA records transmitter information to the SERV list. Since the SERV list is not empty, the CA with the lowest T b will become CH and serve as the relay for the transmitter CH.</p><p>Theorem 1. In JCR, a CH with gradient k transmits its data to the sink in k hops.</p><p>Proof: According to Lemma 3 and the definition of forward node (Definition 4), the data from CH with g = k can be transmitted to the CH with g = k -h in h hops. The gradient of the sink is 0, thus the CH with g = k can transmit its data to the sink in k hops.</p><p>Theorem 2. In JCR, a CM with gradient k transmits its data to the sink in k to k + 2 hops. Proof: In JCR, the CM selects its CH which has the highest residual energy within range R c . Since R c is constrained by R c ≤ R t = R max (Eqn.13), the gradient of its CH can be k -1, k or k + 1. Combing with Theorem 1, the CM with g = k can transmit its data to the sink in k to k + 2 hops. Theorem 3. The JCR protocol generates a connected network topology.</p><p>Proof: According to Lemma 2, each node is either a CH or a CM by running JCR protocol. According to Theorem 1 and 2, every node can transmit its data to the sink with limited hops. Therefore, the network is connected.</p><p>Based on the analytical results given above, the JCR protocol can generate connected and efficient inter-cluster topology.</p><p>Then we use simulations to analyze the network topology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Connectivity</head><p>The performance of JCR are compared with backoff strategy clustering (BSC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> which use similar strategy to select CHs. BSC uses the greedy routing, which has been stated in Section III-B, to generate inter-cluster topology. In JCR, R max and R t are both set to be 70m, while the BSC does not have limitation on the transmission range.</p><p>There are 400 nodes randomly deployed in an area of 200 * 200m 2 , and the sink locates at [0, 0]. Both BSC and JCR are running in 50 different deployment which runs 20 rounds to select different set of CHs. The cluster-based topology is reorganized at the beginning of every round. The clustering range R c is adjusted from 20m to 70m.</p><p>At first, we compare the length of edges among CHs (LEH) to evaluate the inter-cluster topology in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. In BSC, when R c is set from 20m to 70m, the average LEH grows from 25m to 82.9m and the maximum LEH grows from 46m to 127.7m. The LEH of BSC increases almost linearly with the growth of R c . When R c is larger than 30m, the maximum LEH of BSC grows larger than R max , which leads to the disconnection of the network. On the other hand, in JCR, the maximum LEH is tightly bounded by R t = 70m, and the average LEH ranges from 56m to 59m.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows the ratio of disconnection in the network. The ratio of disconnection is calculated by the percentage of rounds in which the network topology exists any edge that is longer than R max . In BSC, the ratio of disconnection is 26% when R c = 40m, and it grows sharply to 82% when R c = 50m. When R c grows larger than 60m, the network is doomed to be disconnected at every round. Therefore, in BSC, the R c has to be smaller than 40m in order to keep the network connectivity. However, the energy efficiency can hardly be achieved in this case <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. On the other hand, the topology generated by JCR is ensured to be connected with any value of R c . The reason that JCR provides connected topology can be found in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">7</ref>. When R c grows from 20m to 70m, the number of CHs in JCR drops from 88 to 16, while the number of CHs in BSC drops from 59 to 8. JCR protocol generates more CHs than BSC to guarantee the connectivity among CHs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Efficiency of the Topology</head><p>The hop count from the node to the sink is used as the metric to evaluate the efficiency of network topology generated by JCR. To clarify the relations between the hop count and the gradient, the hop count is recorded separately with different g. R c is set to be 70m. The results are given in Table <ref type="table">III</ref>.</p><p>For CHs, the hop count is the same as the gradient g, which proves the results derived in Theorem 1. It is because, the CHs selection algorithm ensures that the relay of a CH has to be its forward node. Therefore, the transmission path from CHs to the sink is ensured to be forward. For CMs, the average hop count is larger than g, the results depend on the CH that the CM selected. Nevertheless, the hop count of CM is tightly bounded by k + 2, which has been proved in Theorem 2.</p><p>Then we compare the average hop count of CHs between BSC and JCR. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref>, when R c grows from 20m to 70m, the average hop count of CHs in BSC drops from 8.8 to 2.9. In BSC, the hop count is related to the number of CHs. In contrast, in JCR, R c has little impacts on the average hop count of CHs. When R c ranges from 20m to 70m, the average hop count of CHs grows from 2.64 to 2.76. A larger R c generates larger area of clusters, thus the CM with g = k have higher probability to select the CH with g = k or g = k+ 1. It leads to the slight growth of hop count when R c increases. Nevertheless, the hop count in JCR is still smaller than that of BSC when R c = R max . It proves that the transmission path generated by JCR is more efficient than BSC, and the advantage is greater when R c is smaller.</p><p>To summarize, the analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the JCR protocol generates connected and efficient inter-cluster topology. It is worthy to note that the gradient field is built by flooding GFE packet with R max , thus the value of g is equal to the minimum hop count from the node to the sink. Therefore, the JCR can provide optimal transmission path for CHs, and sub-optimal path for CMs. Moreover, the analysis results show that the JCR protocol decouples the relations between R c and the inter-cluster topology. Thus the research works of cluster range assignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> can be used in JCR with maximum transmission range constraint.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. ENERGY CONSUMPTION ANALYSIS</head><p>The CHs selection algorithm of JCR ensures that the CH selects one of its forward nodes as its relay. As we discussed in Section V, this scheme ensures the connectivity and the efficiency of inter-cluster topology. In this section, we will provide analytical and numerical results to show that this scheme may lead to the imbalance of energy consumption among CHs, and the number of neighbor nodes plays an important role in this problem. Furthermore, we also prove that the energy imbalance problem can be solved by tuning the factor of α in the backoff timer T b .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Probability to be Cluster Heads</head><p>According to the CHs selection algorithm described in Section IV-B, in JCR, the node will be selected as CH in two conditions when its backoff timer T b terminates:</p><p>1) SERV list is not empty. It means that there is at least one of its backward nodes has been selected as CH, and the node will be selected as CH and serve as its relay. In this case, The probability in this condition can be written as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">p 1 (i) = 1 - ∏ j [1 -p b (i, j)], j ∈ B(i) (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>where p b (i, j) is the probability that the node j is selected as CH and chooses the node i as its relay. In JCR, the relay of node j is one of its forward nodes which has the smallest T b . Given p f (i, j) as the probability that the node i has the smallest T b in F(j), p b (i, j) can be formulated as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">p b (i, j) = P CH (j) • p f (i, j)<label>(15)</label></formula><p>P CH (j) is the probability that node j is selected as CH.</p><p>2) Both SERV list and JOIN list is empty. It means that, if the first condition given above is not satisfied, the node which has the smallest T b in N e will be the CH. Therefore, the probability in this condition is, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> where p e (i, m) denotes the probability that the node i has the smallest T b in Q c (i) (Definition 7). If the node has no backward node (e.g. the nodes with g = G), the probability will be determined by the T b competition in Q c (i). The probability can be written as, Combining Eqn.14, 16 and 17, the probability that the node i is selected as CH can be formulated as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">p 2 (i) = p e (i, m) • ∏ j [1 -p b (i, j)], m ∈ Q c (i), j ∈ B(i)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">p 2 (i) = p e (i, m), N b (i) = 0, m ∈ Q c (i)<label>(17)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">P CH (i) =    1 -(1 -p e (i, m)) • ∏ j [1 -p b (i, j)] N b (i) ̸ = 0 p e (i, m) N b (i) = 0<label>(18)</label></formula><p>Then we use simulations to prove the correctness of Eqn.18. In the simulations, there are 400 nodes randomly deployed in an area of 200 * 200m 2 , and the sink locates at [0, 0]. To clarify the analysis, all the nodes set its R c = R t = 70m, and they use a simple backoff timer,</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">T b = (G -g) + rand (<label>19</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_25">)</formula><p>where rand is a random variable whose value is selected from [0, 1] with uniform distribution. In this case, p f (i, j) can be simplified as 1 N f (j) . At first, every node uses Eqn.18 to estimate its probability of being CH. The algorithm is given as follows: The calculation starts from the nodes with g = G. Since all the nodes with g = G have no backward node and R c = R t , all their CH probability can be estimated by P CH (i) = p e (i, m) = 1 Ne(i) . After that, the CH probability of the nodes with g = G-1 can be calculated by Eqn.18. The calculation repeats until g = 1.</p><p>On the other hand, the network runs 1000 rounds to obtain different set of CHs. We can obtain the probability of being CH by recording the times to be CH for every node. The results are given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref>. To make the results clear to be read, we only demonstrate the nodes whose ID ranges from 1 to 50. There are two important results we can derive from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9:</ref> 1) Eqn.18 can estimate the probability of being CH with acceptable error.</p><p>2) The probability of being CH is imbalanced when T b is set as Eqn.19, i.e. without the consideration of residual energy and neighbor nodes.</p><p>The results inspire us to look into Eqn.18 to exploit the factors that influence P CH (i). There are two parts in Eqn. 2) The number of neighbor nodes. P CH (i) grows with larger N b (i).</p><p>3) The CH probability of backward nodes, i.e. P CH (B(i)).</p><p>P CH (i) increases with the growth of P CH (B(i)).</p><p>Based on the analysis given above, in SectionVI-B, we study how does neighbor nodes leads to imbalanced CHs selection shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref>. Then we provide the guideline of setting the backoff timer to balance the energy consumption in SectionVI-C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Impact of Neighbor Nodes</head><p>At first, we study the relations between the node's location and its neighbor nodes. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>, given ∆d(i) and node density ρ, the number of forward nodes N f can be estimated by euclidean geometry,</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">N f (i) = ρ•(R 2 t •arccos ∆d(i) R t -∆d(i)• √ R 2 t -∆d(i) 2 ) (20)</formula><p>Similarly, the number of backward nodes N b is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">N b (i) =ρ • (R 2 t • arccos R t -∆d(i) R t -(R t -∆d(i)) • √ R 2 t -(R t -∆d(i)) 2 )<label>(21)</label></formula><p>and the number of equal nodes N e is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">N e (i) = ρ • πR 2 t -N b -N f (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_29">)</formula><p>Then we use simulations to study the relations between ∆d and neighbor nodes. To reduce the boundary effect, the network area is set as 500 * 100m 2 . There are 500 nodes randomly deployed in the area and the sink locates at [0, 50].</p><p>At first, we focus on the nodes located at R(3). The results Due to the boundary effect, the number of neighbor nodes in simulations are smaller than that calculated by Eqn.20-22. Nevertheless, Eqn.20-22 are sufficient to demonstrate the relations between ∆d and neighbor nodes. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>, N b increases with the growth of ∆d. On the other hand, N f reduces when ∆d grows. The variance of N e is relatively small, and its maximum value appears when the node locates at the middle of the Ring.</p><p>The variance of P CH and neighbor nodes shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref> and 10 motivate us to study their relations. Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref> shows P CH with respect to g and N b , and we have three important results:</p><p>1) With any value of g, P CH increases sharply when N b &gt; 35. The reason can be found in Eqn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>. When N b grows larger than 35, N f is monotonic increasing and N e is monotonic decreasing. All these factors lead to the growth of P CH according to Eqn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref>.</p><p>2) The variance of P CH is relatively small when N b &lt; 35. It is because when ∆d grows from 0 to R t /2, N e increases that reduces P CH . On the other hand, the decrease of N f and the increase of N b leads to the growth of P CH . These two opposite efforts make the variance of P CH small.</p><p>3) When N b &gt; 35, P CH increases with the reduction of g. The reason can be found in the p b (i, j) part in Eqn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref>. When ∆d &gt; R t /2, P CH (i) increases and N f decreases with the growth of N b . All these factors leads to the growth of p b (i, j) and so as the P CH (i). On the other hand, when ∆d &lt; R t /2, this effect can be neglect with small N b or large N f .</p><p>In multi-hop data collection, the nodes in R( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) have higher energy consumption due to the relay burden, i.e. the energy hole problem. This problem is more severe with imbalanced CHs selection described above. Fortunately, this problem can be solved by considering the number of neighbor nodes in the backoff timer T b . In the next section, we will study how does the backoff timer T b impact the energy consumption in JCR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Impact of Backoff Timer</head><p>According to the analysis given in Section VI-A and VI-B, the location and the backoff timer determines the node's probability to be CH. Since the node location is uncontrollable in this paper, the setting of the backoff timer is critical to balance the energy consumption. Let us revisit the backoff timer setting of JCR (Eqn.11) given Section IV-B,</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">T b = { [(G -g) + α( E-e E ) + (1 -α)( NF -N f N F )] × τ g &gt; 1 [(G -1) + α( E-e E ) + (1 -α) N b N B ] × τ g = 1</formula><p>The backoff timer of JCR considers both the residual energy E r and the number of neighbor nodes (N b or N f ). According to Eqn.11, in the same Ring, the nodes with higher residual energy and more forward nodes (or less backward node) have higher possibility to be CH. The parameter α is used to balance the impact of E r and N b (or N f ).</p><p>In order to study the efficiency of considering neighbor nodes in T b , simulations are executed to provide a closer view at R <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. There are 400 nodes randomly deployed in a network area of 200 × 200m 2 and the sink locates at [0, 0]. The maximum transmission range R max is set as 70m, and so as R t and R c . Fig. <ref type="figure">12</ref> shows the probability to be CH at R <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> with different N b and α. When α = 1, which means T b does not consider the impact of N b , the probability grows from 6.6% to 16.7% with the growth of N b . It is similar to the results given in Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref>.</p><p>On the contrary, when α = 0.8, the probability decreases from 36.6% to 6.8%. The results prove that the backoff timer given in Eqn.11 effectively adjust the node's probability to be CH with different neighbor nodes. When the α is smaller, the impact of neighbor nodes is higher, and so as the P CH of the nodes with smaller N b .</p><p>Then we study the network lifetime to evaluate the energy efficiency of JCR. The network lifetime is defined as the number of the round at which the first dead node appears in the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The initial energy of every node is 2J, and the node is dead when it spends all its energy. Fig. <ref type="figure">13</ref> shows the residual energy of the nodes when the first dead node appears. In α = 1, over 70% energy are left in the nodes with N b &lt; 5. The residual energy decreases with the growth of N b . For the nodes with N b &gt; 55, the residual energy is about 37%. The variance of residual energy is large due to the imbalanced CHs selection and traffic load.</p><p>On the other hand, the variance of residual energy is much more smaller when α &lt; 1. Specifically, when α = 0.8, the residual energy drops sharply to lower than 30%. The imbalance of energy consumption is effectively alleviated by considering the number of neighbors in the backoff timer. Moreover, the result also demonstrates that the value of α impacts the network performance.  In the rest of this section, we use simulations to study how does α impact the network lifetime with different values of clustering range R c (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">14</ref>), aggregation rate (Fig. <ref type="figure">15</ref>), network area (Fig. <ref type="figure">16</ref>) and network density (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">17</ref>).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">14</ref> shows the relations between network lifetime and α when the clustering range R c is set as 30m, 50m and 70m. It is worthy to note that, when α = 1, the T b does not consider the impact of N f . In R c = 70m, the network lifetime reaches maximum as 566 rounds when α = 0.8, and the network lifetime is 378 rounds when α = 1. The network lifetime is prolonged over 50% by considering neighbor nodes in T b . Moreover, the network lifetime reduces when R c decreases. The result is the same as that given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. It is because the growth of R c leads to the decreasing number of CHs and so as the number of inter-cluster packets.</p><p>Then we study the impact of aggregation rate β on the network lifetime. In this scenario, R c is set as 70m and the β is set as 0, 0.1 and 0.2. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">15</ref>, the network lifetime decreases with the growth of β because of the growth of packet size. To maximize the network lifetime, the α should be set as 0.8, 0.5 and 0.4 respectively when β = 0, 0.1, 0.2. The optimal value of α is smaller when β is larger. Fig. <ref type="figure">16</ref> shows the results when the network area grows from 100×100m 2 , 200×200m 2 to 300×300m 2 . The node density is fixed at 0.01node/m 2 . The R c is set as 70m and β = 0. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">16</ref>, the network lifetime is shorter in a larger area due to the growth of multi-hop relay burden. In 100 × 100m 2 network, the maximum lifetime is 893 rounds when α = 1, while the maximum lifetime is 315 rounds in 300 × 300m 2 network when α = 0.5. The reason is that the multi-hop relay burden is higher in a larger area. To balance the energy consumption, the α should be smaller such that the node with higher N b has lower probability to be CH.</p><p>At last, we study the network lifetime with different node density. In a fixed network area of 200 × 200m 2 , the number of nodes N is set as 200, 400 and 800 respectively. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">17</ref>, the network with higher node density has longer network lifetime. The growth of the node density increases the number of CMs and so as the burden for CH. However, according to Eqn.18, the growth of node density leads to the growth of neighbor nodes, and hence reduces the P CH for each node. Moreover, a higher node density is helpful to load balance. When N = 800, the maximum network lifetime is achieved at α = 0.8. The optimal α reduces to 0.7 and 0.5 when N = 400 and N = 200 respectively. It is because, the variance of neighbor nodes is larger in a sparse network which leads to more severe imbalance of CHs selection. Reducing α increases the impact of neighbor nodes in CHs selection, and it is helpful to balance the energy consumption.</p><p>To summarize, considering residual energy and neighbor nodes in the backoff timer T b is helpful to improve the performance of JCR. Moreover, the optimal value of α is smaller when the inter-cluster traffic load grows up.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Network Lifetime Comparison</head><p>To prove the energy efficiency of JCR, we compare the network lifetime of JCR with that of BSC. The first simulation is run in the network with 400 nodes randomly deployed in an area of 200 × 200m 2 . The inter-cluster transmission range R t in JCR is set as 70m, while the transmission range in BSC has no limitation. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">18</ref> shows the network lifetime when R c and β varies and the value of α is set to be optimal respectively. JCR performs better than BSC when R c &lt; 40m due to the efficient network topology. The advantage become small when R c grows larger than 40m. Because JCR generates more CHs to ensure network connectivity that leads to the growth of inter-cluster traffic load. On the other hand, when β = 0.1, which means the inter-cluster traffic load depends on not only the number of CHs but also the number of CMs, the advantage of JCR is larger than that in β = 0.</p><p>Then we compare the network lifetime when the side length of the network grows from 100m to 300m. The node density is fixed at 0.01node/m 2 . The R c is set as 70m and β = 0.1. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">19</ref>, JCR performs better in a small area due to the efficient network topology. The advantage is small when M ≥ 200m, since JCR has to generate more CHs than BSC to ensure network connectivity that leads to the growth of inter-cluster traffic load.</p><p>It is worthy to note that, the results of BSC given above are based on the assumption that there is no limitation on the maximum transmission range. For completeness, we also study the network lifetime of BSC with the limitation of R max = 70m. According to Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, the R c should be set as 35m to ensure the maximum LEH is smaller than 70m. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">19</ref>, the performance of BSC is greatly reduced due to the limitation of R max . The network lifetime of JCR is over 117.6% longer than that of BSC, and the improvement increases from 117.6% to 172.7% with the growth of the network area.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .Fig. 3 .</head><label>23</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we propose a joint clustering and routing (JCR) protocol to provide reliable and efficient data collection in large-scale WSN. The random backoff and gradient routing schemes are adopted in JCR to execute the cluster head selection and multi-hop routing simultaneously with low overhead. Theoretical analysis and simulation results prove that JCR can provide connected and efficient inter-cluster topology with limited transmission range. Moreover, the backoff timer in JCR can be carefully tuned to balance the energy consumption and prolong the network lifetime.</p></div>
