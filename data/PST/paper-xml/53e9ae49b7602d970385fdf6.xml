<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Vertex connectivity, matching number, chromatic number, crossing number, genus, and independence number are but a few examples of graph invariants. An important problem to be solved in understanding a graph invariant is "how it behaves" on graph products. Because of how the product relates to the two factors, it seems reasonable to think that the value of the invariant on the product of two graphs G and H will, in some consistent way, relate to its value-and perhaps that of other invariants-on G and H. In 1996 Nowakowski and Rall <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> explored this relationship for twelve independence, coloring and domination invariants on ten associative graph products whose edge structure depends on that of both factors.</p><p>For some invariants and products, this relationship is known and easy to verify. An example of this situation is that the chromatic number of the Cartesian product of two graphs is the maximum of their chromatic numbers. In some cases, for example the independence number of the direct product, there are proven bounds, but in general no exact formula is known in terms of the independence numbers of the two factor graphs. For still other invariants the invariant has a conjectured behavior, but the issue is far from being settled. This is the situation for the domination number on a Cartesian product. The following conjecture was made by V. G. Vizing in 1968, after being posed by him as a problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>: Conjecture 1.1 <ref type="bibr">(Vizing [44]</ref>). For every pair of finite graphs G and H, (G H) ≥ (G) (H).</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">)<label>1</label></formula><p>As usual, stands for the domination number, and G H stands for the Cartesian product of graphs G and H.</p><p>Vizing's conjecture is arguably the main open problem in the area of domination theory. In this paper we present a survey of what is known about attacks on Vizing's conjecture and give some new results. We say that a graph G satisfies Vizing's conjecture if inequality (1) holds for every graph H.</p><p>The most successful attack in proving that the conjecture holds in special cases has been the idea of partitioning a graph into subgraphs of a particular type, as initiated by <ref type="bibr">Barcalkin</ref> and German <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Their approach gives a large class of graphs, we call them BG-graphs, which satisfy Vizing's conjecture. Their fundamental contribution, its consequences, and independent rediscoveries are presented in Section 2.</p><p>The class of BG-graphs has been expanded in two different ways. The first class is the one of Type X graphs as introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>; the second was recently proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. These two classes are presented in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. The second approach implies, among others, that chordal graphs satisfy Vizing's conjecture, a result first proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>In 2000, Clark and Suen <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> made a breakthrough by proving, using what we call the double projection approach, that (G H) ≥ 1 2 (G) (H) for all graphs G and H. Aharoni and Szabó <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> applied the approach to settle the conjecture for chordal graphs. In this paper we use the double projection approach to prove that for a claw-free graph G and any graph H without isolated vertices, (G H) ≥ 1 2 (G)( (H)+1), where stands for the independence number. (Note that (G) ≥ (G) holds for any graph G.) Moreover, if H has large enough order, this bound can be improved. The double projection approach is treated in Section 5.</p><p>We follow with a section on possible minimal counterexamples to the conjecture. Among other properties we prove that a minimal counterexample G is edge-critical, that every vertex of G belongs to a minimum dominating set, and that the domination number decreases in any graph formed by identifying arbitrary vertices u and v of G.</p><p>Then, in Section 7, several additional approaches to the conjecture are briefly described, while Section 8 gives Vizing-type theorems for related domination invariants. For instance, a version of Vizing's conjecture is true for the fractional domination number. We conclude the paper with several stronger and weaker conjectures than Vizing's conjecture.</p><p>In the rest of this section definitions are given. Let G = (V(G), E(G)) be a finite, simple graph. For subsets of vertices, A and B, we say that B dominates A if A ⊆ N <ref type="bibr">[B]</ref>; that is, if each vertex of A is in B or is adjacent to some vertex of B. When A and B are disjoint and B dominates A, then we will say that B externally dominates A. The domination number of G is the smallest cardinality, denoted (G), of a set that dominates V(G). If D dominates V(G), we will also say that D dominates the graph G and that D is a dominating set of G. For a survey on domination, see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>Any dominating set of G must intersect every closed neighborhood in G. Thus, the domination number of G is at least as large as the cardinality of any set X ⊆ V(G) having the property that for distinct x 1 and x 2 in X, N[x 1 ]∩N[x 2 ] = ∅. Such a set X is called a 2-packing, and the maximum cardinality of a 2-packing in G is denoted (G) and is called the 2-packing number of G. The smallest cardinality of a dominating set that is also independent is denoted i(G), and the vertex independence number of G is the maximum cardinality, (G), of an independent set of vertices in G. For convenience of notation we will write |G| to denote the number of vertices in G, and g ∈ G to mean that g is a vertex of G.</p><p>If G is not a complete graph, then for any pair of vertices g 1 and g 2 that are not adjacent in G, it is clear that (G)-1 ≤ (G+g 1 g 2 ) ≤ (G). If G has the property that (G)-1 = (G+g 1 g 2 ) for every such pair of nonadjacent vertices, then G is edge-critical with respect to domination (or edge-critical for brevity). We will see in Observation 2.1 that to prove Vizing's conjecture, it suffices to show the inequality is true whenever one of the two graphs is edge-critical.</p><p>The Cartesian product G H of graphs G and H is the graph whose vertex set is V(G)×V(H). Two vertices (g 1 , h 1 ) and (g 2 , h 2 ) are adjacent in G H if either g 1 = g 2 and h 1 h 2 is an edge in H or h 1 = h 2 and g 1 g 2 is an edge in G. For a vertex g of G, the subgraph of G H induced by the set {(g, h)|h ∈ H} is called an H-fiber and is denoted by g H. Similarly, for h ∈ H, the G-fiber, G h , is the subgraph induced by {(g, h)|g ∈ G}. We will have occasion to use the fiber notation G h and g H to refer instead to the set of vertices in these subgraphs; the meaning will be clear from the context. It is clear that all G-fibers are isomorphic to G and all H-fibers are isomorphic to H.</p><p>We will have need of projection maps from the Cartesian product G H to one of the factors G or H or to a fiber. The projection to H is the map p H : V(G H) → V(H) defined by p H (g, h) = h. For a specified vertex x of G, the projection to the H-fiber, x H, is the function that maps a vertex (g, h) to (x, h). Projections to G or to a G-fiber have the obvious meaning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">DECOMPOSABLE GRAPHS</head><p>One of the first results that shows the truth of Vizing's conjecture for a class of graphs is due to Barcalkin and German <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Their theorem about the so-called decomposable graphs is still one of the nicest partial results on the conjecture.</p><p>Let G be a graph with domination number k. If the vertex set of G can be covered by k complete subgraphs (cliques, for short), then G is called a decomposable graph. <ref type="bibr">Barcalkin and</ref> German proved that every decomposable graph satisfies Vizing's conjecture. They also noticed that the class of graphs that satisfy Vizing's conjecture can always be extended by using the following basic fact. Observation 2.1. Let G be a graph that satisfies Vizing's conjecture, and let G be a spanning subgraph of G such that (G ) = (G). Then G also satisfies Vizing's conjecture.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Indeed, if H is any graph, then (G ) (H) = (G) (H) ≤ (G H) ≤ (G H).</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The last inequality holds since G H is a spanning subgraph of G H.</head><p>Hence the theorem of Barcalkin and German states:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Theorem 2.2 (Barcalkin and German [4]). If a graph G is a spanning subgraph of a decomposable graph G such that (G) = (G ), then for every graph H, (G H) ≥ (G) (H).</formula><p>Theorem 2.2 is not difficult to prove if one observes a nice feature of the partition of decomposable graphs related to the external domination of cliques.</p><p>Let G be a decomposable graph with (G) = k, and let C = {C 1 , ...,C k } be a partition of V(G) into cliques. Suppose that one wants to externally dominate a union of &lt;k cliques from C; that is, given</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">C i 1 , .. . ,C i ∈ C one looks for a (smallest) set of vertices in G-(C i 1 ∪•••∪C i ) that dominates C i 1 ∪•••∪C i .</formula><p>Select and fix such a set D, and let C j 1 , .. . ,C j t be the cliques from C that have a nonempty intersection with D. Then we claim that t m=1 (|C j m ∩D|-1) ≥ .</p><p>(2)</p><p>In words, the sum of the number of "additional" vertices (that is, the surplus to 1 of the number of vertices from D) in cliques C j m is at least the number of cliques that are externally dominated. Indeed, if the left-hand side of inequality (2) were less than , then the +t cliques from C would be dominated by fewer than +t vertices. Since the remaining cliques can be dominated by k -( +t) vertices (each clique by one of its vertices), this implies the contradiction (G)&lt;k.</p><p>Proof of Theorem 2.2. By Observation 2.1 we may assume that G is a decomposable graph. Consider the Cartesian product G H, where G is a decomposable graph with (G) = k. Let D be a minimum dominating set of G H. The main idea of the proof is that each vertex from D will get a label from 1 to k, and for each label i, the projection to H of the vertices from D that are labeled i, is a dominating set of H. This clearly implies |D| ≥ k (H), and G satisfies the conjecture.</p><p>Let C 1 , . . . ,C k be a partition of V(G) into cliques. For each h ∈ V(H) and i, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> where the corresponding partition of G H is shown, and the cell C h i is shaded.) The following simple labeling rule (SLR) is used: if a G-cell C h i contains a vertex from D, then one of the vertices from D∩C h i gets the label i. Hence in the projection, h will also get the label i. Note that we have not yet determined the remaining labels if there is more than one vertex in D∩C h i . Fix an arbitrary vertex h ∈ V(H). We need to prove that for an arbitrary i, 1≤ i ≤ k, there exists a vertex from D, labeled by i, that is projected to the neighborhood of h. There are two cases. First, if there exists a vertex of D in V(C i )×N[h], then by SLR, there will be a vertex in the neighborhood of h to which the label i is projected, and so this case is settled.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">1≤ i ≤ k, we call C h i = V(C i )×{h} a G-cell. (See Fig.</formula><p>The second case is that there is no vertex from D in V(C i )×N[h], and we call such C h i a missing G-cell for h. Let C h i 1 , . . . ,C h i be the missing G-cells for h. Note that, by definition, the missing G-cells for h are dominated entirely within the G-fiber, G h . Hence  there are vertices in D∩G h that dominate</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">C h i 1 ∪•••∪C h i . Let C h j 1 , . . . ,C h j t be the G-cells in G h that intersect D. Since G h is isomorphic to G, we infer by inequality (2) that t m=1 (|C h j m ∩D|-1) ≥ .</formula><p>Thus there are enough additional vertices in D∩G h (that have not already been labeled by SLR), so that for each missing G-cell C h i , the label i can be given to one of the vertices in C h j m ∩D, where |C h j m ∩D| ≥ 2. Hence in this case the label i will be projected to h. This concludes the proof of Theorem 2.2.</p><p>A graph G satisfying the hypothesis of Theorem 2.2 was said by <ref type="bibr">Barcalkin and</ref> German to belong to the A-class; we call such a graph a BG-graph. Several common graphs are BG-graphs, including trees, any graph with domination number 2, cycles, and any graph having a 2-packing of cardinality equal to its domination number.</p><p>The truth of the conjecture for a graph having a 2-packing of cardinality equal to its domination number was independently obtained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> while in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> it was done for cycles. Also, Vizing's conjecture was proved for graphs with a certain vertex-partition property by Faudree, Schelp and Shreve <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and by Chen, Piotrowski and Shreve <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. It was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> that the first class is a proper subclass of the BG-graphs while the second is the same as the class of BG-graphs.</p><p>On the other hand, any bipartite graph B with (B)&lt;|B| / 2, that is edge-critical, is not a BG-graph. An example of such a bipartite graph is B 2 of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, formed by removing the edges of 3 vertex-disjoint 4-cycles from K 6,6 . The nonbipartite graph B 1 is not edge-critical, but a short analysis shows it also is not a BG-graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">THE ONE-HALF ARGUMENT AND TYPE X GRAPHS</head><p>In 1995, Hartnell and Rall <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> found a method of partitioning V(G) that is somewhat different from that of Barcalkin and German. They termed the class of graphs having such a partition, Type X . Any decomposable graph is of Type X . The proof of the main theorem regarding these graphs uses the simple fact that a connected graph of order at least 2 has a domination number that is at most one-half its order. The proof technique is best illustrated by using a specific example, the graph G in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Note first that (G) = 3. We shall consider V(G) as being partitioned into three parts, two of which induce cliques and the other induces a star. Let C 1 = {r, s}, C 2 = {a, b, c} and S = {u, v, w}. Note that both the star S and the clique C 2 contain a vertex whose neighborhood is entirely contained in its own part, whereas both vertices of C 1 have a neighbor outside of C 1 .</p><p>Let H be any graph and consider any dominating set D of G H. We will show that |D| ≥ 3 (H); more precisely, we will find three disjoint sets in D each with cardinality at least (H). We start by designating a vertex x from each of the three parts of V(G), and constructing a so-called missing fiber list L x .</p><p>Suppose D∩ v H does not dominate v H. Let L v be the set of all the vertices h in H such that (v, h) is not dominated by D∩ v H. We call L v the missing fiber list for the H-fiber v H. In a similar manner make a missing fiber list L b for the H-fiber b H.</p><p>Fix a vertex, say r, of the clique C 1 , and project all the elements of D∩ s H onto r H. Let X represent the set of vertices in r H which were already in D, together with those that are images of this projection. The set of all vertices h in H such that (r, h) is not dominated by X is the missing fiber list, L r , for C 1 . Of course, some of these missing fiber lists may be empty. The key idea is to find replacements for the vertices on these lists in the u H-, w H-, a H-, and c H-fibers.</p><p>By the nature of S noted above, if h ∈ L v then at least one of (u, h), (w, h) is in D. Similarly, if h ∈ L b , then at least one of (a, h), (c, h) is in D. However, these vertices also dominate (s, h) or (r, h) (within the G h -fiber). In showing that D contains at least 3 (H) vertices we must be careful not to count any members of D twice. Now project the vertices in D∩ u H onto w H. Let F denote the subgraph of w H induced by the resulting set of vertices from D∩ w H together with the image of this projection of D∩ u H.</p><p>Consider any k ∈ L r . Assume first that (w, k) / ∈ F. This implies that k / ∈ L v and that both of (a, k) and (c, k) are in D to dominate (s, k) and (r, k). Thus, one of these can be counted for the missing fiber list in C 1 and the other for the missing fiber list L b , if necessary. Now assume that (w, k) is an isolated vertex in F and that both of (u, k) and (w, k) belong to D. If k ∈ L b , then the nature of C 2 noted above implies there are at least three members of D in the G k -fiber. In particular, at least one of (a, k) or (c, k) is in D. Hence, (u, k) can be counted for the missing fiber list L r and (w, k) for the missing fiber list</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L v if necessary (i.e. if k ∈ L v ).</formula><p>Next we assume that (w, k) is an isolated vertex in F and that only one of (u,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">k) or (w, k) is in D. Suppose that (u, k) ∈ D. Since D dominates (r, k) it follows that (c, k) ∈ D.</formula><p>In addition, since (w, k) must be dominated by D from within the G k -fiber, we may conclude that either (v, k) ∈ D or (a, k) ∈ D. In this case we have at least three vertices from D in G k . Hence we will be able to count one of these for missing fiber k in C 1 and still have two members of D in case k is in L v or in L b . The case when (w, k) ∈ D is handled in a similar manner.</p><p>Finally, we assume that (w, k) is a vertex in a component K of order two or more in F. Since the complement of a minimal dominating set is also a dominating set, K has two disjoint dominating sets A 1 and A 2 . The vertices in A 1 can be counted towards dominating v H and those in A 2 can be counted towards dominating r H.</p><p>This counting gives |D| ≥ 3 (H) = (G) (H). Thus G satisfies Vizing's conjecture.</p><p>In the proof of [25, Theorem 3.1] that the graphs of Type X satisfy Vizing's conjecture, a similar method of partitioning and the one-half argument were used as for G in the above example. Here is the formal definition of Type X graphs.</p><p>Consider a graph G with (G) = n = k +t +m+1 and such that V(G) can be partitioned into S∪SC ∪BC ∪C, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">S = S 1 ∪•••∪S k , BC = B 1 ∪•••∪B t , and C = C 1 ∪•••∪ C m . Each of SC, B 1 , ...,B t , C 1 , . . . ,C m induces a clique.</formula><p>Every vertex of SC (special clique) has at least one neighbor outside SC, whereas each of B 1 , ...,B t (the buffer cliques), say B i , has at least one vertex, say b i , which has no neighbors outside B i . Each S i ∈{S 1 , .. . ,S k } is "star-like" in that it contains a star centered at a vertex v i which is adjacent to each vertex in T i = S i -{v i }. The vertex v i has no neighbors besides those in T i . Although other pairs of vertices in T i may be adjacent (and hence S i does not necessarily induce a star), S i does not induce a clique nor can more edges be added in the subgraph induced by S i without lowering the domination number of G. Furthermore, there are no edges between vertices in S and vertices in C.</p><p>It should be noted that a graph of Type X need not have a clique having the properties of SC, and any of t, m or k is allowed to be 0. However, if such an SC is not in G, then (G) = n = k +t +m. Also, if SC is not present and BC is empty, but S as well as C are not empty, then the graph is disconnected. SC cannot be the only one of these which is nonempty, since by definition its vertices must have neighbors outside SC. Theorem 3.1 <ref type="bibr">(Hartnell and Rall [25]</ref>). Let G be a spanning subgraph of a graph G of Type X such that (G ) = (G). Then G satisfies Vizing's conjecture.</p><p>The same authors showed that any graph whose domination number is one more than its 2-packing number is of Type X , thus establishing the following corollary to Theorem 3.1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>). If G is a graph and (G) = (G)+1, then G satisfies Vizing's conjecture.</p></div>

Whereas the one-half argument essentially "shared" vertices from one copy of a graph between two copies, one can consider the situation where these vertices may be needed in three different copies. We do this with an example.</p><p>Consider the graph G in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. We observe that (G) = 5, and the 2-packing number of G is 3. Also, G is not of Type X . We show that G satisfies Vizing's conjecture. We first establish a lemma that will be needed in the argument.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Lemma 3.3. Let G be a connected graph of order n ≥ 2 and assume that V(G) = V 1 ∪V 2 ∪W where no vertex in V 1 is adjacent to any vertex in V 2 . For i= 1, 2 let i (G)</formula><p>denote the minimum cardinality of a set of vertices of G that dominates V i , and let (G) denote the domination number of G. Then,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">1 (G)+ 2 (G)+ (G) ≤ n.</formula><p>Proof. We prove the statement for trees. The lemma will follow in general since these three numbers 1 (G), 2 (G), (G) are no larger than the corresponding numbers for any spanning tree of G.</p><p>The statement clearly holds for the only tree of order 2. Assume the result holds for all nontrivial trees of order at most k and let T be any tree of order k +1. Let V(T) = V 1 ∪V 2 ∪W and assume no vertex in V 1 is adjacent to any vertex in V 2 . The result clearly holds if T is a star. Otherwise, let v be a vertex of degree one at the end of a longest path in T and let w be its unique neighbor. Let R denote the other degree one neighbors (if any) of w. Let T be the tree T -({v, w}∪R).</p><p>By induction 1 (T )+ 2 (T )+ (T ) ≤ |T |, where we are assuming V(T ) inherits the partition from that of V(T). It is clear that (T) ≤ (T )+1. If R = ∅, then at most one of V 1 , V 2 intersects {v, w}. On the other hand, if R = ∅, then |T| ≥ |T |+3 and since w dominates R∪{v}, it follows immediately that</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">1 (T)+ 2 (T)+ (T) ≤ 1 (T )+ 2 (T )+ (T )+3.</formula><p>We will now show that the graph G from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> satisfies Vizing's conjecture. To that end, let H be an arbitrary graph and let D be a minimum dominating set of the Cartesian product G H. For an arbitrary vertex g of G we denote the intersection of D with the fiber g H by D g . Label the vertices of G and select pairs of its vertices as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>.</p><p>While D dominates all of G H, to show that (G H) ≥ (G) (H) we will show that</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">|D| ≥ 5 (H) to dominate r H ∪ s H ∪ t H ∪ v H ∪ w H.</formula><p>First we note that if each of D r , D s , D t , D v and D w contains at least (H) vertices, then |D| ≥ 5 (H).</p><p>Thus, we assume this is not the case. We associate the color 1 (respectively, 2, 3, 4, 5) with the H-fiber r H (respectively, s H, t H, v H, w H). We will color each vertex of H with a subset of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} in such a way that the subset of V(H) colored i dominates H for each 1 ≤ i ≤ 5. The subset assigned to each vertex will accumulate during the course of the argument below. As these assignments are made, the total number of assignments will not exceed |D|. We begin by assigning color 1 (respectively, 2, 3, 4 or 5) to each vertex h for which (r, h) belongs to D r (respectively, (s, h)</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">∈ D s , (t, h) ∈ D t , (v, h) ∈ D v , (w, h) ∈ D w ).</formula><p>We say that a vertex h of H is on the missing fiber list at r if the vertex (r, h) is not dominated by D r . Denote this missing fiber list by L r . Note that if h ∈ L r , then at least one of (y, h) and (z, h) is in D. Similarly, let L s and L t be the missing fiber lists at s and t, respectively.</p><p>Let f X denote the map from D y to z H given by f X (y, h) = (z, h) and let D z denote D z ∪ f X (D y ). In an analogous way we form D u , D v , D w and D x by doing similar projections of the subset of D in the H-fibers located at clear vertices within B 1 ×V(H), D 1 × V(H), D 2 ×V(H), and B 2 ×V(H) onto the H-fibers specified by the solid vertices. Let us say that a vertex h from H has weight 1 in B 1 if exactly one of (a, h) or (u, h) is in D. If both of these vertices are in D we say h has weight 2 in B 1 . The weight of h in each of D 1 , D 2 , B 2 and X is defined in a similar way.</p><p>As we did above for r, s and t, we define missing fiber lists L v and L w . However, here we say for example, that h</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">∈ L v if (v, h) is not dominated by D v (instead of, if (v, h) is not dominated by D v ).</formula><p>We are not concerned with missing fiber lists at u, x and z. Rather, the focus is on the connected components of the subgraphs induced by D u , D x and D z .</p><p>Each such component is an isolated vertex or has order at least two. In the case where one of these components has order at least two the complement of a minimal dominating set is also a dominating set. We will make use of the fact that such a component has two disjoint dominating sets. Finally, assume k has weight one in B 1 . We observe that k cannot be on the missing fiber lists at both s and v because D dominates both of (a, k) and (u, k) (in fact, at least one of (s, k), (b, k), (v, k) is in D). If k ∈ L s , assign color 2 to k; if k ∈ L v , assign color 4 to k. The components of the subgraph induced by D x are handled in a similar manner.</p><p>We now make the important observation that if a vertex h is on the missing fiber list at s, then color 2 has been assigned to h or to a neighbor of h. Thus, the vertices having color 2 in their list dominate H. The same is true for the vertices having color 3 in their list. Also, if a vertex k is on the missing fiber list L v and (u, k) ∈ D u , then either k or one of its neighbors has been assigned the color 4. Furthermore, if vertex k is in L v and (u, k) / ∈ D u , then (w, k) ∈ D, and hence neither k nor any of its neighbors in H belongs to L w . Similar statements hold in regard to such a vertex of H relative to L w .</p><p>Suppose that k ∈ L v and color <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> has not yet been assigned to k or one of its neighbors. Then (u, k) / ∈ D u and (w, k) ∈ D. Assume that (z, k) / ∈ D z . Then k / ∈ L r for otherwise the vertex (r, k) would not be dominated. Now we ask which vertex dominates (b, k). It can be neither (y, k) nor (z, k) because (z, k) / ∈ D z . Similarly, since (u, k) / ∈ D u it is also not dominated by (u, k) or (a, k). Hence (b, k) must be dominated by (c, k). Then both (c, k) and (w, k) are in D and we may assign color 4 to k. The same can be done for color 5. If some vertex k is not dominated by a vertex assigned color 4 or 5 then (z, k) ∈ D z . Note also that (z, k) ∈ D z when k ∈ L r . We therefore only need to deal with the vertices in D z .</p><p>Consider a component C = {(z, k)} of order one in D z . There are three cases to handle: k is in both, neither or exactly one of L v , L w . Suppose that k ∈ L v ∩L w . Since D dominates both (v, k) and (w, k) this implies that k has weight at least one in both of B 1 and B 2 . As noted above, either k or one of its neighbors in H has been assigned color 4. The same is true about color 5. Thus we can assign color 1 to k.</p><p>Assume next that k / ∈ L v ∪L w . In this case we assign color 1 to k. Finally, assume that k belongs to exactly one of the two missing fiber lists L v and L w . Without lost of generality we suppose that k ∈ L v and k is not in L w . From the previous observation we may assume that (u, k) / ∈ D u . As noted above this implies that (w, k) belongs to D and neither k nor any of its neighbors in H belongs to L w . If k / ∈ L r , assign color 4 to k. If, on the other hand, k belongs to L r , then because D dominates both of (y, k) and (z, k) it follows that (c, k) is also in D or k has weight two in X. In both instances we assign colors 1 and 4 to k.</p><p>We are thus led to the final case in which we consider a component C in D z of order at least two. Let (z, h) ∈ C. As with a component of order one, we have already handled the situation in which h</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">∈ L v ∩L w (from B 1 and B 2 ). Place (z, h) in V 1 if h ∈ L v -L w and place (z, h) in V 2 if h ∈ L w -L v . Let W = C -(V 1 ∪V 2 )</formula><p>. By our observation above no vertex of V 1 is adjacent to any vertex of V 2 . We apply Lemma 3.3 and infer that there exist subsets</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">A 1 , A 2 and A of C such that A i dominates V i , for 1 ≤ i ≤ 2, A dominates C and |A 1 |+|A 2 |+|A| ≤ |C|. These subsets of C need not be disjoint. If (z, h) ∈ A 1 , assign color 4 to h. If (z, h) ∈ A 2 ,</formula><p>assign color 5 to h. Finally assign color 1 to any h for which (z, h) ∈ A. We have assigned |A 1 |+|A 2 |+|A| colors which is at most |C|.</p><p>It now follows that the set of vertices having color 1 (respectively, 4 or 5) dominates H. Combining this with our earlier conclusion about colors 2 and 3 we have shown</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">(G H) = |D| ≥ 5 (H) = (G) (H).</formula><p>It is unclear how far the above idea can be pushed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">FAIR RECEPTION</head><p>Recently Brešar and Rall <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> introduced the notion of a fair reception in a graph. It uses an approach similar to that of Barcalkin and German, by partitioning a graph into subgraphs that enjoy a condition like that in inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Yet the partition is more general, since arbitrary subgraphs (not only cliques) are allowed in the partition, and also there can be a special, external part Z.</p><p>Let {S 1 , . . . ,S k } be a collection of pairwise disjoint sets of vertices from a graph G with S = S 1 ∪•••∪S k , and let Z = V(G)-S. We say that S 1 , ...,S k form a fair reception of size k if for any integer ,1 ≤ ≤ k, and any choice of sets S i 1 , .. . ,S i from the collection, the following holds: if D externally dominates</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">S i 1 ∪•••∪S i then |D∩Z|+ j,S j ∩D =∅ (|S j ∩D|-1) ≥ . (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>That is, on the left-hand side we count all the vertices of D that are not in S, and for vertices of D that are in some S j , we count all but one from D∩S j . In any graph, any nonempty subset of the vertex set forms a fair reception of size 1. Another example is obtained by taking a 2-packing and letting each set S i consist of exactly one vertex of the 2-packing. Hence in any graph G there is a fair reception of size (G).</p><p>Given a graph G, the largest k such that there exists a fair reception of size k in G is denoted by F (G), and is called the fair domination number of G. For instance in C 5 we can let S 1 be a single vertex and the vertices in its antipodal edge be S 2 , and obtain a fair reception of size 2. Thus F (C 5 ) = 2 = (C 5 ). We have the following basic observation about the fair domination number.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposition 4.1 (Brešar and Rall [10]). For any graph G, (G) ≤ F (G) ≤ (G).</head><p>Proof. The first inequality has been established above. Suppose there is a graph G such that r = (G)&lt; F (G) = k. Let A be a minimum dominating set, and assume that the sets S 1 , .. . ,S k with Z = V(G)-S form a fair reception of size k in G. Since r&lt;k, the set A must be disjoint from at least one of these sets. Assume that A∩S i = ∅ for 1 ≤ i ≤ t and that A∩S j = ∅ for t +1 ≤ j ≤ k.</p><p>The set A externally dominates S 1 ∪•••∪S t and so it follows from the definition of fair reception that</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">t ≤ |A∩Z|+ j,S j ∩A =∅ (|S j ∩A|-1) = |A∩Z|+ k j=t+1 |S j ∩A|-(k -t) = |A|-k +t.</formula><p>This immediately implies that k ≤ |A|, which is a contradiction.</p><p>If the partition of V(G) into F (G) sets (and an eventual set Z) obeys condition (3), then similar arguments as in Theorem 2.2 can be used to deduce the following result. Theorem 4.2 <ref type="bibr">(Brešar and Rall [10]</ref>). For all graphs G and H,</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">(G H) ≥ max{ (G) F (H), F (G) (H)}.</formula><p>An application to Vizing's conjecture is seen in the following obvious corollary. Corollary 4.3 <ref type="bibr">(Brešar and Rall [10]</ref>). If G is a graph with F (G) = (G), then G satisfies Vizing's conjecture.</p><p>It is also easy to see the following fact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposition 4.4 (Brešar and Rall [10]). Let G be a decomposable graph. Then a partition of the vertex set into (G) cliques yields a fair reception of G of size (G) (in which S equals V(G)).</head><p>Note that a family of sets that forms a fair reception in a graph G also forms a fair reception in any spanning subgraph of G. Hence by the above proposition, the class of graphs G with (G) = F (G) contains the class of BG-graphs as well. Thus, Theorem 4.2 is a generalization of the result by Barcalkin and German. The same authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> also constructed an infinite family of graphs whose fair domination number and domination number are equal but which are not covered by the Type X results.</p><p>The fair domination number of a graph is related to the invariant i introduced by Aharoni and Szabó <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Let i (G) denote the maximum, over all independent sets M in G, of the smallest cardinality of a set D that dominates M (i.e. such that M ⊆ N[D]). Proposition 4.5 <ref type="bibr">(Brešar and Rall [10]</ref>). For any graph G, F (G) ≥ i (G).</p><p>Proof. It is easy to see that we may assume G has no isolated vertices. Let I be an independent set of vertices in G that requires k = i (G) vertices to dominate, and suppose that A = {x 1 , .. . ,x k } dominates I. Because G has no isolated vertices we may assume that A externally dominates I. Let the sets S 1 , . . . ,S k be a partition of I such that S i ⊆ N(x i ). We claim that S 1 , . . . ,S k form a fair reception in G. To (externally) dominate any subfamily of of these sets, one needs at least vertices (all of which are in Z, hence (3) will be satisfied). Indeed, otherwise we easily infer that I can be dominated by fewer than k vertices, which is a contradiction. Thus F (G) ≥ k = i (G).</p><p>As a corollary, we obtain the result of Aharoni and Szabó <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>:</p></div>

Chordal graphs satisfy Vizing's conjecture.</p><p>Unfortunately, i (G) can be arbitrarily smaller than (G), though it is at least (G). The relationship between F (G) and (G) is murkier.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">THE DOUBLE-PROJECTION ARGUMENT</head><p>In attacking Vizing's conjecture, the following question is quite natural.

Recently Suen and Tarr <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> announced the following improvement of Theorem 5.1:</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">(G H) ≥ 1 2 (G) (H)+ 1 2 min{ (G), (H)}.</formula><p>Yet another recent improvement of Theorem 5.1 is due to Wu <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. A Roman domination of a graph G is a labeling of its vertices with labels from {0, 1, 2} such that if a vertex is labeled with 0 then it has a neighbor labeled with 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">PROPERTIES OF A MINIMAL COUNTEREXAMPLE</head><p>A natural way to prove or disprove a conjecture in graph theory is to check for the existence of a minimal counterexample. Suppose Vizing's conjecture is false. Then, there exists a graph G such that for some graph H, (G H)&lt; (G) (H). From among all such graphs, G, choose one of smallest order. We call such a graph a minimal counterexample.</p><p>In this section we add to the list of properties that must be satisfied by any minimal counterexample. As a consequence it might be possible to find such a counterexample or to prove that Vizing's conjecture is actually true for any graph satisfying all such conditions. In the latter case the truth of the conjecture is established.</p><p>It is immediate that a minimal counterexample is connected. We may also assume that a minimal counterexample is edge-critical with respect to domination (see Observation 2.1). (For more information on edge-critical graphs see the survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.) Suppose that u and v are distinct vertices in a graph G. Denote by G uv the graph formed by identifying vertices u and v in G and then removing any parallel edges. For reference purposes let w be the vertex in the identification of u and v. (If e = uv ∈ E(G), then G uv is the usual graph obtained from G by contracting the edge e.) It is clear from the definition that (G uv ) ≤ (G). It is also easy to see that (G uv H) ≤ (G H) for any graph H. Indeed, if D is a minimum dominating set of G H, then</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">D = (D-( u H ∪ v H))∪{(w, h)|(u, h) ∈ D or (v, h) ∈ D}</formula><p>dominates G uv H. Using this, we can now establish another property of any minimal counterexample. Burton and Sumner <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> call graphs with this property totally dotcritical. Theorem 6.1. If G is a minimal counterexample to Vizing's conjecture, then for every pair of distinct vertices u and v of G, (G uv )&lt; (G).</p><p>Proof. Let H be a graph such that (G H)&lt; (G) (H), and let u and v be distinct vertices of G. Then, G uv satisfies Vizing's conjecture. It follows that</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">(G uv ) (H) ≤ (G uv H) ≤ (G H)&lt; (G) (H).</formula><p>The conclusion of the theorem follows.</p><p>Cycles of order 3n+1 satisfy the conclusion of Theorem 6.1 as does any graph formed from a connected graph by adding a single leaf adjacent to each vertex. Problem 6.2. Characterize the graphs G such that for every pair of distinct vertices u and v in G, (G uv )&lt; (G).</p><p>Among the consequences of Theorem 6.1, it follows that a minimal counterexample cannot have a vertex adjacent to two or more vertices of degree one, nor can any vertex have two neighbors, each of degree two, that are adjacent to each other. In addition, we also have the following corollary. The property given in the corollary should be considered in relation to the study of the set of vertices belonging to all, to some, or to no minimum dominating sets started by <ref type="bibr">Mynhardt [38]</ref>. This study followed the initiative by Hammer et al. for stable sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>In 2004 Sun <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> proved that: Theorem 6.4 <ref type="bibr">(Sun [42]</ref>). Every graph G such that (G) = 3 satisfies Vizing's conjecture.</p><p>(The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> proved that the inequality in Vizing's conjecture holds if both factors have domination number 3.) This, together with the fact that any graph with domination number at most 2 is a BG-graph, implies that any G with (G) ≤ 3 satisfies the conjecture.</p><p>There are various relationships that exist between the classes of graphs that have been shown to satisfy Vizing's conjecture. For example, every BG-graph and every graph G with (G) ≤ (G)+1 is of Type X . Also, (G)</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">= i (G) = F (G) if G is chordal.</formula><p>By combining results from the first part of this survey together with those derived in this section, we see that any minimal counterexample G must satisfy all of the following conditions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">• (G) ≥ 4; • G is not of Type X ; • F (G)&lt; (G);</formula><p>• G is edge-critical and (G uv )&lt; (G) for all pairs of vertices u, v in G;</p><p>• Every vertex of G belongs to a minimum dominating set.</p><p>It is not hard to construct a graph that satisfies all of the above conditions, except possibly that F (G)&lt; (G) (the invariant F is often difficult to compute). Indeed, this is how we produced the graph G in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. We observe that (G) = 5, the 2-packing number of G is 3 (implying that G is not of Type X ), and G is edge-critical. We also think that F (G)&lt;5, although we were not able to verify it. Hence, according to the list of conditions above, G is a possible candidate for a counterexample to Vizing's conjecture. As shown in Section 3, this is not the case.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Attachable Sets</head><p>Suppose that a graph G 1 has a subset S 1 of vertices such that for every graph H it is the case that |D| ≥ (G 1 ) (H) whenever D is a subset of V(G 1 H) that dominates (V(G 1 )-S 1 )×V(H). Then clearly G 1 satisfies Vizing's conjecture. In this case S 1 is called an attachable set of G 1 . For example, Hartnell and Rall showed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> that any independent set of vertices in C 5 is an attachable set. In fact, the following result is proved.</p><p>Theorem 7.1 <ref type="bibr">(Hartnell and Rall [24]</ref>). Cycles of the form C 3k and C 3k+2 have attachable sets. No cycle of the form C 3k+1 has an attachable set.</p><p>Another way to get a graph G with an attachable set is to start with any graph G that satisfies the conjecture and any vertex v of G that belongs to some minimum dominating set of G. Construct G by adding to G a new vertex v , the edge vv , and any additional subset of edges that join v to neighbors of v in G. Then {v } is an attachable set of G . If v w ∈ E(G ) such that w = v and w belongs to a minimum dominating set of G, then the edge vv can be removed from G . The set {v } is attachable in the resulting graph. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> for additional details. This provides, for example, another way to see that complete bipartite graphs satisfy Vizing's conjecture.</p><p>The use of graphs with attachable sets is illustrated by the following construction. Suppose S i is an attachable set of G i for i = 1, 2. Let G be the graph built from the disjoint union of G 1 and G 2 by adding any subset of the edges that join a vertex in S 1 with a vertex in S 2 . It is easy to show that G satisfies Vizing's conjecture, and, in fact, that S 1 ∪S 2 is an attachable set of G.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Degree Conditions on Pairs of Graphs</head><p>Recall that one says that a graph G satisfies Vizing's conjecture if inequality (1) holds for every graph H. The majority of known results on the conjecture gives classes of graph that satisfy the conjecture. Alternatively, one could also try to prove that the inequality holds for given pairs of graphs, an approach followed by Clark, Ismail and Suen in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. We give two of their results. A natural question arising from the above theorem is: Question 7.3. Can one prove that all cubic graphs satisfy Vizing's conjecture? Theorem 7.4 (Clark et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>). Let G and H be graphs of order at most n, and let</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">(G), (H) ≥ √ n ln n. Then (G H) ≥ (G) (H).</formula><p>The approach used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is the following. Clearly,</p><formula xml:id="formula_53">(G H) ≥ |G H| (G H)+1 .</formula><p>Suppose we have a general upper bound on the domination number of an arbitrary graph in terms of its number of vertices, minimum and maximum degree, and that the product of such upper bounds for G and H is bounded above by |G H| /( (G H)+1) . Then the inequality in Vizing's conjecture holds for the pair G, H. Upper bounds applied in this approach are the following well known bound due to Arnautov <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> (G) ≤ n 1+ln( +1) +1</p><p>and its extension from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Pairs that Attain Equality</head><p>The reason that Vizing's conjecture is so difficult lies also in the fact that it is hard to determine or bound the domination number of a graph, especially if it is not very small. As a consequence it is very difficult to verify that a counterexample has been found. Perhaps surprisingly, many classes of pairs of graphs for which the equality is achieved in (1) have been discovered; the complete list of these classes can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.

Total Domination</head><p>A total dominating set of a graph G with no isolated vertex is a set S of vertices of G such that every vertex is adjacent to a vertex in S. The total domination number of G, denoted by t (G), is the minimum cardinality of a total dominating set. It was conjectured in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> that the product of the total domination numbers of two graphs without isolated vertices is bounded above by twice the total domination number of their Cartesian product. This conjecture was solved by Ho <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Theorem 8.4 <ref type="bibr">(Ho [32]</ref>). For any graphs G and H without isolated vertices, t (G H) ≥ 1 2 t (G) t (H). In the case when at least one of G or H is a nontrivial tree, those graphs for which t (G H) = 1  2 t (G) t (H) are characterized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.

Integer Domination</head><p>For k ≥ 1, a function f : V(G) →{0, 1, . . . , k} defined on the vertices of a graph G is called a {k}-dominating function, abbreviated kDF, if the sum of its function values over any closed neighborhood is at least k <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The weight of a kDF is the sum of its function values over all vertices. The {k}-domination number, denoted {k} (G), of G is the minimum weight of a kDF. Note that the characteristic function of a dominating set of G is a {1}-dominating function, and so {1} (G) = (G). This type of domination is referred to as integer domination. It and fractional domination are related as follows. </p></div>

A perfect matching M in G is a matching in G such that every vertex of G is incident to an edge of M. A paired-dominating set, abbreviated PDS, of a graph G is a dominating set S of G such that the subgraph G[S] induced by S contains a perfect matching M (not necessarily induced). Every graph without isolated vertices has a PDS since the end-vertices of any maximal matching form such a set. The paired-domination number of G, denoted by pr (G), is the minimum cardinality of a PDS; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</p><p>A version of Vizing's Conjecture for the paired-domination number is studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. For this purpose, recall that for k ≥ 2, a k-packing in a graph G was defined by Meir and Moon <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> as a set S of vertices of G that are pairwise at distance greater than k apart, i.e. if u, v ∈ S, then d G (u, v)&gt;k. The k-packing number of G, denote k (G), is the maximum cardinality of a k-packing in G. We have written 2 as . Brešar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> observed that it is not true that for every pair of graphs G and H, pr (G H) ≥ max{ pr (G) (H), pr (H) (G)}. For example, let G be the graph obtained from K 4 by attaching to each vertex a leaf and let H = C 9 . Then, (G) = 4 and pr (H) = 6, whence pr (G H) ≤ 22&lt;24 = pr (G) (H). However, they observed that the 3-packing number related to the paired-domination number plays a similar role as the packing number related to the usual domination number. Theorem 8.13 <ref type="bibr">(Brešar et al. [8]</ref>). For any graphs G and H without isolated vertices, pr (G H) ≥ max{ pr (G) 3 (H), pr (H) 3 (G)}.</p><p>It was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> that every nontrivial tree T has pr (T) = 2 3 (T). Hence we have the following corollary of Theorem 8.13. Theorem 8.14 <ref type="bibr">(Brešar et al. [8]</ref>). Let T be a nontrivial tree and H any graph without isolated vertices.

It is clear that i(G) = 6. Let H = G; then (H) = 2 = i(H). However, i(G H) = 11. This pair of graphs also shows that there are graphs with (G H)&lt;i(G) (H), and i(G H)&lt;i(G)i(H).

Moreover, for any edge uv in G, there exists a minimum dominating set D such that either both u and v are in D, or u is in D and one of u or v is the only vertex not dominated by D-{u}. Proof. Let u and v be any two adjacent vertices of G, denote by w the vertex of G uv obtained by the identification of u and v. Consider a minimum dominating set D of G uv . If the added vertex w is in D , let D = (D -{w})∪{u, v}; otherwise let D = D ∪{u}. In both cases, it is easy to check that D dominates G. Moreover, |D| = |D |+1, and since (G)&gt; (G uv ) = |D |, we deduce that D is a minimum dominating set of G that contains u. Now, in the first case, D contains both u and v. In the second case, all the vertices in G except possibly u or v are dominated by D-{u}. Furthermore, D contains a neighbor x of w, which is a neighbor of u or v in G.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">VIZING-TYPE THEOREMS FOR RELATED DOMINATION INVARIANTS</head><p>In this section, we survey versions of Vizing's conjecture for various domination-type invariants, including fractional, total, independent, and integer domination. In particular, Theorem 5.1 can be generalized in several ways.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Fractional Domination</head><p>A function f : V(G) → [0, 1] defined on the vertices of a graph G is called a fractionaldominating function if the sum of its function values over any closed neighborhood is at least 1. The weight of a fractional-dominating function is the sum of its function values over all vertices. The fractional domination number of G, denoted f (G), is the minimum weight of a fractional-dominating function. Note that the characteristic function of a dominating set of G is a fractional-dominating function, and so f (G) ≤ (G). The fractional version of Vizing's Conjecture was established by Fisher, Ryan, Domke, and Majumdar <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Theorem 8.1 <ref type="bibr">(Fisher et al. [21]</ref>). For any graphs G and H, f (G H) ≥ f (G) f (H).</p><p>In 2001, Brešar <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> gave a straightforward proof of the related result, originally proved by Fisher: Theorem 8.2 <ref type="bibr">(Fisher [20]</ref>). If G and H are connected graphs, then</p><p>This theorem shows that Vizing's conjecture is satisfied by graphs (e.g. trees, strongly chordal) for which the fractional domination number and domination number are equal.</p><p>The proof technique of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> involved the following concept. Let f be a function that assigns to each vertex v of G a subset (possibly empty) of V(H). For each vertex v ∈ V(G) we require</p><p>It is clear how each such function f corresponds to a dominating set of G H (one forms a dominating set for G H by taking the union of all subsets of the form {v}×f (v)), and conversely. The graph domination number of G with respect to H, denoted H (G), is defined by</p><p>obtained from normalizing the invariant by dividing it by k. Rearranged, this conjecture is:</p><p>Conjecture 8.8 <ref type="bibr">(Hou and Lu [33]</ref>). For any k ≥ 1 and graphs G and H,</p><p>A couple of partial results are known: Theorem 8.9 (Brešar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>). For any graphs G and H,</p><p>It is not difficult to see that for any graph G, {k} (G) ≤ k (G). In the following theorem we use the function defined by</p><p>Theorem 8.10 (Brešar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>). For any graphs G and H,</p><p>When k = 1, Theorems 8.9 and 8.10 simplify to (G H) ≥ 1 2 (G) (H), which is Theorem 5.1. The following questions from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> remained unresolved, even though the second one is very weak: Question 8.11. Is it true that for any graphs G and H, {2} (G H) ≥ (G) (H)? Failing which, is there some k such that {k} (G H) ≥ (G) (H) for any pair of graphs G and H? Theorem 8.4 can be extended to integer total domination. For k ≥ 1 an integer, a function f : V(G) →{0, 1, . . . , k} is a total {k}-dominating function, abbreviated TkDF, if the sum of its function values over any open neighborhood is at least k. The total {k}-domination number, denoted {k} t (G), of G is the minimum weight of a TkDF. Note that the characteristic function of a total dominating set of G is a total {1}-dominating function, and so {1} t (G) = t (G). Total {k}-domination is also referred to as integer total domination.</p><p>The following version of Vizing's conjecture for the total {k}-domination number holds: Theorem 8.12 (Li and Hou <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>). For k ≥ 1 an integer, and for any graphs G and H without isolated vertices,</p><p>When k = 1, Theorem 8.12 gives Theorem 8.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">STRONGER AND WEAKER CONJECTURES</head><p>In this section we give several conjectures and questions. Some of them are stronger than Vizing's conjecture meaning an affirmative answer would imply the conjecture, while others would follow from the truth of Vizing's conjecture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The bg-Conjecture</head><p>The clique cover number (G) of a graph G is the minimum number of complete subgraphs of G that cover V(G). Note that (G) = (G), and (G) ≤ (G) since a dominating set for G can be formed by choosing a single vertex from each of the (G) cliques that belong to the cover. Barcalkin and German's <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> decomposable graphs are those with (G) = (G). Denote by E(G) the collection of all edge-critical graphs, G , such that G is a spanning subgraph of G and (G ) = (G). Theorem 2.2 can now be stated using these invariants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem 9.1. If there exists a graph G ∈ E(G) such that (G ) = (G), then for every graph H, (G H) ≥ (G) (H).</head><p>Of course, not all graphs satisfy the hypothesis of Theorem 2.2, but it suggests another conjecture whose truth would imply Vizing's conjecture. Let bg(G) denote the minimum value of (G ), where the minimum is taken over all G ∈ E(G). Clearly, for any graph G, (G) ≤ bg(G), and G satisfies the hypothesis of Theorem 2.2 if and only if these two invariants have the same value.</p><p>If we could show that (G H) ≥ (G)bg(H), then Vizing's conjecture would follow. This inequality is not true, in general. This can be seen by letting G = B 1 and H = B 2 from Figure <ref type="figure">2;</ref><ref type="figure"></ref> (B 1 ) = 3, bg(B 1 ) = 4, (B 2 ) = 4 and bg(B 2 ) = 6. The set ({a, b, c, d}×</p><p>However, the truth of the following conjecture would also establish Vizing's conjecture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conjecture 9.2. For any pair of graphs G and H,</head><p>The same graph B 2 as above could possibly produce a counterexample to Conjecture 9.2 if one can show that (B 2 B 2 ) is less than 24. is a consequence of Vizing's conjecture. Perhaps this could be proven without first proving Vizing's conjecture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Partition Conjecture</head><p>Vizing's conjecture would follow from the following conjecture. Conjecture 9.7. For any graph G, there exists a partition of V(G) into (G) sets A 1 , . . . , A (G) such that for any graph H, there is a minimum dominating set, D, of G H such that the projection p H (D∩(A i ×V(H))) dominates H for all i, 1≤ i ≤ (G).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.">CONCLUSION-WORK IN PROGRESS</head><p>Vizing's conjecture is that the domination number of the Cartesian product of graphs G and H is at least as large as the product of their domination numbers. Starting with the paper of Barcalkin and German <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the inequality has been proven for all H and several families of G that admit a suitable partition, such as chordal graphs. In a different direction, a relaxed inequality was proven for all pairs by Clark and Suen <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In contrast, several similar bounds were established for other, related graph invariants. In this paper we provided additional properties of a minimal counterexample, if it exists, and improved bounds on claw-free graphs.</p><p>A common thread running through almost all the progress is to bound the size of a dominating set of G H by partitioning it or projecting it and thereby relating it to dominating sets of G and H. It is unclear whether this approach will be able to prove the conjecture. On the other hand, a few researchers suspect that it might not be true after all, and base their doubt on the fact that the conjectured inequality is proven sharp for several rather different families of pairs of graphs (so there "should" also be pairs of graphs which contradict the conjecture...). Indeed, forty years later, Vizing's conjecture remains unresolved. Even partial results have proven difficult. It will be interesting to see what the next decades will bring.</p></div>			</div>
