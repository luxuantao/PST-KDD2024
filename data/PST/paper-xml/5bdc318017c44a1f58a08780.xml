<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In e-learning, most content-based (CB) recommender systems provide recommendations depending on matching rules between learners and learning objects (LOs). Such learner-oriented approaches are limited when it comes to detecting learners' changes, furthermore, the recommendations show low adaptability and diversity. In this study, in order to improve the adaptability and diversity of recommendations, we incorporate an LO-oriented recommendation mechanism to learner-oriented recommender systems, and propose an LO self-organization based recommendation approach (Self). LO self-organization means LO interacts with each other in a spontaneous and autonomous way. Such self-organization behavior is conducive to generating a stable LO structure through information propagation. The proposed approach works as follows: firstly, LOs are simulated as intelligent entities using the self-organization theory. LOs can receive information, transmit information, as well as move. Secondly, an environment perception module is designed. This module can capture and perceive learner's preference drifts by analyzing LOs' self-organization behaviors. Finally, according to learners' explicit requirements and implicit preference drifts, recommendations are generated through LOs' self-organization behaviors. Based on application to real-life learning processes, the ample experimental results demonstrate the high adaptability, diversity, and personalization of the recommendations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>E-learning recommender systems aim to recommend a sequence of items to learners, that is, to suggest the most efficient or effective paths through a plethora of learning resources to achieve a certain competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. However, over specification and excessive searching in e-learning recommender systems result in information overload. Learners do not have enough time to deal with these massive recommendations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5</head><p>In addition, the adaptability and diversity of recommendations are desirable in e-learning recommender systems, because learners' preferences and abilities keep changing, and also because the functionality of some learning resources for active learners keeps changing. The diverse and adaptive recommendations should be presented to motivate learning potential of learners and ensure a long-term learning experience.</p><p>In this study, we aim to improve the adaptability and diversity of content-based (CB) recommendations. Generally, learning resources are filtered in three ways: CB, collaborative filtering (CF), and hybrid filtering (HF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. CF recommender systems compute the similarity computation between learners based on their rating and then make predictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. CF methods are known to suffer from the rating sparsity problem which occurs when the users or items have insufficient rating records <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In e-learning, the rating information is extremely sparse. The main reasons for this are a lack of motivation for learners to rate, a lack of scoring mechanisms, and the scheduled but limited learning time of learners <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The high data sparsity makes it difficult to apply CF techniques. CB recommender systems recommend relevant learning contents which are highly matched to learners' learning goals and preferences. In addition, CB recommender systems do not usually suffer from the first-rater problem, therefore, CB recommendation approaches are the only ones capable of recommending items not previously rated by any learner <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The learner's ability, goal, mood, and cognitive style are often used as criteria in CB recommendation systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>A few researches have been done to study learners' learning activities and give corresponding adaptive recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. The architecture of adaptive CB recommender system is described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In it, the learner model is extracted form learner profiles, and the adaptive module builds the adaptive concept selection rules or content selection rules through analyzing the relationships between the learner and LO models. The recommendation module executes the adaptive matching rules and provides the recommendations. The learning profiles of learners are updated by the feedback from the interaction module. Lu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> pointed out the matching rules are important for discovering associations between student requirements and the learning material tree. Nevertheless, CB recommender systems in e-learning still face the following problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>:</p><p>• The low adaptability of CB recommender systems makes it difficult for them to keeo up with the constant and rapid changes in e-learning environments. This problem refers to the fact that the recommendation approaches have a low ability to capture and perceive the changes in learners' preferences in an adaptive way <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The main reasons are: (1) the learner and LO models are often limited when it comes to comprehensively extracting the useful information of both learners and learning resources. As a result, the adaptive models are also limited; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> the implicit or predictive demands are seldom considered in the existing adaptive models.</p><p>• The CB recommendation approach has the problem of low diversity due to the existence of excessive  similar recommendations. Many researches have mentioned that the diversity should be given higher priority than in previous recommender systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. The problem of low diversity has not been addressed enough in traditional CB recommendation systems. In e-learning, learners are bothered when very similar, almost identical, items appear in a recommendation list <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. CB recommendation strategies are top-down and completely learner-oriented, as a result, learners only receive items that are similar to what they previously liked or showed to prefer. These approaches lack inherent mechanisms to improve the diversity of recommendations. Also, the highly matched resources are not likely to stimulate learners' interest or promote their learning potential.</p><p>In order to improve the adaptability and diversity of recommendations, we propose a recommendation approach based on the self-organization theory. The self-organization theory refers to the self-organizing phenomenon in which subsystems or individuals can form certain structures according to some rules without any external instruction. In our study, we model LOs as entities with the ability to receive information, transit information, and move towards target learners in a self-organizing way. The behaviors of LO individuals have the purpose to satisfy the requirements of active learners, which ensures the presentation of effective recommendations.</p><p>The architecture of the proposed recommendation approach is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. It includes the learner model, LO model, and the recommendation module and interactive module.</p><p>In learner model, learning styles are applied on describing a learner in e-learning environments. Learning styles are defined as how a learner behaves while learning, and what kind of preferences he/she has.</p><p>We define learning styles using several aspects such as competency, preferences, attitude, learning experiences etc. In LO model, besides the basic attributes such as content, media or difficulty, some extended attributes are added such as LO states, as well as the statistics of LOs being operated and accessed.</p><p>In the recommendation module, LOs are modeled as intelligent entities which have autonomous and spontaneous behaviors, such as information transmitting and position changing. In the environment perception module, both the real-time operations of learners and the self-organization tendency of LOs are mined in order to perceive learners' preference drifts. When learners begin to study, recommendations</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>are initialized according to learners' goals and learning styles. Next, learners' interactions with LOs become the stimuli for LOs' self-organization. According to learners' requirements and the preference drifts feedback from environment perception module, LO entities perform micro and bottom-up selforganization behaviors. The final recommendations will be presented when the self-organization process becomes stable. The LO self-organization behaviors will be continuously triggered by learners' learning activities. If learners achieve their goals, the recommendation stops.</p><p>According to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, there are some characteristics which distinguish the proposed recommendation approach from previous approaches.</p><p>• The proposed recommendation strategy is based on both learner-LO and LO-LO relationships and not only based on learner-LO relationships. In most CB recommender systems, recommendations are provided to learners according to learner-LO matching rules. In the proposed approach, only few LOs are directly influenced by learners, and most of the LOs exhibit their behaviors according to LO-LO relationships. The appropriate reduction of learner-LO dependence will help address the problem of excessive recommendations. Consequently, the recommendations are expected to be more diversified.</p><p>• The self-organization based recommendation approach is bottom-up, spontaneous and distributed, rather than top-down, predefined and centralized. Our approach emphasizes the role of LOs' individual behavior. The fact is that LOs being operated by learners deliver effective information to other candidate LOs, and learners' operations carry the information of their real-time demands, abilities and learning experiences. The interactive information is generated, transmitted, received, and processed in a self-organizing way. The distributed and bottom-up recommendation strategies guarantee the diversity and adaptivity of recommendations.</p><p>• Besides learners' learning profiles, the dynamic changes of learners are also obtained through LOs' self-organization behaviors. The environment perception module is applied to capture the changes within the recommendation environment. Once an LO is studied by learners or be influenced by other LOs, its attributes, such as extended metadata, immediately are updated. Such attribute changes transmit the real-time preference drift of learners. Hence, we can update the environment parameters such as the changes in learners' preferences and abilities, the changes in LOs' position, the clustering tendency, LOs' quality analysis, system entropy, etc. By analyzing the environment parameters, we can further obtain the predictive environment parameters.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes some previous research related to our study. Section 3 provides details on learner and LO modeling. Section 4 introduces the self-organization recommendation strategy. Section 5 presents the experimental setup of the proposed recommendation approach. Section 6 includes the experimental results and our discussions. Finally, section 7 summarizes the characteristics of the proposed approach and introduces future work. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Works</head><p>In this section, we review relevant researches on the learner model, the LO model and recommendation methods related to improving the diversity and adaptability of recommendations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Learner and LO models</head><p>Martins et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> mentioned that the user model should be conducive to making the educational process more adaptive and capable of preparing learners for future professions. Some modeling methods are used to generate user models in adaptive hypermedia systems such as the overlay model and the uncertainty-based user model <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. In the application of the overlay model for recommender systems, besides some common characteristics such as learners' learning goals, age, gender, and education level, learning styles are also often used to describe learners' personalized preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Many previous studies have considered accurately matching one or two of the above learning styles <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. Felder and Silverman's learning style and David Kolb's learning style (KLS) are the most widely used. In the e-learning environments, since learners' preferences and dynamic demands are subjective and multidimensional, more comprehensive learning styles and dynamic preferences should be combined together in CB recommender systems. Some methods are used to build user models with the consideration of the imprecise and complex natures of human behaviors, for example Bayesian belief network, matching learning, fuzzy logic-based techniques, etc <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. Collaborative filtering approaches are mainly applied on predicting the preferences and processing concept drift <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Si et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> considered diversity features in check-in data for constructing adaptive recommendation method, especially variability and consecutiveness features of temporal factor. Those studies also pointed that popular windowing and instance weighing approaches for handling concept drift or dynamic changes are not the best, simply because in collaborative filtering, the rating matrix is high dimensional and extremely sparse. Most importantly, the need for large amounts of historical data is an unavoidable limitation in such model building methods.</p><p>In e-learning recommender systems, the LO model is also one of the most important inputs. Besides ontology and concept map <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, metadata is often applied to the description of LOs <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Some metadata is extended for special educational recommendation systems. The metadata includes competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, reputation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, etc. Some researches studied how to accurately create and update the domain model.</p><p>For example, Kahraman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> focused on developing a domain model of adaptive hypermedia applications by redefining the storage layer of existing adaptive hypermedia systems. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, the course-based learning activities are fused into a fuzzy tree-structured learner profile to meet learners' requirements.</p><p>The similarity measure is most based on learning activities and pedagogical issues. Until now, there is no research that models LOs as intelligent entities and uses LOs' interactions to make recommendations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Recommendation Strategies</head><p>It is acknowledged that adaptive presentation and adaptive navigation should be achieved according to the real-time needs of the learners <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Currently, recommender systems obtain the changes in learner preferences by analyzing learners' behaviors or their ability tests, then adjust recommendation strategies to make appropriate recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. For example, DiNoia et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> focused on modeling</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M</head><p>A N U S C R I P T user propensity to select diverse items, where diversity is computed by means of content-based item attributes. Vargas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> also tried to detect the diversity of users' preferences by analyzing users' history profiles. Project et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> proposed an adaptive recommender system by incorporating the learner model to the resource model through the combination of hierarchical and network-based approaches to represent the resource domain. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> proposed a method for automatically constructing concepts maps for adaptive learning systems based on data mining techniques. Colace et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> studied the adaptive hypermedia system by using the definition of methodologies which are able to manage user model, learning contents, tracking strategies, and adaptation model. Kahraman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> focused on redefining the storage layer of existing adaptive hypermedia reference models in order to create and update the domain. From the above researches, it is clear that the adaptive model is confined to the predefined learner model, and that the CB recommendation strategies are directly based on learner-LO similarity. Compared with the fast-changing in learners' preferences, the learner profile-based evaluations and recommendations often lag behind, which eventually decreases the adaptability of recommendations. All these considered, there is a need for further research on detecting the ever-changing information of both learners and LOs and incorporating the information into the recommender systems.</p><p>Moreover, the interest and curiosity of learners is often reduced due to a lack of diversity. In order to decrease excessive recommendations and increase adaptability, recommendation systems should have the ability to generate unexpected but attractive recommendations. One possible solution is the introduction of probability-based recommendation mechanisms. For example, Sheth et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> applied the probabilitybased genetic algorithms to the information filtering. Yueh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> studied Markov's chain model-based meta-rules to help learners achieve effective web-based learning paths. Additionally, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) is a common way of determining student knowledge of skills in adaptive educational systems and cognitive tutors <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. The basic BKT is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that models student knowledge based on five parameters: prior, learn rate, forget, guess, and slip. Some other factors are introduced to improve the basic BKT. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, learners' affective states are combined with learners' knowledge ststes to optimize the knowledge tracing algorithm. Pavlic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> predicted learners' performance by using logistic regression on the difficulty of LOs and the time series-based studying results.</p><p>Currently, few attempts have been made to improve the quality of recommendations using influence propagation among individuals. Janssen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> provided recommendations for active learners by feeding back information on successful learning tracks from other learners. Koper et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> showed that indirect social interaction helps learners achieve their required competence effectively, they concentrated on studying the influence of LO quality, the disturbance of the external environment, and the matching errors. Those studies focused solely on the influence propagation of individuals' behaviors, the individuals specifically refer to the learners. Until now, there is no research that takes LOs as entities which can transmit information. Actually, LOs can respond to the input signal of stimulus and spontaneously reach a steady state, then the recommendations can be achieved. The LOs operated by learners carry valuable information on learners' implicit demands, so the predictive and adaptive recommendations can be obtained by analyzing the inherent correlation and interactions among LOs.  In this study, we incorporate self-organization theory into CB e-learning recommender systems. The LO-oriented recommendation mechanism is fused into the learner-oriented recommender system. This bottom-up and distributed approach is conducive to improving the diversity and adaptivity of recommendations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Preliminaries</head><p>In this study, the e-learning environment is defined as the interactive place for learner and learning resource entities. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> is a brief ontology graph of the LO, learner, and the environment. In this section, we introduce the LO model and learner model based on the ontology descriptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Learner Model</head><p>Each learner is represented as a two-tuple &lt;GU, T U, BU &gt;. A detailed description of each tuple is as follows.</p><p>(1) GU represents learning goals. Each learner's goals are composed of a concept set that the learner needs to learn.</p><p>( LOs; pref erence priority (HP ) is a sequence of the above preferences for a certain learner. These metadata are represented as digits or digital sequences and can be updated according to learner profiles.</p><p>(3)BU represents learners' behaviors. BU = {bu 1 , bu 2 , . . . , bu n }. BU includes the possible operations of learners in e-learning platform. Although some sequential pattern mining algorithms are applied to extracting learners' learning activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, it is not wise to predefine or utilize constant activity patterns to model learners. Therefore, in this study, learners' behaviors are the basic and direct stimuli for the self-organization of LOs. For example, bu 1 means marking T oo hard. If a learner marks an LO with T oo hard, bu 1 = 1, otherwise, bu 1 = 0. bu 2 means marking T oo easy; bu 3 means marking Later and bu 4 means marking Ignore. The other behaviors include learners' self-adjustment on preferences and the performances on tests.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">environment perception module</head><p>In this study, the recommender system is set as a three-tuple &lt;L, U, E&gt;. Here, L is the LO set, U is a learner, and E refers to the recommendation environment. It is assumed that all the entities are positioned in a two-dimensional environment using automatic cell machine theory. The entities around one active entity are considered as its neighbors. Each parameter in E reflects the specific state of LOs and learners, and the parameters are evaluated and updated within a certain time window T W . With n LOs considered, the main parameters of E are as follows:</p><p>• EC is a set, which consists of the LO's current state. EC = {EC l1 , EC l2 , . . . , EC ln }.</p><p>• EP is a set which reflects the current ranking of LOs in recommendations. EP = {EP l1 , EP l2 , . . . , EP ln }.</p><p>• ES is a set which reflects LOs' ranking based on the similarity between the learner and LOs.</p><p>ES = {ES l1 , ES l2 , . . . , ES ln }.</p><p>• EP V records the variation of the position of the LOs in EP . [t − 1, t] is the time interval.</p><p>EP V = (EP t l1 − EP t−1 l1 ), . . . , (EP t ln − EP t−1 ln ).</p><p>• ESV records the variations in the order of LOs in ES. ESV = (ES t l1 − ES t−1 l1 ), . . . , (ES t ln − ES t−1 ln ).</p><p>• EP A is an LO set which records the LOs' average ranking in T W . EP A = {EP A l1 , EP A l2 , . . . , EP A ln }.</p><p>EP A li refers to the average position of l i .</p><p>• CL shows the change in ability of learners according to their visited LOs and test results. The ability evaluation mechanism is designed according to the pedagogical methods.</p><p>• U P A is the set of learners' preferences obtained by analyzing the frequency of accessing LOs with a certain attribute. U P A = {LA  ). If LOs are marked frequently by learners, it means learners have low willingness to study these LOs. This is because the marking behavior represent learners' attitude towards the quality of the target LOs, especially in the age of information overloaded <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</p><p>• SE is the system entropy which reflects the stability of the environment, low entropy means the recommender system provides a stable LO structure. The equation for computing SE is given in section 6.3.1.</p><p>• SC is the stable cluster sets of LOs. With information propagation, LOs evolve from a relatively disorderly state to a relatively stable state. When the similarity of inter clusters is greater than a preset threshold, and system entropy decreases below a threshold, LO clusters are recorded. For example, SC = {l 1 , l 5 }, {l 3 , l 7 }, . . . , {l 2 , l 4 , l 8 , l 17 }.</p><p>• CC records the constant clusters of LOs. For each cluster in CC, LOs have fixed neighbor relationships during time T W . For example, CC = {l 1 , l 3 , l 7 }, . . . , {l 2 , l 5 , l 8 }, this means that l 1 , l 3 and l 7 are neighbors during T W .</p><p>SC and CC reflect the quality of the LO regions. When the learner shows preference drift, the LO sets with similar preferences in SC and the LOs that have a higher stability in CC will be immediately recommended.</p><p>E includes learners' explicit and predictive preferences changes, LOs' cluster state and LOs' quality.</p><p>By analyzing the environment detection parameters -E, more information about the learner and LO is further mined and defined as the predictive environment (P E). P E has the following parameters:</p><p>• LP C. It is the current preference set obtained from learners' direct operations on LOs. LP C = {LP C LA j |j ∈ [1, m]}. Each attribute U P i is ranked in LP C according to an evaluation of its preferences in both U P A and U P M . The preference evaluation of LA j is computed as LP C LA j = (Order U P A (LA j )+2×Order U P M (LA j ))/3. Learners' marking behaviors are given higher weights.</p><p>• LP F . It is the predictive preference set for learners. LP F = {LP F LA j |j ∈ [1, m]}, it is obtained by analyzing the LOs which are not directly operated by learners. The LOs which have the same attribute are extracted to compute the tendency. Three factors influence this perception parameter, the position changes in EP V , ESV and EC3. EC3 is an LO candidate cluster with the attribute</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">EC = 3. LP F LA j = ω∈{EP V,ESV,EC3}</formula><p>Order ω (LA j ). Order ω (LA j ) refers to the sum of the order of LA j in ω set.</p><p>• LOP . It is an ordered LO set which records LO's potential to be selected.</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">LOP = {LOP li |i ∈ [1, n]}, LOP li = ω∈{EP,ES,EP A} Order ω (l i ).</formula><p>• Environmentperceptionmodule. It is the optimal LO clusters, LC = {lc 1 , . . . , lc i , . . . , lc k }. The LOs in lc j is a sub-set in LC. The LOs belong to the intersection of elements in both both SC and CC. For example, {l 3 , l 7 } belongs to SC and CC, therefore, {l 3 , l 7 } is an element in LOR.   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4</ref> is the diagram describing the recommendation environment, and it is also a demo explaining the self-organization behaviors of LOs (seeing 4.3.1). In such a two-dimensional environment, the central square indicates a learner, also, its position is fixed. LOs are represented as colorful circles. LOs' positions are initialized using cell automatic machine theory. The learner is surrounded by layers of LOs. The LOs which belong to the layer nearest to the learner have the highest priority when being selected. In the same layer, the priority is set from high to low clockwise.</p></div>

Then learner's learning behavior causes the changes of learning environment, thus the self-organization of resources is triggered. The LO that learner is studying is initialized as an active LO. At the beginning, the neighbors in same LOR with the active LO are influenced first. Their similarity to the active LO and their latent quality in LOP are the criteria to decide their behaviors. Under given conditions, these neighbors may move according to certain rules. The moving LOs transmit the information to their new neighbors in LOR.

The evaluation strategies and the experiment results are discussed in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Effectiveness and Efficiency</head><p>The effectiveness and efficiency of the recommendation strategies are evaluated by analyzing some basic data, such as resource utilization, learners' scores, and learning time <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1.">Score Evaluations</head><p>The average score (M ean) reflects the overall knowledge level of the group. The standard deviation (Std.D) reflects the difference of the group.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> lists the results of the VB experiment. The M ean of the Self group is slightly higher than in the other groups (the Self group refers to the learners who use Self-based recommender system).</p><p>The Std.D of the Self group is correspondingly lower than the other groups. It indicates that the Self group can effectively improve the knowledge level of all the students. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> lists the results of the C experiment. It can be seen that the M ean in P art2 do not achieve better scores than P art1. This is mainly because the test in P art2 is more difficult than P art1. The CV16 group which applied the Self approach in P art2 obtains slightly higher M ean results, also, its Std.D is obviously lower than in P art1.</p><p>It shows that compared with GA and M C, Self performs better in helping learners decreasing standard deviation and ensuring good effectiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M</head><p>A N U S C R I P T The average learning time is utilized to evaluate the efficiency of recommendation strategies. Generally, efficient recommender systems are expected to help learners accomplish their learning goals in a relatively short time. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref> lists the results of the VB experiment. In it, the T RL refers to the total length of suggested time of recommended LOs, and the T imeP refers to the ratio between the length of time that learners actually spent and the T RL. As for the Tra, T RL means the total length suggested time of the LOs that learners selected first.</p><p>Through the comparisons of the T RL results, it is found that the T RL of the Self group is significantly lower than that of the other two algorithm groups. MC performs better than GA. In addition, from the analysis of T imeP , it is clear that the actual length of the spent time by the Self group is only slightly higher than the length of the suggested time of recommended LOs. Specifically, the T imeP of SM in the Self group is 108%. This indicates the actual learning process of the Self group is highly consistent with learners' learning plans. As for the Tra group, the T RL shows that the students selected the LOs with the shortest time first, but the T imep indicates that they spent longer learning time than their expectations.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref> lists the results of the C experiment. Just as in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref>, the values of T imep in P art1 remain high, otherwise, the values of T imep in P art2 are lower than the T imep in P art1. It indicates  that, compared with the Tra, the other three approaches (Self, GA and MC) show better effectiveness in decreasing the learning time of learners. Further, by analyzing the results of T imep of P art2, we are surprised to find that CV16 has a value of 92%, not only is it lower than 100%, it is also lower than 108% in VB experiment. Considering the fact that the number of LOs in P art2 is larger than in SM, it is can be concluded that Self can achieve higher performance in providing accurate and suitable recommendations when faced with more massive amount of LOs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.3.">LO Utilization</head><p>LO utilization refers to the percentage of the recommended LOs out of the total candidate LOs. In recommender systems, the higher LO utilization means more LOs are recommended. Therefore, higher LO utilization is often combined with information overload. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">9</ref> it can be seen that the results of Self, GA, MC groups in C are lower than those in VB.</p><p>The Self has the lowest LO utilization in C, it shows that the recommendation approaches are better applied when there are more LOs.</p></div>

To make better comparison, the total learning time is mapped to a range of 0-1000 in the x-axis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>545</head><p>Based on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">10</ref>, it is can be seen that the values of the Self and MC groups are far lower than that of GA and Tra groups. MC performs a distinct downward trend at the back part of their curves. However, the Self reaches a stable state earlier than the other three approaches. In addition, the curve of the Self group approach decreases sharply, and it does not fall into local optimum. The results show that the Self can provide suitable LOs to learners with a small margin of matching error. As for the Tra, the curve is fluctuating and it does not show a significant convergence trend. This indicates that the students in the Tra group have a lower ability than other groups in adapting to their dynamic demands.</p><p>(2) Hit rate evaluation In order to test whether the recommended LOs can appropriately suit learners' learning styles well, the hit rate of recommendations is analyzed. Hit rate refers to the proportion of recommended results which are consistent with learners' top preferences in LP C. We take content preference as an example.</p><p>All the participants in both VB and C experiments are divided into four sub-groups, that is, T heoryG, T estG, ExplanationG and ExampleG. For example, students in the T heoryG sub-group have the same first preference for the theory attribute. First, learners' current content preferences in LP C are taken as the references. The hit rates for different content attributes in these four sub-groups are recorded and shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">11</ref>. Second, the hit rates for predictive preferences in the Self group are denoted as Self-p in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">11</ref>. As for Self-p, the predictive preferences in LP F are used as the statistical data.</p><p>From the statistical data, it is found that, compared with the recommendations from the GA and MC groups, the recommendations from the Self show higher consistency with the preferences in LP C. Self-p has even higher hit rate than that in the Self. The Self approach is able to tailor to learners' demands and provide high accurate and predictive recommendations.</p><p>(3) Marking evaluation Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13</ref> list the proportion of learners who marked LOs with Ignore in these two experiments. LOs which are marked with Ignore will not appear in the candidate queue again. It is interesting that in these two figures, the marking proportions of the Tra group are the highest. This means that learners are still willing to achieve their learning goals with smaller LOs. The marking proportions in the Self group are 3.4% and 4.1% in VB and C respectively. The values are lower than other groups.</p><p>Combining the results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">9</ref>, we conclude that Self approach is able to recommend less but more experiments. When learners feel that the recommended LO cannot match their preferences, they mark it by Later in order to temporarily avoid this LO. However, the LO still has the chance of being selected by the learner. Comparing Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13</ref>, we can see that learners' Later marking proportions are higher than the Ignore proportions. This shows that learners are more cautious when making Ignore. Alternatively, when learners encounter an unsmooth learning experience, they do not easily give up the LOs that may be useful. It is also clear the marking proportions of Self, GA, and MC groups decrease distinctly. Recommender systems are effective to ensure learners' learning experiences.</p><p>Learners give lower marking proportions when using the Self approach due to their high recognition for the recommendations.   The method for measuring the diversity in Top-N recommendation is applied here <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. The diversity of recommendations is calculated according to whether the LO distribution in recommendations is balanced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2.">Objective Evaluation on Diversity</head><p>Since the item characteristic-based diversity function can be regarded as a complementary for similarity measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, the non-centralized distribution of attributes can be treated an expression of diversity.</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">DI(R) = (1/(|R| * (|R| − 1))) * i∈R j∈R,j =i div(l i , l j )<label>(12)</label></formula><p>R is the LO set of recommendations for a specific learner and its size is |R|. We compute div(l i , l j ) as the complement of sim(l i , l j ), where the similarity between l i and l j is computed with the consideration of LOs' basic attributes. These attributes include the content attribute, media attribute, difficulty, and the importance level. sim(l i , l j ) is given referring to equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</p><p>Generally, improving the diversity is often accompanied with a decrease in accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. In this study, the analysis of diversity is also based on accuracy. The fitness values shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">10</ref> are first converted to a reciprocal (1/F ) and then they are mapped as the precision of the recommendations. Then the relationship between accuracy and diversity is recorded in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">16</ref>. It is noticed that the diversity of recommendations from the Self group does not change a lot. In other words, it still maintains a higher diversity value compared to the MC and GA. The high adaptability and the bottom-up recommendation strategy ensure that the diversity of recommendations is maintained with non-significant decreases in precision.</p><p>(2) Novelty evaluation Inspired by the popularity-based novelty method which measures the unexpectedness of an object relative to its global popularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, the novelty of the recommendations is evaluated with the percentage of long-tail items among the recommendations across all users <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>. In this study, taking the similarity of learners and LOs as the basis for matching, we consider 40% of low matching items as long-tail items.</p><p>The statistics are about the percentage of LOs being recommended from the long-tail LO sets. The long-tail LO sets are grouped based on different attributes, that is, importance, difficulty, media, and content.</p><p>The statistical results of novelty proportions in VB experiment are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">17</ref>. We focus on the results of Concept first. Both the Self and Tra groups have higher proportions than the other two groups, which indicates that learners are positive about considering the other concepts. In addition, the Self provides possibility of triggering such expectation. As for Dif f iculty, learners in the Tra group like to stick to their difficult preferences. However, the Self recommends more LOs with different levels of difficulty. This owes to the environment perception module with it learners' ability changes can be quickly captured and predicted, hence, the recommendations are more adaptive. It is unexpected that learners in the Tra group like to learn LOs with different attributes in Content and M edia. Maybe it is because learners feel interesting in trying other attributes in Content and M edia. However, the Self shows a lower proportion of these two attributes. The results of the C experiment are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_26">18</ref> which show conclusions similar to the VB experiment.</p><p>The marking evaluations being considered, the Self group marked little for the recommendations. It can be seen that although learners in the Tra group show a preference for high novelty in Content and M edia, they are more likely to be attracted by the novelty of Content and Dif f iculty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.3.">Subjective Evaluation</head><p>When the learners finished the learning process, they were invited to complete a questionnaire designed to evaluate the learners' learning experience. The constituents and the results of the questionnaire are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">9</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">10</ref>. The ratings of each question range from 1 to 5 (1-Very unsatisfied, 2-Unsatisfied, 3-Fair, 4-Satisfied, 5-Very satisfied). For example, if the learner rates 5 on Dif f iculty, it means he is very satisfied with the difficulty of the recommendations.</p><p>The questionnaire results in the VB experiment are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">9</ref>. The first part of the questionnaire is P ersonal satisf action evaluation, which aims to obtain learners' evaluations on the difficulty, media type, content sequence, and learning time. The Tra group rated high scores in the first three terms, which reflects that learners are satisfied with their selections. As for T ime, the Self performs better than the GA and MC, while the Tra group received the lowest ratings. The main reason is that the first three approaches are capable of balancing learners' diverse demands with the massive LOs. The accuracy of  the proposed approach is proven by the results.</p><p>The second part evaluates learner's learning feelings. We apply the four dimensions test of Trevino and Webster which includes control, attraction focus, curiosity, and intrinsic interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. The Self group receives noticeably higher scores in flow experience, which indicates that the learners were immersed 640 and engrossed in the learning process. The Self group also significantly outperforms the other groups in Attention f ocus and Curiosity, which is attributed to the randomness and probability mechanisms included in the self-organization approach. The diversity of the proposed approach has been proven by this part of the questionnaires.</p><p>The third part evaluates the dynamic interactive ability of the recommendation systems by analyzing  whether the recommended LOs are relevant to the learners' knowledge level, especially when it comes to strengthening the weak abilities. As a whole, the Self received higher evaluations. The Self performs well in interactive flexibility, and its recommendations are consistent with learners' domain weaknesses.</p><p>Learners' satisfaction also denotes their acceptance of the predictive and adaptive recommendations.</p><p>Of course, although the interactive information is generated in a self-organized way, the environment perception module plays an important role in capturing and predicting the real time demands of learners in the Self group. The adaptability of the proposed approach has been well proved.</p><p>Finally, the learners rated the recommendation systems with Overall satisf action. The ratings show that the Self is greatly approved by the learners in VB experiment.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">10</ref> shows the results of the C experiment. We first focus on Overall satisf action. Although learners highly rated the Self approach, it is found that learners in the C experiment tend to give low ratings. Under this situation, learners in the Self group also rated higher scores on the Dif f iculty, T ime, Control, Intrinsic interest and Enhancing learning f lexibility. This proves learners' high recognition for the Self.</p></div>

The LO utilization of the Tra group in C is computed by analyzing the three groups' learners' profiles of P art1.The results of F M and SM show that the LO utilization in the Self group are slightly lower than the MA and GA groups. Especially, the LOs' quantity in the Self group becomes lower in SM . It can be seen that the Self can satisfy learners' goals with fewer LOs, and it has the ability to reduce the similar resources in recommendations. It can also be observed that the Tra group obtains the lowest LO utilizations in SM and C.

For the MC, entropy is related to the transfer probability of states.</p><p>When the recommended LOs reach a stable state for the first time, the average computation time (Ave time) and average entropy (Ave entropy) are recorded. The results of the VB experiment are shown in Table <ref type="table">11</ref>. In terms of Ave time, it is noticed that the value of the Self is faster than that of the other algorithms. Moreover, the Ave time of GA and MC groups increases when faced with large scale problems; however, the Self does not show large differences. This demonstrates that the Self approach has obvious advantages in large scale problems. The lower average entropy of the Self approach shows that it can reach a stable state more quickly.</p><p>In order to conduct further analysis of the Self, the system entropy of the Self approach is calculated at equal time interval. Four concepts from F M , SM , P art1, and P art2 are selected to make the entropy evaluations. They are Input and output in F M , Loop structure in SM , Sequence structure in P art1 and Array in P art2. The quantities of these four numbers are 82, 185, 274 and 332, respectively. We aim to evaluate the entropies of different problem scales. The results are listed in Fig. <ref type="figure">19</ref>. The entropies of all these concepts show a clear downward trend. This is because that the information transmission is very frequent at the beginning of the learning process. When self-organization behaviors continue, the frequency of information transmission decreases. This implies that the positions of LOs are relatively fixed. In addition, with larger number of LOs, the entropy shows a distinct downward trend. This also indicates that the Self approach has the ability to adapt to larger scale problems. The adaptability and quick performances of the self-organization based strategy are highly proven by the entropy evaluations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.2.">Self-organization evolution evaluation</head><p>The self-organization process is evaluated through variations in LOs' ranking. When implementing the self-organization recommendation systems, the learner is represented as a blue square, and is located in the central part of the environment. The candidate LOs are designated by colorful dots, randomly placed in the environment. The higher the matching degree, the more similar the LO's color becomes to the learner's color.  In future work, more case studies will be used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach,</p><p>especially in massive open online courses (MOOCs). Furthermore, we will study the recommender systems based on learners' self-organization behaviors, Finally, we will devote to finding a way to combine LO self-organization and learner self-organization to provide personalized recommendations is also a key issue.</p></div>			</div>
