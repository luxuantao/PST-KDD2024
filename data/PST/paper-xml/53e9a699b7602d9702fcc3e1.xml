<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>For the discovery of similar patterns in 1D time-series, it is very typical to perform a normalization of the data (for example a transformation so that the data follow a zero mean and unit standard deviation). Such transformations can reveal latent patterns and are very commonly used in datamining applications. However, when dealing with multidimensional time-series, which appear naturally in applications such as video-tracking, motion-capture etc, similar motion patterns can also be expressed at different orientations. It is therefore imperative to provide support for additional transformations, such as rotation. In this work, we transform the positional information of moving data, into a space that is translation, scale and rotation invariant. Our distance measure in the new space is able to detect elastic matches and can be efficiently lower bounded, thus being computationally tractable. The proposed methods are easy to implement, fast to compute and can have many applications for real world problems, in areas such as handwriting recognition and posture estimation in motion-capture data. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the technique, using real and synthetic handwriting data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Advances in wireless communication, sensor devices and GPS technology make it possible nowadays to collect large amounts of trajectory data. A trajectory is a set of positional information of a moving object, ordered by time. Examples include tracking animals, gathering human motion data by tracking various body joints, or tracing the evolution of migrating particles in biological sciences. In fact, multidimensional trajectory data are prevalent in many fields such as environmental information systems, meteorology, wireless technology, video tracking, or video motion capture.</p><p>An important problem in such applications is designing techniques for identifying trajectories that are similar. Such techniques can be used to cluster sets of trajectories, to in-dex sets of trajectories so that nearest neighbor queries can be executed efficiently, and to classify new trajectories given a set of examples.</p><p>While the design of distance functions between trajectories has been considered in recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref>, none of these techniques consider similarity measures that are rotation invariant. In many applications, a similarity measure that is immune to rotation effects is desirable. To illustrate this, consider a hand-writing recognition application, where each letter is represented by a two-dimensional trajectory. In this application, we are interested in classifying a new trajectory, given a set of letter examples. For example, all the trajectories in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> represent the same letter, so they should be considered similar to one another. However, none of the currently proposed techniques can tackle the problem effectively, primarily because they are not capable of eliminating the rotation component from the similarity calculations.</p><p>In this paper we seek distance measures for trajectories that are invariant under rotations. Furthermore, we seek distance functions that are efficient to compute, so that operations such as clustering and indexing for nearest neighbor calculations do not suffer from performance penalties. Our main contributions are the following:</p><p>First, we present a distance measure that allows us to find similar trajectories under translation, scaling and rotational transformations. We adapt techniques developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> to first map each trajectory to a trajectory in a rotation invariant space. We extend the robustness of this work by introducing a novel iterative modulo normalization technique. The distance of two trajectories in the new rotation invariant space, is computed using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). We show that the resulting distance measure is robust under the desired family of transformations (translation, rotation, scaling), and moreover, is very efficient to compute. We provide experimental evidence to demonstrate the accuracy of our distance measure.</p><p>Second, we give a new technique for lower-bounding our distance measure. Our lower-bounding is a general technique for lower-bounding the DTW distance, and is therefore of independent interest. We compare our technique with recent efforts on this problem, and show that our approach is efficient and more accurate than previously known techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">RELATED WORK</head><p>The problem that we examine in this paper is related to problems studied in the areas of pattern recognition and computer vision, such as testing for congruence of point sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5]</ref>, which is a fundamental (and still open) problem in computer vision. Also related to this general area are prob- lems in medical image registration <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>, and geometric hashing <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Past Present (a) (b) (c) (d) (e)</formula><p>Inspired by the work of Cohen and Guibas <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>, we use the turning angle transformation as our invariant matching signature. The work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> deals with planar lines (and not trajectories), where the x-y position of two dimensional line shapes are transformed into an angle/arc-length space. The partial (subsequence) matching problem, is solved by a line sweep algorithm in a scale-shift plane and guarantees scale, translation and rotation invariance. This comes at a high cost of O(m 2 n 2 ) time complexity for lines of length m and n respectively. Moreover, while this method can handle global scaling, there is no support for local scaling. Compared to other methods based on algebraic moments, curvature <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> and Hausdorff distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>, the turning angle has been shown to be the most robust for the retrieval of two dimensional images and shapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Rotation Invariant Transformations</head><p>It is difficult to design distance measures that are invariant to rotation using positional information directly. Instead, we use a modification of a technique by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> to map the trajectories to a space that is more amenable to this purpose. We briefly describe the technique below:</p><p>We define the movement vector V at time t as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Vt = Pt -Pt-1, t = 1, . . . , n -1</formula><p>We extract the angles of each movement vector relative to a reference movement vector V ref . This reference vector is the positive x-axis or vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">0]</ref>. In other words, we calculate how much is the acute rotation angle that is required to align the vector V ref to the direction of the current movement vector Vt.</p><p>The acute angle α between these two vectors is computed utilizing the dot product as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">αt = Vt = sign • cos -1 ( &lt; Vt, V ref &gt; Vt • V ref )</formula><p>and &lt; •, • &gt; signifies the vector dot product. However, the dot product does not specify the direction of the rotation, which is denoted by sign. (e.g., clockwise or counterclockwise). This information is obtained using the direction of the cross product between Vt and V ref , by examining whether it spans towards the positive or the negative z-axis. For 2D trajectories the sign is calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">sign = 1 if ([Vt × V ref ] • [0 0 1] T ) &gt; 0 -1 if ([Vt × V ref ] • [0 0 1] T ) &lt; 0</formula><p>In addition to the angle of each movement vector we also record its Euclidean length L (arc length). Therefore, we have transformed the spatial coordinates of a trajectory into a sequence of Angle/Arc-Length pairs. We call this new transformed space, AAL space and figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref> shows how the AAL representation of a 2-dimensional trajectory is computed.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">PAAL = [( V1, V1 ), . . . , ( Vn-1, Vn-1 )]</formula><p>We also consider different approaches to define the reference vectors required by the AAL transformation. As a reference vector, instead of the positive x-axis (which we call exact angles), one could use other vectors as well. In this work we also consider the following:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Angle Relative to Previous (relative angles):</head><p>V</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">ref = Pt-1 -Pt-2</formula><p>The problem with this approach is that small differences in the angles can be compounded in the original trajectory, resulting to a large deviation between two sequences, while the distance in the AAL space remains small.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Angle Relative to center of Mass (cMass angles):</head><p>The center of mass is defined as the average of the different locations of the object over time:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">PcMass = 1 n [ n px,n, n py,n] and V ref = Pt-1 -PcMass</formula><p>In the experimental section we show that both exact and cMass angles, have good robustness under real or synthetic datasets. The relative angles perform well for the synthetic ones, but for real datasets their performance degrades rapidly.</p><p>Representation of trajectories in the new space offers significant advantages over the spatial representation, because it is translation invariant. Additionally when we are computing exact angles from a reference vector, rotation of a trajectory by θ degrees this will result in a shifted pattern by θ degrees in the AAL space. Finally, scale invariance can be accomplished by dividing the arc length of each movement vector by the total arc length of the trajectory.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">PAAL = [( V1, V1 i Vi ), . . . , ( Vn-1, Vn-1 i Vi )]</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">ITERATIVE MODULO NORMALIZATION</head><p>After the transformation of the x-y position of the trajectories into the angle/arc-length space (using the exact angles), similar but rotated trajectories will depict analogous patterns in the new space. However, the patterns may differ by some amount of vertical shift according to their orientation. To create a rotation invariant transformation we normalize the transformed sequences. A simple normalization would be to subtract the average angle value. This, nonetheless, is not sufficient because this average value can be significantly distorted. For example, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> shows two similar (but not identical) 2D trajectories. Their similarity is more prevalent if the darker one is rotated clockwise by around 70 o . The patterns in the AAL space appear very similar but they are distant by a vertical shift corresponding to 70 o in the angle axis. Additionally, one can observe that some sections of the 2nd trajectory appear very noisy in the AAL space. This is attributed to the fact that certain consecutive movement vectors can oscillate around the π angle. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> demonstrates the two feature patterns when the average angle value is subtracted from both trajectories. Obviously, an even better matching can be found (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</p><p>For this purpose we introduce an iterative normalization procedure. The pseudo-code of the algorithm is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> and it performs two basic steps: These phases are repeated a certain number of times or until stability. For simplicity in all our experiments we iterate the normalization steps five times, which proves to be more than adequate for achieving stability.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">SUPPORT FOR ELASTIC MATCHING</head><p>Using the previous transformations we have addressed the issues of translation, rotation and scaling. However, in order for the two patterns in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> to be matched effectively it is necessary to provide support for local compressions and decompressions in the arc-length axis. To accomplish that we use a warping distance measure in the AAL space.</p><p>The most widely used measure that supports local compressions and decompressions is Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref>. In order to utilize the DTW one assumes that the measurement values (in this case the angles), are taken at discrete and equi-spaced time instances  (arc lengths for our case), which we achieve this by resampling/interpolating the sequence of angle/arc-length pairs. If Q = (Q1, Q2, . . . , Qn) and Head(Q) = (Q1, Q2, . . . , Qn-1) (and similarly for a sequence T ) then the recursive equation to provide then warping distance between Q and T is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">DT W (Q, T ) = D(Qn, Tn) + min    DT W (Head(Q), Head(T )) DT W (Head(Q), T ) DT W (Q, Head(T ))</formula><p>where D(•, •) is the distance between two points of the sequence. Typically, D is the Euclidean distance, but it can be any distance complying to the requirements of a specific application. In our setting of this problem we use a different distance function in the warping definition. We call the new distance Dwarp and we use it to mitigate the potential wrap-around effect of the turning angles:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Dwarp(Qi, Ti) = min |Qi -Ti| 2π -|Qi -Ti|</formula><p>The DTW distance can be computed using a well known dynamic programming algorithm in O(n 2 ) time for sequences of length n.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">APPROXIMATING THE DTW</head><p>Since the O(n 2 ) complexity of DTW quickly becomes a bottleneck for large datamining tasks, one can reduce the warping scope within a matching region of δ 2 effectively reducing the complexity into O(δn). This simplification is realistic for most real applications and in many cases it can also improve accuracy by limiting the number of degenerate matchings 3 .</p><p>We revisit some of the most recent DTW lower bounds. The work of Keogh <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> instigated an enhanced interest in the Warping Distance, by introducing a new tight lower bound, called LB-Keogh. The idea is based on the notion of the Minimum Bounding Envelope (MBE), which records the areas of possible matching, when local displacement is constrained within a region δ. The MBE of a sequence Q 2 That is, allow matchings between two points if they are δ points apart. 3 Typical values for δ are 20 -30% of n. consists of the area defined between the upper envelope U and the lower envelope L and their values at position i is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Li = min(Q i-δ , . . . , Q i+δ ), Ui = max(Q i-δ , . . . , Q i+δ )</formula><p>The author further showed that this lower bounding function can be indexed, by introducing a reduced dimensionality version of it called LB -P AA, which is illustrated in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>. This is achieved by creating a simplified representation of the query MBE and all database sequences, by converting them into k equi-length Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs) <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">4</ref> . Each of the k MBRs of Q consists of a tuple, [qi,L, qi,U ] with values:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">MBRi(Q) = qi,L = min(L n k (i-1)+1 , . . . , L n k i ) qi,U = max(U n k (i-1)+1 , . . . , U n k i</formula><p>) When segmenting any database sequence T into MBRs, using the above equation we can essentially consider that Ui = Li = Ti.</p><p>The lower bound distance LB-PAA is the distance between the MBRs of the query envelope (MBR(MBE(Q))) and the MBRs of T (MBR(T )), which is shown in gray vertical lines in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>). Extensions of the MBE for multidimensional sequences and introduction of new upper bounds have appeared in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> Zhu and Shasha, improved on the previous idea, by leveraging the lower bounding property of the PAA representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. The PAA approximation is a simple and effective dimensionality reduction technique, that converts a sequence of length n into k equi-length segments, that record average values of the original sequence. That is P AA(Q) = (q1, q2, . . . , qk ), where :</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">qi = k n n k i j= n k (i-1)+1</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Qj</head><p>Similarly as before, the MBE of the query Q is constructed, however both the envelope (U &amp; L) and any other sequence T are approximated by their PAA representation. The new lower bound, LB-Zhu, is essentially the distance between P AA(MBE(Q)) and P AA(T ). A schematic representation is given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">A New Lower Bound Technique for DTW</head><p>The envelope-based approaches are fast to compute, however the tightness of the lower bound diminishes for large warping lengths (that is, when the parameter δ becomes too large). This happens because the bounding envelope becomes very wide.</p><p>We propose a different approach for approximating the DTW. In order to minimize the impact of δ (the width of the bounding envelope), we use only approximations of the query sequence Q and the database sequence T . We compute the Minimum Bounding Rectangle approximation of the query sequence Q (MBR(Q)), and the PAA approximation of a sequence T in the database, P AA(T ). The distance between the segments MBRi(Q) = [qi,L, qi,U ] and P AAj(T ) = tj is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Dseg (MBR i (Q), P AA j (T )) =    k × ∆(q i,L , tj ), if qi,L &gt; tj k × ∆(q i,U , tj ) if qi,U &lt; tj 0 o t h e r w i s e</formula><p>∆ can be any distance such as the squared Euclidean or, in our case, the Dwarp distance which mitigates the wraparound effects.</p><p>LB-Warp = 29.0621 In order to lower bound the warping distance between Q, T we just need to run a DTW computation on the approximations, using Dseg as the base distance function. We call this lower bound LB -W arp. Additionally, the warping length needs to be modified. If the original warping computation allowed matching within δ points (out of n), it has to be modified now to δ( k n ) . Therefore the running complexity is reduced from O(nδ), to O(k δ( k n ) ). In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref> we give an example of how the new bound is computed; no envelope is computed around the query sequence (compare with Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>), but the approximation segments of the two sequences can be matched with neighboring segments.</p><p>We can state the following lemma:</p><p>Lemma 1. (Lower Bounding Lemma): Given trajectories Q and T of length n and warping length δ, and their approximations of length k, MBR(Q) and P AA(T ) the following inequality holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">LB -W arp δ( k n ) (MBR(Q), P AA(T )) ≤ DT W δ (Q, T )</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">EXPERIMENTS</head><p>We show the rotation invariance of the new measures, using a real dataset obtained through a graphic tablet, where the x-y position of the stylus is recorded over time (tablet real dataset). This dataset contained 90 two-dimensional time-series, a subset of which is shown is Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>. Based on the tablet real dataset, we created also a synthetic dataset, using a single orientation of each tablet stroke and creating three additional copies by rotating the template at random angles between [-90 . . . + 90 o ] (tablet synthetic) This dataset is used as a sanity check, to examine possible performance deviations between synthetic and real datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Classification Accuracy</head><p>We have conducted a leave-one-out Nearest Neighbor classification scheme, in order to measure the classification accuracy of the rotation invariant distance measures. We observe that the Exact Angles (all angles are with respect to a reference direction) and the cMass Angles techniques are both very accurate. The performance of the Relative Angles approach is good for synthetic data, however only Exact and cMass Angles give good accuracy for real data. This example indicates (once more) the great discrepancy that can exist in the performance of an algorithm between synthetic and real datasets.</p><p>In fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">12</ref> we show a 2D mapping of 40 handwritten strokes based on their pairwise distances. The position of the symbols on 2D plane, is derived using ISOMAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, which represents an improved implementation of Multidimensional Scaling. The spatial proximity in 2D of the rotated versions of the same symbol, indicates that the new representation is very robust to rotation transformations.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Pruning Power of the LB-Warp</head><p>Using the sequences of the tablet real dataset as seeds, we generated datasets with larger cardinality (1000, 2000, 4000 and 8000) for testing the scalability and pruning power of the new lower bound.</p><p>We evaluate the pruning power of the lower bounds, using a scheme not affected by implementation details. We accomplish this by measuring the number of raw sequences retrieved from disk, in order to find the 1-Nearest-Neighbor (1NN) to a given query, averaged over 50 queries.</p><p>We observe that the new lower bound represents a significant enhancement over the previous approaches. For certain queries we may examine up to 35 times fewer sequences than LB-Keogh and up to 15 times fewer sequences compared to LB-Zhu (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">15</ref>). In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">14</ref> we report the cumulative time for returning the 1NN for 50 queries. This time includes the lowerbound distance calculation as well as the time to find the 1NN and the experiment is conducted for increasing dataset sizes. We observe that LB -W arp outperforms all previous approaches. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Transformations supported by our representation.
