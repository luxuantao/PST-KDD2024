<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We propose measurements and approximations to describe the variability of offered traffic to a queue (i.e., the variability of the arrival process together with the service requirements), and predict the average workload in the queue (which is assumed to have a single-server, unlimited waiting space, and a work-conserving service discipline). The principal traffic measurement considered is a normalized version of the variance of the total input of work as a function of time, which we call the index of dispersion for work (IDW). Given ample traffic data, the IDW can easily be estimated using sample averages. Given a mathematical model, such as a multiclass queue in which each class has G//C/7 offered traffic, the lDW can often be calculated analytically, or approximated by exploiting limits as t + 0 and t + CO. Our basic premise is that the average workload is primarily determined by the offered traffic, beyond the offered load (the deterministic rate work arrives), through the IDW. In this paper we provide support for this premise and indicate how the average workload can be predicted from the IDW or basic model parameters.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY</head><p>Our purpose is to gain a better understanding of complicated queueing systems(and thusalargeclassof discrete event systems). We consider only one queue with a singleserver, unlimited waiting space and exogenous input, but the queue might be one queue in a network. The problem is that there may becomplicated offered traffic, e.g., several classes with different service requirements and non-Poisson arrival processes. To better understand the offered traffic (the arrival process together with the service requirements), and the resulting congestion in a queue t o which it is offered, we propose traffic measurements and simple approximations. To a large extent, the measurements can be applied without specifying a detailed probability model. O n the other hand, for a large class of models, approximations can be obtained for the principal performance measure considered here (the average workload) from basic model parameters, without measurements. <ref type="bibr">April 19,1988;</ref><ref type="bibr">revised September 19,1988</ref> </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Measurements to Describe the Variability o f the Offered Traffic</head><p>The measurements we propose are intended to describe the variability of the offered traffic, because the variability of the offered traffic, appropriately defined, is a primary determinant of performance. We wish to capture the variability of individual interarrival and service times, but also the variability resulting from dependence among these variables. In the context of the growing literature o n traffic measurements <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[44]</ref>, our contribution i s to suggest new measurements that hopefully will provide additional insight intotheoffered traffic and itseffect on performance. We attempt to link traffic measurements more closely to performance analysis.</p><p>The main measurement we propose for the offered traffic is theindexofdispersion forwork(1DW). Let X(t) be the total work i n service time to enter the queue during the time interval [0, t]. The IDW is the function of time where 7 i s the average service time, var is the variance, and €is theexpectation. We typically consider equilibrium conditions, underwhich {X(t): t &gt; 0 ) has stationary increments with € [ X ( t ) ] = p t , where p is the offered load or traffic intensity. Then the IDW is just a scaled version of var [ X ( t ) ] , the variance-timecurveof X(t). From ample data, the IDW i s easy to estimate using sample averages; e.g., we can estimate €[X(gk] from a sample path of the total input process by mk(t) = n-' 2: [X(t + s,) -x(s,)lk</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">n (2) - , = I</formula><p>from n times points 0 I s, &lt; s2 &lt; . . . &lt; s, (or the associated integral) and var [X(t)] byE2(t) -E,(OL. (The statistical precision of the estimate can be an important issue, but we do not discuss it here.) When the service times are i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) and independent of the arrival process, the IDW essentially reduces to the relatively familiar index 0018-921918910100-0171$01 00 1989 IEEt ot ciispersmn tor c o ~i n t ~ (IDC) of the arrival process alone, \CY' Section Ill-B and 159) below Thus, in many applications the IL)\V\\iII be describing the arrival process alone How-e\c'r,n hen the independenceconditionsdonot hold, itcan tic, important t o consider the IDW instead of the IDC, see 1 L 41 -[ L h] 12e \uggest using the IDW and similar traffic measure-ment&gt; to better understand queueing networks From the ID\% \\\e ran see the variability in the otfered traffic t o each queue irom IDW measurements at several queues we can see hon the network topology and other model features attvct \ariabilitv and performance</p><p>In thi\ paper, we provide theoretical support for IDW measurements and approximations and give a few examples \le intend to di5cuss actual measurements in other pJpPr5 We discu5s IDW measurements and approxima-tion\ tor a multiclass packet queue in <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref> Elbewhere, L X C intend todescribc IDWmeasurementsofthearrival proe s at each queue ot several queues in series.

In particular, let RZ,,) denote the long-run average, or mean steady-state workload as a function of the offered load p when the mean service time i s r. Instead of E(Z,), we consider the normalized mean workload Even though cs(p) is a trivial modification of E(Z,), we contend that c : ( p ) is very useful t o see the impact of the variability i n the offered traffic o n the average workload. The normalization in (3) is veryconvenient for graphical display, in the spirit of Section 5.5.2 of <ref type="bibr">Allen [6]</ref> and Chapter 1 of Newell <ref type="bibr">[42]</ref>. The normalized workload ci(p) is a partial characterization of queue performance as a function of p , somewhat like the caudal characteristic curve introduced by Neuts <ref type="bibr">[41]</ref>.</p><p>Asafunction ofrandpalone,theaverageworkload might be described by the exact M / D / l value (assuming a Poisson arrival process and deterministic service times)</p><p>The normalized mean workload in (3) can be interpreted as the ratio of the given average workload to what it is in the M / D / l case, i.e., from (3) and (4), (Similarly, normalization with respect to the M / M / l queue are considered by <ref type="bibr">Burman and Smith (171.)</ref> We think of the M / D / l formula in (4) as describing the first-order rate effect of theoffered trafficon theaverageworkload, includingthe dramatic increase associated with (1 -p j -' as p + 1. We think of the normalized mean workload in (3) as describing the second-order variability effect of the offered traffic on the average workload. Indeed, in Section Il-D we use scaling arguments to show that the normalized mean workload in (3) is invariant under a change of the deterministic rates.</p><p>Thus, the performance measure ot interest is the normalized mean workload cj(pj in ( 3 ) as a function of p . We consider cs(p) as a function of p partly because we often want t o consider the performance of a queue at different traffic intensities. For example, we may want to consider how much traffic to offer to the queue. Alternatively, for a given offered traffic, we may want to consider different rates at which service may be performed. We primarily think of different traffic intensities resulting from relatively simple deterministic scaling of the rate of the arrival process or the service process, but it might occur i n more complicated ways. We suggest tocusing o n the normalized mean workload as a function of p , regardless of how it changes with p. Of course, it is important to properly represent the way the normalized mean workload does change with 0. When there is feedback or a control mechanism, the normalized mean workload and the IDW will often change with Q i n unanticipated ways. In this paper we assume that p changes by the relatively simple deterministic scaling. Even if we are only interested in one system with a given traffic intensity, considering thequeueasafunction o f p is useful todevelop approximations based o n light-traffic ( p + 0) and heavytraffic ( p + 1) limits.</p><p>Unlike theaverageworkload E(Z,), ci(p) typically has nondegenerate limits as P --t 0, and as p + 1. Indeed, for MiGI1 queues, the normalized mean workload i s constant, in particular, or D(deterministic1, cf(p) tends to decrease. Indeed, a rough two-moment approximation for c$p) in GliGil queues, which we develop in Section IV-AI, is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">~: ( p , GIIGII) z C: + 1 + p ( ~5 -1)<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where c i i s the squared coefficient of variation of an interarrival time.</p><p>The curves in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>  in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> are markedly nonlinear. Many different shapes are possible.</p><p>In order to predict how offered traffic will affect the average workload in a queue, it is natural to estimate the normalized mean workload directlyvia simulation (using either historical or randomly generated data), and indeed we suggestthisapproach in Section Il-C. However,wealsosuggest obtaining information about the normalized mean workload indirectly from the IDW, because the I D W is often much easiertoworkwith, especiallywith multiclassqueues. We also consider the IDW in addition to the normalized mean workload because we want to better understand how the offered traffic affects the normalized mean workload.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. A Special Relationship: The IDW and the Normalized Mean Workload</head><p>As a generalidea, we suggest using traffic measurements to gain insight into the variability of offered traffic, and the performance of a queue to which this traffic is offered. To support this general idea, we primarily consider only one traffic measurement, the I D W in (I), and only one performance measure, the normalized mean workload c$p) in (3). As a specific idea, we suggest using the I D W to gain insight into the normalized mean workload c?(p). The IDW may be useful more generally, but we contend that it is especially appropriate for predicting the normalized mean workload.</p><p>Wecontend thatc:(p) is primarilydetermined bythe IDW, so that it should be possible to predict c:(p) reasonablywell, given Q and { / J t ) : t z 0 ) . Assuming that { cf(p): 0 5 p 5 I } is obtained by deterministic scaling of the interarrival or service times, we contend that the two curves {cz(p): 0 5 p 5 I } and {lw(t): 0 I t I a} are very similar. For example, for two different queues, if one I D W i s always higher than the other, then we predict that the normalized mean workloads are similarly ordered. If the two IDWs are nearly the same, then we predict that the normalized mean workloads are nearly the same. Moreover, the actual values should be nearly the same. (These suggested relations are approximations. In Section V-c we construct several models with identical IDWs, but different normalized mean workloads. Nevertheless, approximating the normalized mean workload of one of these models by the normalized mean workload in another of these models is reasonable.) At this point it seems appropriate to explain why we might expect the two functions {cs(p): 0 5 p 5 I} and {/-,(tho 5 t 5 00 } to be related. For us, the starting point was the heavy-traffic diffusion process limit (discussed here in Section IV) (8) which follows from [24], 1251, [37], <ref type="bibr">[52]</ref>, or <ref type="bibr">[42]</ref>; i.e., it is known that c:(l) = /,\(a); the hcavy-traffic limit c;(l) depends o n the total input process of work only via the IDW, and that in this limit all the correlations play a role. However, it is apparent that a s p decreases from 1, distant correlations in the total input process of work should have less impact o n c ; ( ~) .</p><p>Roughlyspeaking, IJtjforagiven thasan impact upon c ; ( p ) tor a given p only if fluctuations in the offered traffic at time s have an impact upon the workload at time s + t at that p . I t the workload process hits zero before t i m e s + f , then this impact tends t o be gone, but otherwise not. (This assertion is rigorously justified when the zero state is a regeneration point for the model; otherwise, it is an approximation.) I n other words, correlations within busy periods should be more significant than correlations across busy periods, and higher p means longer busy periods.</p><p>An approximation tor c ; ( p ) suggested by this heuristic analysis and ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>  where C,,!,(t) is stochastically increasing with p , i.e., for any non d ec re as i ng rea I-va I u ed f u n c t i o n h , -% I I1 whenever p i &lt; P ? .

Further insight can be gained from the MiGil queue, for which /,,Jt) = cs(p) = c;' + 1 for a l l l a n d p; see ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and (60). More generally, using the IDW to approximate the normalized mean workload can be regarded as a consequence of a Levy process approximation for the net input process of work; see Sec- tion IV-C. This perspective is helpful because it does not depend on heavy-traffic or light-traffic limits.</p><p>Iim c i ( p j = cj(0j = /,,(o) = Iim /,,,(t)</p><p>,&gt; -0</p><p>1 -0</p></div>

The exact IDW formulas are given in Section Ill-G.) Also appearing in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> i s another approximation discussed below. The advantages of having /,(w) in ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) is not evident from Table <ref type="table">1</ref>; it is evident when /,(CO) is much higher, e.g., when it i s 77, as in the packet queue examples in <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper we restrict attention to deterministic timetransformation approximations of the form (9), but we recognize that the appropriate time transformation t ( p ) should ideally depend o n the IDW. Thus, in Section V we develop what we call a variability-fixedpoint approximation to obtain t ( p ) from Iw(t). To a large extent, this approach is motivated by the work of Newell, pp. <ref type="bibr">132-151 of [42] and [43]</ref>, although the specific approximation here seems to be new.</p><p>In particular, we propose approximation (9) where t(p) is determined by the fixed point equation t(p) = x ( p ) l , ( t ( p ) ) , 0 5 p I 1 (15) where x(p) i s an increasing function of p , such as X(P) = PIU -P ) .</p><p>( In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">3</ref> the variability fixed-point approximation is applied to two different IDW curves at the same p . Since IDW A has lower variability for small t than IDW 6, we contend that it $ appropriate to have the fixed points ordered by fA(p) &lt; tB(p) for all sufficiently small p . In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">3</ref>, we see that IDW A intersects the line t/x(p) three times, so that (15) can have multiple solutions. We avoid ambiguity by always selecting the minimal solution, but there is a fundamental difficulty when (15) has multiple solutions; then t(p) and I,(t(p)) are dikontinuous in p , whereas c;(p) should be continuous. The difficulty stems from approximating the mixing cdf G,(t) in (11) t o be a unit point mass. We could refine the approximation by smoothing the curve /,(t(p)) after applying (13), but here we just observe that multiple solutions to (15) signals a problem with the fixed-point approximation. In most applications, (15) should have a unique solution, at least for when p is not too small.</p><p>We also apply the fixed-point framework to develop approximationsforthederivativesc:(O) and c;(l)to usewith theendvalues in(8)and( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) in a light-trafficand heavy-traffic interpolation. A specific interpolation approximation for c;(p) given the four values cz(O), Cs(O), c:(I), and i-f(l) is developed in <ref type="bibr">[60]</ref>. The interpolation approximation has the form for 0 I p 5 1, where the coefficients a, and exponents b, depend o n the four limits c:(O), C;(O), cZ(l), and c:(l), but not p . This interpolation obviously avoids the discontinuity problem above. The parameters a, and b, are chosen so that the approximation and its first derivative are monotone whenever possible, and so that the second derivative is monotone whenever the first derivative cannot be monotone.</p><p>We express the derivatives  <ref type="formula">8</ref>)</p><p>and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(12)</ref>. InSectionV-Bweshowthat it isconvenienttowork with / , ( p ) in (18) instead of /,(t). Equation ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) is the basis for an approximate light-traffic and heavy-traffic interpolation, given only the asymptotic behavior of / , ( p ) as p -+ 0 and as p -+ 1. In support of (18), we show that the approximation for C:(O) i s correct for the GIIGII queue, and the approximation for cZ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">1</ref>) is correct for the GIIMII queue. Comparisons of the interpolation approximation based o n ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) with exact values for the H,IMII and E,/M/I models appear in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. For H,/M/l, (17) and (18) offer a substantial improvement. Indeed, all the approximations do remarkablywell for these examples. Unfortunately, the approximations are not always nearly so good (e.g., see Section VI), but overall, our numerical experience is encouraging. On the basis of performanceand simplicity, the leading candidates are the simple time transformation (9) with (13), and the interpolation approximation (17) and (18).</p><p>We became interested in new ways to approximate E(Z,,) and c;(p) because of difficult models, such as those having the normalized mean workloads displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. However, every model need not be so difficult. For example, we could have a queue with complicated dependence among the interarrival times and service times, but a measured IDW, as in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Our results lead us to predict (probably quite accurately) from such a relatively level IDW that the normalized mean workload in this case will be approximately the same as in an M/G/I queue, with c i + 1 = 5; i.e., in some applications, the behavior will be better than we might expect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Scaling</head><p>The functions c;(p) and /, <ref type="bibr">(t)</ref>  For such multiclass queues, heavy-traffic limit theorems have been established in <ref type="bibr">[ I l l , [37]</ref>, and [52] that yield relatively simple approximations for the mean steady-state workload, and other performance measures. Extensions to networks of queues with feedback have been established by <ref type="bibr">Reiman [48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Johnson [38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Peterson [45],</ref><ref type="bibr">and Harrison [33]</ref>. Unfortunately, however, for the models motivating this work (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[24]-[26]</ref>, and [51]), these heavy-traffic approximations are not accurate at typical design loads, so it is desirable to develop refinements. (At typical design loads, the heavy-traffic approximation can exceed the actual mean workload by a factor of ten or more; see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>  </p></div>

We could also have introduced a one-parameter family by scaling the service requirements, i.e., by replacing v, by pv,.

To make the characterization dimensionless (independent of the measuring units), it is natural to consider the squared coefficient of variation c$ = var (X)I(EX)2. (Note that cfx = ci.)The variability of a stochastic process { X ( t ) : t 2 0 ) is more complicated than the variability of a real-valued random variable, because it includes fluctuations over time due to the dependence among the different variables, as well as the variability of the individual variables X ( t ) for each t. Nevertheless, the variance and associated dimensionless normalizations are useful partial characterizations of the variability of a stochastic process. A natural generalization of the variance is the variance-time curve {var [X(t)]: t z 0 ) .</p><p>From what we have said, it is clear that in general the variance-time curve i s an unsatisfactory partial character-ization of the variabilityot the process { X ( t ) : t 2 0 ) because it only captures one torrn of the variability-the variability of the individual variables X ( t ) tor each t.

Combining (60) and (70), we obtain a convenient analytical approximation for the IDW in multiclass queues in which each class provides GIIGII offered traffic.</p><p>1v. THE IDW AND THE NORMALIZED MEAN WORKLOAD I n this section we investigate the basic premise of this paper-that the normalized mean workload c:(p) in (3) is primarily determined by the IDW of the offered traffic in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Indeed, we have observed that for the MIGIl queue that the IDW completely determines the normalized mean workload: c:(p) = /,(t) = c: + 1 for all p and t. Moreover, for Cl/M/I queues, the lDC, and thus the /OW, completely determines the normalized mean workload; i.e., from (59) and (62), we see that the IDC, and thus the IDW, completely determines thearrival-process renewal function H,(t), which in turn is well known to completely determine the interarrival-time distribution. However, for GIIGII queues in which neither the interarrival-time distribution nor the service-time distribution is exponential, the IDW does not completely determine the normalized mean workload, because from (59) and (62) we identify only the first two moments of the service time distribution. For general GI/G/I queues, it is well known that the average workload depends o n the service-time distribution beyond the first two moments. O n the other hand, it is also known that the average workload does not greatly depend on the servicetime distribution beyond the first two moments; see Table <ref type="table">Ill of [58]</ref> and<ref type="table">Tables 4-9</ref> of <ref type="bibr">Ramaswami and Latouche [47]</ref>.</p><p>(These tables describe other mean steady-state quantities, but they determine the mean workload via L = hW and Brumelle's formula, (72) below.)</p><p>To be specific about the scaling for the IDW, let {/,(t):</p><p>t 5: 0) be defined with respect to (X,(t): t 2 0) using the scaling in Section 11-A; i.e., €[X,(t)] = t, t 5: 0, for a stationary version.

Thus, as discussed in Section I-C, the main idea in this paper is that we should be able to use the IDW {lw(t): t 2 0) as a basis for approximating {cz(p): 0 5 p 5 I}. In fact, we contend that {c:(p): 0 &lt; p s 1) and {lw(t): t &gt; 0) contain roughly the same information, so that it should be possible to approximate either function reasonably well, given the other. This strengthened version of the main hypothesis supports using the normalized mean workload to approximately characterize an RMPP, as proposed in Section Il-C.</p><p>The strengthened version of the main hypothesis i s supported by (9), but not by (IO).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Light Traffic</head><p>I n this section we describe the limiting behavior of c:(p) as p -+ 0, and relate it to the limiting behavior of /,(t) as t -+ 0. The main positive result that we establish in this section is <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(12)</ref>. The derivatives at 0 are not so simply related, but they involve similar ingredients.</p><p>I ) The Normalized Mean Workload in Light Traffic: Experience has revealed that many performance measures depend on the fine structureof thequeueing model in light traffic. Indeed, recent light-traffic limits for the mean waiting time in the GllGIl queue established by Daley and Rolski [21] indicate that both the appropriate normalization, and the resulting nondegenerate limit depend o n the fine structure of the interarrival-time and service-time distributions. To briefly summarize their result, let P(u, &lt; t) = F(t) be the unscaled interarrival-time cdf. If there exists a &gt; 0 such that t-"F(t) -+ y, 0 &lt; y &lt; 03, as t + 0 and E ( v ~+ ~) &lt; 03, where v is a service time, then (with our scaling)</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">Iim ~-" E ( w , ) = E(v'+")~/(I + CY) (71)</formula><p>where W, is the steady-state waiting time as a function of p. As Daley and Rolski point out, (71) indicates limitations o n the possibility of developing simple robust approximations for the mean waiting time using light-traffic asymptotics. Even for the GI/G/I model, the light-traffic limit depends on the detailed behavior of the interarrival-time distribution near the origin, and possibly higher moments of the service-time distribution. I t is significant that the mean steady-state workload is much better behaved in this respect. This can be seen from Brumelle's [I61 general formula (not restricted to CI/G/I) relating the mean workload €(Z,) to the waiting time and the service time; see pp. where (c: + I) = E ( V ~) / ( € V ) ~.

Perhaps the main point is that ( <ref type="formula">74</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">75</ref>), and ( <ref type="formula">77</ref>) are much less delicate than (71), so that it is more reasonable to hope tor robust light-traffic approximations for the mean workload than for the mean waiting time.</p><p>Brumelle's formula (72) also produces the linear interpolation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">7</ref>) for G l i G i l queues when we apply the familiar waiting time approximation (79) Indeed, (72) provides a simple way to derive (79) from ci(0) = 1 + ct, cl(1) = c$ + c f and linear interpolation. From Brumelle's general formula (72), we immediately obtained the general form of ~$ 0 ) in ( <ref type="formula">74</ref>). The general form of the derivative c,(O) in ( <ref type="formula">75</ref>) is more complicated, but we can heuristically derive what it should be.

For related heuristic discussion, see Section 6.8of Newell [42].) As in Section I I-A, we assume that customers arrive one at a time. Consider the customer-stationary process, and let vo be the service time of the 0th customer, v -, be the service time of the ( -1)st customer, and uo the unscaled interarrival-time between these two customers.

However, to illustrate the possibilities, consider the multiclass queue in which the overall offered traffic is the superposition from independent sources. For each class, assume that the service times are i.i.d. and independent of the arrival process, but d o not require that each component arrival process be a renewal process. As above, we use the scaling in (19) with € ( U " ) = E(vo) = 1. Let p,,(t) be the conditional probability that customer -1 is class i, and customer 0 is class j given that ug = t, which we assume exists as a measurable function of t that i s continuous at t = 0.

For multiclass queues in which each class provides Gl/G/l input, we apply (60), and expressions for the IDC of a renewal process in Section Ill&amp;.

In this section we consider how. As indicated in Section I-C, l,(t) for a given t has an impact upon c:(p) for a given p only if fluctuations in the offered traffic at time s have an impact upon the workload at time s + t at that p. Moreover, if the workload process hits zero before time s + t, then this impact tends to be gone. It is thus natural to consider the approximation c:b) = EII,v(Te,(~))l <ref type="bibr">(1 24)</ref> where Te0(p) is the first passage time to 0 starting in equilibrium with traffic intensity p. We then approximate the mean first passage time to zero by what it would be for a Levy process without negative jumps (see p. 79 of [46]), i.e., i.e., the mean workload in equilibrium i s €(Z,), and the workload goes down at an average rate of (1 -p ) .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Model Approximations</head><p>Our basic premise is that the normalized mean workloads in two different queueing systems should be nearly the same it the IDWs of their oiiered traffic are nearly the same. This premise immediately suggests an approximation procedure: Given a single-server queue with complex offered traffic, replace the offered traffic with ofiered traffic that is more manageable, and has nearly the same IDW. By "more manageable," we mean that the normalized mean workload can be computed exactly or approximately. The basic premise implies that the normalized mean workload obtained tor the more manageable offered traffic should be a good approximation i o r the normalized mean workload in the original model.</p><p>Essentially this same approximation procedure has already been applied with some success to approximate complex arrival processes by renewal processes in 1541, 1551, As an alternative to the fixed-point approximation in Section V-A and the light-traffic and heavy-traffic interpolation in Section V-B, we suggest a Gl/G/l model approximation.</p><p>For any given offered traffic with I D W /),(t), we choose GIIGII offered traffic (ii possible) t o approximate /,,(t).

For example, Ott and Zucker applied the transform f(s), even when it is not completely monotone, to approximately solve the approximating "GI"IMI1 queue in the usual way, and the results were very encouraging. We tend not to prefer this approach because it requires considerable data about the arrival process, because it does not seem to extend t o include the service requirements, and because further work must be done to identify and solve the approximating GI/G/I queue. However, the procedure obviously has potential.</p><p>Once we have an approximate GI/C/I model, we can calculate other performance measures besides the average workload, but it is not at all clear that the I D W should be used to predict more than the average workload. Obviously, the I D W provides some idea about the queue performance more generally, but it is not so directly connected to other performance measures. To illustrate the limitations, note that neither the IDW nor the full workload process can distinguish between a queue with batch arrivals having a Poisson arrival process for batches, and a simple MIGII queue in which the customers arrive one at a time. Thus, from the IDW or the mean workload, we cannot predict the average waiting time per customer. However, if service times are independent of waiting times, so that customer arrivals occur one at a time, then we can predict the average waiting time from the average workload using Brumelle's formula (72).</p><p>As illustrated by the M / G / I queue, the full distribution of the steady-state workload depends on the service-time distribution beyond the first two moments, so we clearly cannot determine the distribution of the steady-state workload from the IDW. Even a full Gl/G/l model approximation matchingthe IDW exactlydoes not help.The difficulties are well illustrated by examples in <ref type="bibr">Ramaswami and Latouche [47]</ref>. However, a natural rough approximation tor the steadystate workload distribution, assuming nice behavior, is an atom of (1p ) at zero (which i s exact), plus an exponential tail, with the previously determined mean, i.e., P(Z, &gt; tj = pe-'"'E'z.", t &gt; 0.</p><p>(149) This exponential approximation i s asymptotically correct in heavy traffic in great generality, and is known t o be remarkably good for a large class of M / G / l queues. As indicated by the heavy-traffic limit, (149) tends to perform better as p increases. A possible retinement of (149) i s to use an interpolation approximation, using the fact that the workload distribution, conditional on being positive, behaves like the stationary-excess of the service-time distribution in light traffic.</p><p>Of course, we can also consider other model approximations besides Gl/G/l models. Another good candidate for the arrival process is a Markov modulated Poisson process. This model approximation i s well illustrated by Heffes and Lucantoni <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref>.</p></div>

In addition to the simulation estimates, which were obtained by Albin [3]-[5],</p><p>approximate 95 percent confidence intervals are indicated in parentheses below the estimate. Albin's estimates actually are for the mean number i n system, but these are converted into the mean workload by applying L = XW and (72), Since this transformation is linear, the new confidence intervals are easily obtained as well.</p><p>The first two approximations are Albin's hybrid approximation, and QNA approximation i n ( <ref type="formula">29</ref>) and (33) of <ref type="bibr">[57]</ref> that is based on it.

In that context, the QNA approximation is appealing because of its simplicity.</p><p>The next three approximations are simple deterministic time transformations ot the IDW, as in (9) where t ( p ) is independent of the IDW.

Overall, (129) seems best, but it seems too low tor all cases except the first.</p><p>The next-to-last approximation is a Gl/G/l model approximation as discussed i n Section V-C. By redefining the third moment as in ( <ref type="formula">143</ref>) and fitting an H2 distribution t o the tirst three moments, we obtain an HJMII queue with the identical IDW. (Evidently the same result would be achieved by applying (148).) The approximate solution is then the exact solution for the resulting HLiMil model (obtained i n the usual way). As can be seen from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">2</ref>, the G l / G / l model approximation performs well, but not exceptionally well. Evidently there is a limit to the information provided by the IDW. The final approximation i n Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">2</ref> is the interpolation approximation in ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) using ( <ref type="formula">151</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">153</ref>), which coincides with the interpolation approximation applied to the H2/M/1 model obtained by the GI/G/I model approximation. (All the interpolation approximations for GI/G/I queues in [60] coincide for exponential service-time distributions.) It is significant that the interpolation approximation performs nearly as well as the GI/G/l model approximation. This example suggests that it may not be worthwhileobtainingafull GI/G/I model that has nearlythe same IDW even if it can be done.</p><p>I n summary, the simple time transformation in (9) plus (13), and the interpolation in (17) plus (18) look very good in this experiment, and are appealing because of their simplicity.</p></div>

The Second Experiment: H2 a n d E2 Distributions</head><p>The second experiment consists of 24 cases, based o n 2 values of p (0.7 and (0.9)), 3 values of n (2,4, and 16), 2 interarrival-time distributions, and 2 service-time distributions. The two interarrival-time and service-time distributions are f2 and H2 with balanced means, and c,' = 5.0. With mean 1, the third moments are ma3 = 3.0, and ma, = 3 c 3 c i + 1) = 90, respectively; the densities at the origin are 90) = 0, and f(0) = 2c:/(l + c i ) = 5/3. Albin's simulation experiment also includes other distributions, including other service-time distributions with the samec:, in particular, lognormal for c: = 5.0,and shifted exponential with ca = 0.5. (A shifted-exponential random variable is a constant plus an exponential.) In support of approximations for the mean workload that only depend on the first two momentsof the service time, the simulation estimates with the different service-time distributions are quite close to the estimates for the service distributions we consider. The bigger discrepancy occurs when c,' = c: = 5.0, p = 0.7, and n = 2; the lognormal service times yield values about 6 percent lower. Overall, Albin's simulation results support using only two moments of the service-time distribution.</p><p>The basic approximations developed here are compared to the estimated exact values in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. Each simulation estimate is also given an approximate standard deviation based o n 20 batches from one long run.</p><p>As in Section VI-A, the approximations are all obtained analytically, without measurements, using the explicit formulas for the E2 and H2 IDWs in Section Ill-G. Otherwise, we would have worked with the asymptotic approximation in (69) and (115). For example, for the H2/H2case, the approximation is /,(t) = 10 -12n/t, which is quite accurate for /,(t) 2 8. In applications, typically the component arrival processes have a given time scale, so that when more component processes are introduced, p increases with n. Then, the IDW associated with the superposition of n i.i.d. processes is independent of n. In contrast, here the IDWs changewith n, as indicated in (150) and as illustrated for the H2/H2 and E2/E2 cases in Figs. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">6</ref>, where the variability fixed-point equation ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) i s solved graphically for all n and p .

(From our approach, we do clearly see that it should be easier to obtain good approximations in these cases.)</p><p>For the H2 arrival processes, the results are reasonable for smaller n, but the quality of the results deteriorates dramatically as n increases. Indeed, for the H2/E2 case, the two   The IDWs and thc variabilitv~tixcd-point approxi-  <ref type="formula">9</ref>) plus (15), and (17) plus (18), both perform very poorly when n = 16 and p = 0.9.

The IDLt's and the variability-tixed point approxi Indeed, trom Table <ref type="table">3</ref> we see that the derivatives are least informative tor large n in the H2/E2 case. This difficulty with the approximation also was observed of the HJMil queue i n Table <ref type="table">5</ref> of <ref type="bibr">[60]</ref>. As before, the results can be interpreted more positively: The approximations for the function c j ( p j have the right shape. The values do not match well at higher p because the functions are very steep at that end.</p><p>However, we could not anticipate so clearly the difficulty with the variability fixed point approximation in the H,/E, case with n = 16 and p = 0.9. We conjecture that the asymptotics in Section V-B cease to be relevant as n and p both get large, so that for large n, x ( p ) in ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) should become something like p/2(1 -p),, as in (128). Indeed, from [43] and [59], we know that the crucial factor when n --t m and p -+ 1 is n(1p)*, so that the crude approximation (14) should get steadily better as n increases.</p><p>From <ref type="bibr">[59]</ref>, we see that as n gets extremely large, in a certain senseci(0) approaches a step function, increasing from c$(O) to c ?

Indeed, the IDW approximation (153), i.e., t:(l) = 03 for H,/E,, seems to tell the main story.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VfI. CONCLUSION5</head><p>In this paper we have developed some new ways to gain insight intotheoffered traffictoaqueue(thearriva1 process together with the service requirements), and its effect on performance. We have proposed two basic measurements of the offered traffic: the normalized mean workload {c:(p): 0 I p 5 1) in (3) (Section Il-C) and the I D W {/&amp;): t 2 0) in (1) (Section Ill). Both are functions that can be estimated from a single sample path of the offered traffic; see (2) and Section Il-B. Moreover, both measurements also apply to the arrival process alone, as well as to the arrival process together with the service requirements, essentially by considering constant service times.</p><p>Much of the paper has been devoted to establishing connections betwen IJt) and c$(p). We have provided strong support for our basic premise that c:(p) is primarily determined byl,,,(t), startingwith (8)and ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>),and continuingwith Section IV. We have also indicated limitations on this basic premise by considering different queues with identical IDWs. In particular, this occurs when the arrival process is a superposition of i.i.d. H2 renewal processes, and we apply the GIIGI1 model approximation in Section V-C by redefining the third interarrival-time moment as in (143). The H,/ GI1 model obtained by fitting an H, distribution to the first three moments has exactly the same IDW as the queue with the superposition arrival process, but the resulting approximation performs only about as well as the interpolation approximation.</p><p>We have also proposed four ways to approximate c:(p) in terms of / , ~t ) , which can be applied either w i t h measurements or basic model parameters (as illustrated by Section VI). The first approximation is the simple time transformation in (9) and (13); the second i s the variability fixedpoint approximation in (9), (15), and Section V-A; the third is the interpolation approximation in (17), (18) and Section V-B; and the fourth is the GIIGII model approximation in Section V-C (which was not developed completely). We have found <ref type="bibr">(in [24]-[26] and [60]</ref>, as well as here) that these approximations perform quite well, but not uniformly so. All these procedures correctly capture the first-order behavior in the limiting values c:(O) and ci <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. For the middle, on the basis of simplicity as well as performance, we preferthe interpolation approximation (17) and (18), and the sample time transformation (14). All the approximations seem promising, but they require further study. I I } given { l J t ) : t 2 0 } , we succeed in predicting the performance of the queueatallpgiven the offered traffic at onlyonep, but recall that this strong property requires that the offered traffic depend o n p via the simple linear scaling in Section Il-A. If the offered traffic is not exogenous (e.g., i f there are feedback effects, as in a closed queueing network), then the offered traffic will not change by the simple linear scaling when we change the arrival rate or service rate. Then c:(p) may only be related to the IDW associated with the given p. The IDW should nevertheless provide useful insight.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 .
