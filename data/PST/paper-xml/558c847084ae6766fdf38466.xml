<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>A large body of work in the networking community focuses on topology measurements at various levels, including the Internet, the Web (WWW), peer-to-peer (P2P) and online social networks (OSN). The size of these networks and other practical restrictions make measuring the entire graph impossible. Instead, researchers typically collect and study a small but "representative" sample. In this paper, we are particularly interested in sampling networks that naturally allow to explore the neighbors of a given node (which is the case in WWW, P2P and OSN). A number of graph exploration techniques use this basic operation for sampling. They can be roughly classified in two categories: (a) with replacement (random walks), and (b) without replacement (graph traversal techniques).</p><p>In the first category, random walks, nodes can be revisited. This category includes the classic Random Walk (RW) as well as the Metropolis-Hastings Random Walk (MHRW). They are used for sampling of nodes on the Web <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, P2P networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> and large graphs in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Random walks are well studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and result in samples that have either no bias (MHRW) or a known bias (RW) that can be corrected This work was supported by: grant ManCom 2110 of the Hasler Foundation, Bern, Switzerland; SNF grant PBELP2-130871, Switzerland; and NSF CAREER grant 0747110, USA. -BFS -DFS -Forest Fire -Snowball</p><p>Metropolis-Hastings Random Walk (MHRW) Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Overview of results. We calculate the average node degree k * (and the full degree distribution, not shown) expected to be observed by BFS in a random graph RG(p k ) with a given degree distribution p k , as a function of the fraction of sampled nodes f . We show RW and MHRW as a reference. k is the real average node degree, and k 2 is the real average squared node degree.</p><p>Observations:</p><p>(1) For a small sample size, BFS has the same bias as RW; with increasing f , the bias decreases; a complete BFS (f = 1) is unbiased, as is MHRW (or uniform sampling).</p><p>(2) All common graph traversal techniques (that do not revisit the same node) lead to the same bias.</p><p>(3) The shape of the BFS curve depends on the real node degree distribution p k , but it is always monotonically decreasing.</p><p>for. Random walks are not the focus of this paper, but are discussed as baseline for comparison.</p><p>In the second category, graph traversal techniques, each node is visited exactly once (if we let the process run until completion and if the graph is connected). These methods vary in the order in which they visit the nodes; examples include BFS, Depth-First Search (DFS), Forest Fire (FF) and Snowball Sampling (SBS). Graph traversals, especially BFS, are very popular and widely used for sampling large networks, e.g. WWW <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> or OSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. One reason is that BFS is well-known (a textbook technique) and easy to understand. Another and probably more important reason is that (incomplete) BFS collects a full view (all nodes and edges) of some particular region in the graph. Consequently, we can study the topological characteristics (e.g., shortest path lengths, clustering coefficients, community structure) of the resulting sample, which is a big advantage of BFS over random walks. Of course, this study is correct only if the BFS sample is representative of the entire graph. At first sight it seems true, e.g., a BFS sample of a lattice is a (smaller) lattice.</p><p>Unfortunately, this intuition often fails. It was observed empirically that BFS introduces a bias towards high-degree nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> [13]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. We also confirmed this fact in a recent measurement of Facebook <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, where our BFS crawler found the average node degree k BF S 324, while the real value is only k 94, i.e., about 3.5 times smaller. To make things worse, many important properties are usually strongly correlated with the node degree (e.g., privacy settings in Facebook <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>), which makes the BFS sample far from being representative with respect to many metrics. Despite the popularity of BFS on the one hand, and its bias on the other hand, we still know relatively little about the statistical properties of node sequences returned by BFS. The formal analysis is challenging because BFS, similarly to every sampling without replacement, introduces complex dependencies difficult to deal with mathematically.</p><p>Our work is a step toward understanding the statistical characteristics of incomplete BFS sampling. In particular, we focus on a random graph RG(p k ) with a given (and arbitrary) degree distribution p k , which we introduce in Section IV. In Section V, we calculate precisely the node degree distribution expected to be observed by BFS as a function of the fraction of sampled nodes in RG(p k ).</p><p>We accompany this central result with additional related contributions. First, we show that in RG(p k ), BFS is equivalent to other graph traversal techniques, such as Depth First Search (DFS), Snowball Sampling, and Forest Fire (we overview these methods in Section III). Second, we compare the bias of BFS to that of random walks. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, at the beginning of the exploration process, BFS exhibits exactly the same bias as RW; with increasing fraction of sampled nodes f , this bias monotonically decreases; when BFS is complete (f = 1), there is no bias, as in the case of MHRW. Third, given a biased sample, we derive in Section VI an unbiased estimator of the original node degree distribution.</p><p>In addition, in Section VII, we use simulation to confirm our analysis and investigate the effect of graph properties, such as assortativity, not captured directly by RG(p k ). We complement it with real-world measurements of the Facebook social network in Section VIII. Section IX concludes and outlines future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RELATED WORK</head><p>BFS used in practice. BFS is widely used today for exploring large networks, such as OSNs. The following list provides some examples but is by no means exhaustive. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, Ahn et al. used BFS to sample Orkut and MySpace. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, Mislove et al. used BFS to crawl the social graph in four popular OSNs: Flickr, LiveJournal, Orkut, and YouTube. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, Wilson et al. measured the social graph and the user interaction graph of Facebook using several BFSs, each BFS constrained in one of the largest 22 regional Facebook networks. In our recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, we have also crawled Facebook using various sampling techniques, including BFS, RW and MHRW. It has been empirically observed that incomplete BFS and its variants introduce bias towards high-degree nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> [13]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. We also confirmed this in Facebook <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, an observation that in fact inspired this paper.</p><p>Analyzing BFS. To the best of our knowledge, the sampling bias of BFS has not been analyzed so far. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> are the closest related papers to our methodology. The original paper by <ref type="bibr">Kim [17]</ref> analyzes the size of the largest connected component in classic Erdös-Rényi random graph by essentially applying the configuration model with node degrees chosen from a Poisson distribution. To match the stubs (or 'clones' in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>) uniformly at random in a tractable way, Kim proposes a "cut-off line" algorithm: he first assigns each stub a random index from [0, np], and next progressively scans this interval. Achlioptas et al. used this powerful idea in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to study the bias of traceroute sampling in random graphs with a given degree distribution. The basic operation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> is traceroute (i.e., "discover a path") and is performed from a single node to all other nodes in the graph. The union of the observed paths forms a "BFS-tree", which includes all nodes but misses some edges (e.g., those between nodes at the same depth in the tree). In contrast, the basic operation in the traversal methods presented in our paper is to discover all neighbors of a node, and it is applied to all nodes in increasing distance from the origin. Another important difference is that <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> studies a completed BFS-tree, whereas we study the sampling process when it has visited only a fraction f &lt; 1 of nodes; a completed BFS (f= 1) is trivial in our case (it has no bias).</p><p>Another recent paper related to BFS bias is <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The paper is about Snowball Sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, which is similar to BFS, and proposes a heuristic approach to correct the degree biases in ith generation of Snowball based on the values measured in generation i-1. The authors show by simulation that this technique performs moderately well, especially when a significant fraction of nodes have been covered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. GRAPH EXPLORATION TECHNIQUES</head><p>Let G = (V, E) be a connected graph with the set of vertices V , and a set of undirected edges E. Initially, G is unknown, except for one (or some limited number of) seed node(s). When sampling through graph exploration, we begin at the seed node, and we recursively visit (one, some or all) of its neighbors. We distinguish two main categories of exploration techniques: with and without replacement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Exploration with replacement (random walks)</head><p>Exploration with replacement, or simply a walk, allows revisiting the same node many times. Consider the following classic examples:</p><p>1) Random Walk (RW): In this classic sampling technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, we start at some seed node. At every iteration, the next-hop node v is chosen uniformly at random among the neighbors of the current node u. It is easy to see that RW introduces a linear bias towards nodes of high degree <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Metropolis Hastings Random Walk (MHRW):</head><p>In this technique, as in RW, the next-hop node w is chosen uniformly at random among the neighbors of the current node u. However, with a probability that depends on the degrees of w and u, MHRW performs a self-loop instead of moving to w. More specifically, the probability P u,w of moving from u to w is as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P u,w = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ 1 ku • min(1, ku kw ) if w is a neighbor of u, 1 -y =u P u,y if w = u, 0 otherwise,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where k v is the degree of node v. Essentially, MHRW reduces the transitions to high degree nodes and thus eliminates the degree bias of RW. This property of MHRW was recently exploited in various network sampling contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</p><p>3) Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS): RDS was proposed and studied in the field of social sciences to penetrate hidden populations, such as that of drug addicts <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. In the network sampling terminology, at each iteration RDS selects randomly exactly n neighbors (typically n 3) of the current node u and schedules them to visit later. RDS visits the nodes in the order they were scheduled. Thus, RDS is a modification of Snowball Sampling (described below) that allows node revisiting. RDS introduces a degree bias that is known and can be corrected for. It was demonstrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> on the example with n = 1, which reduces RDS precisely to Random Walk (RW). This approach was recently tested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> on various graph models and unstructured P2P networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Exploration without replacement (graph traversals)</head><p>In contrast, exploration without replacement, or graph traversal, never revisits the same node. At the end of the process, and assuming that the graph is connected, all nodes are visited.</p><p>1) Breadth First Search (BFS): BFS is a classic graph traversal algorithm that starts from the seed and progressively explores all neighbors. At each new iteration the earliest explored but not-yet-visited node is selected next. Thus, BFS discovers all nodes within some distance from the seed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Depth First Search (DFS):</head><p>This technique is similar to BFS, except that at each iteration we select the latest explored but not-yet-visited node. As a result, DFS explores first the nodes that are faraway (in the number of hops) from the seed.</p><p>3) Forest Fire (FF): FF is a randomized version of BFS, where for every neighbor v of the current node, we flip a coin, with probability of success p, to decide if we explore v. FF reduces to BFS for p= 1. It is possible that this process dies out before it covers all nodes. In this case, in order to make FF comparable with other techniques, we revive the process from a random node already in the sample. Forest Fire is inspired by the graph growing model of the same name proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and is used as a graph sampling technique in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Snowball Sampling (SBS):</head><p>Snowball Sampling is a precursor of RDS and a term loosely used for BFS-like traversal techniques. According to a classic definition by Goodman <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, an n-name Snowball Sampling is similar to BFS, but at every node v, not all k v , but exactly n neighbors are chosen randomly out of all k v neighbors of v. These n neighbors are scheduled to visit, but only if they have not been visited before.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. GRAPH MODEL RG(p k )</head><p>A basic important graph property is the node degree distribution p k , i.e., the fraction of nodes with degree equal to k, for all k ≥ 0.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> Depending on the network, the degree</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">G = (V, E) graph G with nodes V and edges E kv degree of node v p k = 1 |V | v∈V 1 kv =k degree distribution in G q k expected observed degree distribution q k observed degree distribution p k estimated original degree distribution in G k = k k p k average node degree in G k * = k k q k</formula><p>expected observed average node degree f fraction of nodes covered by the sample distribution can vary, ranging from constant-degree (in regular graphs), a distribution concentrated around the average value (e.g., in Erdös-Rényi random graphs or in well-balanced P2P networks), to heavily right-skewed distributions with k covering several decades (in WWW, unstructured P2P, Internet at the Autonomous System level, OSNs). We handle all these cases by assuming that we are given any fixed node degree distribution p k . Other than that, the graph G is completely random. That is, G is drawn uniformly at random from the set of all multigraphs with degree distribution p k . We denote this model by RG(p k ).</p><p>We use a classic technique to generate RG(p k ), called the configuration model <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>: each node v is given k v "stubs" (or "edges-to-be"). Next, all these v∈V k v = 2|E| stubs are randomly matched in pairs, until all stubs are exhausted (and |E| edges are created). In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> (ignore the rectangular interval [0,1] for now), we present four nodes with their stubs (left) and an example of their random matching (right).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. ANALYZING THE NODE DEGREE BIAS</head><p>In this section, we study the node degree bias observed when the graph exploration techniques of Section III are run on the random graph RG(p k ) of Section IV. In particular, we derive the node degree distribution q k and the average node degree k * expected to be observed, as a function of the original degree distribution p k and, in the case of BFS, of the fraction of sampled nodes f .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Exploration with replacement (walks)</head><p>We begin by summarizing the relevant results known for walks, in particular for RW and MHRW. They will serve as a reference point for our main analysis of graph traversals in the next section.</p><p>1) Random Walk (RW): Random walks have been widely studied; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for an excellent survey. In any given connected and aperiodic graph, the probability of being at a particular node v converges at equilibrium to the stationary distribution π v = kv 2|E| . Therefore, the expected observed degree distribution q k is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">q k = v π v • 1 {kv =k} = k 2|E| p k |V | = k p k k , (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where k is the average node degree in G. Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>) is essentially similar to calculation for RDS in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. As this holds for any fixed (and connected and aperiodic) graph, it is also true for all connected graphs generated by the configuration model. Consequently, the expected observed average node degree is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">k * = k k q k = k k 2 p k k = k 2 k ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where k 2 is the average squared node degree in G. We show this value k 2 k in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Metropolis Hastings Random Walk (MHRW):</head><p>It is easy to show that the transition matrix P u,w shown in Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) leads to a uniform stationary distribution π v = 1</p><p>|V | <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and consequently:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">q k = p k (4) k * = k k q k = k k p k = k .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, we show that MHRW estimates the true mean.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Exploration without replacement (Main Result)</head><p>In both RW and MHRW the nodes can be revisited. So the state of the system at iteration i + 1 depends only on iteration i, which makes it possible to analyze with Markov Chain techniques. In contrast, graph traversals do not allow for node revisits, which introduces crucial dependencies between all the iterations and significantly complicates the analysis. To handle these dependencies, we adopt an elegant technique recently introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> (to study the size of the largest connected component) and extended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> (to study the bias of traceroute sampling). However, our work differs in many aspects from both <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, which we comment in detail in the related work Section II.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Exploration without replacement at the stub level:</head><p>We begin by defining Algorithm 1 (below) -a general graph traversal technique that collects a sequence of nodes S, without replacements. To be compatible with the configuration model (see Section IV), we are interested in the process at the stub level, where we consider one stub at a time, rather than one node at a time. An integral part of the algorithm is a queue Q that keeps the discovered, but still not-yet-followed stubs. First, we enqueue on Q all the stubs of some initial node v 1 , and by setting S ← [v 1 ]. Next, at every iteration, we dequeue one stub from Q, call it a, and follow it to discover its partnerstub b, and b's</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">owner v(b). If node v(b) is not yet discovered, i.e., if v(b) /</formula><p>∈ S, then we append v(b) to S and we enqueue on Q all other stubs of v(b).</p><p>Depending on the scheduling discipline for the elements in Q (line 3), Algorithm 1 implements BFS (for a first-in first out scheduling), DFS (last-in first-out) or Forest Fire (firstin first-out with randomized stub losses). Line 9 guarantees that the algorithm never tracebacks the edges, i.e., that stub a dequeued from Q in line 3 never belongs to an edge that has already been traversed in the opposite direction. end if 11: end while random. Next, we can sample this fixed graph and average the result over the space of all the random graphs RG(p k ) that have just been constructed. Unfortunately, this space grows exponentially with the number of nodes |V |, making the problem untractable. Therefore, we adopt an alternative construction of G -by iteratively selecting b 'on the fly' (i.e, every time line 4 is executed), uniformly at random from all still unmatched stubs. By the principle of deferred decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, these two approaches are equivalent.</p><p>With the help of the 'on the fly' approach, we are able to write down the equations we need. Indeed, let us denote by X i ∈ V the ith selected node, and let P(X 1 = u) be the probability that node u ∈ V is chosen as a starting node. It is easy to show that with z= 2|E| we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P(X2= v) = u =v kv z-ku • P(X1= u)<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">P(X3= w) = v =w u =w,v kw z-kv -ku • kv z-ku • P(X1= u),<label>(7)</label></formula><p>and so on. Theoretically, these equations allow us to calculate the expected node degree at any iteration, and thus the degree bias of BFS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Breaking the dependencies:</head><p>There is still one problem with the equations above. Due to the increasing number of nested sums, the results can be calculated in practice for a first few iterations only. This is because we select stub b uniformly and independently at random from all the unmatched stubs. So the stub selected at iteration i depends on the stubs selected at iterations 1 . . . i-1, which results in the nested sums. We remedy this by implementing the 'on the fly' approach as follows. First, we assign each stub a real-valued index t drawn uniformly at random from the interval [0, 1]. Then, every time we process line 4, we pick b as the unmatched stub with the smallest index. We can interpret this as a continuoustime process, where we determine progressively the partners of stubs dequeued from Q, by scanning the interval from 'time' t= 0 to t= 1 in a search of unmatched stubs. Because the indices chosen by the stubs are independent from each other, the above trick breaks the dependence between the stubs, which is crucial for making this approach tractable.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, we present an example execution of Algorithm 1, where line 4 is implemented as described above. </p><formula xml:id="formula_9">time t (index) time t (index) current time t v 1 v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 v 2 v 3 v 3 v 3 v 4 v 4 v 4</formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. An illustration of the stub-level, on-the-fly graph exploration without replacements. In this particular example, we show an execution of BFS starting at node v 1 . Left: Initially, each node v has kv stubs, where kv is a given target degree of v. Each of these stubs is assigned a real-valued number drawn uniformly at random from the interval [0, 1] shown below the graph. Next, we follow Algorithm 1 with a starting node v 1 . The numbers next to the stubs of every node v indicate the order in which these stubs are enqueued on Q. Center: The state of the system at time t. All stubs in [0, t] have already been matched (the indices of matched stubs are set in plain line). All unmatched stubs are distributed uniformly at random on (t, 1]. This interval can contain also some (here two) already matched stubs. Right: The final result is a realization of a random graph G with a given node degree sequence (i.e., of the configuration model). G may contain self-loops and multiedges.</p><p>4) Expected sampled degree distribution q k : Now we are ready to derive the expected observed degree distribution q k . Recall that all the stub indices are chosen independently and uniformly from [0, 1]. A vertex v with degree k is not sampled yet at time t if the indices of all its k stubs are larger than t, which happens with probability (1t) k . So the probability that v is sampled before time t is 1-(1-t) k . Therefore, the expected fraction of vertices of degree k sampled before t is</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">f k (t) = p k (1-(1-t) k ).<label>(8)</label></formula><p>By normalizing Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">8</ref>), we obtain the expected observed (sampled) degree distribution at time t:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">q k (t) = f k (t) l f l (t) = p k (1 -(1-t) k ) l p l (1 -(1-t) l ) .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Unfortunately, it is difficult to interpret q k (t) directly, because t is proportional neither to the number of matched edges nor to the number of discovered nodes. Recall that our primary goal is to express q k as a function of fraction f of covered nodes. We achieve this by calculating f (t) -the expected fraction of nodes, of any degree, visited before time t</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">f (t) = k f k (t) = 1 - k p k (1-t) k . (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>Because p k ≥ 0, and p k &gt; 0 for at least one k &gt; 0, the term k p k (1-t) k is continuous and strictly decreasing from 1 to 0 with t growing from 0 to 1. Thus, for f ∈ [0, 1] there exists a well defined t= t(f ) that satisfies Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">10</ref>). Although we cannot compute t(f ) analytically (except in some special cases such as for k ≤ 4), it is straightforward to find it numerically. Now, we can rewrite Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">9</ref>) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">q k (f ) = p k (1 -(1-t(f )) k ) l p l (1 -(1-t(f )) l ) ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>which is the expected observed degree distribution after covering fraction f of nodes of graph G.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5) Equivalence of traversal techniques under RW (p k ):</head><p>An interesting observation is that, under the random graph model RW (p k ), all common traversal techniques (BFS, DFS, FF, SBS, . . . ) are subject to exactly the same bias. The explanation is that the sampled node sequence S is fully determined by the choice of stub indices on [0, 1], independently of the way we manage the elements in Q.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6) Equivalence to weighted sampling without replacement:</head><p>Consider a node v with a degree k v . The probability that v is discovered before time t, given that it has not been discovered before t 0 ≤ t, is</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">P(v before time t | v not before t 0 ) = 1 - 1-t 1-t 0 kv (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">)</formula><p>We now take the derivative of the above equation with respect to t, which results in the conditional probability density function k v ( 1-t 1-t0 ) kv-1 . Setting t → t 0 (but keeping t &gt; t 0 ), reduces it to k v , which is the probability density that v is sampled at t 0 , given that it has not been sampled before. This means that at every point in time, out of all nodes that have not yet been selected, the probability of selecting v is proportional to its degree k v . Therefore, this scheme is equivalent to node sampling weighted by degree, without replacements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7)</head><p>Equivalence to RW for f → 0: Finally, for f → 0 (and thus t→ 0), we have 1-(1-t) k kt, and Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">9</ref>) simplifies to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>). This means that in the beginning of the sampling process, every traversal technique is equivalent to RW, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> for f→ 0.</p><p>8) k * is decreasing in f : As in Section V-B2, let X i ∈ V be the ith selected node, and let z = 2|E|. We have shown above that our procedure is equivalent to weighted sampling without replacements, thus we can write P(X 1 = u) = ku z . Now, it follows from Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">6</ref>) that P(X 2 = w) = kw z • α w , where α w = u =w ku z-ku . Because for any two nodes a and b, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">α b -α a = z(k a -k b )/((z -k a )(z -k b )),</formula><p>α w strictly decreases with growing k w . As a result, P(X 2 ) is more concentrated around nodes with smaller degrees than is P(X 1 ), implying that</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">E[k X2 ] &lt; E[k X1 ].</formula><p>We can use an analogous argument at every iteration i ≤ |V |, which allows us to say that</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">E[k Xi ] &lt; E[k Xi-1 ]. In other words, k * (f ) is a decreasing function of f .</formula><p>A practical consequence is that many short traversals (e.g., BFS-es) are more biased than a long one, with the same total number of samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Comments on the graph connectivity</head><p>Note that the configuration model RG(p k ) might result in a graph G that is not connected. In this case, every exploration technique covers only the component C in which it was initiated; consequently, the process described in Section V-B3 stops once C is covered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CORRECTING FOR NODE DEGREE BIAS</head><p>In the previous section we derived the expected observed degree distribution q k as a function of the original degree distribution p k , for three general graph exploration techniques. The distribution q k is usually biased towards high-degree nodes. In this section, we derive unbiased estimators p k and k of the original degree distribution p k and its mean k , respectively.</p><p>Let S ⊂ V be a sequence of vertices that we sampled. Based on S, we can estimate q k as q k = number of nodes in S with degree k |S|</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Random Walk (RW)</head><p>In order to estimate p k based on q k , consider again Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>), which says that q k is proportional to k p k . Therefore, p k is proportional to q k /k, and p k is proportional to q k /k which allows us to write (similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">p k = q k k • l q l l -1<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where l q l l is a normalizing constant.

We can solve this chicken-and-egg problem iteratively, if we know the real fraction f real of covered nodes, or equivalently the graph size |V |. First, we evaluate Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_25">18</ref>) for some values of t and feed the resulting p k 's into Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">10</ref>) to obtain the corresponding f 's.

Of course, based on p k , we can calculate the average node degree as k = k k p k .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. SIMULATION RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we implement and simulate the considered sampling techniques, namely BFS, DFS, FF (with p = 0.5), RW and MHRW. The simulations confirm our analytical results derived for the random graph model RG(p k ). More importantly, in simulations we can study the effect of topological properties, such as of assortativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, that are not directly captured by RG(p k ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Random graph RG(p k )</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> verifies all the formulae derived in this paper, for the random graph RG(p k ) with a given degree distribution. The analytical expectations are plotted in thick plain lines in the background and the averaged simulation results are plotted in thinner lines lying on top of them. We observe almost a perfect match between theory and simulation in estimating the sampled degree distribution q k (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, right) and its mean k * (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, left). Indeed, all traversal techniques follow the same curve (as predicted in V-B5), that initially coincides with that of RW (see V-B7) and is monotonically decreasing in f (see V-B8). We also show that degree weighted node sampling without replacements exhibits exactly the same bias (see V-B6). Finally, applying the estimators p k derived in Section VI corrects for the bias of q k .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The effect of degree-degree correlations (assortativity r)</head><p>Depending on the type of network, nodes may tend to connect to similar or different nodes. For example, in most social networks high degree nodes tend to connect to other high degree nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Such networks are called assortative. In contrast, biological and technological networks are typically disassortative, i.e., they exhibit significantly more high-degree-to-low-degree connections. This observation can be quantified by calculating the assortativity coefficient r <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Values r &lt; 0, r &gt; 0 and r = 0 indicate disassortative, assortative, and purely random graphs such as RG(p k ), respectively.</p><p>For the same initial parameters as in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> (p k , |V |), we simulated different levels of assortativity. The results (not presented here due to space constraints) show that for r &gt; 0, the degree bias is even stronger than for r = 0. This is because the high-degree nodes are now interconnected more densely than in a purely random graph, and are thus easier to discover by sampling techniques that are inherently biased towards high degree nodes. Not surprisingly, a negative assortativity r &lt; 0 has the opposite effect: every high-degree node tends to connect to low-degree nodes, which significantly slows down the discovery of the former.</p><p>In contrast, random walks RW and MHRW are not affected by the changes in assortativity. This is expected, because their stationary distributions hold for any fixed (connected and aperiodic) graph regardless of its topological properties.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. REAL LIFE EXAMPLE: SAMPLING OF FACEBOOK</head><p>In this section we apply and test the previous ideas in a real-life large-scale system -the Facebook social graph. With 250+ millions of active users, Facebook is currently the largest online social network. Crawling the entire topology of Facebook would require downloading about 50T B of HTML data <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, which makes sampling a very practical alternative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Data collection</head><p>We have implemented a set of crawlers to collect the samples of Facebook (FB) according to the UNI, BFS, RW, MHRW techniques. The details of our implementation are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The data sets are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">II</ref>.</p><p>UNI is a true uniform sample of FB users (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for details). Thanks to a large number of samples |S|, UNI gives a high quality estimation of p k and k . Therefore, we use UNI as ground truth for comparison of various techniques.</p><p>We ran two types of BFS crawling. BFS 28 consists of 28 small BFS-es initiated at 28 randomly chosen nodes from UNI, which allowed us to easily parallelize the process. Moreover, at the time of data collection, we (naively) thought that this would reduce the BFS bias. After gaining more insight (which, nota bene, motivated this paper), we collected a single large BFS 1 , initiated at a randomly chosen node from UNI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Results</head><p>We present the Facebook sampling results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">III</ref>   is the largest. It drops very slightly under the (relatively very short) BFS 28 crawl, which confirms our findings from V-B7. BFS 1 , a sample 15 times longer than BFS 28 , is significantly less biased, which is in agreement with V-B8.</p><p>The second row shows the expected sampled average node degrees (i.e., our predictions of the values in the first row), assuming that the underlying Facebook topology is a random graph RG(p k ) with degree distribution p k equal to that sampled by UNI. As expected, this works very well for RW. However, the values predicted for BFS overshoot the reality. This is because Facebook is not a pure random graph RG(p k ). For example, Facebook, as most social networks, is characterized by a high clustering coefficient c. We believe that it is possible to incorporate this fact in our analytical model, e.g., by appropriately stretching the function f (t) in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. This is a main goal in our future work.</p><p>Finally, in the last row of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">III</ref> we apply the estimators developed in Section VI to correct the degree biases of RW and BFS. In the case of RW, the correction works very well. For the BFS estimator, the results are significantly worse, clearly for the reasons discussed in the previous paragraph.</p><p>All the above observations hold also for the entire degree distribution, which is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Practical recommendations</head><p>BFS is strongly biased toward high degree nodes. It is possible to correct for this bias precisely when the underlying graph is a RG(p k ) (which is not the case in practice). Also, in more realistic graphs, this bias can be corrected reasonably well for a very small sample size (as is the case for BFS 28 ), where BFS is similar to RW (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). On the other k node degree Prob(k) Degree distributions sampled in Facebook Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Facebook measurements -degree distribution. Crawlers used: UNI, RW and BFS. All plots are in log-log scale with logarithmic binning of data (we take the average of all points that fall in the same bin). We also correct these distributions, as described in Section VI. extreme, for very large sampling coverage, the bias of BFS becomes relatively and could be sometimes neglected (even without additional correction). in all other cases, the results become difficult to interpret. In contrast, both RW (equipped with a correction procedure) and MHRW are unbiased, regardless of the actual graph topology. Therefore, we recommend using RW and MHRW (with a slight advantage of RW <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>) as general methods to sample the node properties.</p><p>In contrast, RW and MHRW are not useful when sampling non-local graph properties, such as the graph diameter or the average shortest path length. In this case, BFS seems very attractive, because it produces a full view of a particular region in the graph, which is usually a densely connected graph itself, and for which the non-local properties can be easily calculated. However, all such results should be interpreted very carefully, as they may be also strongly affected by the bias of BFS. For example, the graph diameter (usually) drops significantly with growing average node degree of a network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS</head><p>When crawling large, undirected networks, BFS tends to discover high-degree nodes first. As a result, the nodes sampled by an incomplete BFS are biased with respect to their degrees, and also to many other properties that correlate with the degree (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for examples).</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to quantify this bias. In particular, we calculated the node degree distribution expected to be observed by BFS as a function of the fraction f of covered nodes, in a random graph RG(p k ) with a given degree distribution p k . Furthermore, we also showed that, for RG(p k ), all commonly used graph traversal techniques that sample nodes without replacement lead to the same bias, and we showed how to correct for this bias.</p><p>We compared our analytical results (obtained for random graphs) with experimental results obtained via BFS sampling of the Facebook social graph (which is not expected to be a random graph). Qualitatively, the same trends hold: For a small sample size, f → 0, BFS has the same bias as the classic Random Walk, and with increasing f , the bias monotonically decreases. Quantitatively, however, the bias of our Facebook samples does not match precisely the one we calculated for RG(p k ). This is the effect of topological properties other than the degree distribution, in which Facebook and the random graph vary. For example, we found in simulations that the degree bias gets amplified in graphs with strong positive assortativity. In future work, we plan to extend our theoretical framework to capture such topological properties as well.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>2 ) 7 :</head><label>27</label><figDesc>Discovery on the fly: In line 4 of Algorithm 1, we follow stub a to discover its partner b.
