<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>A range image provides geometric information about the object independent of the position, direction, and intensity of light sources illuminating the scene, or of the reflectance properties of that object. Many object recognition algorithms using range images as input were proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. To recognize a 3D object, first its range image has to be segmented into homogeneous regions. Uncorrupted range images can be approximated reasonably well by a piecewise polynomial surface, and, thus, a homogeneous region corresponds to a polynomial surface patch.</p><p>There are two "traditional" approaches toward segmentation of piecewise polynomial data. In the region-based range image segmentation methods, first the pixels having similar properties are grouped together, e.g., Besl <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In the edge-based methods, on the other hand, first the discontinuities are extracted and the segmentation is then guided by the obtained contours, e.g., Fan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Significant effort is required to compare the performance of different range segmentation methods. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, a rigorous framework was developed (including ground truth based quantitative measures), and four traditional techniques for segmentation into planar patches were evaluated. None of the methods provided superior performance under all the evaluation criteria.</p><p>Robust estimation techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> can also be used to recover the parameters of a surface patch. The percentage of tolerated outliers determines the breakdown point of the estimator. The two most frequently used classes of robust estimators are the Mestimators and the family of high breakdown point (close to 0.5) techniques. The least median of squares (LMedS) estimator is the best known from the latter class. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> for an introductory text on robust estimators with an emphasis on LMedS.</p><p>Koivunen and Pietikäinen <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> compared the performance of M-estimators (the algorithm proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>) and least trimmed squares estimator (a high breakdown point technique). Roth and Levine <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> proposed a Hough transform type evidence accumulation method, similar with the computation of LMedS. The idea of using subsets of the data is also at the basis of the Residual Consensus method proposed by Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Boyer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> developed a range segmentation system in which an M-estimator is used as the main computational module. The error norm used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> provides bounded sensitivity to outliers, i.e., the method can also be regarded as a robust approach.</p><p>The breakdown point of any one-step robust estimator cannot exceed 0.5. That is, the inliers must be the absolute majority in the data in order to be able to recover for arbitrary outliers and without additional assumptions, their underlying model. This condition cannot be satisfied in a range image, and many segmentation algorithms therefore start by detecting seed regions. The homogeneity of the seed regions is established with high confidence, and the final segmentation is obtained by extending these regions using robust estimators and/or heuristics e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>However, it is possible to design multistep procedures which can recover, in the lack of any a priori information, the model parameters representing the relative majority of homogeneous pixels in the window of analysis. These procedures tolerate more than half of the data being outliers, i.e., the apparent breakdown point exceeds 0.5. It must be emphasized that this breakdown point does not have the same meaning as that of a one-step robust estimator, i.e., as it is used in statistics.</p><p>In Section 2, we propose a multistep procedure, the adaptive least kth order squares (ALKS) estimator, and compare its performance with two other procedures described in the literature: Minimization of the Probability of Randomness (MINPRAN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and Residual Consensus (RESC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. In Section 3, a range image segmentation technique based on ALKS is described and its performance compared with several other methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">ADAPTIVE LEAST KTH ORDER SQUARE ESTIMATOR</head><p>Let r i , i = 1, , n be the residuals associated with the data points in the window. (For convenience, we use a single index for the data points.) The least median of squares estimator (LMedS) finds the model parameters which minimize (r 2 ) k:n , where the subscript means the kth largest residual in the ascendingly ordered list, and k is close to half the number of points. The LMedS estimator will always return a model representing at least 50 percent of the data points.</p><p>Methods developed in computer vision try to exploit the a priori information about the structure of the data to define a model carried by less than half the data points. The inliers have to be close to the estimated fit, the outliers are uniformly distributed, etc. The Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the Minimize the Probability of Randomness (MINPRAN) technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and the Residual Consensus (RESC) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> belong to this category.</p><p>Adaptively selecting the point set of the relative homogeneous majority, however, can also be achieved with the help of a robust estimator. The least kth order squares (LKS) uses an arbitrary p &lt; k &lt; n in the minimization and belongs to the family of least quantile of squares estimators <ref type="bibr">[17, p. 124</ref>]. Taking into account both the explosion and the implosion definitions of the breakdown point <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, we obtain that the LKS estimator has the theoretical breakdown point of min ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">k n k n 1 - 3 8 .</formula><p>The computation of LKS is similar to the well-known technique for LMedS (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>). A p-tuple is chosen randomly from the data to define a model hypothesis. Using all the computed model parameters except the intercept, the residuals of this partial model, u i are computed. The residuals are then sorted in ascending order and the location of the shortest window containing at least k residuals is found. Let</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d u u l k l k n p l n p , : : = - + - - - 1 2 1 51 6 1 6<label>(1)</label></formula><p>be the half-width of the corresponding window. The procedure is repeated for several p-tuples. Their number can be established based on simple probabilistic considerations <ref type="bibr">[17, p. 197</ref>]. The ptuple yielding the smallest d l,k , denoted d k , provides the LKS esti- mate of the model. The standard deviation of the noise corrupting the inliers, i.e., the robust estimate of the noise variance can be approximated as .5</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">s d k n k k = + - F 1 0 1 2 7 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where the compensation factor in the denominator assumes Gaussian distribution for the inlier noise, and </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">F -1 [◊]</formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">e k k i k k i q k i k i q k k k q p r s s r q p s k k 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 = - = - = = = Â Â , , s ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where only the residuals of the q k points declared inliers by the LKS estimator are used. The optimum value of k is chosen as the one yielding the smallest e k 2 . Note that the inliers are selected based on s k , and, therefore, the distribution of e k 2 is difficult to determine even for the ideal case, homogeneous data corrupted with Gaussian noise. The adaptive procedure using LKS with k chosen by minimizing (3), will be referred to in the sequel as ALKS.</p><p>For homogeneous data, all the n data points belong to the same homogeneous patch corrupted with i.i.d. zero-mean noise having standard deviation s, s k 2 is the unbiased sample variance of the noise (3), and, therefore, it is close to s 2 once k is large enough.</p><p>Thus, the criterion (3) compares a nonrobust and a robust estimate of the noise variance. The robust estimate s k is an underestimate of s for all values of k ([17, p. 202]). The underestimation decreases monotonically with increasing k, and the criterion (3) has its minimum for larger ks, yielding almost all data points being classified as inliers. Given the stochastic nature of the processes, all the properties should be regarded as true with high probability.</p><p>In nonhomogeneous data, the nm inliers are corrupted with i.i.d. zero-mean noise having standard deviation s, and the remaining m points are outliers. The inliers provide the largest homogeneous region, but can represent only a relative majority in the data, and the outliers can be structured as well.</p><p>First, k £ nm. Assume that the LKS estimator returns an unbiased estimate of the model for the inliers. The residuals of the nm inliers, however, are distributed over the entire range of the noise, and, thus, as k increases (but remains less or equal than nm), the estimate s k increases monotonically, since residuals significantly larger than s are used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. The phenomenon, an artifact of the data nonhomogeneity, was analyzed in details in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Thus, it is expected that for k £ nm the criterion (3) decreases monotonically as k increases. The observation was verified by extensive simulations.</p><p>Once k &gt; nm, at least one data point in the window is an outlier, and the estimated model is never correct. The residuals increase significantly. The increase of s k is much less than that of s k , since only the difference of two residuals and not their squared sum is used, yielding an increase of the criterion (3).</p><p>The above qualitative analysis also shows the limitations of the criterion (3). If several extreme outliers are present in the data, s k can become so large that the minimum of the criterion is produced at an incorrect k. However, for real data, the pixel domain is bounded and such a situation cannot happen.</p><p>Similarly, if for values of k just exceeding nm the change in the structure of the residuals is not very abrupt, the criterion may not yield the minimum at the correct k. More complex piecewise surfaces (like a roof edge, or a double step) are more prone to errors, since there are more data points close to an erroneous fit. The "bridging fits problem" of the robust estimators <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> is another aspect of the same phenomenon. As will be shown below, the ALKS procedure is less sensitive but not immune to adverse conditions.</p><p>To compare the performance of ALKS with that of other estimators, least squares (LS), LMedS, MINPRAN, and RESC, four piecewise linear one-dimensional synthetic signals of increasing complexity were generated. Each signal contained 100 data points corrupted with zero-mean, i.i.d. Gaussian noise having standard deviation s. A percentage a of the data points was also corrupted with impulse noise uniformly distributed in the range of (0, 100). In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> the four signals are shown. The ALKS procedure used 500 p-tuples for each value of k. This number can be reduced significantly without performance deterioration. Also, similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the same samples can be used for different ks. Only the multistep procedures RESC and ALKS show correct results across all the cases. However, RESC requires user tuned parameters for optimal performance, while ALKS is entirely data driven.</p><p>The behavior of the ALKS estimator is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Nineteen uniformly spaced values of the index h = k/n were defined between 0.05 and 0.95. The four signals were generated 1,000 times and the ALKS procedure was applied to recover the largest homogeneous region. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RANGE IMAGE SEGMENTATION WITH ALKS</head><p>The ALKS procedure can be used as the computational module for a robust range image segmentation algorithm. Since the ALKS estimator detects the relative majority, the algorithm can start by defining the first processing window as the entire image. This eliminates the need for heuristic procedures often involved in finding the seed regions. The order of the polynomial surface used as model is an important consideration in range image analysis: planar, quadratic, or cubic <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. We have found that higher-order surfaces can be accurately approximated when the segmentation is based only on planar surfaces, but uses high breakdown point estimators. If necessary, the planar patches then can be fused using the adequate model order. The increased number of degrees of freedoms of a higher-order model often can yield undersegmentation artifacts. For example, a spatial roof edge (a crease) will be fused under a quadratic surface model. The only systematic study of the performance of range image segmenters <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> also used planar patches.</p><p>The ALKS based range image segmentation algorithm can be summarized as follows:</p><p>1) Define the region to be processed as the largest connected component of unlabeled pixels. At the start, this means the entire image. The connected component algorithm from [7, vol. 1, sec. 2.3.5] was used. 2) Apply the ALKS procedure to the selected region and discriminate the inliers. 3) Label the largest connected component of inliers as the delineated homogeneous patch. 4) Refine the model parameter estimates by a least-squares fit to the inliers. 5) Repeat steps 1-5 until the size of the largest connected component is less than a threshold (100 pixels was used in the implementation). 6) Eliminate the isolated outliers surrounded by inliers. An unlabeled pixel is allocated to the class of the majority of its labeled four-connected neighbors.</p><p>The range image segmentation algorithm was tested on both synthetic and real 256 ¥ 256 range images. The real images were captured by a range finder of the Seoul National University. The range finder uses the active triangulation method <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and a resolution is 0.1mm both for the interpixel distances and depth values. The raw images were interpolated with cubic surfaces to compensate for information loss due to shadow effects and nonlinear sampling along the row direction. The background and the objects have significantly different dynamic ranges, the former being automatically set to zero. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, the segmentation of three different range images are shown. To emphasize the tolerance of the algorithm to missing data (outliers), the images were also corrupted with 10 percent impulse noise bounded only by the machine precision. Slightly distorted boundaries appear near the junction of surfaces, and the higher-order surfaces are split into a number of planar patches. Note, however, that the main boundaries of these objects are correct, and, thus, if needed, the quadratic surfaces can be recovered by further processing. The segmenta-tions (using 500 three-tuples per LKS iteration, and 19 steps for the index h) took less than two minutes on an Indigo 2 Silicon Graphics workstation.</p><p>It is of importance to compare the performance of the algorithm with that of other robust range image segmentation methods. For lack of space, we do not describe here the comparison with the robust region growing algorithm of Meer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>; the robust clustering technique described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>; and the already mentioned RESC technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The results can be seen in the extended version of the paper at site http://www.caip.rutgers.edu/ ~meer/RIUL/projects. html. The ALKS based algorithm provides the most satisfactory segmentation results at a somewhat lower computational cost. The performance evaluation work for range image segmentation algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> provides a large set of standard data together with the ground truth. We have used an image from the ABW family (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>) whose segmentation ground truth is Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>. The results of two methods analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the UB and USF algorithms with the parameters as described in the paper, are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref>. They were taken from their web sites. The result for the ALKS segmenter is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4e</ref>. There is one clear mistake in the segmentation, several faces of the right object are fused. However, this error can be recovered by further processing. The labels associated with the delineated regions are given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4f</ref>. The mean square error of all the fits, except labels 5 and 8, were between 0.299 (label 10) and 0.914 (label 4). The remaining two labels had much larger fitting errors, 3.344 (label 5) and 5.298 (label 8). The latter is a region poorly captured by the sensor as the ground truth (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>) also illustrates. The regions with high fitting errors can now be separated and, thus, analyzed with increased sensitivity. Since the goal of the comparison was to contrast the raw ALKS method with more traditional techniques, this processing step was not implemented. It must be emphasized, that the ALKS result is obtained without any user set tuning parameter (beside minimum region size) while the traditional methods require a search for the optimal set of thresholds <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>The adaptive least kth order squares procedure described in this paper is designed to handle piecewise structured data, a case frequently met in computer vision. Its advantage relative to traditional techniques or similar multistep robust procedures (like MINIPRAN or RESC) is its lack of embedded a priori assumptions. There are no parameters to be tuned for optimal performance, and the outliers can have arbitrary structure. While the inliers are assumed to be corrupted by normal noise, this hypothesis has practically no influence on the results as examples with real images have shown.</p><p>Inspired by an earlier version of the ALKS procedure, Stewart developed the MUSE (minimum unbiased scale estimator) technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The MUSE operator detects the homogeneous patch corresponding to a relative majority in the processing window, by seeking the value of k for which the kth ordered residual (normalized by the expected value of the corresponding order statistic of the standard residual distribution) is minimum. The MUSE technique puts the emphasis on the nature of the inlier distribution, and requires a lookup table for the scale estimator correction. In the ALKS approach, the optimal region size is determined by comparing a robust and a nonrobust estimate of the noise variance and not based on a single residual. Extensive theoretical analysis and simulations have shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> that MUSE will fail around signal-to-noise ratios at which the performance of MINIPRAN, ALKS, or RESC also decline. For a step signal, this will appear close to a step height of 8s.</p><p>Range image segmentation in particular, and robust analysis of image structures under the piecewise polynomial surface model in general, are difficult problems with the currently available solutions being not general enough to be able to handle arbitrary data. A possible way toward further progress is to overcome some of the inherent limitations of high breakdown point robust estimation techniques.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Line.
