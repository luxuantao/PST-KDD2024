<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reinitialization-Free Level Set Evolution via Reaction Diffusion</head><p>Kaihua Zhang, Lei Zhang, Member, IEEE, Huihui Song, and David Zhang, Fellow, IEEE Abstract-This paper presents a novel reaction-diffusion (RD) method for implicit active contours that is completely free of the costly reinitialization procedure in level set evolution (LSE). A diffusion term is introduced into LSE, resulting in an RD-LSE equation, from which a piecewise constant solution can be derived. In order to obtain a stable numerical solution from the RD-based LSE, we propose a two-step splitting method to iteratively solve the RD-LSE equation, where we first iterate the LSE equation, then solve the diffusion equation. The second step regularizes the level set function obtained in the first step to ensure stability, and thus the complex and costly reinitialization procedure is completely eliminated from LSE. By successfully applying diffusion to LSE, the RD-LSE model is stable by means of the simple finite difference method, which is very easy to implement. The proposed RD method can be generalized to solve the LSE for both variational level set method and partial differential equation-based level set method. The RD-LSE method shows very good performance on boundary antileakage. The extensive and promising experimental results on synthetic and real images validate the effectiveness of the proposed RD-LSE approach.</p><p>Index Terms-Active contours, image segmentation, level set, partial differential equation (PDE), reaction-diffusion, variational method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I N THE past two decades, active contour models (ACMs, also called snakes or deformable models) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> have been widely used in image processing and computer vision applications, especially for image segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The original ACM proposed by Kass et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> moves the explicit parametric curves to extract objects in images. However, the parametric ACM has some intrinsic drawbacks, such as its difficulty in handling topological changes and its dependency of parameterization <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The level set method later proposed by Osher and Sethian <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> implicitly represents the curve by the zero level of a high dimensional function, and it significantly improves ACM by being free of these drawbacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>The level set methods (LSM) can be categorized into partial differential equation (PDE) based ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and variational ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The level set evolution (LSE) of PDE-based LSM is directly derived from the geometric consideration of the motion equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, which can be used to implement most of the parametric ACMs, such as Kass et al.'s snakes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, region competition snakes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and geodesic active contours <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, etc. The LSE of variational LSM is derived via minimizing a certain energy functional defined on the level set <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, such as Chan-Vese ACM <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, Vese and Chan's piecewise smoothing ACM <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, local binary fitting ACM <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, etc. Moreover, the variational LSM can be easily converted into PDE-based LSM by changing slightly the LSE equation while keeping the final steady state solution unchanged <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>In implementing the traditional LSMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, the upwind schemes are often used to keep numerical stability, and the level set function (LSF) is initialized to be a signed distance function (SDF). Since the LSF often becomes very flat or steep near the zero level set in the LSE process and this will affect much the numerical stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, a remedy procedure called re-initialization is applied periodically to enforce the degraded LSF being an SDF <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The first re-initialization method was proposed by Chopp <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and it directly computes the SDF. However, this method is very time-consuming. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, Chopp also proposed a more efficient method by restricting the front movement and the re-initialization within a band of points near the zero level set. However, it is difficult to locate and discretize the interface by Chopp's methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The method proposed by Sussman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> iteratively solves a re-initialization equation. Nonetheless, when the LSF is far away from an SDF, this method fails to yield a desirable SDF. The re-initialization method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> addresses this problem by using a new signed function, but it will shift the interface to some degree <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In order to make the interface stationary during re-initialization, a specific method for the two-phase incompressible flow was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, which focuses on preserving the amount of material in each cell. The method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> uses a true upwind discretization near the interface to make the interface localization accurate, and it can keep the interface stationary. All the above mentioned re-initialization methods, however, have the risk of preventing new zero contours from emerging <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, which may cause undesirable results for image segmentation, such as failures to detecting the interior boundary.</p><p>In recent years, some variational level set formulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> have been proposed to regularize the LSF during evolution, and hence the re-initialization procedure can be eliminated. These variational LSMs without re-initialization have many advantages over the traditional methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, including higher efficiency and easier implementation, etc <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Some global minimization methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> eliminate the re-initialization procedure by combining the total variational model with the Chan-Vese model <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> or the Vese-Chan's piecewise smoothing model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. However, these global minimization methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> can only be applied to some variational LSF with specific forms.</p><p>In this paper we propose a new LSM, namely the reactiondiffusion (RD) method, which is completely free of the costly re-initialization procedure. The RD equation was originally used to model the chemical mechanism of animal coats <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. It includes two processes: reaction, in which the substances are transformed into each other, and diffusion, which causes the substances to spread out over a surface in space. The RD equation was also used to describe the dynamic process in fields such as texture analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, natural image modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and phase transition modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. In particular, the RD equation in phase transition modeling is based on the Van der Waals-Cahn-Hilliard theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, which is widely used in mechanics for stability analysis of systems with unstable components (e.g., density distributions of a fluid confined to a container <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>). It has been proved that the stable configurations of the components are piecewise constant in the whole domain, and the interfaces between the segmented areas have minimal length <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. These conclusions have been used in image classification with promising results <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. However, the phase transition method cannot be directly applied to image segmentation because of the inaccurate representation of interface and the stiff parameter ε -1 in its RD equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>The joint use of phase transition and LSM has been briefly discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> aims to apply the curvaturerelated flow in phase transition to analyze the evolution driven by the curvature based force. In fact, the curvature motion based on the phase transition theory has been widely studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. For example, the classical Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> applies a linear diffusion process to a binary function to generate the mean curvature motion with a small time step; the methods in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> convolve a compactly supported Gaussian kernel (or an arbitrary positive radically symmetric kernel) with a binary function to generate similar motion (often called the convolution-generated curvature motion).</p><p>Motivated by the RD based phase transition theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, we propose to introduce a diffusion term into the conventional LSE equation, constructing an RD-LSE equation to combine the merits of phase transition and LSM. We present the unique and stable equilibrium solution of RD-LSE based on the Van der Waals-Cahn-Hilliard theory, and give the accurate representation of interface. The re-initialization procedure is completely eliminated from the proposed RD-LSM owe to the regularization of the diffusion term. A two-step splitting method (TSSM) is proposed to iteratively solve the RD equation in order to eliminate the side effect of the stiff parameter ε -1 . In the first step of TSSM, the LSE equation is iterated, while in the second step the diffusion equation is solved, ensuring the smoothness of the LSF so that the costly re-initialization procedure is not necessary at all. Though the diffusion method has been widely used in image processing, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one to apply diffusion to LSE, making it re-initialization free with a solid theoretical analysis under the RD framework. One salient advantage of the proposed method is that it can be generalized to a unified framework whose LSE equation can be either PDE-based ones or variational ones. Another advantage of RD-LSE is its higher boundary anti-leakage and antinoise capability compared with state-of-the-art methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In addition, due to the diffusion term, the LSE formulation in our method can be simply implemented by finite difference scheme instead of the upwind scheme used in traditional LSMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The proposed RD-LSE method is applied to representative ACMs such as geodesic active contours (GAC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and Chan-Vese (CV) active contours <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The results are very promising, validating the effectiveness of RD-LSE.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the background and related works. Section III presents the RD-LSM. Section IV implements RD-LSM, and analyzes the consistency between theory and implementation. Section V presents experimental results and Section VI concludes the paper.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Level Set Method</head><p>Consider a closed parameterized planar curve or surface, denoted by C( p,t):[0,1]×R + → R n , where n = 2 is for planar curve and n = 3 is for surface, and t is the artificial time generated by the movement of the initial curve or surface C 0 ( p) in its inward normal direction N .

For parametric ACMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, we can use the Lagrangian approach to getting the above evolution equation and solve it iteratively. However, the intrinsic drawback of iteratively solving Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) lies in its difficulty to handle topological changes of the moving front, such as splitting and merging <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. This problem can be avoided by using the LSM <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Consider a closed moving front C(t) = x∈ R n , which is represented by the zero level set of an LSF φ(x, t), i.e., C(t) = {x|φ(C(t), t) = 0}. Since φ(C(t),t) = 0, we can take the derivative w.r.t time t on both sides, yielding the following equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">φ t + ∇φ • C t = φ t + ∇φ • F N = 0 φ(x, t = 0) = φ 0 (x)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where gradient operator</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">∇(•) (∂(•)/∂ x 1 , ∂(•)/∂ x 2 , . . ., ∂(•)/ ∂ x n ), and φ 0 (x) is the initial LSF C 0 ( p) = {x|φ 0 (x) = 0}.</formula><p>Since the inward normal can be represented as N = -∇φ/|∇φ| <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, Eq.

In variational LSMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the LSE equation is</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">φ t = -E φ (φ) = Fδ(φ) φ(x, t = 0) = φ 0 (x) (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">)</formula><p>where E φ (φ) denotes the Gateaux derivative (or first variation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> of an energy functional E(φ), δ(φ) is the Dirac functional, and F has the form as defined in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">3</ref>).</p><p>In implementing traditional LSMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, the term F 1 in the force function F of Eq. (3) or Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">4</ref>) is usually approximated by using the upwind scheme, while the remaining can be approximated by the simple central difference scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. During evolution, the LSF may become too flat or too steep near the zero level set, causing serious numerical errors. Therefore, a procedure called reinitialization <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> is periodically employed to reshape it to be an SDF. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> Versus Without Re-initialization <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> 1) Re-Initialization: In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Osher and Sethian proposed to initialize the LSF as φ(x) = 1±dist 2 (x), where dist(•) is a distance function and "±" denotes the signs inside and outside the contour. Later, Mulder et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> initialized the LSF as φ(x) = ±dist(x), which is an SDF that can result in accurate numerical solutions. However, in evolution the LSF can become too steep or flat near the contour, leading to serious numerical errors. In order to reduce numerical errors, Chopp <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> periodically re-initialized the LSF to be an SDF. Unfortunately, this re-initialization method straightforwardly computes the SDF in the whole domain and it is very time-consuming. Chopp also proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> to restrict the re-initialization to a band of points close to the zero level set. Such a narrow band method <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> can reduce the computational complexity to some extent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Re-initialization</head><p>Many lately developed re-initialization methods do not directly compute the SDF <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> since the solution of |∇φ| = 1 is itself an SDF <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the following re-initialization equation was proposed</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">φ t + S(φ 0 )(|∇φ| -1) = 0 (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><p>where S(φ 0 ) = φ 0 / φ 2 0 + ( x) 2 , φ 0 is the initial LSF and x is the spatial step. Unfortunately, if the initial LSF φ 0 deviates much from an SDF, Eq. (5) will fail to yield a desirable final SDF <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. This problem can be alleviated by modifying S(•) as S (φ) = φ/ φ 2 + |∇φ| 2 ( x) 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. However, this method will shift the interface from its original position <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Some methods were then proposed to make the interface remain stationary during re-initialization. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> is specific to the two-phase incompressible flow by preserving the amount of material in each cell, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> uses a true upwind discretization in the neighborhood of the interface to achieve the accurate interface localization and keep the interface stationary. In summary, re-initialization has many problems, such as the expensive computational cost, blocking the emerging of new contours <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, failures when the LSF deviates much from an SDF, and inconsistency between theory and implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. Therefore, some formulations have been proposed to regularize the variational LSF to eliminate the re-initialization procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>2) Distance Regularized Level Set Evolution (DRLSE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>: In [3], Li et al. proposed a signed distance penalizing energy functional:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">P(φ) = 1 2 (|∇φ| -1) 2 dx ( 6 )</formula><p>Eq. ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) measures the closeness between an LSF φ and an SDF in the domain ⊂ R n , n = 2 or 3.

However, r 1 (φ)→ -∞ when |∇φ| →0, which may cause oscillation in the final LSF φ <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, this problem is solved by applying a new diffusion rate</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">r 2 (φ) = sin(2π|∇φ|) 2π|∇φ| , if|∇φ| ≤ 1 1 -1 |∇φ| , if|∇φ| ≥ 1<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Xie <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> also proposed a constrained level set diffusion rate as</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">r 3 (φ) = H ρ (|∇φ| -1)<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">H ρ (z) = (1/2)[1+(2/π)arctan(z/ρ)]</formula><p>and ρ is a fixed parameter. The three diffusion rates are illustrated in the left figure of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. We see that the diffusion rate in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> constrains the LSF to be an SDF, so does the one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> when |∇φ| ≥0.5. When |∇φ| ≤0.5, the diffusion rate in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> makes the LSF flat, preventing the emerging of unnecessary peaks and valleys. The diffusion rate in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> changes smoothly from 0 to 1 and makes the LSF tend to flat. The diffusion equation in Eq.

( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">10</ref>) but with different force term F, in the following of this paper we call them generalized DRLSE (GDRLSE). The GDRLSE methods using r 1 (φ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, r 2 (φ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and r 3 (φ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> are called as GDRLSE1, GDRLSE2, and GDRLSE3, respectively. In our experiments in Section V, F will be constructed by constant term and curvature term (Section V-B), edge-based force term (Section V-C), GAC force term (Section V-D), and CV force term (Section V-E), respectively.</p><p>3) Problems of GDRLSE: Although GDRLSE methods have many advantages over re-initialization methods, such as higher efficiency and easier implementation, they still have the following drawbacks. can also be extended to PDE-based LSM. However, no experiment or theoretical analysis was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. We found that these three methods cannot work well for PDE-based LSE. The reason is as follows. When applying GDRLSE methods to PDE-based LSE, we can rewrite Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">3</ref>) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">φ t = F R |∇(φ)| + F|∇(φ)|, where F R = α∇(r (φ)∇φ)/|∇(φ)|</formula><p>is the regularization force that drives zero level set to evolve. When the zero level set reaches the object boundary, the LSE force F will be close to zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and this can make the zero level set finally stop at the object boundary if the regularization force F R = 0 with r (φ) = 0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, i.e., |∇φ| = 1 when r (φ) = r 1 (φ) or r 2 (φ). However, when r (φ) = r 3 (φ), no solution satisfies r (φ) = 0 (please refer to the left image in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Thus, when the zero level set reaches the object boundary, the LSF φ may not be an SDF (i.e., |∇φ| =1), making the regularization force F R be nonzero, driving the zero level set continue to evolve, and finally causing the boundary leakage problem. Our experimental results in Section V-D also validate our above analysis (please refer to Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> in Section V-D).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Limited Anti-Leakage Capability for Weak Boundaries:</head><p>As can be seen in the middle row of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, when using δ 1,ρ and edge-based force term, GDRLSE1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, GDRLSE2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and our RD methods all can yield a satisfactory segmentation without boundary leakage. However, the good anti-leakage capability of GDRLSE1 and GDRLSE2 comes not only from their regularization term, but also from the use of Dirac functional δ 1,ρ that restricts the force function to act only in a small neighborhood of zero level set (see the red dotted line in the right figure of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Nonetheless, the use of δ 1,ρ prevents the emerging of new contours, which may make LSE fall into local minima. This is why δ 1,ρ is not used in the CV model <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. If we use the Dirac functional δ 2,ρ , the force function will act on curves at all levels, but this will easily lead to boundary leakage (see the bottom left figure in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). The PDE-based LSE can also make the force function act on curves at all levels by replacing δ 1,ρ with |∇φ| <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. By applying GDRLSE methods to PDE-based LSE, it can also be found that the boundary leakage will occur for objects with weak boundary (refer to Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> in Section V-D). The method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> uses δ 2,ρ but employs a specific force term so that it can produce good results for images with weak boundaries. If other commonly used force terms are used, however, it can be shown that the boundary leakage will easily occur (see the third figure, bottom row, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). The reason of bad performance by using δ 2,ρ in GDRLSE methods is the same as that by using |∇φ| in PDE-based LSE. 3) Sensitivity to Noise: When the image is contaminated by strong noise, the force term F in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">10</ref>) will be much distorted, and then the regularization term will fail to keep the LSF smooth. Please refer to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> in Section V-E for examples.</p></div>

REACTION-DIFFUSION (RD) BASED LEVEL SET EVOLUTION</head><p>Since the zero level is used to represent the object contour, we only need to consider the zero level set of the LSF.

However, since the diffusion process in Step 2 can make the LSF smooth while reducing to some extent the numerical error generated in Step 1, we can easily choose a proper t 1 to make the evolution stable. In all our experiments, we set t 1 = 0.1 and it works very well.</p><p>3) Discussion on the Evolution Speed: For the re-initialization methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">5</ref>) should be iterated several times to make the LSF be an SDF while keeping the zero level set stationary. This is very timeconsuming <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The GDRLSE methods are computationally much more efficient than re-initialization method. Refer to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">10</ref>), in each iteration the computation of GDRLSE includes two components: the regularization term and LSE term driven by force F. In each iteration of our RD method, the computation also includes two similar components. The only difference is that we split the computation into two steps: first compute the LSE term, and then compute the diffusion term. Therefore, the computation complexity of RD is similar to that of GDRLSE methods.</p><p>However, the zero LSE speeds of RD and GDRLSE methods are different. δ 2,ρ (φ) and |∇φ| are not zero in the neighborhood of zero level set. For GDRLSE methods, when using δ(φ) = δ 2,ρ (φ) we can rewrite Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">10</ref>) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">φ t = F R δ 2,ρ (φ) + Fδ 2,ρ (φ), where F R = α∇(r (φ)∇φ)/δ 2,ρ (φ)</formula><p>is the regularization force that drives the zero level set to evolve. When apply GDRLSE to PDE-based LSM, we can use |∇φ| instead of δ(φ), and the similar analysis holds. The zero LSE speed is determined by the total force (i.e., F R + F). However, the signs of diffusion ratios of GDRLSE1 and GDRLSE2 (refer to r 1 and r 2 in the left figure of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) may be inverse for different LSFs during LSE, and this can make the sign of regularization force F R different from that of the LSE force F (refer to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3(a)</ref>), and consequently reduce the evolution speed. When the zero level set reaches the object boundary, the LSE force F will be close to zero, and this can make the zero level set finally stop at the object boundary if F R = 0. However, when force Fis zero, the regularization force F R may not be zero, making the zero level set continue to evolve and finally causing the boundary leakage problem. Such disadvantages also exist for GDRLSE3.</p><p>In summary, we cannot set a large time step for GDRLSE methods with δ 2,ρ (φ) or |∇φ| in order to avoid boundary leakage because the time step affects both regularization force and LSE force. In all our experiments in Section V, we set time step t = 0.1 for GDRLSE methods to alleviate the boundary leakage. We set t 1 = 0.1 for the first step of our RD method, and set t 2 = 0.1 or 0.001 for the second step of RD according to the noise level in the image. The small time steps can prevent the zero level set from moving <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and the zero LSE speed is mainly determined by the force F in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>), making our RD method have better boundary anti-leakage performance than GDRLSE methods (refer to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3(b)</ref>). Overall, sometimes the zero LSE speed of RD is faster than GDRLSE because the LSE force of GDRLSE can be decreased by the regularization force; sometimes the reverse is true because the LSE force of GDRLSE can be increased by the regularization force.</p><p>Note that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, a large time step (e.g., t = 5) is set for GDRLSE1 and GDRLSE2 methods, and the LSE is very fast without obvious boundary leakage. However, the good anti-leakage capability of GDRLSE1 and GDRLSE2 comes from not only their regularization term, but also the use of Dirac functional δ 1,ρ that restricts the force function acting only in a small neighborhood of the zero level set (see the red dotted line in the right figure of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Our experimental results also validate this (refer to Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref><ref type="figure">7</ref>in Sections V-C and V-D). However, based on our experiments using the codes downloaded from <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> with default settings, it is found that there still exists the risk of boundary leakage even the Dirac functional δ 1,ρ is used in GDRLSE1 (e.g., the middle left image in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) and GDRLSE2 if a large time step such as t = 5 is set. Some examples are given at http://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/∼cslzhang/RD/RD. htm. Therefore, we set a small time step t = 0.1 in all our experiments to alleviate the boundary leakage of GDRLSE1 and GDRLSE2.</p></div>

Since the interface evolution is independent of the initial functions provided that their zero level sets are at the same position <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, the zero level set of the final steady state solution by the proposed RD method will keep unchanged.</p><p>As an example, we use the proposed RD method to implement the GAC model, and then apply it to an artificial image with interior boundary. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. We set t 2 = 0.001, which is small enough to ensure the final LSF to be a piecewise constant function. It can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4(d</ref>) that the LSF is gradually tending to be piecewise constant so that the value in each region is nearly a constant during LSE, which is consistent with Theorem 2.</p><p>For region-based models such as the CV model <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, since the data terms often take large values which weaken the effect of diffusion term, we can set a large diffusion rate to keep the LSF smooth during LSE, and hence the final LSF is often piecewise smooth (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> for examples).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Setup of Experiments</head><p>In our experiments, all the competing methods use the same level set model, while the only differences are the different regularization terms used in them. As explained in Section II-B2, we use GDRLSE1, GDRLSE2 and GDRLSE3 to represent the methods in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, respectively. The level set models used in our experiments are summarized in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>.  In the following experiments, in most cases we initialize the LSF to be a binary function whose values have positive and negative signs respectively inside and outside the contour. We set ρ = 0.5 for GDRLSE3 as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and ρ = 1 for other methods. Other parameters are set according to the different experiments. The Matlab source code of the proposed RD method and more experimental results can be found in http://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/∼cslzhang/RD/RD.htm. We first apply the RD method to PDE-based LSM to demonstrate its superior performance to re-initialization methods; second, we apply it to edge-based variational level set models and compare it with GDRLSE methods for images with weak boundaries; third, we apply the RD method to classical GAC model <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and the CV model <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> in comparison with GDRLSE and representative LSMs with re-initialization; finally, we compare RD with GDRLSE methods for the edgebased variational level set model, and the region-based CV model in efficiency. The advantages of our RD method over reinitialization methods and GDRLSE methods are summarized as follows.</p><p>1) The RD method can keep the LSE process stable for both variational LSM and PDE-based LSM (refer to Figs. 5 in Section V-B). 2) In the edge-based models, for variational LSM with δ 2,ρ , in general our RD method has better boundary antileakage ability than GDRLSE methods (refer to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> in Section V-C). For the PDE-based GAC model, the boundary anti-leakage performance of our RD method is much better than re-initialization method and GDRLSE methods (refer to Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> in Section V-D). This is because in RD-LSE only the LSE force F drives the zero level set to evolve (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>(b)), while for GDRLSE methods the regularization force F R may be nonzero at the object boundary and drive the zero level set passing the object boundary (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3(a)</ref>). 3) For region-based LSM such as the CV model, our RD method has better anti-noise performance than the re-initialization method and GDRLSE methods (refer to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> in Section V-E).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Experiments With Edge-Based Variational LSM</head><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the Dirac functional is approximated by δ 1,ρ and the force term is F = λdiv(g(|∇ I |)∇φ/|∇φ|)+νg(|∇ I |), where λ and ν are fixed parameters and g(|∇ I |) is an edge indicator function. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, δ 1,ρ is used, and GDRLSE1, GDRLSE2 and the proposed RD lead to similar results. As explained in Section II-B3, to validate more comprehensively the performance of a method, other Dirac functional should also be considered. In this sub-section, we approximate the Dirac functional by δ 2,ρ and compare RD with GDRLSE methods on images with weak boundaries. Our experiments validate that the boundary anti-leakage performance of GDRLSE methods is much affected by the Dirac functional.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> shows some segmentation results by RD and GDRLSE methods for edge-based variational LSM with δ 2,ρ . The test images are two magnetic resonance images of the left ventricle of a human heart. For the first image, both RD and GDRLSE3 yield satisfying segmentation results without much boundary leakage, but GDRLSE1 and GDRLSE2 lead to serious boundary leakage because the boundary of this image is very weak and blurred. For the other image, both RD and GDRLSE1 generate satisfying results. However, for GDRLSE2 and GDRLSE3, the LSE falls into local minima because the image data force terms are significantly affected by the noisy objects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Experiments With the PDE-Based GAC Model</head><p>In the LSE equation (refer to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">3</ref>)) of GAC model <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, there is F = div(g(|∇ I |)∇φ/|∇φ|)+νg(|∇ I |), where g(|∇ I |) is an edge indicator function and v is a fixed parameter. The LSE equation of GAC model is PDE-based. We adapted the GDRLSE methods to the GAC model and compared them with our RD method. Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> shows the segmentation results on a noisy synthetic image with weak boundaries. The re-initialization method <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> can keep the LSF smooth during LSE, and hence reduce the numerical error to some extent. However, the reinitialization will move the zero level set away from its original position, resulting in boundary leakage <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. (In order to be consistent with the traditional LSMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, we initialized the LSF to be an SDF for the reinitialization method.) As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, the RD method results in a very good segmentation without boundary leakage, and the final LSF can be approximated as a piecewise constant function with constant values inside and outside the contours. This is again consistent with what is claimed in Theorem 2. For GDRLSE1, some contours occur inside the object during evolution because |∇φ| acts on all level curves, making the LSF evolve in the whole domain and produce false peaks and valleys. For GDRLSE2, obvious boundary leakage occurs. This is also because in the LSE equation of GAC model in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, δ(φ) is replaced by |∇φ| which acts on all level curves, leading to boundary leakage. Similarly, boundary leakage occurs for GDRLSE3.</p><p>We also tested some images from the Coral dataset [59], and the results can be found at the website associated with this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Experiments With the CV Model</head><p>The CV model <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> is a simplified Mumford-Shah model <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[60]</ref>, which assumes that the image is piecewise constant. The LSE equation of the CV model is in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">4</ref>), where F = μdiv(∇φ/|∇φ|)-ν-λ 1 (Ic in (φ)) 2 + λ 2 (Ic out (φ)) 2 , μ,ν ≥0; λ 1 ,λ 2 &gt;0 are fixed parameters, c in (φ) and c out (φ) are average intensity inside and outside zero level set, respectively. The Dirac functional is approximated by δ 2,ρ defined in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</p><p>In implementing the LSE equation, the re-initialization is optional <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. However, without re-initialization the LSF will become unsmooth during LSE, especially when the image is noisy, and hence serious numerical error can occur. Therefore, in the following experiments, we mainly compare the RD method with the re-initialization method <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and the three GDRLSE methods.</p><p>1) Experiments on Noisy Images: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> shows the segmentation results on a real image with noisy background. The noisy background results in big numerical errors for methods without re-initialization, making the LSF fail to evolve stably. For the re-initialization method <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, it fails to re-initialize the LSF to be an SDF because of the strong noise. As shown in the left second column of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>, the RD method can still yield desirable results, and the final LSF keeps smooth. This is because the diffusion procedure in the second step of our RD algorithm can reduce the error produced by the LSE in the first step effectively. Since we used a large diffusion rate t 2 = 0.1, the final LSF is nearly piecewise smooth. The GDRLSE1 method falls into local minima because the noisy background makes the regularization term invalid, and there exist some spikes in the final LSF. The GDRLSE2 method yields similar results to GDRLSE1, because the large gradient of the LSF caused by the noisy force term makes the two different regularization terms in GDRLSE1 and GDRLSE2 perform nearly the same (please refer to the definitions of r 1 and r 2 in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">7</ref>) and Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">8</ref>), respectively, and we can see that when |∇φ| is large, r 1 and r 2 are the same). For GDRLSE3, the final segmentation result is very noisy because the diffusion rate r 3 (φ) = H ρ (|∇φ|-1) changes smoothly from 0 to 1, which limits its regularization capability. More experimental results on some real images can be found in the website of this paper.</p><p>2) Demonstration of Global Minimum: To further demonstrate that our RD method with the CV model can reach the global minimum while being robust to level set initializations, we apply it to a noisy synthetic image with different level set initializations, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>. The zero contours can be set outside the objects, around all the objects, cross some objects or even inside one object. Although these initializations are very different, the final contours are almost the same, which validates that our RD method can robustly evolve to the global minimum of the energy functional, leading a good global segmentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Efficiency Experiments</head><p>At last, let's compare the efficiency of our RD method with other GDRLSE methods in terms of converged iterations and CPU time. All the competing methods are run under Matlab R2010a programming environment in a desktop with Windows XP OS, Pentium Dual-Core 2.10 GHz CPU and 1.95 GB RAM. From our extensive experiments, we observed that only the edge-based models with Dirac functional δ 1,ρ can yield good results for most GDRLSE methods. Moreover, by using the CV model the GDRLSE methods can lead to good results. Therefore, we evaluate the efficiency for edgebased models with Dirac functional δ 1,ρ and the CV model.  It should be noted that different parameter settings and level set initializations will affect much the efficiency of LSE. For a fair comparison, we choose the synthetic images in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> for evaluation since all the competing methods can yield favorable results on them. We tune the parameters for each method so that their best results can be obtained. The comparison results are illustrated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>. It can be seen that in average the RD method achieves the best performance in terms of both iterations and CPU time. In summary, the proposed RD method has high computational efficiency while having high segmentation accuracy and robustness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we proposed a reaction-diffusion (RD) based level set evolution (LSE), which is completely free of the re-initialization procedure required by traditional level set methods. A two-step-splitting-method (TSSM) was then proposed to effectively solve the RD based LSE. The proposed RD method can be generally applied to either variational level set methods or PDE-based level set methods. It can be implemented by using the simple finite difference scheme. The RD method has the following advantages over the traditional level set method and state-of-the-art algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. First, the RD method is general, which can be applied to the PDE-based level set methods and variational ones. Second, the RD method has much better performance on weak boundary anti-leakage. Third, the implementation of the RD equation is very simple and it does not need the upwind scheme at all. Fourth, the RD method is robust to noise. The experiments on synthetic and real images demonstrated the promising performance of our approach.</p><p>Motivated by the convolution-generated curvature motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> in phase transitions, the diffusion procedure in our TSSM algorithm can also be replaced by convolving any positive, radically symmetric kernel with a small enough width. Actually we have used a Gaussian kernel to regularize the level set function in our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, we utilized a constant kernel to regularize two level set functions and achieved promising results. This implies that the RD method can be readily extended to multiphase level set method based on the theory of phase transitions in mixtures of Cahn-Hilliard fluids <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. </p></div>

Proof: It is very easy to validate this theorem. The energy functional E(φ) is a constant when φ is chosen. Therefore, F(φ) = E(φ)dx= E(φ)S , where S is the area of the domain which is a constant. Thus, it is easy to yield the conclusion E φ (φ)= F φ (φ).</figDesc></figure>
