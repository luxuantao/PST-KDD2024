<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Monetary incentive is often used to encourage user-generated content (UGC) contribution in many UGC platforms. Empirical studies, however, reported contradictory results with regard to the impact of monetary incentive. We build a theoretical model to study the impact of monetary incentive on UGC contribution, where four types of contributors (classified by whether they are intrinsically-motivated and whether they produce efficiently) compete for audience attention, and the introduction of monetary incentive either positively or negatively modifies contributors' intrinsic reward. We identify two types of crowding in/out effect-the motivation crowd in/out, and the competition crowd in/out. Under the influence of these two types of crowd in/out effects, an increase in the monetary incentive has a non-monotonic impact on the market structure, total content volume as well as the overall quality of content contributed. As a result, different market equilibrium outcomes emerge with an increase in the monetary incentive. Our findings offer guidelines in designing monetary incentive schemes to achieve different market outcomes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, online community becomes more and more essential in people's daily life (such as Wikipedia, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and various online forums or review sites) as well as business practice (such as the knowledge sharing systems, co-creation forums, open-source software communities.) An increasing number of companies, including Apple, Oracle, SAP, and SUN, adopt online user forums, to offer platforms for users to contribute solutions to other users' questions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Jabr et al. 2013)</ref>, or to collect usergenerated creative ideas and product designs. These online communities heavily rely on users to contribute contents (such as product reviews, blogs, music, pictures, videos, answers, knowledge, etc.) Therefore, it becomes a critical issue for these businesses to encourage users to contribute.</p><p>Monetary incentives are often introduced to encourage contribution. For example, YouTube, About.com, Break, and Epinions pay users for their contributions in the form of advertising-revenue sharing schemes <ref type="bibr">(Tang et al. 2012a</ref>); many companies use cash awards to encourage employees to contribute knowledge to their electronic knowledge repositories <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Garud and Kumaraswamy 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kankanhalli et al. 2005)</ref>. For example, Infosys (NASDAQ: INFY), a global software services company, offers KCUs (knowledge currency units, which can be exchanged for cash) to its employees for contributing knowledge to its knowledge portal <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Garud and Kumaraswamy 2005)</ref>. Some companies also use monetary rewards to compensate their consumers for contributing in co-creation forums, such as Lego's Cuusoo platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Antorini et al. 2012)</ref>, Siemens' ShareNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Voelpel et al. 2005)</ref> etc. The objectives of using monetary incentives include attracting more contributors, generating more content, and improving content quality.</p><p>However, the empirical results on the impact of monetary incentives on UGC contribution are mixed. On one hand, based on standard economic theory, monetary incentives induce more effort and higher performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gneezy et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kreps 1997)</ref>, which is a "standard price effect" or even "law of behavior" <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gneezy et al. 2011</ref>). Some empirical evidences on the impact of monetary incentives on UGC contribution show that monetary incentives may (1) attracting more contributors <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Garud and Kumaraswamy 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Ogawa 2014</ref>); (2) improving the contribution volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Garud and Kumaraswamy 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Roberts et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tang et al. 2012b)</ref>; and (3) improving the contribution quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Sun and Zhu 2013)</ref>. On the other hand, researchers also find that introducing monetary incentive does not always guarantee improved outcomes (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Frey and Jegen 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gneezy et al. 2011, for surveys)</ref>. Monetary incentive may sometimes "backfire" <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Fehr and Falk 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lepper et al. 1973)</ref>. Empirical evidences also show that monetary incentive (1) crowding out some contributors <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ma et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sun et al. 2013);</ref><ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> reducing the total contribution, (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ariely et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gneezy and Rustichini 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Titmuss 1970</ref>); (3) reducing the contribution quality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Garud and Kumaraswamy 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mason and Watts 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Zhang et al. 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Due to the complex relationship between monetary incentive and UGC contribution, it is suggested to build models to examine "when and why" incentives work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kreps 1997)</ref>. Unfortunately, little research has been done to address this research problem. On one hand, the limited number of theoretical models on UGC contribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ghosh and McAfee 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ma et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Zhang and Sarvary 2014)</ref> do not focus on the effect of monetary incentives on UGC contribution. On the other, it is not appropriate to adopt traditional models which study the impact of monetary incentive on prosocial behavior (e.g., the salient model developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">B?nabou and Tirole (2006)</ref>) to the UGC contribution context. UGC contribution is fundamentally different from prosocial behavior: UGC contributor's intrinsic reward is correlated with the audience's attention (e.g., viewing, reading) and even interaction (e.g., "like", comment). So, there exists competition among contributors for limited audience attention. Such competition is absent in prosocial behavior.</p><p>In this paper, we build a model to examine the impact of monetary incentive on UGC contribution and to offer explanations to the contradictory findings in the literature. We not only consider the interaction between intrinsic reward of content contribution and monetary incentive, but also incorporate the competition among contributors for audience attention. We consider four types of contributors-classified by whether they are intrinsically-motivated to contribute, and whether they are efficient in producing content.</p><p>These four types of contributors respond to monetary incentive differently. We identify two types of crowding in/out effects associated with monetary incentives. More specifically, when monetary incentives are introduced (from zero to positive), it affects contributors' intrinsic motivation dramatically. Contributors may be crowded in or out, or their contribution volume may change dramatically. We refer this as the "Motivation Crowd In/Out." When there already exists monetary incentive, an increase in the monetary incentive may attract in contributors with higher quality or efficiency, while driving out contributors with lower quality or efficiency. We call this "Competition Crowd In/Out." Under the influence of these two types of Crowd In/Out effects, an increase in the monetary incentive has a non-monotonic impact on the market structure, total contribution volume as well as the overall quality of content contributed. As a result, different market equilibria emerge, depending on parameter values such as the difference between the contributors, as well as the quality control associated with the monetary incentive. Our findings offers guidelines in designing an appropriate monetary incentive scheme to achieve different market outcomes. We also discuss practical implications of our research results.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this paper makes the first effort to model the impact of monetary incentive on UGC contribution. We consider not only the interaction between monetary incentive and contributors' intrinsic incentive, but also the competition among contributors, which is not covered in the studies of prosocial behavior. In addition, besides the total market contribution, we also examine other market performance measures such as market structure and quality level in the market. This remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related literature; Section 3 describes the model setup; Section 4 describes the benchmark model with monetary incentive without quality control; Section 5 extends the model by adding quality control. Section 6 discusses the practical implications of the theoretical findings.</p><p>Finally, Section 7 discusses the results, limitations, and further research directions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">UGC</head><p>A common definition of UGC is "any form of content such as blogs, wikis, discussion forums, posts, chats, tweets, podcasting, pins, digital images, video, audio files, and other forms of media that was created by users of an online system or service, often made available via social media websites" <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Moens et al. 2014)</ref>. According to the related literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ghose et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Goes et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Goh et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Levina and Arriaga 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lukyanenko et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Susarla et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Zhang and Sarvary 2014)</ref>, UGC has several characteristics: (1) the content is digital content, rather than material content; (2) UGC is in general free to access, thus is one type of "public goods" <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Zhang and Zhu 2010)</ref>; and (3) the contributors need to compete for audience <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Huang et al. 2015)</ref>.</p><p>According to the "public goods" theory, the UGC users are able to "take free ride": The famous "1% rule" indicates that only 1% of the users actively contribute, while the other 99% of the users just "lurk" (van Mierlo 2014). But why do the contributors contribute UGC? It is found that both intrinsic motivation and extrinsic incentive can influence UGC contribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gneezy et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kreps 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">McKenzie et al. 2012)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lee et al. (2013)</ref> find that the users of a pay-for-answer Q&amp;A service contribute answers by financial incentives and intrinsic motives. There is no consistent classification of intrinsic motivations and extrinsic incentives <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(McKenzie et al. 2012</ref>). The intrinsic reward may include reputation, interpersonal ties, direct reciprocity, and enjoyment <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Wasko and Faraj 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Zhang and Zhu 2010)</ref>. The common practice of extrinsic incentive is usually monetary incentive which is correlated to the audience attracted or the ratings received (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Antorini et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mason and Watts 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tang et al. 2012b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Voelpel et al. 2005)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Mixed Findings of the Impact of Monetary incentive</head><p>The empirical results on the impact of monetary incentives on UGC contribution is mixed. <ref type="bibr">Gibson (2012)</ref> claims that monetary compensation is not the best way to enhance the overall output within an online co-creation community. Aguinis et al. ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) also claim that "monetary rewards do not always lead to these desirable outcomes." In detail, researchers find the mixed findings of the impact of monetary incentives in three perspectives: the contributors, the volume of contribution, and the quality of contribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>? Contributors</head><p>Empirical studies find monetary incentive could both attract more contributors or crowd out contributors <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gneezy et al. 2011)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Garud and Kumaraswamy (2005)</ref> find that the monetary incentive of the knowledge sharing system in InfoSys attracted nearly 20 percent of employees to contribute knowledge. <ref type="bibr">Sun et al. (2013)</ref> utilize a natural experiment and find that monetary incentive moderately increase the contributions of the some contributors, but decreases the contributions of some other contributors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ma et al. (2009)</ref> study the impact of monetary incentive and find that higher monetary incentive may attract some contributors to an UGC platform while drive away some other contributors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>? Volume of Contribution</head><p>The findings on the impact of monetary incentive on contribution volume is also mixed.</p><p>On one hand, there are a lot of well-documented cases which show that "monetary incentive works" <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kreps 1997)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Becker et al. (2010)</ref> find that monetary incentive can increase the adoption of online communities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Roberts et al. (2006)</ref> find that paid participation lead to above-average contribution levels. Using data collected from YouTube, <ref type="bibr">Tang et al. (2012b)</ref> show that revenue sharing program can motivate content contribution. On the other hand, there are also a lot of "opponents" who believe that monetary incentive may "backfire" <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(McKenzie et al. 2012)</ref>. A lot of evidences were found that monetary incentive negatively affect the contribution (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Deci et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Frey and Jegen 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gneezy et al. 2011</ref> for surveys), which show a "crowding-out effect": the phenomena that "raising monetary incentive reduces, rather than increases, supply <ref type="bibr">" (p.590, Frey and Jegen 2001)</ref>. Monetary incentive may lead to lessened levels of quality-weighted effort and lower net profits <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kreps 1997)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lin and Huang (2013)</ref> compared two Q&amp;A online forums Google Answers and Yahoo! Kimo Knowledge+, and conclude that Google Answers failed with its monetary incentive but Knowledge+ success with its virtual rewarding mechanism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>? Contribution Quality</head><p>Contribution quality is another major concern of UGC platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chen et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ma et al. 2009)</ref>. Some researchers find a positive effect of monetary incentive on contribution quality. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Sun and Zhu (2013)</ref> find that the blog content quality of a Chinese portal site significantly increased after the contributors join the ad-revenue-sharing program. However, more researchers find non-significant or even negative effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Wang et al. (2012)</ref> find that there are no significant quality differences between paid and unpaid reviews. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Moon and Park (2002)</ref> find that the contributions motivated by the reward systems are not guaranteed to be of good quality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mason and Watts (2010)</ref> find that increased financial incentives increase the quantity but not the quality of the work performed by participants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Ogawa (2014)</ref> compares two similar recipe websites Rakuten Recipe (offering monetary incentive) and CookPad (offers no monetary incentive), and finds a relatively lower content quality of the Rakuten Recipe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Possible Reasons of the Mixed Findings</head><p>To understand mixed findings about the impact of monetary incentive on UGC contribution, several possible explanations are mentioned in the literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>? The Interaction between Intrinsic Motivation and Monetary Incentive</head><p>A lot of researchers find that monetary incentive interacts with intrinsic motivations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fehr and Falk 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Frey and Jegen 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">McKenzie et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Roberts et al. 2006</ref>). On the one hand, monetary incentive may crowd out intrinsic motivations which are important to producing desired behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gneezy et al. 2011)</ref>. This is known as the "motivation crowding out effect", or "over-justification effect" <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lepper et al. 1973)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kreps (1997)</ref> asserts that providing monetary incentive could be counterproductive, because it may destroy workers' intrinsic motivation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">B?nabou and Tirole (2006)</ref> indicate that providing rewards to foster prosocial behavior may have a perverse effect and reduce the total contribution. A lot of empirical studies also show that monetary incentive have negative impacts on prosocial behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ariely et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Frey and Oberholzer-Gee 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gneezy and Rustichini 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mellstr?m and Johannesson 2008)</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, monetary incentive may positively impact the intrinsic motivation, thus the marginal benefit of performance further increases beyond the standard price effect. This is known as the "motivation crowding in effect". In the context of UGC contribution, contributors may be proud of the ability of earning money through contributing. For example, Michelle Phan was a no-name YouTuber in 2008. She posted hundreds of makeup videos, attracted a lot of viewers and earned advertising revenue. Now she is Lanc?me's first video makeup artist, and an idol of successful contributor on YouTube <ref type="bibr">(Tang et al. 2012b)</ref>. Therefore, when study the impact of monetary incentive on UGC contribution, both crowding in and out effect should be considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>? The Amount of Monetary Incentive</head><p>Empirical studies show that the amount of monetary incentive may play a key role. First, introducing a small monetary incentive is found to be sufficient to cause a sharp reduction of contribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(B?nabou and Tirole 2006)</ref>. This is because when a small monetary incentive is introduced, the contributors switch from "unprofitable" to "profitable", which may be interpreted as "greedy", so they reduce their contribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(B?nabou and Tirole 2006)</ref>. Mathematically, it is suggested that "zero is special", i.e., the impact of monetary incentive on contribution is discontinuous at zero point <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(B?nabou and Tirole 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gneezy et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Second, a sufficiently large monetary incentive is found to have a positive impact. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gneezy et al. (2011)</ref> speculate that if monetary incentive are large enough, the "positive standard price effect" will be larger than the potential negative crowding out effect, thus show an overall positive effect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gneezy and Rustichini (2000)</ref> conduct a field experiment which require high school students to collect donations. They find that the students who receive a small compensation perform worse than the students who are not compensated; however, the students who receive a relatively big compensation perform better than the students who receive a small compensation.</p><p>Following this line of literature, the impact of the monetary incentive should be studied in two steps: (1) the introduction of a small monetary incentive, i.e., "from zero to small";</p><p>(2) the increasing of monetary incentive, i.e., "from small to large".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>? Contributors React to Monetary Incentive Differently</head><p>Some empirical studies find that contributors have different reactions to monetary incentives, so that monetary incentive may work for some people, but may not for the others <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gneezy et al. 2011</ref>). In the InfoSys case <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Garud and Kumaraswamy 2005)</ref>, introducing a monetary incentive attracted the contributors who "just to secure monetary rewards". <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kreps (1997)</ref> argues that the crowding out effect applies only to the employees who have high initial levels of intrinsic motivation. <ref type="bibr">Sun et al. (2013)</ref> find that monetary incentive moderately increase the contributions of the loners (those who have no connections with other contributors), but decreases the contributions of the socialites (those who have many connections with other contributors).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>? Different Quality Control</head><p>The quality of UGC varies "drastically from excellent to abuse and spam", thus quality control is vital for UGC platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(McKenzie et al. 2012)</ref>. Interestingly, quality control will not only influence the contribution quality, but also the contribution volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Mason and Watts 2010)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ghosh and McAfee (2011)</ref> build a game-theoretic model to study the effect of exposure as incentive on UGC contribution. They find that when exposure is independent with quality, there will be a lot of low quality contributions in the equilibrium.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Related Models</head><p>In summary, the impact of monetary incentive on UGC contribution is still confusing due to the mixed findings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ariely et al. (2009)</ref> indicate that "less is known, however, about the mechanisms by which this unintended consequence occurs." <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kreps (1997)</ref> indicates that there is a need to develop theoretical models to understand when and why monetary incentive works.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, little theoretical research has been done to study the impact of monetary incentive on UGC contribution. The most related model is the prosocial behavior model developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">B?nabou and Tirole (2006)</ref>, which shows that extrinsic incentives could interact with a contributor's image concern, thus may negatively correlated with the contribution of prosocial behavior. However, since it focuses on the prosocial behavior, without considering the competition between the contributors, thus is not proper to be directly adopted into the UGC contribution context.</p><p>There are several game-theoretic models which study the UGC-related problems. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ghosh and McAfee (2011)</ref> develop a model to study whether the contributors will contribute high quality content when they are motivated by exposure. However, their model did not consider monetary incentive. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ma et al. (2009)</ref> study the impact of quality control on UGC contribution. In their model, two UGC platforms (one control quality while the other not) compete with each other for users. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Zhang and Sarvary (2014)</ref> develop a model which discusses competition between UGC platforms. These models do not focus on the effect of monetary incentive on UGC contribution, thus cannot offer a comprehensive explanation on the mixed findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The Benchmark Model without Monetary Incentive</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The Contributors</head><p>We classify the contributors by two dimensions: (1) the quality dimension: contributors can be either Intrinsically-motivated (?) or Non-intrinsically-motivated (? ?</p><p>). The intrinsically-motivated contributors contribute higher quality content than the nonintrinsically-motivated contributors do <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Garud and Kumaraswamy 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lou et al. 2013</ref>);</p><p>(2) the quantity dimension: Contributors can be either Production-efficient (?) or Nonproduction-efficient (? ? ). The production-efficient contributors contribute more content with one unit of effort than the non-production-efficient contributors <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lee et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Pal et al. 2012)</ref>. A production-efficient contributor may not produce high-quality content. For example, a contributor can simply produce (such as copy and paste) many contents in popular topics (such as stock market, salacious content, and celebrities gossip) and attracts a lot of attention, while those contents are not necessarily of high-quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Sun and Zhu 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Let ? ? represent the effort of the intrinsically-motivated contributors to contribute one unit of UGC, and ? ? represent that of the non-intrinsically-motivated contributors,</p><p>where ? ? &gt; ? ? . Given the same effort ? (? ? 0), the intrinsically-motivated contributors contribute less content than the non-intrinsically-motivated contributors</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( ? ? ? &lt; ? ? ?</formula><p>). This is consistent with the empirical findings that the intrinsically-motivated contributors contribute higher quality content but with lower quantity than the non-intrinsically motivated contributors, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Garud and Kumaraswamy 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lou et al. 2013)</ref>. Assume that the non-production-efficient contributors produces ? (0 &lt; ? &lt; 1) less content than the production-efficient contributor does, so that if the production-efficient contributor contributes 1 unit of content, the non-production-efficient contributor contribute (1 -?)</p><p>unit of content with the same effort.</p><p>Therefore, we classify the contributors into 4 types. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> demonstrates the conceptual model of these four types of contributors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1, the Four Types of Contributors</head><p>Then we are able to calculate the quantity of contents of these four types of contributors.</p><p>Let ? ? denote contributor type ?'s content volume, then we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">? ?? = ? ?? ? ? , ? ?? ? = (1-?)? ?? ? ? ? , ? ? ? ? = ? ? ? ? ? ?</formula><p>, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">? ?? ??? = (1-?)? ?? ???? ? ?</formula><p>.

The direct standard price effect is widely acknowledged in the economics literature. It is recognized as a basic "law of behavior" that higher monetary incentive will lead to higher marginal benefit or lower marginal cost, thus will lead to more effort and better performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Frey and Jegen 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gneezy et al. 2011)</ref>. In practice, a monetary reward can be given based on the market share that the content generates. For example, YouTube's "Advertisement Sharing Plan" pays monetary rewards according to the number of views that the video attracts. It can be also based on the quality of the content being contributed. For example, the more "likes" or "helpful comments" or the higher rating attracted, the higher the payment. We first consider the simplest case that the monetary incentive is proportional to the market share where ? &gt; 0. We extend this assumption in section 5 by incorporating quality based incentive.</p><p>Besides the direct standard price effect, monetary incentive may also have an indirect psychological effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gneezy et al. 2011)</ref>. The indirect psychological effect could be either positive or negative (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alexy and Leitner 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Roberts et al. 2006)</ref>, i.e., the monetary incentive may modify the intrinsic motivations of contribution.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 3, Equilibrium Cases and Conditions</head><p>Proposition 1 shows that different level of monetary incentive and other parameters corresponds to different equilibrium, each corresponding to a scenario with different contributors as well as contribution volume in the market. Each of the 6 equilibria has its own advantages/weakness. For example, the "all contributors participate" equilibrium (Case 1) has the most contributors (variety), which may be desired by a UGC platform at its early stage ; the "purely intrinsically-motivated" equilibrium (Case 4) has the highest quality content, which may be preferred by an internal knowledge repository within an organization (InfoSys, for example). The "purely non-intrinsically motivated" equilibrium (Case 13) produces the lowest quality content; and the "purely productionefficient" equilibrium (Case 6) represents the highest production efficiency.</p><p>Moreover, Proposition 1 also implies that, when the level of monetary incentive changes, the equilibrium may change from one case to another, and some contributors enter into or quit from the market. This may cause the change in the market structure, total contribution volume, as well as the overall contribution quality. In the following section we discuss the shift of equilibrium when the conditions changes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Equilibrium Shifts</head><p>Note that all the inequalities in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> are related to the parameters ?, ? ? and ?. Recall that the parameter ? describes the difference of the productivities between a productive contributor and a non-productive contributor, which is assumed to be exogenous in this model. The parameter ? ? represents the modified intrinsic reward from contributing contents, which is commonly assumed to be exogenous too, because it is difficult to influence or control by the sponsor <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Frey and Jegen 2001)</ref>. The monetary incentive ? can be easily manipulated. Therefore, we focus on the impact of ? given ? and ? ? (the details are in Appendix A-4).</p><p>We discuss the equilibrium shift when ? ? ? 0 and ? ? &lt; 0 seperately. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows how the equilibrium change as the monetary incentive increases when the modified monetary incentive ? ? is no-negative. As shown in the subfigure 2(1), when the monetary incentive increases, the equilibrium shifts from the "Case NMI" (No Monetary Incentive),</p><p>to "Case 4" (?? and ?? ? contribute), then to "Case 2" (? ? ? enters), then to "Case 1" (?? ??? enters so that all contributors contribute, when ? &lt; 1 2 ? ) or "Case 6" (?? ? is crowded out from the market so that only the production-efficient contributors contribute, when ? ? 1 2 ? ). Note that in this scenario, there are no further cases after Case 1 and Case 6, i.e., the equilibrium sticks to these cases and does not shift when the monetary incentive further increases. We call such cases Ultimate Case, indicated by the semi-loops with arrows in the subfigure 2(1). The subfigure 2(2) and 2(3) show the change of market shares corresponding to the subfigure 2(1) when ? &lt; 1 2 ? and ? ? 1 2 ? separately.  Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows the equilibrium change as the monetary incentive increases when the modified monetary incentive ? ? is negative. After comparing the equilibrium shift when ? ? &lt; 0 (subfigure 3(1)) and ? ? ? 0 (subfigure 2(1)), we find that they both start from the No Monetary Incentive Cases (NMI) and end with Case 1 or Case 6; however, as highlighted in subfigure 3(1), the shift of equilibrium is different.</p><p>Interestingly, when a small monetary incentive is introduced (i.e., when the monetary incentive increases from 0), the change of market shares is not continuous: all the intrinsically-motivated contributors (?? and ?? ? ) are crowded out from the market, and the non-intrinsically-motivated contributors (? ? ? and ?? ??? ) enter the market. This illustrates a "market turnover". Intuitively, when ?? &lt; 0, intrinsically-motivated contributors incur a loss. If this loss can not be offset by the small amount of monetary incentive, the intrinsically-motivated contributors will quite the market. The non-intrinsically-motivated contributors enjoy the positive monetary incentive while their intrinsic reward is not affected (zero), so they enter the market.  Combining the scenarios when ? ? ? 0 and ? ? &lt; 0, we have the following proposition:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposition 2 (Equilibrium Shifts):</head><p>With an increase in the monetary incentive, contributors may be attracted to or crowded out of the contribution market, depending on the level of monetary incentive ?, modified intrinsic reward ? ? , as well as the difference in the productivities ?. Specifically, (a) If the modified intrinsic reward is positive ( ? ? ? 0 ,) as the monetary incentive increases, the equilibrium shifts from case 4 (purely intrinsically-motivated ?? and ?? ? ), to case 2 (? ? ? joins), then to case 1 (?? ??? joins, when ? &lt; 1 2 ? ) or case 6 (?? ? quits, when ? &gt; 1 2 ? ).</p><p>(b) If the modified intrinsic reward is negative ( ? ? &lt; 0 ,) as the monetary incentive increases, the equilibrium shifts from case 13 (purely non-intrinsically-motivated ? ? ? and ?? ??? ), to case 5 (?? joins), then to case 1 (?? ? joins, when ? &lt; 1 2 ? ) or case 6 (?? ??? quits, when ? &gt; 1 2 ? ).</p><p>Proposition 2 shows that, raising the monetary incentive can both attract in and crowd out certain types of contributors. More specifically:</p><p>(1) The ultimate cases are either Case 1 (all in) or Case 6 (purely production-efficient).</p><p>Case 1 (all in) is possible only when ? &lt; 1 2 ? , i.e., when the difference in the production efficiencies is small, which implies that the four types of contributors are similar. Case 6 (purely production-efficient) is possible only when ? ? 1 2 ? , i.e., the difference in the production efficiencies is large. Under this condition the production-efficient contributors produces a lot more content than the non-production-efficient ones, and they crowd out the non-production-efficient contributors when there is a large monetary incentive.</p><p>(2) Among all the cases, ?? is present the most of times (absent only in Case 13). This is because ?? is the dominant contributor in the market: it contributes high quality content and has high production efficiency. The only reason for it not to be in the market is when it suffers from the negative intrinsic reward when the monetary incentive is first introduced (Case 13). However, when the monetary incentive is large enough to offset this negative intrinsic reward, the contributor ?? will be attracted back into the market.</p><p>(3) Among all the cases, ?? ??? appears the least of times among all the contributors. This is because ?? ??? is the weakest contributor in the market: it contributes low quality content and has low production efficiency. The contributor ?? ??? can join the market either when the market "welcomes" all the contributors (Case 1) or when the intrinsically-motivated contributors suffers from the negative intrinsic reward (Case 13 and Case 5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Total Content Volume</head><p>Now we discuss the impact of monetary incentive on the total content volume. Note that the impact of monetary incentive on market share can be non-continuous when the monetary incentive changes from zero to positive. We classify monetary incentive as Zero, Small and Large, and study the impact of the monetary incentive in two steps: (1) the introduction of a small monetary incentive, i.e., from no monetary incentive to a small monetary incentive; (2) the increasing of monetary incentive, i.e., from a small to large monetary incentive.</p><p>From Lemma 1, the total content volume when there is no monetary incentive is ? =</p><p>(1-?)?</p><p>(2-?) .

(2-?) &gt; (1-?)?</formula><p>(2-?) (note that ? ? = ? + ? &gt; ? and ? = 0 + ). This is known as the motivation crowding in effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Frey and Jegen 2001)</ref>. If there is no modification on the intrinsic reward (? = 0), the total market contribution will be</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">(1-?)?</formula><p>(2-?) + 0 + , which is nearly no change. If the modification of intrinsic reward ? is negative yet ? ? = ? + ? &gt; 0, the total market contribution drops to</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">(1-?)(? ? +?) (2-?) &lt; (1-?)? (2-?)

(2-?) &lt; (1-?)?</formula><p>(2-?) . Since ? = 0 + , there is barely market contribution. This is consistent with the motivation crowding out effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Frey and Jegen 2001)</ref>. Therefore, we have the following proposition:</p><p>Proposition 3 (Motivation Crowding In/Out):</p><p>When a small monetary incentive is introduced, the total market contribution could either increase or reduce:</p><p>(a) when the monetary incentive is associated with a positive modification on the intrinsic motivation, the total market contribution increases;</p><p>(b) when there is no modification on the intrinsic motivation, the total market contribution remains unchanged;</p><p>(c) when the modification is negative, the total market contribution reduces, and may even drop to close to 0. when a small monetary incentive is introduced, either a "crowding in" or "crowding out" can happen, depending on the modification of the intrinsic reward by the monetary incentive. The "crowding in effect" is observed if the monetary incentive is perceived to enhance the intrinsic reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Frey and Jegen 2001)</ref>, e.g., the ability to make money via contributing content is a good thing and admirable <ref type="bibr">(Tang et al. 2012b</ref>); the "crowding out effect" is observed if the monetary incentive breaks certain established social norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Titmuss 1970)</ref> or social reputation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(B?nabou and Tirole 2006)</ref>, e.g., the contributors may not want to be perceived to be greedy when contribution is paid <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(B?nabou and Tirole 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The market contribution could even dramatically disappear when the monetary incentive is small.</p><p>Proposition 3 shows that either a "crowding in effect" or a "crowding out effect" may happen when a small monetary incentive is introduced. What happens when the monetary incentive keeps increasing? As proved in the Appendix, when ? &gt; 0, we can get ?? ?? &gt; 0.</p><p>Therefore, we have,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 2 (Standard Price Effect):</head><p>A higher monetary incentive leads to a higher total content volume.</p><p>Lemma 2 shows a theoretical support to the "standard price effect" of monetary incentive <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gneezy and Rustichini 2000)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> illustrates that the total market contribution increases as the monetary incentive increases. the modification of the intrinsic reward is negative (? &lt; 0), the introduction of a small amount of monetary incentive reduces the total market contribution; however, according to Lemma 2, when the monetary incentive keep increasing, the total contribution volume also increases. So, if the monetary incentive is sufficiently large, the total content volume will be higher than that when there is no monetary incentive.</p><p>Therefore, as frequently emphasized by economists, "incentives matter" <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gneezy et al. 2011)</ref>. Whatever the initial impact of monetary incentive is, if the monetary incentive is sufficiently large, it increases the total market contribution, otherwise the total market contribution can even be lower than the case when no monetary incentive is offered.</p><p>Similar empirical results, such as "Pay Enough or Don't Pay at All", is reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gneezy and Rustichini (2000)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corollary 1 (Pay Nothing or Pay Enough):</head><p>A sufficiently large monetary incentive ? &gt; ? * induces a higher contribution volume than the case without monetary incentive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Average Content Quality</head><p>To calculate the average content quality (? (? ? [0,1]) in the market, we assume that each contributor's content quality remain unchanged as the monetary incentive increases, which is commonly observed in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mason and Watts 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Wang et al. 2012</ref>) (the detail of the calculation can be found in the Appendix.) We also relax this assumption in the Appendix.</p><p>Since the intrinsically-motivated contributors contribute relatively higher quality content than the non-intrinsically-motivated contributors do, it is then easy to infer that, the average content quality is a function of market shares of each contributor: if the market share of each contributor remains unchanged, the average content quality also remains unchanged, even when the overall contribution volume increases (consistent with Mason and Watts (2010)'s findings); if the market share of the intrinsically-motivated contributors increases, the average content quality increases; and vice versa. Moreover, this impact is further enlarged because a piece of high-quality content attracts more audience than a piece of low-quality content, thus the proportion of high quality contentis -less than of the relative market shares occupied by the intrinsically-motivated contributors. We can easily observe that: (1) When the modified intrinsic reward is non-negative (? ? ? 0), after the non-intrinsically-motivated contributors join to contribute, the average content quality drops, as shown in subfigure 6(1). The empirical findings in the literature also support this result <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Garud and Kumaraswamy 2005)</ref>. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>)</p><p>Interestingly, when the modified intrinsic reward is negative (? ? &lt; 0), we find a U-shape relationship between the average quality and monetary incentive, as depicted in the subfigure 6(2). In this case, when the monetary incentive is first introduced, the intrinsically-motivated contributors are crowded out while the non-intrinsicallymotivated contributors enters the market. This "motivation crowd out/in" causes a sudden drop in the average quality in the market. However, when the monetary incentive is sufficiently large and offsets the disutility of the intrinsically-motivated contributors, they re-enter the market and crowd out some non-intrinsically motivated contributors, so the average quality increases again. So, we have:</p><p>Proposition 4 (Average Content Quality):</p><p>1. When the modified intrinsic reward is non-negative (? ? ? 0), the average quality of the contents decreases with the amount of the monetary incentive;</p><p>2. When the modified intrinsic reward is negative (? ? &lt; 0), introducing a small monetary incentive reduces the average content quality, but further increasing the monetary incentive increases the average content quality, which demonstrates a U-shape relationship.</p><p>Proposition 4 indicates that if the objective of the online community is to encourage higher quality content rather than more content (e.g., co-creation forums, Wikipedia, and knowledge sharing forums within organizations), a monetary incentive may not be effective in encouraging contributors, because it attracts the non-intrinsically-motivated contributors who brings down the average content quality. For example, in the InfoSys case <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Garud and Kumaraswamy 2005)</ref>, introducing a monetary incentive attracted the contributors who "just to secure monetary rewards". The content volume sharply increased while the average contribution quality sharply dropped <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Garud and Kumaraswamy 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The InfoSys employees reported that they "search the repository, gets three documents and finds out that they are not useful ? a waste of time ? they are finding it faster to do things on their own or to ask someone they know instead of searching the repository for reusable content" <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Garud and Kumaraswamy 2005)</ref>. In this case, the more content contributed, the less valuable the knowledge repository is. Therefore, merely offering monetary incentive may be helpful for online communities to increase the contribution volume, but not sufficient for them to control the content quality.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Introducing Quality Control in Monetary Incentives</head><p>As we discussed previously, the contribution quality can be more important than volume in some scenarios. In these contexts, a monetary incentive that purely based on the number of attention received may not be sufficient, and it is necessary to add quality control.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Total Content Volume</head><p>After quality control is added, while Proposition 3 (i.e., the motivation crowding in/out effect) still hold, Lemma 2 (i.e., the standard price effect) does not hold any more. More specifically, when increasing the monetary incentive, the total content volume does not monotonically change. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref>, when the quality control is high, the intrinsically-motivated contributors, who contribute high quality content with low quantity, enter the market and crowd out the non-intrinsically-motivated contributors. So the market share of the intrinsically-motivated contributors increase, while the total content volume reduces. We refer to this as "competition crowding out effect". Moreover, when the quality control ? is higher and the productivity difference ? is low, the "competition crowding out" is more likely to happen. Therefore, we have,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposition 6 (Competition Crowding Out):</head><p>An increase in the monetary incentive may reduce the total content volume, when the quality control is high (? ? ? 2 * ) and the modified intrinsic reward is negative. Proposition 3 and 6 show that, the impact of monetary incentive on total content volume is more complex than what is described in the literature. It demonstrates a "W" shape. The first drop of total content volume is due to the "motivation crowding out effect", while the second drop is due to the "competition crowding out effect". In the other regions, the "standard price effect" holds where the total content volume increases as the monetary incentive increases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Average Content Quality</head><p>We also calculate the average content quality when there is quality control. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref> illustrates the change of the average content quality ? with an increase in the monetary incentive in various scenarios. Since the ? ? ? 2 * line is higher than the ? 1 * ? ? &lt; ? 2 * line, which is higher than the k &lt; ? 1 * line, it shows that the higher the quality control, the higher the average content quality. Therefore, we have:</p><p>Proposition 7 (Average Content Quality with Quality Control):</p><p>The higher the quality control, the higher the average quality of content. According to Proposition 4 and Proposition 7, we conclude that, to elicit high content quality, offering monetary incentive alone maybe not be sufficient. Quality control is also needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Practical Implications</head><p>In practice the impact of monetary incentive on UGC contribution is complex. The outcome varies with the magnitude of the monetary incentive, whether it is associated with quality control, as well as other market conditions such as the difference between the efficiencies levels of the intrinsically motivated and non-intrinsically motivated contributors.</p><p>This paper provides a theoretical framework to understand the complex, and dynamic nature of the impact of monetary incentive. For example, when a monetary incentive is first introduced at InfoSys without quality control, it attracted contributors who "just to secure monetary rewards" <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Garud and Kumaraswamy 2005.)</ref> This corresponds to the equilibrium shift from Case NMI to Case 2 or even Case 1 (Proposition 2, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) in our model. According to Lemma 2 and Proposition 4, this should be associated with an increase in the contribution volume and a drop of overall contribution quality, which were actually observed. Then the KM group in the InfoSys company modified the incentive scheme to enhance quality control. The resulting equilibrium shift then follows Case 1?Case 2?Case 4 (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>), and those who are not intrinsically-motivated were crowded out. The observation-the contributors who "have contributed to KShop just to secure monetary rewards reduced their participation"-is also consistent with our theoretical prediction.</p><p>Second, our model offers guidelines to different UGC platforms on designing monetary incentive mechanisms. Different UGC platforms, or at different stages of one single UGC platform, may have different objectives with respect to market composition, the volume of contribution, or quality of the contribution, and thus may desire a different equilibrium illustrated in our model. So, in order to achieve their objectives, the UGC platforms need to design their monetary incentive (namely, the level of monetary incentive and as well as quality control) associated with the equilibrium desired.</p><p>For example, if the objective is to attract all the contributors into the market (Case 1), which is probably critical in the early stage of a platform, the monetary incentive cannot be too high or too low. If it is too low, the production-efficient contributors will not join;</p><p>if too high, the intrinsically-motivated contributors will be driven out of the market; If the objective is to remain high contribution quality (Case 4), the monetary incentive should not be too high, in order to avoid attracting too much contribution from the nonintrinsically-motivated but productive contributors, which hurt the overall contribution quality; If the objective is to increase the total market contribution, the monetary incentive should be above a threshold level, otherwise it will reduce the total market contribution.</p><p>Third, our model also implies an unexpected consequence of introducing monetary incentive: transferring the UGC platform to a PGC (professionally generated content) platform. Once the monetary incentive is sufficiently high, the UGC contribution becomes a business, i.e., professionalized or commercialized. Then the production-efficient contributors crowd out non-production-efficient contributors (e.g., the equilibrium shift from Case 2 to Case 6). For example, after Youtube was purchased by Google in 2006 and the ad-revenue-sharing program was introduced in 2007, the traditional network and cable broadcasters (such as ABC, NBC and CBS), who represent the ? ? ? contributors in our model, enter the market and contribute PGC on Youtube. In 2009, YouTube reorganized its categories to four: Movies, Music, Show and Video, where the 'Video' option is the only UGC clip category <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kim 2012)</ref>. Then the "dominance of PGC marginalizes UGC":</p><p>although there is still room for UGC, the "ubiquitous PGC will overshadow UGC, marginalizing individuals' own creations." <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kim 2012)</ref> Our model shows that it is not always good to be "professionalized" or "commercialized", because the crowding out of the contributors ?? ? may cause the drop of content variety and even content quality. The intrinsically-motivated but non production efficient contributors ?? ? represents those contributors who contribute high quality, yet niche contents which are typically not appeal to the mass market. Such contents bring value to the platform as well as the society, especially for the knowledge sharing platforms. When the monetary incentive is introduced, these contributors are crowded out and the variety of content reduces <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Sun and Zhu 2013)</ref>. Our model offers an explanation on why the commercialized UGC platforms are fulfilled with similar "hot topics" <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Sun and Zhu 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Szabo and Huberman 2010)</ref>. This is perhaps one of the reasons why Wikipedia remains to be a nonprofit UGC platform.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>To the best of our knowledge, this paper makes the first effort to theoretically address the impact of monetary incentive on UGC contribution. By considering different types of contributors, and incorporating both intrinsic motivation and competition among contributors, we provide a framework to explain the seemingly contradictory findings in the previous literature. We characterize two crowd in/out based on whether the intrinsic motivation of contribution is dramatically affected, that is, the motivation crowd in/out and the competition crowd in/out. When the monetary incentive is introduced (from zero to positive), contributors' intrinsic motivation of contribution can be dramatically affected (characterized by the modification of intrinsic motivation ?). This leads to a sudden change in the number of contributors, or the total content volume in the market-a motivation crowd in/out. For example, when the monetary incentive is negatively correlated with a contributor's intrinsic motivation, this contributor will be crowded out when the monetary incentive turns from zero to positive. Similar results are reported in the literature of prosocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(B?nabou and Tirole 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gneezy et al. 2011)</ref>. When the monetary incentive is already positive, with a change in the level of monetary incentive, contributors with higher quality or efficiency may join the market while contributors with lower quality or efficiency are crowded out-a competition crowd in/out. It is worth noting that contrary to the traditional wisdom that money is always good (standard price effect), we find that the impact of monetary incentive is nonmonotonic on the number of contributors in the market, the volume as well as the quality level of the content contributed.</p><p>Our results also show that contrary to the conventional thinking that competition always leads to a more desirable market outcome, in the context of UGC contribution, when a monetary incentive is provided with quality control, the number of contributors may reduce, so does the total contribution volume in the market. This is due to the "competition crowding out" effect where when monetary incentive increases, contributors that are attracted to the market with higher quality or higher production efficiency dilutes the attention received by the existing contributors, and may even drive them out of the market; or when the contributors focus more on the quality of contents, the volume of contribution drops. Such market outcome may not be ideal for the UGC platform depending on its objective.</p><p>By studying the shift of equilibrium under different conditions, this model provides a way to reconcile the seemingly contradictory empirical findings on the impact of monetary incentives on UGC contribution (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Garud and Kumaraswamy 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lin and Huang 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mason and Watts 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Ogawa 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tang et al. 2012a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Wang et al. 2012)</ref>. We also offer guidelines in designing a better monetary incentive scheme by adjusting two variables: the level of monetary incentive as well as the quality control.</p><p>This study is not without limitation. First, for tractability, we assume that a contributor's reward is a linear function of her market share. In reality, the reward function can be either convex or concave in its market share. It is worthwhile to relax this assumption and explore non-linear functions. Second, in this model we consider only one social media website. In practice there is typically one dominant social media website that dominates the field, e.g., Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc. It is possible that new social media websites compete with the established one by offering significantly higher monetary incentive. It will be interesting to model such competitions. Finally, it is valuable to collect field data or conduct field experiments to verify our research findings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gneezy et al. (2011)</ref> indicate that, "Incentives do matter, but in various and sometimes unexpected ways". Our paper shows some initial efforts on understanding the effect of monetary incentive on UGC contribution. More efforts are still needed in future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Note:</head><label></label><figDesc>The subfigure (1) shows the equilibrium shifts when the modified intrinsic reward is non-negative.
