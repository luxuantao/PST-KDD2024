<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In wireless one-hop broadcast communications, each node broadcasts messages to inform all neighbors within an intended communication range. Clearly, the packet transmission of the various nodes might interfere with each other due to the overlapping communication ranges. IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) provides some basic mechanisms for coordination of these transmissions. However, due to its distributed nature, DCF suffers from coordination failures, e.g., due to the very well-known hidden terminal problem. When considering realistic radio propagation phenomena to various degrees, these 'incoordination problems' can drastically increase. On the other hand, transceivers with packet capturing capability might be able to deal with some of the uncoordinated packets. In order to understand the effects of different radio propagation environments on packet level incoordination, we provide a detailed simulation study measuring six transmission success/failure categories and five performance metrics. We report quantitative results w.r.t. probability of incoordination and the effects of power-setting and packet retransmission strategies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>We address a communication scenario in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks where each node communicates only with its direct neighbors by the means of broadcast messages. Thus, from a sender's perspective, a node will send out broadcast messages intended for its one-hop neighbors; from a receiver's perspective, a node will collect all these broadcast messages of its local neighborhood. As the most basic benefit of this type of communication, each node will learn about the presence of its neighbors. In a more advanced setup, specific status information can be distributed and collected within a certain local scope. The addressed communication scenario is typical for monitoring and safety-related applications where each node is in need of information about its neighborhood, e.g., in vehicular ad hoc networks.</p><p>For medium access control we assume a CSMA/CA-based approach as it is used in IEEE 802.11 DCF <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>. Clearly, the packet transmissions of the various nodes might interfere with each other due to the overlapping communication ranges. Since we focus solely on broadcast messages, there is neither a protocol-defined frame retransmission scheme nor a RTS/CTS 'reservation'. While IEEE 802.11 DCF provides some basic mechanisms for coordination of these transmissions, it can suffer from coordination failures, for example due to the very well-known hidden terminal problem.</p><p>The starting point for our study at hand is the fact that the hidden terminal problem, while usually treated as something completely understood, changes its 'gestalt' (shape) when we look at it in the presence of realistic radio propagation phenomena. Indeed, there exist as many wireless channel conditions as there exist different environments. These situations are modeled with different radio propagation models, deterministic or probabilistic, with adjustable parameters that can affect communication's performance in diverse manners. With probabilistic radio propagation 'hidden' terminals can appear much closer to a sender than typically expected with a deterministic model. Therefore, CSMA/CA's ability to coordinate the various nodes is seriously challenged.</p><p>By taking the probability of reception of a broadcast message as our figure of merit, we are interested in finding answers to the following questions:</p><p>• How is IEEE 802.11's coordination function challenged by different propagation models?</p><p>• Can we formalize and measure the additional 'incoordination' introduced by probabilistic propagation models? • Given the various propagation models, when does an increase of transmission power or packet generation rate lead to an improved reception probability? When, in contrast, does it hurt?</p><p>For this study we have selected the following propagation models: i) Two Ray Ground model as a reference which models the direct path of radio waves between sender and receiver and one reflection to the ground, ii) Log-Normal Shadowing, which models the path-loss relative to a reference distance and the possible variations in the surrounding environment (e.g., obstacles), and iii) Nakagami, which models fast-fading.</p><p>In order to obtain relevant results, not only the radio propagation model has to be carefully designed but also the transceiver technology has to be correctly modeled. We implemented in ns-2.28 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref> cumulative noise capability (inspired by the GloMoSim implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>) and a packet capture model (as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>). The latter model simulates the capture behavior of the widely used Atheros chipset, which can help to deal with the above mentioned challenges. Thus, we are also interested in answering the following question: How much does packet capturing help to deal with 'incoordination' introduced by probabilistic radio propagation?</p><p>We extended ns-2.28 in order to analyze the reception rates and their dependence on distance. We differentiate six disjoint packet reception categories depending on the reception power of the received message and the potential interferences (such as received, captured, collided, etc.). Moreover, we analyzed the metric Packet Level Incoordination 1 (PLI) to quantify the inability of 802.11 of coordinating the medium under the different environments.</p><p>We have utilized several configuration values for two widely used strategies to improve data delivery, i.e., adjusting transmission power and packet generation/repetition rate. The complete set of study is used not only in order to simulate a wide range of channel conditions but also to isolate the impact of these two strategies on the obtained broadcast reception rates. We describe the simulation results in order to understand transmission success and failure in detail and point out communication strategies considering power-setting and packet retransmission.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we briefly introduce the necessary background information. We define the different reception categories and metrics utilized in Section 3. After pointing to related work in Section 4, Section 5 presents some characteristics of the radio propagation models utilized. Section 6 describes the simulation set up and discusses the obtained results from different perspectives, differentiating the effect of the propagation model, the transmission power and the packet generation rate. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">BACKGROUND</head><p>We briefly explain the basics of radio wave propagation, the ns-2.28 reception model and IEEE 802.11 broadcast characteristics as prerequisite to define the goals and metrics of our study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Radio Wave Propagation</head><p>In a real scenario, the attenuation of a transmitted signal is not only caused by free-space loss. Indeed phenomena such as pathloss (which is the attenuation caused by interferences due to reflections, diffractions or scattering between the radio waves and the environment) or fading (which is the attenuation caused by the movement of the environment relative to the sender) can lead to unexpected strong loss in the power of the transmitted signal.</p><p>In the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>, models that estimate the attenuation of a transmitted signal in the wireless channel are classified in deterministic and probabilistic. Deterministic ones estimate the average attenuation and predict a fixed attenuation for a given traveled distance. Probabilistic ones are characterized by an attenuation variance, which estimates the variation over time of the average signal power at traveled distances.</p><p>In our study, we take into account three radio wave propagation models, a deterministic one, Two Ray Ground, and two probabilistic, Log-Normal Shadowing and Nakagami (see Section 5). 1 A poster consisting of motivation and formal definition of Packet Level Incoordination was presented at ACM MobiHoc 2006.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">NS-2 Simulator: Physical Layer</head><p>When analyzing the performance of wireless networks via simulation, the implementation of the reception and interference models has to be understood in detail. Here, we present a high level explanation of the ns-2.28 implementation together with our extensions.</p><p>Three signal strength thresholds are used to manage the reception and interference of messages: Carrier Sensing Threshold (CSTh): Any node is able to sense a transmission of another station if the signal arrives with a power higher than CSTh. In this case, the wireless interface will try to decode the receiving signal. Any transmission arriving at a node's location with power below CSTh will not be sensed. Receiving Threshold (RxTh): Any node is able to successfully receive another station's transmission, in the absence of other nodes' interferences, if the signal arrives with power higher than RxTh. Capture Threshold (CPTh): If messages overlap in time at a node's location, one of them can be successfully received if its power is CPTh higher (in dB) than the accumulated powers of all other arriving packets at every time during reception.</p><p>Note that the original ns-2.28 implementation does not accumulate the power of interfering signals and only allows, from overlapping frames, the one arriving first to be captured. Inspired by the GlomoSim <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref> implementation, we extended the simulator with cumulative noise capability to model the accumulated power of interfering signals. Additionally, we changed the capture implementation as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref> in order to allow the capture of frames other than the first under certain conditions.</p><p>The first two thresholds, CSTh and RxTh, induce two widely utilized concepts valid only when assuming a deterministic radio propagation model: Carrier Sense Range (CS): Given a transmission power (TxPower), the CS is the distance up to which a node's sent message can be sensed by another station, i.e., RxPower ≥ CST h. Communication Range (CR): Given a TxPower, the CR is the distance up to which a node's message can be successfully received by another station in the absence of other nodes' interferences, i.e., RxPower ≥ RxT h.</p><p>These two concepts are not accurate when using probabilistic propagation models. Indeed, the function that generates the random distribution used to compute the received signal strength is calculated independently from other nodes for each potential receiver. Therefore, there exist no CR and CS ranges when using a probabilistic radio model. In the following we will make use of the term intended CR/CS, or solely CR/CS, as equivalent to express the transmission power that provides this CR/CS value assuming the deterministic propagation model Two Ray Ground.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">IEEE 802.11 Broadcast Characteristics</head><p>The medium access mechanism of IEEE 802.11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> in its ad hoc mode is DCF (Distributed Coordination Function), which is a form of CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance). This strategy is based on the principle that all stations must check the status of the channel before transmitting in order to avoid collisions. The 802.11 specifications state that nodes must sense an idle medium during a DIFS (DCF Interframe Space) period of time before being allowed to transmit. On the other hand, if the medium is, or becomes, busy during this period, the station must defer its transmission starting the, so called, backoff procedure. The backoff mechanism will first set the backoff timer with an integer random number of slots within [0,CW], where CW is the contention window size. The backoff timer will be decremented during idle medium periods (which are longer than DIFS) and even- tually, when the timer's value reaches zero, the station will transmit its message to the medium. Two important considerations must be taken into account when focusing on IEEE 802.11 one hop broadcast communications: i) the ready-to-send and clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) exchange cannot be used to alleviate the impact of interferences, i.e., hidden terminals, and ii) ACKs are not sent after successful reception. Consequently, no retransmissions exist and the CW is not adjusted depending on the existing load on the medium.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">STUDIED METRICS</head><p>In the following, we motivate and define the different metrics proposed and utilized to develop our study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Packet Level Incoordination</head><p>In order to evaluate the performance of the 802.11 coordination strategy (DCF) and to quantify the resulting amount of hidden nodes from a specific node's perspective, we use the following definition:</p><p>Packet Level Incoordination (PLI), receiver perspective. In case a node A has sensed two frames from nodes B and C, i.e., the messages from B and C arrived at A's location with power greater than CST h, we account C's message as uncoordinated if:</p><p>t B + t P BC &lt; t C &lt; t B + t P BC + l B + DIFS, where t B and t C are the times when nodes B and C started to transmit their messages respectively; t P BC is the time needed for a radio wave to propagate from node B to C; and l B is the transmission duration of the message sent by B (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). In other words, we do not account C's message as uncoordinated in situations where the radio wave from node B did not have time to arrive at C's location to prevent its transmission (e.g., in case of choosing the same value for the backoff timer). On the other hand, we will consider C's message as uncoordinated if, although the radio wave from node B had time to reach C's location, node C does not sense B's message and transmits at an earlier time than theoretically allowed, i.e., a minimum time of DIFS after the end of B's message.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Reception Categories and Metrics</head><p>In order to achieve the pursued level of insight, we define six disjoint packet arrival states, or reception categories, possible at any node (a potential receiver). In order to improve comprehensibility, we make use of the letter S to name a packet with power P S that the receiving station tries to successfully decode; and I(t) to name the set of interfering packets at time t with cumulative reception power P I (t). We separate the six categories in two classes depending on their result, i.e., successful or failed reception.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Successful reception:</head><p>• A-reception: If the reception power P S is higher than RxT h and there is no other packet sensed, i.e., with a power higher than CSTh, at the node during its complete reception time, we call the packet 'alone'-received or shortly A-received. • Capture: We call the packet S captured, if the reception power P S is higher than RxT h and the set of interfering packets I(t) satisfies P I (t) +CPT h &lt; P S during the reception time of S.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Failed reception:</head><p>• Ignored: S is ignored due to wireless interface hardware characteristics if the node is transmitting at S's time of arrival. • Not sensed: S is not sensed if P S is lower than CST h.</p><p>• Sensed: S is sensed if it can not be categorized as ignored and P S is too weak to be decoded successfully, but strong enough to be sensed, i.e., CST h ≤ P S &lt; RxT h. • Collision: S collides if, although P S ≥ RxT h, interfering packets avoid a successful reception, i.e., it exists a point of time t during the arrival period of S where P S &lt; P I (t) +CPT h.</p><p>Apart from the above concepts, we make use of five additional metrics to analyze the communication performance.</p><p>• Probability of successful reception: The probability that a transmitted message falls in the categories of A-received or captured. • Packets sent per second: The average number of packets that a node sends to the medium per second. Note that this value can be smaller than the packet generation rate in dense scenarios. • Packets received per second: The average number of packets that a node successfully receives per second from another node.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Channel Busy Time (CBT):</head><p>The time ratio a specific node determines the channel as busy, i.e., at least one packet with power higher than CST h is detected on the channel. • Probability of incoordination: The probability that a packet transmission corresponds to PLI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">RELATED WORK</head><p>Wireless ad hoc networks and their hidden terminal problem have been an intense field of research for many years. Performance measures have been analyzed using both, event-based simulators and analytical approaches that modeled these networks under certain conditions.</p><p>Already in 1975, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref> treated analytically the hidden terminal problem in an ALOHA system using a deterministic radio model. Later, <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> presented an analytical model of the 802.11 DCF able to estimate the throughput of unicast flows assuming a deterministic channel model. This work was extended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> which took into account channel errors modeled as a 2-state Markov chain, retransmissions and multi-hop communication.</p><p>Addressing broadcast communications we can find studies such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>, which analytically modeled a broadcast scheme and addressed the achievable throughput in the sense of the fraction of time that the channel is successfully transmitting user data. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> an analytic model is proposed that predicts the optimal range for maximizing 1-hop broadcast coverage. However, all the studies mentioned above assumed an optimal coordination of CSMA/CA medium access. Indeed, the variety of possible communication states needed to be modeled when taking into account probabilistic radio propagation make a deep analysis highly complex.</p><p>Similar to the analytical approaches, simulation studies often assumed unicast flows and idealistic radio conditions. However, broadcast scenarios with probabilistic propagation models are also addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, which introduces 'communication gray zones' as regions where some types of messages can be exchanged whereas others cannot; and in our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, where we studied packet reception rates for prioritized transmissions under probabilistic radio propagation models, and which motivated us to start the present paper.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that covers all the different causes of broadcast delivery failure at a potential receiver under several propagation conditions as addressed in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">RADIO PROPAGATION DETAILS</head><p>We have selected three different radio models and have adjusted their parameters in order to simulate a wide range of wireless environments. In the following, we provide a brief description of each of them and two figures to characterize their behavior with respect to the traveled distance. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> contains the configuration parameters and the standard deviation measured at a distance of 100m when having a CR=100m for all of them.</p><p>Two Ray Ground (TRG) derives the signal attenuation modeling the direct path of radio waves between sender and receiver and one reflection to the ground. TRG predicts a signal attenuation as a deterministic function of the distance (assuming no change in the interface configuration, e.g., carrier frequency or antennas' gains).</p><p>Log-Normal Shadowing (LNS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> models the path-loss of radio waves relative to a reference distance and the effect (shadowing) of the possible variations in the content of the environment (obstacles, relief). LNS uses a log-normal random variable to reflect the variations of the received power and is characterized by two parameters, the path loss exponent β and the shadowing deviation σ.</p><p>The Nakagami (Nak) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> is used to predict the signal attenuation on fading environments. Nak describes the distribution of a signal amplitude at a given distance making use of a Gamma function and it is characterized by the fading parameter m.  TxPower=-15.1dBm, a value that provides a CR=100m with TRG. First, it is worth noting the faster decrease for shorter distances. This non-linearity presented by all curves has a significant effect on the presence of hidden terminals, as will be observed later in Section 6. Second, note that with our configuration, TRG and Nak curves present the same values, and that the average attenuation suffered from LNS is significantly lower, specially for LNS-10. However, it is not only the average power (or attenuation) what will determine communications' performance but also the variance of this power. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> represents the probability of successfully receiving one message with respect to the distance for the selected radio models (resulting from a scenario where only this transmission takes place, i.e., without other signals' interferences, and utilizing the same TxPower as in the previous plot). Models with a lower standard deviation (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>) present values closer to the deterministic case, i.e., higher rates inside the intended CR, and lower rates outside of it. Experiencing a higher variance leads to a more unpredictable outcome at all distances since the successful reception of a message results from the comparison between the RxPower and the receiving threshold (RxTh). Furthermore, this unpredictability can be seen from two opposite perspectives: as the probability that nodes far away (outside of CR) could receive a message or, on the contrary, as the possibility to interfere other nodes' transmissions far from the sender (outside of CS).</p><p>In the next section we study how this different propagation behavior affects in different degree a scenario with multiple nodes contending to transmit to the shared medium. As we will see, the major difference among propagation models resides on the location and amount of the hidden nodes capable to create packet collisions. In the case of a deterministic propagation model all hidden nodes are located outside of the CS of the sender. Moreover, due to the capture effect, hidden nodes can only cause a packet collision if the potential receiver of a transmitted message is located further than a specific distance d r (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> on both TxPowers 2 . In the following we will refer to this distance d r as the robust distance (or range) against hidden nodes. On the other hand, in case of probabilistic propagation models the benefit of this range (robust against hidden nodes) clearly depends on the experienced attenuation variance and the proper behavior of the CSMA/CA mechanism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">SIMULATION RESULTS</head><p>In order to meet the goals introduced in Section 1 we present our simulation results from two different perspectives. First (Section 6.2), we present a detailed analysis of the system behavior focusing on packet level incoordination (PLI) and the different reception categories defined in Section 3.2. The insights obtained in this analysis point out the causes of transmission failure with respect to the different parameters and phenomena studied in this paper. Second (Section 6.3), once the communications' details have been analyzed, we will present and discuss the performance results from a higher communication perspective. Taking the probability of successful reception and the amount of packets received per second as figures of merit, we will discuss the advantages, and disadvantages, of increasing the transmission power and packet generation rate.</p><p>Before introducing the results obtained, we describe the simulation set up and the configuration of the studied scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Simulation Set Up</head><p>The selected simulated scenario consists of a circle of 600m radius filled with 1800 static nodes located using a uniform random distribution. Using our lowest TxPower choice, we have an average of 12.5 nodes inside the CR 3 . Note that the absolute spatial density of nodes is not a relevant configuration parameter in its own. Node density is only meaningful associated to a particular transmission power in order to be able to compute the load offered to the medium.</p><p>In such topology we have analyzed the chosen metrics from a potential receiver perspective, called reference node (RN), which is located close to the center. Moreover, the obtained results are rep- 2 Note that hidden nodes are not the only cause of packet collisions in a wireless medium. In case of TRG, also nodes inside the CS range of sender can create a 'coordinated' collision due to, e.g., choosing the same backoff timer. 3 The commonly used 1000x1000 meters scenario with 100 nodes and 250m CR experiences in average 20 nodes inside the CR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TxPower [dBm]</head><p>-21. resented with respect to the distance, i.e., we present the probability that a message transmitted by a node located at a specific distance from the reference node corresponds to one of the reception categories defined in Section 3.2. Note that our interest focuses on the interaction among all nodes (and their transmissions) in a wireless network with respect to one potential receiver of all messages.</p><p>In each simulation, all nodes are configured to send broadcast messages of 500Bytes with the same packet generation rate (PGR) and TxPower. In order to understand the behavior of 802.11 in different load configurations we have simulated different values of TxPower and PGR, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. Note that the size of the system area is large enough to avoid strong border effects, from the reference node's perspective, even with the highest TxPower (which implies a CS of 317m).</p><p>Each possible configuration has been simulated with a minimum of 5 different random seeds, which resulted in five weeks of simulation and parsing time of a dual processor machine with 16GB of main memory. Due to the large size of the simulated scenarios each simulation run is on the order of few seconds depending on the corresponding parameters, e.g., smaller PGR scenarios were simulated longer in order to obtain a similar statistical significance than scenarios with larger PGR. The results presented are the average of the values obtained from 50 different RNs, the nodes located closest to the circle center, for all seeds.  We have summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> the main configuration values utilized for the physical layer in our simulations. For a complete description of the MAC and PHY configuration values, we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, where the 802.11 module was adjusted following the guidelines of the DSRC technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. Special mention is deserved by the CW size utilized in our simulations. The optimal CW value differs with respect to the amount of nodes and their offered load to the medium. However, an adaptive strategy tailored to one-hop broadcast communications is out of the scope of this document and is left to future work. We performed a preliminary set of simulations of our nominal scenario (defined in Section 6.2) to find a CW value that presents a low probability that two neighboring nodes, i.e., located inside the CR range of each other, would select the same slot to transmit their messages. From the values proposed in the specifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>, CW=511 is selected and used for all simulations described in this document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Packet Reception Analysis</head><p>To describe the simulation results we select a scenario where nodes send 4 packets per second with a CR of 100m. This configuration results in an offered load to the medium of 29.1% of the channel capacity, when considering the nodes inside the CR. However, considering that all nodes inside the CS would prevent a potential transmitter to get the channel, we can compute an offered load inside the CS of 70.8% of the channel capacity. In the following we will refer to the CS range when using the term 'offered load'. In this section, the curves corresponding to ignored messages are not included because their rates are negligible for all distances. Additionally, not sensed values are not included in order to improve comprehensibility.</p><p>Let us first take a look at Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>, which presents the probability that the reference node (RN) successfully receives a message sent by a neighboring node with respect to the distance between both. For all propagation models, increasing the distance between the sender and the RN decreases the average received power of the signal, and therefore, it increases the probability that a potential transmission from a third node creates a collision, i.e., prevents a capture. Indeed, the difference between the rates shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> are caused by packet collisions, which are mainly due to incoordination among nodes in the network. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> presents the packet level incoordination (PLI) experienced for all propagation models, i.e., the inability of 802.11 of coordinating the nodes in the network. We can observe in both Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> the diverse impact of the different radio models with respect to CSMA/CA performance. As expected, a lower attenuation variance allow a better coordination among neighboring nodes in our scenario, what corresponds to a better performance, i.e., higher reception rates from nodes located inside the CR. Note the difference between the probabilities of successful reception in case of TRG and LNS-10, e.g., 70% between both curves at 50m, and their correspondence to the PLI values due to the high attenuation variance experienced by the LNS-10 scenario.</p><p>Note also the different slope presented by the TRG curve in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>, which experiences the lowest PLI for close distances. This behavior results from the idealistic sensing range of the TRG model, i.e., the only nodes capable to create incoordination (hidden nodes) are located outside of the CS of the sender but inside the one of the RN. Therefore, the potential number of hidden nodes increases when going further from the RN.</p><p>Let us now take a closer look and discuss the probabilities for the different reception categories described in Section 3.2 as well as the CBT value for all propagation models. With these curves we achieve a deeper insight with respect to the influence of the hidden nodes on message reception. For better comprehensibility we will first describe the results of the deterministic case TRG.</p><p>As we can observe in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>(a), all curves show the impact of the increasing number of hidden nodes with the distance to the RN and their capability to prevent a capture for distances further than d r =61m (see <ref type="bibr">Section 5)</ref>. A-reception presents the highest rates close to the RN, starting at 67% and decreasing down to 32% at the edge of its communication range. Note the correspondence with PLI values observed, i.e., their linear increase has the consequence of a linear decrease of A-receptions that only occur in coordinated channel conditions. Capture rates present increasing values while being inside the robust range against hidden nodes d r , reaching a total of 44%. From this distance on, capture rates decrease while collisions present a corresponding increase. Finally, it is also worth noting that with TRG all signals coming from distances between CR and CS are sensed.</p><p>Figures <ref type="figure">7(a</ref>) to 7(f) present the effect of experiencing a different attenuation variance. In order to identify the main differences with respect to the deterministic case (TRG) we will make use of the results obtained with Nak-3, see Figure <ref type="figure">7(c)</ref>. In general, we can observe 'smoother' shapes, not presenting a break point at 100m. The random characteristic of Nakagami, which does not experience a fixed CR and presents a higher incoordination, leads to a situation  where the occurrence of all reception categories is more spread over the distance than in case of TRG.</p><p>More in detail, we can observe that in case of Nak-3, the main amount of messages generated at closer distances to the sender (d &lt; 50m) are captured. This behavior results from the high number of interferences created by nodes further away that arrive at the RN with low power, allowing the capture of a closer transmission. Note also, that successful reception rates decrease with the distance (with a corresponding increase of the probability of collision) since the average received power of the signal is lower and the potential hidden nodes are closer to RN. Around 70m, we can see the maximum value of the collisions curve, i.e., a significant number of transmissions arrive (uncoordinated) at RN with power high enough to be sensed but too weak to be captured. Finally, for transmissions generated further than 100m exists a high probability that they arrive with a power below RxTh; they are sensed.</p><p>With respect to the other radio models, we can observe the effect of experiencing different average attenuation and standard deviation. Environments with lower average attenuation result in higher CBT values, note the CBT=83.9% in case of LNS-10 due to its lowest average attenuation. With respect to the attenuation variance, higher values lead to more spread and overlapping reception categories with respect to the distances to RN. We can observe how increasing the attenuation variance results in lower A-reception rates, going from 47% at 50m in the case of TRG, until 1% in the case of LNS-10 (also affected by the high CBT). This result confirms the inability to coordinate the nodes in the network with the different radio models, as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>. Additionally, we can confirm the importance of the capture effect in all cases, with special relevance in scenarios with higher incoordination. The reception rates in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> would be significantly lower if the wireless interfaces could not capture packets in presence of interferences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adjusting packet generation and communication range</head><p>In order to study the impact of increasing the packet generation rate and the communication range we present the results obtained for packet level incoordination and the reception categories. Due to space restrictions, we focus on Nak-3 as a representative case with medium variance and a subset of the PGRs and CRs <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">4</ref> .</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> shows the results obtained with a CR=100m and three different packet generation rates, 2, 4 and 8 packets per second. As expected, increasing the number of transmissions on the medium leads to an increase of the incoordination and, hence, to a strong decrease of A-reception. Experiencing a higher number of interfering nodes also results in a strong increase of the capture rates for distances close to the RN, becoming the dominant category of successful packet reception for high generation rates. It is worth noting that although we are doubling the number of packets on the medium in each step, the successful reception rates do not fall with the same ratio, thanks in part to the increase of the capture rates. For example, at half of the CR distance, 50m, the message collision rates just increase a 29% from Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>(a) to 8(c).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> presents the results obtained with a PGR of 4 packets per second and three different communication ranges, 50, 100 and 200m. Due to the circular area of the intended CR and CS ranges, doubling the CR results, in average, in multiplying by four the offered load to the medium. As expected, a higher load on the medium results in an increased PLI and, consequently, in a decrease of A-reception rates. Note the low A-reception rates obtained in case of CR=200m due to the high incoordination caused by the load offered to the medium (CBT=93.3%). However, higher CR values, which cause higher PLI and channel load, do not experience a sensible decrease of the successful reception of messages at close distances thanks to the capture effect. Indeed, the increase of the offered load results in a higher relevance of the capture capability, reaching rates up to 99% for close distances to RN in case of CR=200m. The reason is that, although packets from nodes further away can be sensed, their reception power is relatively low compared to close nodes' transmissions (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), allowing the latter ones to be captured.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Maximizing Information Updates</head><p>In this section we present a different perspective to analyze the one-hop broadcast communications' performance in our scenario. This approach is motivated by applications that intend to deliver information updates up to a certain distance (or cover a certain area), e.g., safety applications in vehicular networks. These type of applications must map their requirements, mainly coverage area and amount of delivered updates per time period, to communication's specific parameters, i.e., TxPower and PGR. Therefore, the goal in this section is to study the effect of transmission power and packet generation rate on communication performance at a specific distance, which we assume to be the 'required coverage area' by an application. We fixed the targeted distance to 40m, which is inside all choices of CR, and utilized Nak-3 to illustrate our analysis.</p><p>We base the study on the same scenario as in the previous section, i.e., 1800 nodes sending messages with a common TxPower and PGR, and with respect to the same 'receiving' node RN. However, we do not represent the selected metrics with respect to all possible distances between a specific node and the RN. In this section, we only study (and average) messages sent by nodes located at 40m, i.e., the edge of the 'required coverage area' 5 .</p><p>Let's first take a look at the channel load conditions for all combinations of CR and PGR. Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref> presents the channel busy time 5 The results presented are the average from messages sent by nodes located within [35m, 45m] from the RN.  sensed by the RN. As expected, increasing PGR and/or CR results in a higher CBT. In more detail, we can observe that CBT reaches values close to 100% for the higher CR values (150m and 200m) combined with PGR values higher than 6pps. Figure <ref type="figure">11</ref> depicts the average amount of transmitted messages to the medium by the analyzed nodes. Note how for CR=100m and lower, all messages created by the application are transmitted to the channel. However, due to the high values of CBT not all intended messages can be sent to the medium when having a high PGR in case of CR=150m and 200m. For example, we can observe that in case of CR=200m increasing the PGR from 8pps to 10pps only results in a marginal increase of the amount of packets actually transmitted to the medium, from 7.6pps to 7.9pps. The difference between PGR and the actual amount of packets transmitted to the channel has to be taken into account for a proper evaluation of the communication performance.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref> presents the probability of reception of messages sent to the medium by nodes located at 40m from the RN. As expected, a higher number of messages sent to the medium corresponds to a lower probability of successful reception. However, it is more interesting to look at the results from the CR perspective. We can see that increasing CR from 50m to 75m improves significantly the reception probability for all PGRs. This effect can be explained by the relation between the CR and its corresponding 'robust distance' against hidden nodes, i.e., the analyzed distance of 40m is not covered 'robustly' by CR=50m, but by CR=75m. On the other hand, increasing the CR further than 75m does not present a benefit in terms of 'robustness' against hidden nodes located outside of the CS; instead, it decreases the probability of successful reception, especially for high PGR values, due to the higher transmitted load.</p><p>Finally, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">13</ref> shows the amount of RN's received packets which are sent by the analyzed nodes. We can observe how the highest value, 6.2 packets received per second per node, corre-sponds to a CR=75m and a PGR=10pps. As seen above, there is no benefit in increasing the CR further than 75m, i.e., where the targeted distance of 40m is already 'robust' against hidden terminals. With respect to PGR, we can observe, that higher values help increasing the amount of received packets significantly, as long as the CBT has not reached its maximum value and messages can still be sent to the medium. See how increasing PGR can result in a decrease of received packets per second in PGR-CR combinations where the experienced CBT is close to its maximum, e.g., in case of CR=200m and increasing PGR from 6pps to 8pps. In such situations, the strong decrease of the probability of successful reception counteracts the increase of the amount of messages sent.</p><p>As a conclusion, we can state that in general, when targeting a specific distance, or area around a transmitter, the best strategy is to send with enough power to 'protect' the targeted nodes against hidden terminals. A higher transmission power will create an increased rate of collisions until saturating the medium. As expected, with respect to the packet generation rate, higher probabilities of successful reception for individual messages are achieved with lower load in the communication channel. However, applications' requirements will have to be taken into account, e.g., if a specific time between updates (or number of received packets per second) is required, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">13</ref> would be a good indicator to find the minimum packet generation rate that should be used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have presented a study on IEEE 802.11-based one-hop broadcast communications. Motivated by the uncertainties introduced by probabilistic radio propagation models in wireless communication environments and our interest in understanding, we have defined a metric, Packet Level Incoordination, to quantify the inability of CSMA/CA of coordinating the transmissions in the network and identified six different transmission success/failure categories.</p><p>We performed a simulation study on a circular scenario utilizing our extended version of ns-2.28 and presented the obtained results observed by a reference node located at the center of the circle. As main contributions we see the following items:</p><p>We have quantified the successful reception rates depending on the radio propagation model with respect to the distance between sender and receiver. We observe that models presenting a higher attenuation variance experienced lower successful reception rates. Additionally, we have quantified the incoordination on the medium. In line with the reception rates, a radio model with higher attenuation variance introduced more incoordination among the wireless nodes. In more detail, we have shown the significant difference between the deterministic model Two Ray Ground and the probabilistic Log-normal shadowing model having the highest attenuation variance. We believe that the results obtained for Two Ray Ground, Log-Normal Shadowing and Nakagami models can serve as some kind of 'reference system' for predicting the performance of other radio propagation models as well.</p><p>We presented the probabilities of the different packet arrival categories and observed the impact of the attenuation variance on the broadcast performance for a specific channel load. We described how a higher attenuation variance caused the different arrival categories to appear more spread over distances from the reference node. Also, we demonstrated how the capture effect improves successful reception rates in an uncoordinated medium, specially when the attenuation variance and/or the load on the medium is increased.</p><p>Finally, we presented a study that addressed broadcast reception from nodes positioned at a fixed distance. From the results obtained we can state that the best way to maximize the reception rates from nodes located at a specific distance is to select the TxPower in a way that the targeted node is 'protected' against hidden terminals. This means that the the signal power at the receiving node is 'strong enough' to successfully 'survive' interferences, but 'as weak as possible' in order to control the load on the medium.</p><p>Among all, we intended to make the reader aware of the phenomena occurring in wireless broadcast communications. We provided a study framework and metrics that, after identifying an optimization criterion, can assist in the design of robust and optimal communication strategies under diverse radio propagation environments.</p><p>In our next future we plan to analyze the effect of the CW size on one-hop broadcast communications in order to identify the effect of incoordination also in highly saturated environments. Moreover, we will continue our work of refining the modeling of the wireless channel and the low layers (physical and MAC layer) of ns-2. Our further goal is to find a way to reduce the gap between the abstraction level used in most network simulations and the level of detail utilized in bit-level simulations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :Figure 3 :</head><label>23</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Average received power with respect to the distance for the chosen radio models with a CR=100m.
