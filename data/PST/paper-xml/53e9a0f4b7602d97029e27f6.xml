<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>S IGNAL-TO-NOISE (SNR) measurement is required in some communication receiver and systems designs. Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> proposes a relative estimator for the monitoring of multipath delay-spread in digital mobile radio systems employing QPSK-like modulations. In this letter, we examine four estimators, related to the delay-spread estimator of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, to assess their usefulness as relative or absolute estimators of SNR.</p><p>Let , , , and , , denote the in-phase signal component, the quadrature signal component, the in-phase noise component and the quadrature noise component, respectively, of a received QPSK-like signal symbol. It is assumed that carrier phase synchronization exists. One complex sample is taken for each of symbols. The noise components and are assumed to be independent, zero-mean Gaussian random variables (RV's) with variances (powers)</p><p>, respectively. The signal components are assumed to be discrete, independent, and identically distributed RV's taking values in the set with equal probability. Finally, let denote the in-phase component and the quadrature component, respectively, of the total received signal-plus-noise of the quadrature samples of the th received symbol. We define the SNR as Yoshida et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> used the statistic (in our notation)</p><p>(2)</p><p>to give a relative measure of link quality in multipath-induced intersymbol interference systems that use -DQPSK modulation. The statistic ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) is intuitive in the following sense. Consider one term in the sum and the large SNR case. The numerator then depends mainly on the noise amplitude and the denominator depends mainly on the signal amplitude. Thus (2) resembles (noise amplitude)/(signal amplitude) averaged over symbols. This structure motivates the following four estimators:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(3) (4) (5) (6)</formula><p>These estimators are motivated intuitively as follows. The RV is the signal-plus-noise power of the th sample, which is an increasingly good approximation of the signal power of the th sample as the noise power becomes small. Similarly the RV is the root signal-plus-noise power and approaches the root signal power as the noise power decreases. The RV is, for small noise powers, equal to which has mean value . Correspondingly, the RV has mean value approaching for small noise powers.</p><p>While <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> used (2) as a relative estimator, we have modified the statistic of (2) to give the statistic (3) which is an absolute estimator of SNR. Similarly, the structures of the estimators in (4)-( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) have been derived to give absolute estimates of SNR. Note that these estimators can be used with any QPSK-like signal whose baseband signal symbol constellation has four symbol points that form a square centered at the origin of signal space. Note further that differential phase shifts of the constellation between symbols do not violate the preceding requirement, so that, for example, -DQPSK complies with this requirement.   These behaviors are not unexpected since and , which directly measure SNR, have a quantity in the denominator of the terms in the sum that approaches zero as the SNR increases. Estimators and , on the other hand, do not have quantities in the denominator that approach zero as the SNR increases. This problem is avoided by using quantities related to the inverse of the SNR for empirical averaging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSION</head><p>Four absolute SNR estimators for QPSK-like signaling motivated by a design in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> have been assessed. The two estimators based on statistics directly related to SNR perform poorly, whereas the two estimators based on statistics related to the inverse of the SNR perform well. The estimator has both the smallest bias and smallest MSE of all four estimators over almost the entire useful SNR range of the estimators, say SNR dB. In addition, it is less computationally intensive than as its computation does not require computing square roots. When it exhibits less than 2.5% mean square error for SNR's larger than 5 dB, making it useful for practical applications.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Comparison of Four SNR Estimators for QPSK Modulations Norman C. Beaulieu, Fellow, IEEE, Andrew S. Toms, and David R. Pauluzzi Abstract-Four signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimators for quartenary phase-shift keying (QPSK)-like signaling are proposed and examined. Two are based on receiver statistics directly related to SNR while two others are based on receiver statistics inversely related to SNR. The results show that the estimators based on the inverse of SNR perform better than the estimators based on SNR. Index Terms-Noise measurement, quadrature phase-shift keying.</figDesc></figure>
