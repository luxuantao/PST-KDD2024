<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Abstract-This paper describes two different applications of wavelet transforms in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In each case, the use of wavelets offers tangible benefits over the traditional Fourier transform based imaging. These stem from the simultaneous time and frequency localization properties of the wavelets.</p><p>The first application utilizes the localization properties of wavelets to acquire single T, weighted images in times which are short relative to current methods. An interesting combinatorial scheduling problem arises from the multiscale structure inherent in the formulation of this procedure. Its solution is sketched and applied to the imaging process.</p><p>The second example is a technique for potentially "instant" imaging. Image acquisition is modeled as an inverse wavelet transform of the spin density in the region in question. Signal acquisition takes place in as few as one or two echoes after the excitation by radio frequency (RF) pulses designed to excite a moving band of spins in a slice. These sweeping RF pulses excite strips of spins which rephase at different times during acquisition. They replace phase-encoding gradients; no fast pulsed gradients are required as in echo planar imaging, which is the "instant" imaging technique presently being developed by MR researchers.</p><p>Some applications of these techniques in medical imaging are described, with specific examples presented by means of simulations. Comparisons with corresponding traditional methods are given.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION AGNETIC resonance imaging (MRI) has become an</head><p>M essential part of diagnostic radiology in the last ten years. MRI, like ultrasound and x-ray computed tomography (CT), is used to generate two-dimensional images of sections of the body. MRI stands out from these other methods in at least two important regards: the sections imaged can have arbitrary orientation and position and the contrast between soft tissues is large. MRI is limited only by its spatial resolution and long imaging times.</p><p>The inherent flexibility of MRI also permits its application in many clinical tasks other than imaging static anatomy. Important recent applications include imaging blood vessels without contrast agents <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[42]</ref>, measuring diffusion in tissue <ref type="bibr">[43]</ref>, [5 I], measuring tissue temperature <ref type="bibr">[3 11, cardiac imaging [23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[45]</ref>, and dynamic imaging of the musculoskeletal system [ 171, [46].</p><p>There are many techniques used to obtain MR images, but all involve excitation by radio frequency, (RF), magnetic fields of the nuclear magnetic spins in a sample of interest. The precession of these spins in a carefully controlled magnetic field causes the sample to echo back with a composite electromagnetic signal whose analysis can reveal the types and positions of the nuclei within the sample. Almost all of the various approaches to <ref type="bibr">MRI [6]</ref> employ variants of the Fourier methods to meet the signal processing requirements.</p><p>Here we survey our recent work on the application of wavelet transforms in two types of imaging <ref type="bibr">[52]</ref>, 1221: two-dimensional Fourier transform spin echo imaging, and fast imaging.</p><p>Two-dimensional Fourier transform, spin echo imaging is by far the most common clinical scanning technique. In this type of imaging, imaging speeds are limited by the intrinsic relaxation times of the spins. We are using the localized support properties of wavelets to minimize the number of times each group of spins must be excited and allowed to relax, thereby minimizing imaging time. The localization properties of wavelets also limit motion artifacts and Gibbs ringing, which are serious problems in MRI.</p><p>There is also a large research effort devoted to so-called instant imaging techniques in MRI. This is motivated by the desire to image moving structures such as the heart and the abdomen [l], <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref>, 1401, [451, <ref type="bibr">[441, [50]</ref>. The most prominent technique is called echo planar imaging. This can provide an image of a single slice within a single echo in as little as 40 ms <ref type="bibr">[49]</ref>. We are attempting to approach this level of performance with a new technique using coherent state transforms, namely windowed Fourier and wavelet transforms. The goal is the compression of the MR output signal, so that an image can be quickly obtained in a few echoes, without the use of the fast switched gradients which are required by the echo planar technique.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We begin with a brief overview of magnetic resonance imaging. The particular goal of this section is the description of some of the unique signal processing issues in MRI which may benefit from the introduction of wavelet and other coherent state transforms. The next section describes the significant improvements deriving from a straightforward application of orthogonal wavelets to a particular spin-echo imaging problem. This involves the careful scheduling of the excitations of localized bands of spins living within dyadic intervals over a range of scales. This scheduling problem is described and its solution sketched. From this, we turn to a section describing a completely different application of phase space transforms to the problem of "instant" imaging in MR. In particular, we describe a technique in which the signal acquisition 0018-9448/92$03,00 0 1992 IEEE process may be modeled as an inverse wavelet or windowed Fourier transform. The sweeping RF pulses which implement this are described and simulated. We present some of the details of implementation on an MR scanner, including timing sequences and an analysis of the speed of this process. Finally, conclusions are presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">MRI FUNDAMENTALS</head><p>As stated before, MRI is a relatively new noninvasive imaging technique which complements older methods including ultrasound and X-ray computed tomography (CT). Basic references describing these techniques abound [27], <ref type="bibr">[391, [48]</ref>; here we try to give enough insight into the techniques to permit an appreciation of the signal processing issues which benefit from coherent state signal processing.</p><p>MRI has carved out an important niche in medical imaging. Some perspective of its applicability is gained by a comparison with alternatives like ultrasound and CT.</p><p>Ultrasound is inexpensive and is done in real time. However, ultrasound cannot be used for structures that are deep in the body or where there is air or bone around the structure of interest. Therefore, with few exceptions, ultrasound is only viable in the abdomen and heart.</p><p>X-ray CT techniques offer excellent spatial resolution, but have very limited soft tissue contrast. Contrast in CT is determined by the electron density and the effective atomic number of the materials imaged. Bone is the only tissue in the body with dramatically different electron density or effective atomic number; soft tissues generally have very similar electron densities and atomic numbers.</p><p>MRI contrast, on the other hand, is determined by the relaxation parameters of the water in tissue; the intrinsic contrast between soft tissues in MRI is many times what it is for CT. For example, the white matter of the brain has 12% lower CT number than the gray matter <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>, while white matter has a 140% higher signal than gray matter in an MRI examination [l 1). MRI is limited only by its spatial resolution properties and long imaging times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A . Nuclear Magnetic Spin</head><p>A nucleus with an unpaired nucleon has intrinsic spin. The nuclei of hydrogen, phosphorous, and sodium atoms all have observable spins. Almost all MRI uses the hydrogen nuclei of a sample to construct an image.</p><p>In an MR scanner, a large, external, static magnetic field, H,, causes alignment of the nuclear spins in a sample; the vector sum can be approximated by the bulk magnetization vector of the sample, M . The bulk magnetization precesses around the external field just as a top precesses around the gravitational field. The frequency of precession, f,,,,, , is proportional to the size of the static magnetic field and is called the Larmor frequency:</p><p>The constant of proportionality, y, is different for each nucleus; it is 42 MHz/Tesla for hydrogen. Many things contribute to the magnetic field felt by the spins, including the static magnetic field. Another influence is the fields of atoms adjzcent to the spins, which causes a slight variation in the Larmor frequency called a chemical shift. For example, in imaging tissues, one finds a chemical shift between protons in water, which are bonded to oxygen, and protons in fat which are bonded to carbon.</p><p>The effect of electromagnetic fields on nuclear spins requires a quantum mechanical description. However, MR can be described approximately with a classical treatment of the magnetization and the forces on it. This approximation is sufficient in part because the effects of many nuclei are summed to form the bulk magnetization, which is the actual observable property of the sample. The magnetization in H , can be described exactly like a spinning top in a gravitational field.</p><p>The Larmor frequency can be varied by changing the magnetic field experienced by the spins contributing to the bulk magnetization. In a MR scanner, the magnetic field in the sample is varied from Ho by the addition of three switched, linear magnetic field gradients: one in each orthogonal direction in space. These magnetic field gradients are used to determine which portion of the signal comes from each part of the image, as discussed in detail a bit later. Before turning to imaging considerations, we must first discuss the properties of a single group of spins.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Magnetic Resonance</head><p>The net magnetization can be pushed out of alignment with the static, external magnetic field, H,, by means of another external magnetic field that is rotating with the magnetization at the Larmor frequency. The effect of a field rotating at any frequency other than f,,,,, cancels when averaged over many cycles. Thus, only a field rotating at the Larmor frequency has a net effect; this is a classical explanation of resonance.</p><p>A rotating magnetic field is created in the plane perpendicular to H , by applying a pulsed radio frequency (RF)</p><p>voltage across a specially designed coil surrounding the sample. At the end of such an excitation, the magnetization vector of the sample precesses around the static magnetic field at an angle which is proportional to the product of the strength of the RF field and the length of time for which it was applied. RF pulses are characterized by the angle they push the magnetization to, e.g., a 90" pulse pushes the magnetization vector down to the plane perpendicular to the static magnetic field. This is referred to as the transverse plane. The precessing magnetization generates a very small voltage in a pickup coil, which in some machines is the same as the transmitter coil. Since this coil can only detect fields in the transverse plane, the returning voltage is proportional to the projection of the magnetization vector into this plane, as well as to the number of spins which are precessing. The voltage generated oscillates at the Larmor frequency.</p><p>The signal generated by the magnetization after an RF pulse is called a free induction decay (FID). As the name implies, the signal decays over time. In an ideal system, there are two types of exponential decay contributing to this; they are characterized by decay constants T , and T,. Spin-spin, or transverse relaxation, occurs fastest and is characterized by T2. It is caused by a loss of coherence among the precessing nuclear spins contributing to the transverse bulk magnetization, and is due to local interactions between spins. As a consequence, the spins begin to contribute to the net magnetization out of phase from one another. This effect continues over time until the signal is canceled or dephased.</p><p>T2 is on the order of 50 ms in tissues.</p><p>Spin-lattice relaxation, or longitudinal relaxation, is characterized by T,. It is caused by the magnetization realigning itself with the static magnetic field as the spins lose energy to the lattice. In tissues, TI generally varies from 200 to 800 ms; the purer the liquid, the longer TI becomes. For example, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) is very pure water and has a T, of 5 s. This can be exploited in medical imaging by introducing contrast agents, such as salts, to decrease the TI of tissue in the sample.</p><p>Both TI and T2 decay times are characteristic of the tissues themselves. In a real system, there are other sources of dephasing which have nothing to do with tissue properties but which also contribute to the exponential decay of the FID. Anything that causes a change in the Larmor frequency across the sample causes dephasing; inhomogeneity in the static magnetic field, the application of a magnetic field gradient, and chemical shifts all cause some spins to rotate at different Larmor frequencies, causing dephasing. In practice, all of these sources of spin incoherence, including true T2 relaxation, are lumped together and characterized by a time constant T;. In liquids, TI is always much larger than TT so the FID effectively decays with TT.</p><p>As stated earlier, a classical description of the magnetization as a spinning top is a good approximation. Now that the basic processes have been outlined, differential equations describing the evolution of the magnetization in this classical picture can be presented. These were formulated by <ref type="bibr">Bloch in 1946 [3]</ref>. Excellent and much more complete treatments can be found elsewhere [5], <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[48]</ref>. The differential equations describing the motion of the components of the magnetization, M , are:</p><p>(2) --</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( 3 ) (4)</formula><p>where H is the sum of the static magnetic field which points in the z direction, H,, and the RF excitation, H I , rotating in the transverse x-y plane. MO is the static magnetization strength of the sample in response to the static field H,.</p><p>Neglecting relaxation effects, this reduces to dM dt ( 5 )</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">-= y ( M x H ) .</formula><p>This form is useful in computing the response of the magnetization to a short RF pulse. An important special case for us occurs when the static field varies linearly in space, say along the z axis. Assuming H , points along the z axis, take </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Spin Echoes</head><p>The FID following an RF pulse decays exponentially with decay constant TT. The decay is caused by spin-spin relaxation, which is a property of the tissue, and by all other sources of dephasing, many of which are not properties of the tissue, e.g., static field inhomogeneities. A technique known as spin echoing may be used to eliminate those dephasing effects whose rate of dephasing is constant in time, such as those arising from static field inhomogeneities. A 90" RF pulse puts the magnetization into the transverse plane; the maximum possible signal is obtained initially, but the FID decays away quickly with TT time constant. The signal can be too small to observe after only 5-10 ms. With the spin echo technique, the signal can be recalled with a 180" RF pulse at time T after the 90" pulse. The 180" RF pulse has the effect of reversing the phase of all the spins in the sample.</p><p>Prior to the 180" pulse, some spins were precessing a bit faster than the average, and had opened up a positive phase lead on the others. By the same token, other spins lagged the pack due to slightly slower precession. The phase reversal created by the 180" pulse reverses the phases, so that the fast moving leaders become fast moving laggers and the slow trailing spins become slow leaders. The speeders then catch up in phase to the pack as the slower spins fall back; the net effect is that the signal rephases, or echoes. For example, consider the phase variation caused by inhomogeneities in the static field. Assume H , points along the z axis, with a field strength which varies linearly with position that axis: H , = (K + G , z ) k . The phase of the spins, 0 , depend on time and z :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">0 = y g t + y G , z t .</formula><p>As time goes on, the phases of the spins spread out so that their signals cancel, as we now demonstrate. The signal is where p' represents the effective density of spins as a function of position in the sample, and the integral is taken over the sample. Assume for the sake of illustration that the sample volume is a slab transverse to the z axis, with material of constant spin density located between z = -T and T . Then weighted image. By choosing a short TE and a short TR, the contrast in the resulting image will depend primarily on TI, i.e., it is a T, weighted image.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Imaging</head><p>-S ( t ) = Cp'e'YHO' dz e'YGzzt, i::</p><p>where C is a constant. The integral is a sinc function which goes to zero as time goes on. Suppose at time t = 7 a 180" RF pulse is applied, flipping all spins in the transverse plane so that the phase of every spin is reversed. Therefore, the phase accumulated in time 7 before the 180" RF pulse, yGZz7, becomes -y G Z z r . However, the static inhomogeneity of the magnetic field which is the source of the dephasing does not change:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">~( t ) = CeirHd d Z e i r G z Z f -h G r Z r</formula><p>gives the signal as a function of time after the 180" RF pulse.</p><p>The integral is a translate of a sinc function, and rephases a time 7 after the 180" RF pulse, then starts to dephase once again. The rephasing of the echo looks like a reverse FID, after which the echo dephases again, which looks like another FID. The echo time, TE, is always equal to 27. Subsequent echoes can be produced after the first with subsequent 180" RF pulses.</p><p>Whatever phase variation that is accumulated between the 90" and 180" RF pulses is reversed by the 180" pulse. As long as the cause of dephasing is constant in time, whatever phase variation accumulated between the 90" and 180" pulses is reversed after the 180" pulse. This causes an echo when the spins rephase. Pure spin-spin dephasing is statistical in nature and does not cancel with a spin echo, so the signal dies away eventually anyway. However, it does so with the longer T2 time constant.</p><p>Most imaging techniques require many 90-180-echo sequences to generate an image. A repetition time, TR, must be allowed to expire between each pair of 90-180-echo sequences to allow the magnetization to at least partially realign via TI relaxation with the static magnetic field along the z direction. This is due to the fact that only the projection of the magnetization vector along H , will contribute signal after it is tipped over by the pulse sequence. Indeed, the sequence pushes this z component of magnetization 90" until it is in the transverse plane, and the pickup coil is only sensitive in this plane. If we do not allow some z component to build up by TI relaxation, there will not be much signal after the 90" and 180" pulses.</p><p>After several iterations of 90-180-ech0, the magnetization strength reaches steady state. The size of the signal coming from a particular volume of the sample, or voxel, is a function of both tissue properties TI and T2 in the voxel, and user-selected parameters TR and TE:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">amplitude = constant e-TE/Tz[ 1 -e -T R / T ~] . (7)</formula><p>By choosing a long TE and a long TR, the contrast in the resulting image will depend primarily on T,, i.e., it is a T2 -i:</p><p>All imaging techniques use three coils, each of which produces a magnetic field vector pointing along the z direction at each point of the sample. These are gradient fields, one for each of the x, y , and z axes. They have magnitudes which vary linearly with the position along the appropriate axis. They can be switched on and off, or even slowly varied in time. These are used to modify the static, homogeneous field H,. For instance, when the x gradient, G,, is on, the magnitude of the magnetic field varies linearly with displacement in the x direction, H = ( H , + G,x)k. In this example, as in all of the imaging techniques we describe, we use the convention that H , points in the z direction, and the slices to be imaged are in the transverse ( x -y ) plane. In fact, straightforward manipulation of gradients would allow one to image in a plane with any particular orientation.</p><p>Fourier transform imaging [29] and its variant, spin warp imaging [14], are the most common imaging techniques. The density of spins at each point in the slice, p ( x ) , weighted by the relaxation effects given in <ref type="bibr">(7)</ref> gives the value of the image at each point:</p><p>In spin warp imaging, a slice is first determined with a slice-selection RF pulse. A single slice of spins is excited by turning the z gradient on during the RF pulses. When the z gradient is turned on, the Larmor frequency is a linear function of z. An idealized RF pulse is typically a sinc function which is comprised of pure harmonics with amplitude 1 in a certain band, and amplitude 0 outside that band; that is, the Fourier transform or spectral content of the excitation pulse is an indicator or boxcar function supported on a particular interval of frequencies. Only spins with Larmor frequencies corresponding to harmonics present in the RF are excited. Therefore, spins with Larmor frequencies inside the support of the boxcar are excited; spins with Larmor frequencies outside the boxcar are not excited. The result is a slab of excited spins transverse to the z axis, with the depth of the slab corresponding to the support of the Fourier transform of the RF excitation. Only the spins within this slab contribute signal to the image. The width of the slab can be changed by changing either the time constant of the sinc or the gradient strength. The z position of the slab can be changed by changing the center frequency of the RF pulse.</p><p>In imaging, one tries to excite a thin slab, or slice (subject to bandwidth limitations of course), and then somehow descry the variations of spin density within this slice as a function of position in the transverse plane. One of the two dimensions in the transverse slice is encoded by frequency. By convention, this direction is considered as defining the x axis. Frequency encoding of this dimension is accomplished by turning on the x gradient after excitation, during the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON <ref type="bibr">INFORMATION THEORY, VOL. 38, NO. 2, MARCH 1992</ref> echo. Before this event, all the spins in the transverse slice precess with roughly the same frequency. When the gradient is turned on, the slice breaks up into lines of spins transverse to the x axis; each line is comprised of all spins whose x coordinates have a given value. The spins in a line with a given x position all precess at a Larmor frequency proportional to the x coordinate of the band, as the x gradient produces a linear variation in the field strength along the x axis. Explicitly, the spins in this line create signal at the Larmor frequency: f , , , , = yG,x. The total signal, S ( t ) , is the sum of the signals from all the lines in the slice weighted by the number of spins in the line</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">~( t ) = 1 dx 1 d y p ' ( x , y ) e 1 r G x x r .</formula><p>The (marginal) distribution of spins along the x axis can then be reconstructed with the Fourier transform of the signal.</p><p>The original MR imaging was done by Lauterbur <ref type="bibr">[30]</ref>. He recognized that many projections through the image can be made by changing the direction of the gradient; in effect he varied the position and direction of the x axis to produce projection onto a large number of lines through the slice</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>~, ( t ) = 1 dx.1 d y p ' ( x , y ) e ' l y C J . r ,</head><p>where r = xi + y j + z k , z is the (fixed) height of the slice and G, is the jth of a large number of linear combinations of G,i and G y j . The Fourier transform of S, is then the projection of the object imaged onto the corresponding line. By obtaining enough projections through the image using combinations of G, and G,, p ' ( x , y ) can be found with an inverse Radon transformation in the same way CT scans are reconstructed.</p><p>However, almost all modern imaging uses a variant of Fourier transform imaging called spin warp imaging. A technique called phase encoding is used to determine the variation of p ' ( x , y ) along the y axis. The method is quite general and can be used in many applications, e.g., to encode the velocity of the spins, chemical shifts of the spins, or the third spatial dimension when imaging a volume instead of a slice. Phase encoding of the y axis requires many echoes to be acquired; echoes for j = -N y / 2 + 1 to N y / 2 , where Ny is the number of image pixels in the y direction. The y gradient is turned on for some time Tp at a strength which varies from echo to echo; for the j t h echo, the strength is jG,. The y gradient is turned on after the RF pulse excites the slice, and turned off before the echo and signal acquisition; the timing can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. During this phase encoding, the lines of spins corresponding to different values of the y coordinate are spinning at varying rates, due to the y gradient. At the time the y gradient is turned off, the different lines of spins have accumulated different phases; on the jth iteration, the accumulated phase is O,(Y) = -rjG,YT,.</p><p>(8)</p><p>After phase encoding, the spins echo and the x gradient is turned on to frequency encode the x axis, as described previously. The signal is sampled and digitized, and the procedure begins again: RF excitations, phase encoding at the next step of y gradient strength, sampling of the frequency encoded echo signal, and so on.</p><p>The sampled signal on the jth iteration has values</p><p>where k is the sample index during the sampled echo, and A t is the time between the successive samples. Each echo is a line in the array S j k . The jth echo has N, samples, with the index k running from -Nx/2 + 1 to N,/2. A sampled version of the image, p ' ( x , y ) , is reconstructed from this array with the two-dimensional inverse discrete Fourier transform.</p><p>The time required to generate an image, TI, is</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">TI = Ny T R A u ( 10)</formula><p>because Ny echoes must be acquired, each in a time TR. Au is the number of times each echo is acquired; Au can be more than one if the signal-to-noise ratio in the images are too low and one is forced to average images to reduce noise. In general, the repetition time TR is much larger than the echo time TE. For example, a T I weighted image might have TR = 500 ms and TE = 20 ms and a T2 weighted image might have TR = 2500 ms and TE = 80 ms. Recall that the long TR results from the need to allow the magnetization to at least partially realign via (slow) T I relaxation with the static magnetic field along the z direction; otherwise, there will not be much signal to push into the transverse plane with the 90" to 180" pulses.</p><p>If we are not concerned with signal strength, the minimum possible spacing between spin echo sequences, TR,,,, for a given echo time TE is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">TE i-6.</formula><p>Here 6 is half the time taken by the 90 pulse plus half the signal acquisition period and plus the time required for gradient spoilers after the echo. 6 is a function of the particular hardware used. If we want a decent signal output, we typically must allow a much longer TR to elapse between spin echo sequences for a given group of spins. However, the time difference between TRmin and TR need not be wasted. Other slices can be imaged during that time, while allowing the first slice a sufficient recuperation interval. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the timing.</p><p>The number of slices that can be imaged, N , is TR / TRmin.</p><p>The time per slice is then</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">( 1 1 ) TI -= N,TRminA~. N</formula><p>Note, however, that a single slice cannot be imaged in T,/N; TI must be used to get a batch of N slices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Echo Planar Imaging</head><p>A variation of Fourier imaging called echo planar imaging was reported in 1977 by Mansfield <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref>. Echo planar imaging is a method of imaging a single slice in a single echo. The entire matrix in (9) is obtained in a single echo. A great deal of effort has been put into echo planar in order to image the moving heart <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[401, 1451, [50]</ref>.</p><p>In echo planar, large gradients are used. A large x gradient is used to make the bandwidth of the object imaged, B W , as large as possible,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">BW = yG,FOV,,</formula><p>where FOV, is the field of view in the image in the x direction. The length of time required to image one line of the matrix in (9) is T,ine = N,t, where to is the time between samples and I, = 1/BW. By maximizing G,, Tline is minimized. When T,ine is much smaller than 4T,*, many lines of the matrix in (9) can be obtained from one echo. The quantity 4T,* is a measure of how long the echo is; recall that the echo rings up exponentially with time constant T: and then rings down exponentially with the same time constant. In conventional 2D Fourier transform imaging, each line of the matrix in (9) takes one echo. On the other hand, in echo planar imaging all of the steps required to image the line must happen many times within one echo. In particular, a phase-encoding gradient pulse must be turned rapidly on and off between the acquisition of each line. The readout gradient must also switch signs between lines of data to keep the phase accumulating correctly. The primary problem with echo planar imaging is that very large, very fast, switched gradients are very hard to build. As a result, data is sampled when T,* decay has reduced the signal dramatically. This reduces signal-to-noise ratio and produces artifacts. More complete treatments can be found elsewhere <ref type="bibr">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[50]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Signal-to-Noise</head><p>Some influences on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are common to all imaging techniques. The signal in an imaging experiment is proportional to the number of spins contributing to the signal. The signal, therefore, is proportional to the pixel size in the image; the better the resolution gets, the more the SNR suffers. The noise is generally thought to be a 1 / f process. Over the very tight bandwidth sampled, the noise is essentially proportional to the bandwidth <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>; the larger the gradients, the wider the bandwidth and the greater the noise. The signal is also determined by (7); the longer the TR the larger the signal, and the smaller the TE the larger the signal. Imaging effectively is always a tradeoff between these parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="111.">WAVELET ENCODING</head><p>In diagnostic radiology, there are several very common examinations which require three to five T2 weighted slices, e.g., in spinal examinations. A TR of 2.5 s is generally required to reduce T, weighting and a TE of 80 ms is required to get T2 weighting. The minimum TR is roughly 100 ms. Such a sequence takes 256 x 2.5 s or around 1 1 min; normally 20 to 25 slices can be imaged with the sequence. We are developing wavelet encoding to replace phase encoding in these situations. Wavelet encoding uses the local support properties of wavelets to image a single slice with the minimum repetition time and still have an effective repetition time many times greater.</p><p>In these schemes, the x dimension is frequency encoded, just as it is in 2D Fourier imaging. However, instead of exciting the entire slice with every RF pulse, as is done in phase encoding, each RF pulse excites a wavelet-shaped profile at a particular scale and position along the y axis in the slice. The echo produced is the inner product of the wavelet-excited profile and the spin distribution along the y axis. Therefore, the wavelet transform of the spin distribution can be measured by using a sequence of RF pulses at the correct dilations and translations. The original distribution of spins along the gradient can be found with the inverse discrete wavelet transform of the signal [8], <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref>.</p><p>Wavelet encoding is similar to a technique which excites profiles in the form of Hadamard functions <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. However, the wavelet profiles have localized support, in contrast to Hadamard encoding. A particular consequence is that almost all of the excited profiles are zero over most of the encoded interval, so that only a small band of spins is excited by most of the RF pulses. These pulses are arranged so that consecutive excitations drive up spins in disjoint regions of the sample. So although some part of the sample is being excited every TR seconds, any particular spin is left to relax for many TR periods before it is called on again. This increase in the effective repetition time felt by a given spin is accomplished without increasing the overall imaging time. This is extremely useful in some applications, and is in marked contrast to the traditional Fourier and Hadamard approaches to MR. Note that every RF pulse excites all the spins in Fourier transform imaging and in the Hadamard technique.</p><p>Therefore, the TR is the same as the effective repetition time.</p><p>We shall present wavelet encoding in a technique that produces a projection image. A projection image has no slice selection, so the voxels extend through the object imaged as it does in an x-ray. There are several slice-selection techniques that can be used [ 2 ] , <ref type="bibr">[38]</ref>; however it is easier to see the features of wavelet encoding in a simpler projection sequence. The sequence used to produce wavelet-encoded projection images is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>Wavelet encoding has several advantages over phase encoding <ref type="bibr">[52]</ref>. First, there is much less ringing caused by partial volume effects in wavelet encoding than in phase encoding. The ringing is an artifact in the reconstructed image associated with the presence of an edge in the original sample. The severity of this is related to the coarseness of resolution, or undersampling, of the discrete reconstruction; dividing the fixed bandwidth of the encoded image into a greater number of pixels reduces the effect. We have found that Gibbs ringing in the Fourier transform is much more severe than the corresponding undersampling effects in wavelet transforms. The most important advantage of wavelet encoding is its immunity to motion artifacts. Motion of the object imaged during phase encoding causes a misregistration of signal. The Fourier transform reconstruction spreads the misregistered signal all the way across the image; the basis functions of the expansion are not local so the effect of the error is not local. This phenomenon will be demonstrated later.</p><p>It should be noted that there is at least one previously known method for obtaining large effective repetition times, TR,, with a short TR; namely a method known as line scanning. Instead of exciting a wavelet-shaped excited profile, a line in the image is excited; the image is accumulated one line at a time <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. However, the signal-to-noise ratio in line scanning is significantly less than that in 2D Fourier imaging precisely because only one line of spins produces signal at any time during this procedure; see, for example, 139, Ch. 51. the spins producing signal at any time. The standard analyses can be applied to wavelet encoding as well; wavelet encoding, as we have implemented it here, has signal-to-noise ratios greater than line scanning and less than 2D Fourier imaging.</p><p>To date, we have used the Haar wavelets because there is no overlap between adjacent wavelets at the same scale; this implies each spin must be excited only once for each scale. However, the discontinuities in the Haar functions are difficult to reproduce; RF pulses must be quite long. Therefore, we are starting to use other orthogonal wavelet bases, such as the wavelets of Lemarie/Battle [36] and Daubechies <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>.</p><p>These wavelets are smoother and reduce the bandwidth requirements on the RF pulse. On the other hand, the overlap of these wavelets at a given scale means that each spin must be excited more times. This cuts into the effective repetition rate TR,, as the number of times the spins must be excited and allowed to decay determines the effective repetition time. This is offset somewhat by an increase in the signal produced. We are also exploring the use of the scaling functions of multiresolution analyses instead of the wavelets for the excited profiles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A . The Wavelet Encoding Technique</head><p>A function's wavelet transform is given by the set of inner products of the function with the wavelet at the proper scales and translations. In wavelet encoding, the inner products are measured by using a selective RF pulse to excite the spin density, p'( x , y ) , with a wavelet-shaped excited profile: is the resulting signal, where $ ( y ) is the wavelet-shaped excited profile with ( j , k)eZ2. Here, the exponential is a result of the x gradient on during the signal acquisition; the resulting signal for each wavelet scale j and translation k is a function of time during the echo. The x gradient encodes p'( x , y ) in the x direction with frequency; p ' ( x , y ) in the x direction is reconstructed with a Fourier transform of the signal during the echo. Each excitation and echo provides the signal at one scale and translation. The discrete wavelet transform <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref> with N points must be sampled at scales j = 0 to j = log, N -1 and at k = 2 / translations at each scale j. One average is also required by the wavelet transform; it is obtained by exciting a boxcar or indicator function over the FOV encoded. Digitizing the signal echoes following the N excitations creates a three-dimensional data matrix: indexed by j , k , and t . The reconstruction is formed by performing a discrete Fourier transform in t and an inverse wavelet transform in j and k . The resulting two-dimensional array is the reconstructed image.</p><p>The set of N excitations required by wavelet encoding is the same as the N excitations required by phase encoding.</p><p>The difference is that all but two of the excitations in wavelet encoding excite only a part of the FOV. Each spin is excited once for each of the log, N scales and once for the average, i.e., each spin is excited log, N + 1 times. Two of the excitations excite the entire FOV: the average and the largest scale wavelet. The remaining N -2 excitations each only affect a portion of the spins. We now turn to the problem of optimal scheduling of these excitations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Scheduling</head><p>The problem at hand is to schedule the excitation of the various blocks of spins with profiles corresponding to the wavelet at the proper scales and positions along the waveletencoded axis. By a simple change of scale, we may as well assume that the spins to be imaged are laid out along the unit interval <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref> in the y axis. To simplify the discussion, we present the ideas in terms of the Haar wavelet basis:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">$J, k ( y ) = k + t k + 1 5 y &lt; - 2 J 2 J ' k 2 7</formula><p>otherwise. if-Observe that $J, k is supported on the interval [( k / 2 J ) , ( k + 1)/2/]; we must schedule the excitation of the spins in these intervals for scales from j = 0 up to a value of j equaling the log of the number of pixels. So for example, if we wish to resolve eight pixels, then we must excite Haar wavelet profiles on the spins in the intervals <ref type="bibr">[0, 11, [0, i]</ref>,</p><p>[i, 11, 10, i ] , [i, $1, [i, $1, [ : , 11, in addition to a boxcar on [0, 13. For T, weighted imaging, we desire to do this in such a way that the successive excitations of a given spin occur with as large a time gap T R , as possible, given that we wish to excite the entire ensemble of intervals in as short a total time as possible. The excitation of the entire interval occurs twice a cycle and the only way to observe the desired time gap after this is to wait the full T R , before exciting another interval. However, the subintervals do not all overlap and a clever scheduling of the excitation of these allows us to drive up nonoverlapping subintervals at a fraction of TReff while still observing a spacing of T R , between the successive excitation of any spin. For example, let us consider the case described above. We wish to schedule the excitation of the intervals of length i and shorter in an expeditious fashion. One would not wish to excite [0, i] followed immediately by [0, f], as this would force one to wait the entire T R , before doing this. Rather, one could sequence the excitations as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">[o, 4 9 [ ; &gt; a ] , [&amp; 11 &gt; [o, a] 9 [i, $1 3 [+, 11.</formula><p>In this way, one could maintain a spacing of at least T R , between excitations of overlapping intervals while completing the entire cycle of excitations in 2 T R , plus an overhead of 2 T R , for the two excitations of the entire interval. This obviously beats a sequence like</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">[ O , i ] , [ o , f ] , [ a , i ] , [ i , l ] , [ ~, : ] , [ a , l ] .</formula><p>These sequences may be described graphically in spin-band timing diagrams, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p><p>Another way to represent the situation is a binary tree representing the partial ordering (by inclusion) of the set of subintervals. The depth of a node in the tree represents the scale of the interval to which it corresponds; within a given level, the horizontal position of the node reflects the position of the corresponding interval. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> gives a tree representation of the preceding schedule. The schedule corresponds to a walk on the nodes of the tree. The nodes are labeled with the interval to which they correspond, and numbered according to the sequence in which they are excited.</p><p>An elementary analysis now gives a simple bound for T R e f f . Assume that a band of spins is excited every TR,,, seconds, and that we wish to wavelet encode N = 2 k pixels along the unit interval. Then we require the excitation of Haar wavelets at scales j = 0 to j = k -1, plus an average of the whole interval. The total number of excitations is then,</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">1 2 J + 1 = N</formula><p>as there are 2 J subintervals of [0, 11 at scale j . Our problem is to schedule the excitations of the N -2 subintervals in the scales j = 1 to k -1, in a total time of (N -2 ) x TR,,, seconds so that the successive excitations of any particular spin are well spaced in time.</p><p>We will say that two of these subintervals are related if one is contained in the other. If we wish to maintain a spacing of at least M time steps between successive excitations of any set of spins, then related subintervals must not be excited within M x TR,,, seconds of one another. The question is then how big can M be, subject to the constraint that all of the subintervals must be excited in N -2 time steps? The answer is that M is bounded above by ( N -2)/(10g2 N -1). Moreover, we have constructed schedules which attain this optimum spacing (actually, the integer part of this number). In the following few paragraphs, we sketch the derivation of the bound and the heuristic by which we constructed our schedules. Suppose we have a schedule which maintains a spacing of</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M .</head><p>Let G I denote the subinterval excited on step M . The first excitation of a related subinterval 8, occurs no earlier than step 2 x M. The excitation of any subinterval related to G2 can occur no earlier than step 3 x M ; let G3 be the first such interval which is also related to G , . We continue in this manner, so that if intervals G I , G 2 , . . . , G j are already designated, then G ;+ is taken to be the first interval excited after Gi, which is related to all of the intervals G , , G 2 , . . . , G,. In this manner, we select a family of mutually related subintervals so that the G , is excited no earlier than step i x M . The stipulation that each G i is related to all the previously selected intervals in the family implies that G i lives on a scale different from all the previously selected intervals, as no interval is related to another of the same scale. This process stops when there remain no more intervals which are related to all the previously designated G ;. Therefore there must be precisely one element of the family at each scale, j = 1 to k -1, and the last interval of this family is G k p excited no earlier than step M x ( k -1). Since there are N -2 excitations in all,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">we have M x ( k -1) &lt; N -2, or N -2 M I log, N -1 '</formula><p>As noted before, this bound on the separation is actually attained, and schedules realizing it have been constructed up to size N = 512, using a simple greedy heuristic. Furthermore, there is recent proof that this scheme works in general <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>. We turn to a brief description of the heuristic, and give an example of a schedule for N = 128 which obtains the optimal separation bound of 21.</p><p>We describe the entire family of intervals and their containment relationships by a complete binary tree, as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>. We wish to schedule visits to all of the nodes below the root so as to maintain the optimal separation between visits to related nodes. Nodes are related if their corresponding intervals are; that is, if one node is in the subtree rooted at the other. If we seek a resolution of N = 2 k pixels, then the tree has a total of N -1 nodes on k levels, and we must schedule visits to the N -2 lying below the root. Our schedule is comprised of a sequence of k -1 complete "cuts" across the tree. Each cut is a sequence of consecutively visited nodes traversing from left to right in the tree with the property that there is precisely one of these nodes in each path from the root to a leaf (bottom row node) of the tree. For example, in the case k = 3 discussed above, the schedule is comprised of two cuts taken in sequence, as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>.</p><p>Our schedules are simplified by a symmetry with respect to the left and right subtrees, as can be seen in the simple example of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>. Each of the k -1 cuts is comprised of two subcuts; a cut of the left subtree followed by a cut of the right subtree. We require that the left subcut of the first cut is the mirror image of the right subcut of the last cut; that the left subcut of second cut coincides with the mirror image of the right subcut of the second to last cut; and so on. Because of this, specification of all left subcuts is sufficient to specify the complete schedule.</p><p>The strategy is perhaps best described in the context of a specific example; we now consider the case of 128 = 27 pixels. We must describe six left subcuts; the corresponding right subcuts are then determined by the symmetry. We require the minimum separation to be 21, the figure specified by the analysis above. The main consideration of the strategy is greed; one chooses the nodes of the cut as high in the tree as possible, subject to certain obvious constraints.</p><p>This greedy strategy specifies that the first subcut should consist of the one node at the top of the left subtree. We must then take 20 points in the right subtree to finish the first cut. This is because the second cut, like any other, starts with a node at the very left of the tree (the left spine of the tree); in particular, it is related to the first node of the first cut. In light of the desired spacing of 21 steps between related nodes, this first node of the second cut should occur no earlier than step 22. Having established this spacing, the second left subcut may be taken as the two nodes of the second level of the left subtree, in keeping with the greedy strategy, without violating the spacing. The balance of nodes in the second cut are taken in the right subtree. We need 19, since the third cut begins on the left spine at the third level of the left subtree, and is therefore related to the first node of the second cut. Our choice puts the desired spacing between them. Choosing the four nodes at the third level of the left subtree as the third left subcut maintains this spacing. Contin- uing in this vein, we need to take 17 points in the right subtree to round out the third cut. As usual, this is to observe the spacing between first nodes of the third and fourth cut, the latter occurring at the left spine of the fourth level of the left subtree. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref> illustrates the process to this point.</p><p>At this point, symmetry determines that the fourth left subcut is determined as the mirror image of the third right subcut. In particular, it must have 17 points in it. Likewise, the fifth left subcut must have 19 points in it and the sixth must have 20.</p><p>We determine these last three subcuts by the greedy strategy, picking the consecutive points as high as possible as we move from left to right across the left subtree, subject to two commonsense constraints. The first is that the nodes must comprise a cut of the prescribed size. We must have the right number of nodes with precisely one node in each path from the root to a leaf of the subtree. In particular, no nodes of the cut can be related; this would obviously destroy the separation.</p><p>The second constraint states that the position number of a node within a subcut must at least equal the position number of any related node in the preceding subcut. A moment's thought shows that this is necessary to maintain separation between the nodes of consecutive subcuts. The first nodes of any pair of consecutive cuts are related, as they sit on the left spine of the tree at adjacent levels. We have chosen the total length of the cuts to ensure the proper spacing between these two. The constraint makes certain that the subsequent points in the subcuts maintain this spacing.</p><p>In our example, this dictates that the final three subcuts are as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>. At this point, we have constructed the left portions of all of the cuts. We now invoke the symmetry requirement to determine the right portions of these cuts. This completes the construction of the schedule. Although the preceding discussion has utilized the N = 128 case for illustration of the techniques, the strategy is essentially the same for any size problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Timing</head><p>The times normally encountered in spin echo imaging give us estimates of imaging times for wavelet-encoded imaging.</p><p>A T, weighted sequence generally has an echo time around 80 ms and a TR around 2.5 s; the minimum repetition time, TR,,,, is around 100 ms. If wavelet encoding is implemented to generate T, weighted images using TR = TR,,,, the imaging time is (N -2)TR,,, + 2 TR,,. Letting  Of the 256 excitations, 254 have 100 ms intervals between them and 2 must be followed by a full 3.6 s interval. Therefore, the total imaging time is 32.6 s. The effective repetition time would be greater than 3.6 s, which is significantly larger than the TR usually used in two-dimensional Fourier imaging.</p><p>In the schedule presented above, the time interval between successive excitations of any spin is at least TR,, , but it may be quite a bit more for certain spins. This variation is not significant for T, weighted imaging. However, a different set of criteria are necessary for T, weighted imaging where the magnetization is in steady state during a series of RF pulses. The steady state is disturbed when the time between excitations is changed. In this case, the ordering of the excitations should be made to minimize the variation in time between excitations instead of maximizing the time between excitations. The corresponding combinatorial scheduling problem is under investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Discussion</head><p>There is a very important benefit of wavelet encoding: motion artifacts are dramatically reduced. Typical motion artifacts in actual phase-encoded MR images can be seen in The ability to generate T2 weighted spin echo images one slice at a time is very useful in the clinical setting. T2 weighted images of the spine are usually generated with the spinal column in the image plane. The spinal column is thin enough to be imaged completely in three to five images. In traditional spin warp imaging, this takes 10 to 11 minutes. If the wavelet encoding can be made slice-selective, the same images could be generated with wavelet encoding in 1.5-3.6 minutes. This is a very significant time savings; a half-hour MR examination generally costs 500 to 1000 dollars or more. We are working on methods of making the projection-imaging schemes we presented into slice-selective imaging schemes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. FAST MR IMAGING WITH PHASE SPACE TRANSFORMS</head><p>In this section, we describe methods for encoding the spin distribution as an inverse phase space transform. Our initial work in this area utilized the windowed Fourier transform for this purpose. Subsequent modifications of this technique permit the substitution of an orthogonal wavelet transform, which promises certain improvements. Both methods offer specific advantages over Fourier encoding of MR images. Specifically, an entire image may be encoded in a single spin echo, offering the potential to generate very fast MR images. It appears that acquisition times might approach those of echo planar imaging without the use of the fast switched gradients required by that technique. Instead, during data acquisition the readout gradient is constant in the windowed Fourier transform case, or varies smoothly in the wavelet case; the gradient does not switch sign between "lines" of data as it does in echo planar scanning. A possible further advantage may be derived from the fact that the field of view may be restricted as desired. The limitations of the techniques involve the speed with which the spins phase and dephase. These techniques also appear to suffer signal-to-noise disadvantages compared to two-dimensional Fourier encoding. However, they do not suffer from TT decay as echo planar imaging does and do not require small tip angles as FLASH imaging does.</p><p>The basic concept of the windowed Fourier transform (WFT) based technique and the wavelet transform (WT) based technique is the same. We must encode the spin density of a two-dimensional slice as a time domain output signal and then recover it. In both methods, one dimension is frequency encoded with a constant magnetic field readout gradient as usual. Instead of a phase-encoding position along the second direction, it is labeled by the time that the echo is received from the line of spins at a fixed distance along it. The simplest example of this is the old method of line scanning [15]; each line is recorded as an echo, so the position of the line can be thought of as being encoded in time. However, data acquisition for the WFT and WT imaging is significantly faster than line scanning because many different distributions of spins are excited at different times during one RF pulse.  The echoes of these different distributions of spins are recorded at different times during the subsequent data acquisition.</p><p>The principal innovation in these methods is the use of a rapid succession of slice-selective RF pulses in the plane of the image. This "sweeping" RF pulse is comprised of subpulses concatenated end to end over the time of the pulse. The consecutive subpulses excite adjacent strips of spins within the slice. The echo produced by each strip, or window, of spins occurs at a different time during the data acquisition; the strip of spins contributing signal appears to move across the slice during data acquisition. These techniques can reconstruct images from data taken in a few echoes. In particular, single echo imaging is possible.</p><p>The discussion is organized as follows. We begin with a list of the requisite facts from the theory of joint timefrequency representations of time domain signals. This provides the association of a two-dimensional distribution with a one-dimensional signal, which we need to discuss our model of the signal acquisition process in MR. This is followed by some of the details of implementation in the particular cases of the windowed Fourier transform and the wavelet transform. The next subsection gives an analysis of the speed of this process. Finally, conclusions are presented.</p></div>

An arbitrary image is encoded as an inverse windowed Fourier transform; the resulting time domain signal is measured and the image reconstructed from it by direct windowed Fourier transform. This has the effect of projecting the original image into the range of the WFT. We have found that in order to achieve desired resolutions, we must compensate for this by spreading the image over a larger number of phase space cells then one might expect from experience with imaging based on orthogonal transforms. This leads to increased bandwidth and echo time requirements, and motivates the introduction of orthogonal phase space transforms into imaging.</p><p>Much of the current interest in phase space transforms comes from the recent development of such orthonormal buses generated from a single window by translation and dilution instead of modulation. It is also possible to construct MR imaging schemes based on these wavelet transforms. In particular, these schemes do not suffer the blurring described above, as the point spread function is an impulse.</p><p>As before, a single test function h ( t ) is transformed into a parameterized family of functions, each of which may be considered to be localized near a point in phase space:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">h a , b ( t ) = l a ( p ' / 2 h - i "U b ,</formula><p>representing a function localized near time b and scale a. The wavelet transform of a signal f is the projection:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">. &amp; &gt; 6 ) = Po, b L f ) ,</formula><p>which represents the distribution of f 's energy over time and scale, as measured by the test signal, or wavelet h. As has been know for some time [19], the choice of wavelet h is not so free as the choice of the window in the windowed Fourier transform, but if h E L2( R ) satisfies the admissibility criterion: then the wavelet transform is invertible:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">1 da db 2 7rCh T ( h o , b , f ) h n , b = f .</formula><p>Computation dictates the elimination of the redundancy in the continuous constructions; discrete transforms come from sampling on a lattice in time-scale space. Daubechies and others have considered frames of wavelets of the form h,,,(t) = aimI2h with ( n , m ) E 2 2 , and the parameters a,, bo &gt; 0, a, # 1.

The x direction is encoded as frequency by a constant gradient, as usual. A position along the y direction is encoded by the time that spins near that position echo during sampling, as opposed to phase encoding. This is done by means of a constant gradient in the y direction and complex radio-frequency (RF) pulses driving a time-varying distribution of spins in the plane imaged. Many strips are excited during the pulse; each strip is excited so that its spins come into coherence at a specific time. Thus, the echo from each strip occurs at a different time during the sampling period. These ideas are most simply described in the particular case of WFT imaging, to which we now turn.</p></div>

The amplitude of excitation of the spins in this band has a profile approximated by the Fourier transform, W , of the window. We use windows that are well concentrated in frequency and choose the scaling G, of the y axis so that W is essentially supported in the band [ -Awy / 2 , Aw,, / 2 ] . Therefore, the spin bands excited by successive subpulses are nonoverlapping.</p><p>The resulting excited profile is approximated by the Fourier transform of the RF excitation:</p></div>

After excitation by the RF signal described above, we acquire the output signal by listening to the radio frequency signals emitted by the precessing excited spins in the region. At any given time during the signal acquisition, each spin in the sample is emitting signal at the characteristic frequency y G, y determined by its position along the magnetic gradient in the y direction. The net signal output is obtained by adding up all these oscillations weighted by their amplitudes. The amplitude of the oscillations is a function of position along the y axis, whose form is given by the excitation profile above. The output signal is, therefore, proportional to .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>e i ( t -k A t ) ( w , -k A w , )</head><p>Although all the spins emit signal at any given time, at most positions along the y axis they ring incoherently with their neighbors due to phase differences, and their net contribution to the output signal is canceled. This is caused by the static, magnetic inhomogeneity caused by gradient along the y direction.</p><p>For example, evaluating the expression for the signal at the particular time t = n A t , the only terms which contribute much to the signal are those with summation index k close to n: since all the, other terms are integrals of rapidly oscillating functions, W( w,,)e'("-k)At(w~). See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">15</ref>. Likewise, in any other given time epoch, there is a spatially localized band of spins providing the bulk of the output signal. As time progresses, the band of coherent spins that we can hear moves along the sample at a constant velocity. This may be seen in a plot of integrand of the signal function as a function of time and frequency as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">16</ref>.</p><p>In general, the spin density is a function of position along both axes, and the x direction must be encoded as frequency as well. To do this, we start with the y gradient turned on, and use the sweeping 90" RF pulse described above to drive up the spins. The rephasing of the spins is initiated by turning the y gradient on again and supplying a sweeping 180" RF pulse. Finally, the echoes are read out and digitized with both the y gradient and a frequency encoding x gradient, G,. This situation is indicated schematically in Figs. 17-19.</p><p>Putting w, = y G, x, the detected signal is where p(w,, w,,) denotes the spin density.</p><p>Aw,, is chosen sufficiently small so that the variation of spin density in the y direction is small across any strip of that width perpendicular to the y axis. Recall that we chose the scaling of the y direction by gradient G,, and the window W so that its Fourier transform is essentially supported in an interval of width Aw,,.

In a noise-free situation, we can take our samples so as to avoid the zeros of the sinc, and compensate for its attenuation. We may then recover a blurred version of p"(k, m) by forward windowed Fourier transform, provided A w,, and At are chosen appropriately to meet frame conditions for the given window function, as described in Section IV-A. The blurring is caused by the reproducing kernel or point spread function for the frame, as discussed in that same section. Therefore, the spin density p may be recovered up to this blurring. In practical terms, the blurring means that one obtains a given resolution with WFT imaging at the cost of mapping the image onto a greater bandwidth and time duration than an orthogonal transform would. The cost of longer imaging time and greater bandwidth requirements motivates the use of the orthogonal wavelet transforms, whose point spread function is a delta impulse. These will be discussed in the next subsection. As a final note, the observant reader has already noted that p" is a sheared version of p . This effect is easily undone, and does not really pose much of a problem.</p><p>In reality, of course, there is always a great deal of noise to contend with, and the effect of the sinc is to limit the number of strips we can acquire in a given echo. For images which require many strips, we need to acquire the data in several echoes, with several strips per echo. Since we only excite those strips we wish to hear in each given echo, the next block of strips is ready for excitation almost immediately thereafter. Thus, the multiple echo acquisition should not be appreciably slower than the single echo acquisition of a given image, and offers better signal-to-noise characteristics. The multiple echo approach also has the effect of decreasing the length of the individual echoes, which is necessary for T, weighted imaging anyway.</p><p>We are currently investigating techniques to extend the number of strips which can be acquired in a single echo, by causing the phase variation in the x direction of each strip to go to zero at the echo time of that strip. This appears to be a rather complicated procedure.</p><p>Other considerations are spatial resolution and pulse length, which depend on the gradient strength and the shape of the RF pulse. The shape in time of the RF subpulses determines how swiftly the signal from a strip of spins rephases and dephases and therefore the length of the data collection; the width of the Fourier transform of the subpulses determines the spatial resolution in the direction of the sweeping RF pulse. Both cannot be arbitrarily small for a single RF pulse. For pulse shapes such as sinc, the power drops off very slowly. The Gaussian is a better choice. Another good choice is the prolate spheroidal wave function [47].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. WT Imaging</head><p>A phase space approach to imaging which removes the difficulties of nonorthogonality is provided by orthogonal wavelet transforms. One implementation of those in imaging is an adaptation of the WFT case, and will now be sketched. Of course, one may use frames instead of bases with a few changes.</p><p>For a specific example, we use an orthogonal wavelet transform based on Meyer's original orthogonal wavelets, as described in [7], [4 11. We use the wavelets h in a coordinate system which gives a uniform sampling in the transform (image) domain and which allows us to apply the traveling window concept to an orthogonal transform.</p><p>For any function f in L2( R), we have the decomposition in terms of dilates and translates of Meyer's wavelet hm, ,,(t) = a,"*h(a:xnb,). Writing this decomposition in the frequency domain, we have with Assume now that f is causal; i.e., f( w ) vanishes unless w is positive. Writing the positive w in the form ah, let s ( t ) be f ( a i ) . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H,,,(t) = C,(tm ) H ( tm),</head><p>where the chirp signal given by C,,(t) = eCinboUot. This allows us to choose a uniform sampling grid when applying this to imaging. See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">20</ref>.</p><p>We are now in a position to utilize this transform pair in MR imaging. This is similar to WFT except that time in the complex exponentials is nonlinear. It can be viewed as a windowed "chirp" transform. The nonlinear time can be obtained by changing the gradient during the data acquisition. To ensure that the Hahn and gradient echoes are simultaneous, the gradient during the RF pulses must be of the same form as that during the signal acquisition. The RF pulse is again the sum of subpulses that are shifted in time and in frequency. The basic subpulse window is W ( t ) = H ( t ) , where H is defined in terms of Meyer's wavelet as above. In the low tip angle approximation, an RF pulse of the following form can be used:</p><p>Here, Wm(t) = W ( tm), G,(t) is the y gradient as a function of time during the RF pulse, and 5 is a normalizing constant. The shape of the subpulse can be modified to compensate for the nonlinearities of the Bloch equations.</p><p>The signal, S ( t ) , can be approximated as a constant times J' J' @ ( w , ) p ( ~x 3 w,)</p><p>x [ e;wy(l/G)/&amp;Gy(s) d s eiwx(l/G)/ &amp;Gx(s) ds dw dw</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">1 x Y '</formula><p>where p is the spin density, @ is the excitation profile along the y axis, and wx = yGx, w, = y c y .</p><p>In the present application, we use gradients which vary piecewise exponentially in time. These look like G Y ( t ) = log (a,)&amp;-", G x ( t ) = log (a,)ca;-"</p><p>for t near m. This leads us to consider the change of variable which may be thought of as expressing time warped to the instantaneous gradient strength. The excitation profile is given by where ZGm = W, 0 r;', so that 2Bm(7,) = Wm(t). Thus, the signal is proportional to</p><p>x p ( w,, w,) [ eiwy'~eiw~'x] dw, dw, .</p><p>As with the windowed Fourier transform, it is assumed that Aw, is chosen so that the spin density may be taken constant over the voxel, and so that ZG has its Fourier transform essentially supported in an interval of width A w, .</p><p>Partial volume effects are currently under investigation. The integral over w, and the sum may be interchanged, p pulled out:</p><p>J' dw, eiwxrxC p ( w,, m Aw,) m x J' dwy e i w y r y % B m ( wym Aw,).</p><p>Using arguments analogous to the WFT case, the total signal is then proportional to p"( m , .</p><p>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">H ( t -m) eiym Aw, i dCy(f) dteiynbo i dcx(f) df , m , n</formula><p>where p"( m , n) is the value of the spin density at the ( m , n )</p><p>voxel .</p><p>The signal is essentially the inverse wavelet transform, and the image can be reconstructed with the direct wavelet transform. Thus, RF pulses may be chosen to make the transform orthogonal which improves the point spread function dramatically, with conconiitant reduction in acquisition time.</p><p>An important consideration in implementation is the exact choice of the interval around t = m upon which the gradient looks like ah-"'. The obvious choice is I t -m I &lt; 1/2.</p><p>However, due to the overlap in time of the mth and m + 1st window functions, there is a period at the beginning of the m + 1st window when the x gradient is still coordinated with the prior window, and so therefore is the chirp rate. By the same token, during the tail of the mth the x gradient has already been reset for the next window. We are investigating the effects of this misalignment at present. On the other hand, it can be avoided entirely by eliminating every other window in the inverse wavelet transform. This is done by replacing W, in the RF pulse by W,,, and letting the gradient go as a;-*"' for 1 t -2 m 1 &lt; 2. The image reconstructed from this will be zero in every other column; upon eliminating these, we reconstruct the spin density. The down side of this is a reduction of the signal-to-noise ratio.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Sampling Requirements for WFT Imaging</head><p>Both the requirements on the sampling imposed by the window Fourier transform, WFT, itself and the requirements imposed by the physical system must be met simultaneously. The requirements imposed by the WFT are: the inverse must exist, be stable, and have reasonable resolution. The inverse @(w,) = / g(t)e-iw,(l/O/bc,(s)ds d t .</p><p>Making the change of variable indicated above, this becomes a direct Fourier transform with respect to 7 , : This is not the only requirement. Stability and good resolution require</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">[7] A t Aw, ut ow,</formula><p>where U, is the variance of the window in the time domain, uwx the variance of its Fourier transform.</p><p>The physical system requires the bands of excited spins not overlap. Overlap would cause interference between the signals from different spins in the same window. The overlap is zero if the width of the band excited is equal to the spacing of the bands. With this information and knowledge of the size of the image in pixels and meters, we can write the requirements imposed by the WFT in terms of the machine parameters. The requirement that the inverse exists tells us the acquisition speed. The stability requirement tells us the relation between resolution and gradient strength.</p><p>The existence of the inverse WFT requires the product of the time resolution and frequency resolution to be a number 01 less than 27r. The time resolution tines the number of pixels in the y direction is the sampling time required to acquire the image. Therefore, the existence requirement gives the sampling time c:</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">-% - NXN, Q! T, = y G, FO V, '</formula><p>where the frequencies have been expressed in terms of the gradient and the field of view. The speed of data acquisition is proportional to the number of independent points in the image, H x N y a , and inversely proportional to the bandwidth sampled. An analogous expression can be generated for echo planar imaging [I61 NXN,</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">T = y G, FO V, '</formula><p>where G, is the readout gradient. Echo planar imaging requires extra time for phase-encoding gradient pulses during the sampling. WFT imaging does not require the phaseencoding pulses; however, it does require longer RF pulses because the long, sweeping RF pulses in single-echo WFT imaging are replaced by relatively short slice-selective RF pulses in echo planar imaging.</p><p>An important tradeoff in all MRI techniques is that between the size of the gradients and the spatial resolution in the image. In WFT imaging, the requirement for stability gives us the relationship between the gradients and the resolution:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G, 4px</head><p>_ --- G, &amp;Py'</p><p>where P is the pixel size.</p><p>is given by the data acquisition time for a single echo:</p><p>In conventional 2D Fourier transform MR, the resolution where N,t, is the time required to sample one echo. These two results illustrate an important point: WFT imaging has significantly more tightly intertwined requirements than conventional Fourier transform imaging, Some possible imaging schemes can be given for WFT imaging. A 64 x 48 pixel image with 3072 independent points can be acquired with gradients that exist on standard MR scanners, 10 mTesla/meter, in around 75 ms. This is fast enough to image dynamic processes such as breathing or perfusion of contrast material into tissues of interest. It is almost good enough to image the heart while it is beating. However, the resolution is relatively poor. A 48 X 48 pixel image with 1728 independent pixels can be acquired fast enough to image the heart. However, the stability of the reconstruction is significantly degraded and one cm pixels provide poor resolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Timing Sequences</head><p>Timing diagrams are given below for sequences that produce projection images and slice-selected images. These apply to WFT imaging; those for WT imaging are similar, but with nonconstant gradients.</p><p>The pulse sequence which is simplest to think about is pictured in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">21</ref> below. It consists of a sweeping 90" RF pulse followed by a sweeping 180" RF pulse. This sequence produces a projection image. The time required to generate an image is three and a half times the length of the sweeping RF pulse T,. The first strips to be excited are the first strips to rephase.</p><p>The sequence above can be made slice-selective by replacing the sweeping 180" RF pulse with a slice-selective 180" RF pulse. See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">22</ref>. The rephasing order for the strips would then be reversed; the first strip excited would be the last strip rephased. The variation in echo time in such a sequence is probably prohibitive. The sequence shown below uses a second nonselective 180" RF pulse to reverse the rephasing order again so the first strip excited is the first strip rephased in the sampling period. The sequence can be made to limit the field of view (FOV) in the readout direction by making the nonselective 180" RF pulse into a selective pulse in the readout direction, x in this paper. The field of view can also be limited in the y direction by sweeping the RF pulse only over the region to be imaged. In this way, it is possible to limit the field of view in both directions in a slice-selective sequence. Limiting the FOV reduces the requirements on the gradients and the length of the sweeping RF pulses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>We have sketched two new approaches to magnetic resonance imaging which apply wavelet transforms. In each case, the use of wavelets offers certain advantages over the traditional Fourier transform based imaging.</p><p>The first technique, direct wavelet encoding, replaces phase encoding with wavelet encoding of one of the axes of an image in a spin echo acquisition scheme. The localization properties of wavelets allow one to schedule the excitations of spin bands at various scales in such a way as to permit the acquisition of single-slice T2 weighted images in times which are short relative to current methods. Benefits of this technique include reduction of motion artifacts and Gibbs ringing. On the other hand, signal-to-noise ratios are lower than in Fourier imaging.</p><p>Our current work in direct wavelet encoding centers on the creation of excitation schedules tailored to particular wavelet bases and to particular applications. For instance, one would like to trade speed for higher signal-to-noise ratios in some instances. In other cases, T, weighting may mandate a slower but more uniform schedule. We are also investigating multidimensional versions of these schemes. These variations all feature the resistance to motion artifacts. We feel this may find application in the field of angiography, for example.</p><p>It is now part of the lore of wavelets that their use enables one to zoom in on features of interest. This intriguing notion has encouraged us to investigate adaptive imaging schemes.</p><p>To date, we have encoded all parts of the image at all scales, but in many applications this is not needed. In adaptive imaging, one pursues higher resolution only in those regions of the image where certain features have already been found at the coarser scales.</p><p>The second method presented is a technique for potentially "instant" imaging. Image acquisition is modeled as an inverse wavelet transform of the spin density in the region in question. Signal acquisition takes place in as little as one echo after excitation by radio frequency (RF) pulses designed to excite a moving band of spins across the slice. This replaces phase-encoding gradients; no fast pulsed gradients are required as in echo planar imaging.</p><p>of signal processing to be done on the images after one has acquired them. Noise filtering, edge enhancement, and efficient digital transmission and storage of the images may benefit from wavelet techniques. In addition, other modes of image acquisition may be possible. To date, we have not considered tomographic reconstruction in MRI or elsewhere, but the recent work of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[24]</ref> suggests that wavelets may be applicable in this setting as well. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1.

Gabor's choice of the Gaussian yields a family of phase space translates g,, representing signals optimally concentrated around time r and frequency w in the sense of the Heisenberg variance product measure of phase space resolution.</figDesc></figure>
