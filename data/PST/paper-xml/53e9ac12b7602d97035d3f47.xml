<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We propose a framework for the study of covering based rough set approximations. Three equivalent formulations of the classical rough sets are examined by using equivalence relations, partitions, and r-algebras, respectively.

Covering based rough sets are systematically investigated by generalizing these formulations and definitions. A covering of universe of objects is used to generate different neighborhood operators, neighborhood systems, coverings, and subsystems of the power set of the universe.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>A fundamental assumption of the theory of rough sets is that relationship, more precisely indiscernibility, of objects is defined by an equivalence relation, or equivalently a partition of the universe <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. Ever since the introduction of rough sets in the early 1980s, many attempts have been made to remove this assumption. By the fact that a covering is a generalization of a partition, it is natural to investigate covering based generalizations of rough sets.</p><p>A review of existing studies shows a great diversity of research on covering based rough sets (see <ref type="bibr">Section 2)</ref>. There is a recent surge of interest on this topic; new approximation operators are constantly being proposed and studied. On the other hand, there is still a lack of a common framework within which existing results can be classified and summarized systematically and coherently. The main objective of this paper is to serve such a purpose. We propose a general framework for the study of covering based rough sets and summarize and extend existing results within the framework.</p><p>Our framework is inspired by an insightful comment by Feynman <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> on the character of physical law. Feynman points out the importance of deriving different, but mathematically equivalent, formulations of the same physical law. Although different formulations are mathematically equivalent, they are psychologically unequivalent. Different possible formulations give distinctive clues when one guesses new laws in a wider situation. When this argument is applied to the study of covering based rough sets, we must consider different but equivalent formulations of the Pawlak approximation operators and examine their possible generalizations. In fact, our previous studies on generalized rough sets explored the important roles of multiple formulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>, which serves as a basis of this paper. As pointed by one reviewer of this article, the same argument can be applied to study reducts in rough set theory through a ''comparison of equivalent ways of formulating decision reducts in consistent decision tables, which are not equivalent any longer in case of inconsistent tables or in case of approximate reduction criteria. <ref type="bibr">''</ref> In the Pawlak rough set model, an equivalence relation offers two additional equivalent structures. One is the partition induced by the equivalence relation, and the other is the atomic Boolean algebra with the partition as its set of atoms.</p><p>The latter is also an r-algebra with each element being the union of a family of equivalence classes from the partition. Consequently, we can obtain three equivalent formulations of rough sets, namely, the equivalence relation based formulation, the partition based formulation, and the r-algebra based formulation. They immediately offer hints to generalizing Pawlak rough sets in three directions <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. One may consider an arbitrary binary relation in generalizing the equivalence relation, a covering in generalizing the partition, and a subsystem in generalizing the r-algebra. With each formulation, one may also examine various definitions of approximation operators. In this paper, we choose the element based definition for relation based formulation, the granule based definition for the partition based formulation, and the subsystem based definition for r-algebra based formulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. The same argument can be easily applied when other definitions are used.</p><p>Unlike the case of an equivalence relation, given a covering of the universe, one can define several binary relations, or equivalently 1-neighborhood operators <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>, new coverings, and subsystems. Consequently, we can derive many different approximation operators based on the three definitions. They include many existing approximation operators and new ones.</p><p>The main ideas of the proposed framework are summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, where , indicates a one-to-one two-way construction process, ) indicates a one way construction process, and G ? indicates a connection of a notion to its generalization. It needs to be pointed out that the discussion of this paper is restricted to a finite universe; some results may not necessarily hold for an infinite universe.</p><p>According to the framework given by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the main results from existing studies, which motivates the current research. Section 3 proposes a unified framework by considering three different, but equivalent, formulations of rough sets and three different, but equivalent, definitions of approximation operators. They lead to three directions in generalizing approximation operators. Section 4 investigates various structures induced by a covering of a finite universe. Section 5 defines twenty pairs of approximation operators by using these structures and classifies and characterizes approximation operators introduced in other studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">A brief review of studies on covering based rough sets</head><p>The results from the main studies on covering based rough sets are summarized in this section to motivate the current research. More details can be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref> and discussions in Section 5.</p><p>In 1983, _ Zakowski <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> first proposed the notion of covering based rough set approximations. A pair of lower and upper approximation operators are defined by a straightforward generalization of the Pawlak definition. However, unlike the Pawlak approximation operators, the generalized approximation operators are no longer dual to each other with respect to set complement <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>. By modifying _ Zakowski's definition, Pomykała <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> studied two pairs of dual approximation operators. The lower approximation operator in one pair is the same as _ Zakowski lower approximation operator, and the upper approximation operator in the other pair is the same as _ Zakowski upper approximation operator. By using other mathematical structures induced by a covering, Pomykała <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> suggested and examined additional pairs of dual approximation operators. Furthermore, he considered coverings produced by tolerance relations (i.e., reflexive and symmetric relations) in an incomplete information table. In particular, each subset in the covering is called an elementary set induced by the tolerance relation, which is also called a maximal tolerance block or a maximal consistent block by some authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</p><p>Yao <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref> investigated dual approximation operators by using coverings produced by the predecessor and/or successor neighborhoods of serial or inverse serial binary relations. The two pairs of dual approximation operators introduced by Pomykała <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref> were examined and the conditions for their equivalence to those obtained from a binary relation were given. Couso and Dubois <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> referred to the two pairs as the loose pair and the tight pair, respectively. They presented an interesting investigation of the two pairs of approximation operators within the context of incomplete information. The two pairs of operators were shown to be related to the family of approximation operators produced by all partitions consistent with a covering induced by an ill-known attribute function in an incomplete information table. The result provides a theoretical justification supporting the adoption of the two pairs of operators. Instead of using the duality, Wybraniec-Skardowska <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> studied pairs of approximation operators linked together by a different type of relations. Given an upper approximation operator, the corresponding lower approximation operator is defined based on the upper approximations of singleton subsets. Several such pairs of approximation operators were studied based on a covering and a tolerance relation defined by a covering, including some of these used by _ Zakowski <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> and Pomykała <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>Bryniarski <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> investigated a different pair of approximation operators. The lower approximation operator is the same as _ Zakowski lower approximation operator, but the upper approximation operator is different. The two operators are linked together by the approximation condition satisfied by a covering, namely, for every pair of subsets in a covering, if one is a subset of the other, there must exist a set such that these two subsets are the lower and upper approximations of the set. In other words, Bryniarski considered a special type of coverings. Related to Bryniarski's study, Bonikowski et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> introduced the notion of the minimal description of an object (i.e., the set of all minimal subsets containing the object in a covering) induced by a covering and examined a new pair of approximation operators. The lower approximation operator is again the same as _ Zakowski lower approximation operator, but the upper approximation operator is different. Based on these earlier studies, starting in 2001, there is a surge of research interest in covering based rough sets. The investigations can be divided into two groups. One group focused on new dual pairs of approximation operators, in addition to the two pairs studied by Pomykała <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref> and Yao <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>. The other group focused on non-dual approximation operators. Studies on non-dual approximation operators can be further divided into two subgroups. One of them investigated _ Zakowski approximation operators with respect to specific types of coverings; the other, with major contributions from Zhu and his associates <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87]</ref>, accepted only _ Zakowski lower approximation and proposed new upper approximations. The upper approximations were introduced in a way suggested by Bryniarski <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and Bonikowski et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>; they normally fall within the Bryniarski and _ Zakowski upper approximations. S ´le ˛zak and Wasilewski <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref> studied the pair of _ Zakowski approximation operators based on a covering induced by a tolerance relation. In most cases, approximation operators studied in the latter group are not dual operators.</p><p>By using the minimum neighborhood of an object (i.e., the intersection of subsets in the minimal description of the object), Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> introduced a pair of dual approximation operators. The same pair of approximation operators was also used and examined by Xu and Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> and Xu and Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Liu and Sai <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> gave an axiomatic system for this pair of approximation operators. Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> introduced two pairs of approximation operators in a similar way, but used two different neighborhoods of an object. Qin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> studied five pairs of dual approximation operators based on a covering and the minimum neighborhood induced by a covering. The connections between the five pairs were investigated. In fact, their first two pairs are the same as the ones introduced by Pomykała <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>, Yao <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>, and Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p><p>Mordeson <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> examined the pair of _ Zakowski approximation operators by considering special types of coverings, namely, semi-reduced and reduced coverings with respect to set union. Similarly, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> used the _ Zakowski approximation operators by considering a covering induced by the original covering and a covering induced by a family of coverings.</p><p>In comparison, the majority of studies on non-dual approximation operators introduced new upper approximation operators. Zhu and his associates <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref> systematically studied five types of approximation operators. They consist of new approximation operators and those existing ones studied by _ Zakowski <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>, Pomykała <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>, Yao <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, Xu and Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, and others. While the lower approximation operator is the _ Zakowski lower approximation operator, the upper approximation operators are different. Zhu and associates investigated properties of these operators and their relationships; they also provided sets of axioms for characterizing these operators. Their studies represent a step towards a general framework for the study of various approximation operators. More examples of studies on non-dual approximation operators are given below. Tsang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> defined an upper approximation operator by the union of all subsets in the minimal description of each object in the set to be approximated. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> defined two pairs approximation operators based on the difference between the set and a neighborhood of the set induced by a covering. Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> introduced another upper approximation operator and studied its relationship to operators proposed by Zhu. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> established independent axiomatic systems to characterize three pairs of covering based approximation operators.</p><p>Zhu and Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref> introduced the concept of a reduct of a covering, which provides another way to construct a reduced covering from the original covering. This topic was further studied by some authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. There are several additional research topics related to covering based rough sets, including, for example, topological structures induced by approximation operators <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79]</ref> and approximation operators based on fuzzy coverings <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</p><p>Although many different covering based approximation operators have been proposed and studied extensively, there does not exist a framework to put all these studies together. Moreover, the semantics of different approximation operators are not entirely clear. This is particular true for non-dual approximation operators. There is no convincing argument to support that one lower approximation is associated with many upper approximations. It is expected that new approximation operators will be proposed by researchers in the near future in much an ad hoc manner. All of these call for a general framework and a more systematic formulation of covering based rough sets.</p><p>Since the submission of the first version of this paper in November 2009, we have in fact witnessed another wave of studies on covering based rough sets. For completeness, we briefly review studies since then based on a list of sample, nonexhausive publications.</p><p>Samanta and Chakraborty <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> provided a systematic study and survey of about ten pairs of approximation operators, their properties, and their implication lattices. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> discussed poset approaches to covering based rough sets, introduced the notion of covering numbers for a quantitative study, and investigated matroidal structures of covering based rough sets.</p><p>Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> defined a binary relation based on the relative number of common subsets in a covering for pairs of elements and introduced a pair of approximations operators based on the induced binary relation. Abo-Tabl <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> examined two types of rough set approximation based on a similarity relation and studied their connections to covering based rough set approximations. Zhu <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref> showed that one can construct upper approximations without explicitly using neighborhoods. Liu and Miao <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> introduced covering based rough sets using multi-granulations. Lin and Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> studied covering based rough sets based on pessimistic multi-granulations. Zheng and Dai <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> considered a variable precision model of covering based rough sets. Zhang and Luo <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref> gave a minimal set of axioms for covering based approximations. Yun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> presented another axiomatic study on covering based rough sets.</p><p>Yang and Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> and Li and Wu <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> studied attribute reduction in covering based rough sets, and Feng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> studied reduction of fuzzy covering systems. Du et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> presented algorithms for rule discovery based on coverings defined by neighborhoods of numerical attributes values.</p><p>Shi and Gong <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, and Zhu and Wen <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> examined uncertainty measures in covering based rough sets. Bianucci et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> investigated systematically entropy and co-entropy of a covering. Ge et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> studied granularity-wise separation in covering approximation spaces. Ciucci <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> studied temporal dynamics in covering based on rough sets. Diker and Ug ˘ur <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> examined the connections between textures and covering based rough sets. Li and Liu <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> investigated covering based rough sets using matroid theory.</p><p>Based on a review of these recent studies, our observations and conclusions made in 2009 are still applicable today. In fact, the need for a unified framework for studying covering based rough sets is even more urgent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">A framework for formulating rough set approximations</head><p>We present a general framework for formulating rough set approximations in two steps. In the first step, we examine three mathematically equivalent definitions of Pawlak rough set approximations; in the second step, we study different directions of generalizations according to each of the three definitions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Three definitions of Pawlak rough set approximations</head><p>Suppose U is a finite and non-empty set called the universe. Let E # U Â U be an equivalence relation on U. The pair apr = (U, E) is called an approximation space <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. A few definitions of rough set approximations can be derived based on different representations of an equivalence relation.</p><p>An equivalence relation E can be conveniently represented by a mapping from U to P(U), where P(U) is the power set of U. More specifically, the mapping [Á] E is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">½x E ¼ fyjy 2 U; xEyg:<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>The subset [x] E is the equivalence class containing x. The family of all equivalence classes is commonly known as the quotient set and is denoted by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">U/E = {[x] E jx 2 U}.</formula><p>It defines a partition of the universe, namely, a family of pairwise disjoint non-empty subsets whose union is the universe. A new family of subsets, denoted by r(U/E), can be obtained from U/E by adding the empty set ; and making it closed under set union, which is a subsystem of P(U), that is, r(U/E) # P(U). In fact, it is an r-algebra of subsets of U and a sub-Boolean algebra of the Boolean algebra (P(U), $, \, [), where $, \, and [ represent set complement, intersection and union, respectively. Furthermore, r(U/E) defines uniquely a topological space (U, r(U/E)), in which r(U/E) is the family of all open and closed sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>Under the equivalence relation, we have a coarsened view of the universe. Each equivalence class is considered as a whole granule instead of many individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. They are considered as the elementary definable, observable, or measurable subsets of the universe <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref>. The definability of sets can be formally expressed in terms of a logic language in an information table. More precisely, a set is definable if it can be characterized by a logic formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. By the construction of r(U/E), all subsets in r(U/E) are definable. To a large extent, the standard rough set theory deals with the approximation of any subset of U in terms of definable subsets in r(U/E). From the different representations of an equivalence relation, one can obtain three definitions of Pawlak rough set approximations <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>.</p><p>Definition 1. In an approximation space apr = (U, E) with E being an equivalence relation on U, the Pawlak rough set approximations are defined by the following three equivalent definitions: Element based definition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">aprðAÞ ¼ fxjx 2 U; ½x E # Ag ¼ fxjx 2 U; 8y 2 U½xEy ) y 2 Ag; aprðAÞ ¼ fxjx 2 U; ½x E \ A -;g ¼ fxjx 2 U; 9y 2 U½xEy; y 2 Ag;<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>Granule based definition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">aprðAÞ ¼ [ f½x E j½x E 2 U=E; ½x E # Ag ¼ [ fXjX 2 U=E; X # Ag; aprðAÞ ¼ [ f½x E j½x E 2 U=E; ½x E \ A -;g ¼ [ fXjX 2 U=E; X \ A -;g;<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>Subsystem based definition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">aprðAÞ ¼ [ fXjX 2 rðU=EÞ; X # Ag; aprðAÞ ¼ \ fXjX 2 rðU=EÞ; A # Xg:<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>The three equivalent definitions offer different interpretations of rough set approximations. According to the element based definition, an element x is in the lower approximation apr(A) of a set A if all its equivalent elements are in A; the element is in the upper approximation aprðAÞ if at least one of its equivalent elements is in A. According to the granule based definition, apr(A) is the union of equivalence classes that are subsets of A, aprðAÞ is the union of equivalence classes that have a non-empty intersection with A. According to the subsystem based definition, apr(A) is the largest definable set in the subsystem r(U/E) that is contained in A, aprðAÞ is the smallest definable subset in r(U/E) that contains the set A.</p><p>Grzymala-Busse <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> refers to the element based and granule based definitions as the singleton based approximations and the subset based approximations, respectively. In general, one may use other equivalent definitions.

The notions of reducible subsets and reducts can be immediately applied to a covering and related structures.

In the classical rough set model, we have </p><formula xml:id="formula_29">\-reduct(r(U/E) À {;}) = {U} [ {U À [x] E jx 2 U} = {U} [ { $ [x] E jx 2 U} and [-reduct(r(U/E) À {;}) = U/E.</formula><formula xml:id="formula_30">[-reductðC 1 Þ ¼ C 1 ; [-reductðC 3 Þ ¼ C 3 ; \-reductðC 2 Þ ¼ [-reductðC 2 Þ ¼ C 2 :</formula><p>The proof of the theorem is given in the Appendix.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Subsystems induced by a covering</head><p>In the Pawlak rough set model, the r-algebra, r(U/E), is formed by making U/E to be closed under set union, which also happens to be closed under set complement and intersection. In order to generalize the subsystem based definition, we can construct a pair of dual systems S ¼ ðS; SÞ from a covering such that S is a closure system. There are two possibilities for defining such a system. Definition 16. Let C be a covering of a universe U. The intersection closure of C, denoted by \-closureðCÞ, is the minimum subset of P(U) that contains C; ; and U, and is closed under set intersection. The union closure, [-closureðCÞ, is the minimum subset of P(U) that contains C; ; and U, and is closed under set union.</p><p>By this definition, \-closureðCÞ is a closure system, and the dual of \-closureðCÞ, denoted by ð\-closureðCÞÞ 0 , is closed under set union. Similarly, the dual of [-closureðCÞ, denoted by ð[-closureðCÞÞ 0 is a closure system. They may be used to define approximation operators. </p><formula xml:id="formula_32">\-closureðCÞ ¼ \-closureðC \ Þ; [-closureðCÞ ¼ [-closureðC [ Þ:</formula><p>A simple proof of the theorem is given in the Appendix. An important implication of the theorem is that if the subsystem based definition is used, \-reductðCÞ and [-reductðCÞ will produce the same pairs of approximation operators. This observation provides a plausible justification for studying \-reduct and [-reduct of a covering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Classification of covering based approximation operators</head><p>Within the framework proposed in Section 3, we can immediately investigate various classes of approximation operators by using the structures induced by a covering, as introduced in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Approximation operators</head><p>With the element based, the granule based and the subsystem based definitions, one can obtain three families of approximation operators.

From a given covering C, we can construct six additional coverings, namely, C 1 ; C 2 ; C 3 ; C 4 ; C \ and C [ . By inserting each covering into the granule based definition, we obtain two pairs of approximation operators, namely, the tight pair and the loose pair. For example, by inserting C 1 , we obtain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">apr 0 C 1 ðAÞ ¼ [ fKjK 2 C 1 ; K # Ag; apr 0 C 1 ðAÞ ¼ $ apr 0 C 1 ð$ AÞ; apr 00 C 1 ðAÞ ¼ $ apr 00 C 1 ð$ AÞ; apr 00 C 1 ðAÞ ¼ [ fKjK 2 C 1 ; K \ A -;g:<label>ð35Þ</label></formula><p>Other pairs of approximation operators can be similarly defined and are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref>.</p><p>With respect to the subsystem based definition, we can use the two subsystems:</p><p>S \ ¼ ðð\-closureðCÞÞ 0 ; \-closureðCÞÞ;</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">S [ ¼ ð[-closureðCÞ; ð[-closureðCÞÞ 0 Þ:<label>ð36Þ</label></formula><p>This leads to two pairs approximation operators: </p><formula xml:id="formula_36">apr S\<label>ðAÞ</label></formula><p>They are listed at the bottom of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref>.</p><p>To conclude this subsection, we make several comments on the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref>. First, if one uses the concept based definition, this list can be further expanded. The results of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref> may be viewed as examples of approximation operators based on a covering. Second, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref> contains operators proposed and studied by many authors and new operators. For a review of operators that have been proposed in existing studies, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref> in the next subsection. At the same time, it should be pointed out that some existing approximation operators are not covered by this table. In order to produce these operators, one needs to search for additional definitions (e.g., concept based definition) and new structures. Nevertheless, the general framework, as shown by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, is still applicable. Third, some operators in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref> are closely related. For example, the tight pair and loose pair defined by a covering are related. The pairs of operators apr 00 C ; apr 00 C and ðapr N 4 ; apr N 4 Þ are, in fact, the same, namely, apr 00 C ¼ apr N 4 and apr 00 C ¼ apr N 4 . It will be interesting to investigate systematically relationships among the twenty pairs of operators. Fourth, each pair of approximation operators reflects the information provided by a specific aspect of a covering. From a pure theoretical point of view, one may only study their mathematical properties; it is difficult to argue which pair is more reasonable, meaningful or useful. In order to answer this question, one must fall back to the semantics of a covering in particular applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Summary of studies on covering based approximation operators</head><p>Based on the approximation operators from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref>, we are ready to summarize the main results from the existing studies.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref> is a summary of the most commonly used covering based approximation operators published before the end of 2009. We group them into three groups, the first group consists of pairs of dual approximation operators, the second group consists of pairs of non-dual approximation operators, and the last group consists of pairs of operators such that only one operator is from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref> and the other is not. For example, the pair ðapr 0 C ; ÁÞ indicate that only the lower approximation operator apr 0 C is used and the upper approximation operator is defined differently from any of the upper approximation operators in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref>. The column labeled by ''references'' provides only some examples that use the particular pair of operators; they are not intent to be an exhaustive list. To illustrate the historical development, references are ordered according to the year of publication. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref> may be read together with the brief review of Section 2.</p><p>One can make some useful observations from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref>. First, the proposed framework enables us to reproduce many existing approximation operators and to introduce new approximation operators. It shows that the proposed framework is reasonable and may help us to obtain a better understanding of approximation operators. Differences between different operators stem from the fact that they are obtained by generalizing different formulations of the Pawlak approximation operators. Each of them captures a different aspect of approximation with a covering. It is theoretically difficult to justify which is more reasonable. Some authors reject _ Zakowski upper approximation by the fact that it is a very loose upper bound. Without considering the structure of a covering, such a criticism has to be carefully examined. As shown in the table, we can obtain several additional coverings. The _ Zakowski upper approximation may, in fact, be meaningful for some of these coverings.</p><p>Second, some of the existing approximation operators are not present in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref>. In order to contain such definitions, one may use the same conceptual framework by considering other definitions of Pawlak approximation operators. Alternatively, one may consider other structures induced by a covering. In this case, the same framework can be used. In some sense, the results in Table 2 may be considered as examples of applying the general concept framework given in the Introduction by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Third, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref> offer possible future research topics. For example, one may study relationships between these approximation operators. One may investigate an axiomatic system for each of these operators. One may examine the conditions under which some operators will become the same. One may establish a linkage between properties of a covering and properties of approximation operators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>A general framework is proposed and examined for the study of covering based rough sets. We first review equivalent formulations and definitions of Pawlak approximation operators and then generalize them to the context of a covering. We consider three formulations and three definitions, namely, the equivalence relation based formulation with element based definition, the partition based formulation with granule based definition, and r-algebra based formulation with subsystem based definition. This framework enables us to reproduce many existing approximation operators and to introduce new approximation operators.</p><p>From a covering of universe, we construct four different neighborhoods, six new coverings, and two subsystems. Together, they give rise to twenty pairs of dual approximation operators. These operators reflect a wide range of different aspects of approximations under a covering. Based on the proposed framework, one can also study additional approximation operators. In addition, the same framework may be used to investigate approximation operators with other mathematical structures.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A. Proofs of theorems</head><p>Theorem 6 (the first part). Let K be an intersection reducible subset in F. In this paper, we only consider a finite set U and, consequently, a finite family F. This means that K can be expressed as the union of a finite family of subsets, say {G 1 , . . . , G m }, from (F À {K}), that is, K = G 1 \ . . . \ G m and K -G i , 1 6 i 6 m. Suppose that K 1 is an intersection reducible subset in (F À {K}), by definition it is also an intersection reducible subset in F. Now assume that K 1 -K is an intersection reducible subset in F, that is, K 1 = M 1 \ . . . \ M n , where M j 2 F À {K 1 }. For the expression of K 1 , we need to consider two cases. Case 1: K -M j for any 1 6 j 6 n. It follows that M j 2 ((F À {K}) À {K 1 }). Thus, by definition K 1 is an intersection reducible subset in (F À {K}). Case 2: K is one of M j 's. Without loss of generality, we assume K = M 1 . We have</p><p>It can be verified that G i -K 1 for any 1 6 j 6 m, for otherwise we would have K = K 1 . Therefore, G i 2 ((F À {K}) À {K 1 }) and M j 2 ((F À {K}) À {K 1 }) for 1 6 i 6 m and 2 6 j 6 n. One can also conclude that K 1 is an intersection reducible subset in (F À {K}).</p><p>Theorem 7. We only prove the first equality and the same technique can be used to prove the others. To prove</p><p>there must exist an object x 2 U such that K 2 mdðC; xÞ. This implies that x 2 K. By the expression of K, there must exist a subset K i 0 , 1 6 i 0 6 r, such that x 2 K i 0 . From K i 0 2 C 1 # C and K i &amp; K, one can conclude that K i 0 is a neighborhood of x that is strictly smaller than K. This results in a contradiction to K 2 mdðC; xÞ. Thus, K must be [-irreducible.</p><p>Theorem 8. By the definition of \-reduct, we can easily generate a subset in C by taking the intersection of a family of subsets in C \ . That is, we can obtain C from C \ through an application of set intersection. By the definition of \-closure, it easily follows that C and C \ will produce the same \-closure. Similarly, by the definitions of [-reduct and [-closure, we can show that C and C [ will produce the same [-closure.</p></div>			</div>
