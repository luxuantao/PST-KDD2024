<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>F OR MORE than two decades, ultrasonography has been considered as one of the most powerful techniques for imaging organs and soft tissue structures in the human body. Today, it is being used at an ever-increasing rate in the field of medical diagnostic technology. Ultrasonography is often preferred over other medical imaging modalities because it is noninvasive, portable, and versatile, it does not use ionizing radiations, and it is relatively low-cost. The images produced by commercial ultrasound systems are usually optimized for visual interpretation, since they are mostly used in real-time diagnostic situations. However, the main disadvantage of medical ultrasonography is the poor quality of images, which are affected by multiplicative speckle noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Imaging speckle is a phenomenon that occurs when a coherent source and a noncoherent detector are used to interrogate a medium, which is rough on the scale of the wavelength. Speckle occurs especially in images of the liver and kidney whose underlying structures are too small to be resolved by large wavelength ultrasound. The presence of speckle is undesirable since it degrades image quality and it affects the tasks of human interpretation and diagnosis. As a result, speckle filtering is a critical pre-processing step for feature extraction, analysis, and recognition from medical imagery measurements.</p><p>Current speckle reduction methods are based on temporal averaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, median filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and Wiener filtering. The adaptive weighted median filter, first introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, can effectively suppress speckle but it fails to preserve many useful details, being merely a low-pass filter. The classical Wiener filter, which utilizes the second-order statistics of the Fourier decomposition, is not adequate for removing speckle since it is designed mainly for additive noise suppression. To address the multiplicative nature of speckle noise, Jain developed a homomorphic approach, which by taking the logarithm of the image, converts the multiplicative into additive noise, and consequently applies the Wiener filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Recently, there has been considerably interest in using the wavelet transform as a powerful tool for recovering signals from noisy data <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The main reason for the choice of multiscale bases of decompositions is that the statistics of many natural signals, when decomposed in such bases, are significantly simplified. More specifically, methods based on multiscale decompositions consist of three main steps: First, the raw data are analyzed by means of the wavelet transform, then the empirical wavelet coefficients are shrunk, and finally, the denoised signal is synthesized from the processed wavelet coefficients through the inverse wavelet transform. These methods are generally referred to as wavelet shrinkage techniques. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Zong et al. use a logarithmic transform to separate the noise from the original image. They adopt regularized soft thresholding (wavelet shrinkage) to remove noise energy within the finer scales and nonlinear processing of feature energy for contrast enhancement. A similar approach applied to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The authors perform a comparative study between a complex wavelet coefficient shrinkage filter and several standard speckle filters that are largely used by SAR imaging scientists, and show that the wavelet-based approach is among the best for speckle removal.</p><p>Thresholding methods have two main drawbacks: 1) the choice of the threshold, arguably the most important design parameter, is done in an ad hoc manner; and 2) the specific distributions of the signal and noise may not be well matched at different scales. To address these disadvantages, Simoncelli et al. developed nonlinear estimators, based on formal Bayesian theory, which outperform classical linear processors and simple thresholding estimators in removing noise from visual images <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. They used a generalized Laplacian model for the subband statistics of the signal and developed a noise-removal algorithm, which performs a "coring" operation to the data. The term "coring" refers to a widely used technique for noise suppression, which preserves high-amplitude observations while suppressing low-amplitude values from the high-pass bands of a signal decomposition.</p><p>It is recognized that parametric Bayesian processing presupposes proper modeling for the prior probability density function (PDF) of the signal. In a recent work, Tsakalides et al. showed that alpha-stable distributions, a family of heavy-tailed densities, are sufficiently flexible and rich to appropriately model wavelet coefficients of images in coding applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In this paper, we present a novel speckle suppression method for medical ultrasound images. The proposed processor consists of two major modules: 1) a subband representation function that utilizes the wavelet transform; and 2) a Bayesian denoising algorithm based on an alpha-stable prior for the signal. First, the original image is logarithmically transformed to change multiplicative speckle to additive white noise. Then, the transformed image is analyzed into a multiscale wavelet domain. We show that the subband decompositions of actual ultrasound images have significantly non-Gaussian statistics that are best described by families of heavy-tailed distributions like the alpha-stable. Motivated by our modeling results, we design a Bayesian estimator that exploits these statistics. We use the alpha-stable model to develop a blind speckle-suppression processor that performs a nonlinear operation on the data, and we relate this nonlinearity to the degree of non-Gaussianity of the data.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we define the ultrasound speckle suppression problem by outlining the speckle noise model and common preprocessing steps such as the logarithmic and the wavelet transforms. Section III provides some necessary preliminaries on alpha-stable processes and presents results on the modeling of the subband coefficients of actual medical ultrasound images indicating their heavy-tailed nature. The design of a Bayesian estimator that exploits the signal alpha-stable statistics is described in Section IV. Section V compares the performance of our proposed algorithm with the performance of current denoising methods applied to actual ultrasound images and quantifies the achieved performance improvement. Finally, conclusions and future work directions are drawn in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>Speckle noise affects all coherent imaging systems including laser, SAR imagery, and ultrasound. Speckle may appear distinct in different imaging systems but it is always manifested in a granular pattern due to image formation under coherent waves. The basic properties of speckle are described by Goodman in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> while the main differences between ultrasound and laser speckle are discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. A general model for speckle noise proposed by Jain <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> was also used by Zong <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In the following, we formulate the ultrasound speckle removal problem starting with a brief essential overview of the speckle model.</p><p>Denote by a noisy observation (i.e., the recorded ultrasound image) of the two-dimensional (2-D) function (i.e., the noise-free image that has to be recovered) and by and the corrupting multiplicative and additive speckle noise components, respectively. One can write <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> Generally, the effect of the additive component of the speckle in ultrasound images is less significant than the effect of the multiplicative component. Thus, ignoring the term , one can rewrite (1) as <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> To transform the multiplicative noise model into an additive one, we apply the logarithmic function on both sides of (2)</p><p>(3) Expression (3) can be rewritten as <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> where , , and are the logarithms of , , and , respectively. In fact, this logarithmic transform constitutes the first preprocessing step of our proposed algorithm as shown in the block diagram depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>At this stage, one can consider to be white noise and subsequently apply any conventional additive noise suppression technique, such as Wiener filtering. However, it is recognized that standard noise filtering methods often result in blurred image features. Indeed, single-scale representations of signals, either in time or in frequency, are often inadequate when attempting to separate signals from noisy data. The wavelet transform has been proposed as a useful processing tool for signal recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>The wavelet transform expands a signal using a set of basis functions, which are obtained from a single prototype function called the "mother wavelet." The result of the expansion is a sequence of signal approximations at successively coarser resolutions. The so-called "detail signal" is the difference in information between approximations at two consecutive resolu-tions, and it can be represented by another series expansion. If we consider an original 2-D signal of size , usually being a power of 2 , such a decomposition scheme is mathematically referred to as the dyadic wavelet transform (DWT). In image processing applications, the above scheme is applied along both the abscissa and the ordinate. Thus, the DWT decomposes images with a multiresolution scale factor of two, providing at each resolution level one low-resolution approximation and three spatially oriented wavelet details <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, which are referred as image subbands.</p><p>The wavelet transform is a linear operation. Consequently, after applying the DWT to (4) we get, in each of the three directions, sets of noisy wavelet coefficients written as the sum of the transformations of the signal and of the noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> where and refer to the decomposition level or scale and 1, 2, 3 refers to the three spatial orientations. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, we show an example of a three-scale decomposition of an ultrasound image.</p><p>Current state-of-the-art multiscale techniques for ultrasonic speckle suppression are based on various thresholding schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. These methods try to address the inability of the original soft thresholding technique to balance between speckle suppression and signal detail preservation. In principle, a successful ultrasound imaging algorithm should achieve both noise reduction and feature preservation if it takes into consideration the true statistics of the signal and noise components. Previous studies related to wavelet shrinkage using Bayesian theory have underlined the need for a prior model that accurately approximates the probability density function of the signal and noise wavelet coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. For example, (1)-( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) suggest the use of a multiplicative random field as speckle noise model. It has been shown that, if the number of scatterers per resolution cell is large, a fully developed speckle pattern can be modeled as the magnitude of a complex Gaussian field with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) real and imaginary components (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and references therein). In order to generate spatially correlated speckle noise for use in simulations, one can lowpass filter a complex Gaussian random field and take the magnitude of the filtered output <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>The Bayesian approach for ultrasound speckle noise removal, which we propose in this paper, is based on a novel heavy-tailed family of distributions that better models the prior statistics of the signal component. In Section III, we present the fundamental properties of the model and we justify its use by fitting actual ultrasonic signals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. ALPHA-STABLE MODELING OF ULTRASOUND WAVELET COEFFICIENTS</head><p>This section is intended to provide an introduction on the alpha-stable statistical model used to characterize the wavelet subband coefficients of logarithmic transforms of actual ultrasound images. The model is suitable for describing signals that have highly non-Gaussian statistics and its parameters can be estimated from noisy observations. The appearance of alpha- stable models in the context of ultrasound images has been already noticed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, but they were used to process the ultrasound RF echoes, rather than the recorded images. A review of the state of the art on stable processes from a statistical point of view is provided by a collection of papers edited by Cambanis, Samorodnitsky and Taqqu <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, while textbooks in the area have been written by Samorodnitsky and Taqqu <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and by Nikias and Shao <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Basic Properties of the Alpha-Stable Family</head><p>The appeal of symmetric alpha-stable (</p><p>) distributions as a statistical model for signals derives from some important theoretical and empirical reasons. First, stable random variables satisfy the stability property which states that linear combinations of jointly stable variables are indeed stable. The word stable is used because the shape of the distribution is unchanged (or stable) under such linear combinations. Second, stable processes arise as limiting processes of sums of i.i.d. random variables via the generalized central limit theorem. Actually, the only possible nontrivial limit of normalized sums of i.i.d. terms is stable. On the other hand, strong empirical evidence suggests that many data sets in several physical and economic systems exhibit heavy tail features that justify the use of stable models <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>The distribution is best defined by its characteristic function For values of in the interval , the location parameter corresponds to the mean of the distribution, while for , corresponds to its median. The dispersion parameter determines the spread of the distribution around its location parameter , similar to the variance of the Gaussian distribution.</p><p>The characteristic exponent is the most important parameter of the distribution and it determines the shape of the distribution. The smaller the characteristic exponent is, the heavier the tails of the density. This implies that random variables following distributions with small characteristic exponents are highly impulsive. Gaussian processes are stable processes with 2 while Cauchy processes result when 1. In fact, no closed-form expressions for the general PDF are known except for the Gaussian and the Cauchy members.</p><p>Although the density behaves approximately like a Gaussian density near the origin, its tails decay at a lower rate than the Gaussian density tails <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Indeed, let be a non-Gaussian random variable. Then, as</p><p>where , is the Gamma function, and the statement as means that 1. Hence, the tail probabilities are asymptotically power laws. In other words, while the Gaussian density has exponential tails, the stable densities have algebraic tails. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows the tail behavior of several densities including the Cauchy and the Gaussian. We should note that because expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> gives exactly the tail probability of the Pareto distribution, the term "stable Paretian laws" is used to distinguish between the fast decay of the Gaussian law and the Pareto like tail behavior when . The alpha-stable tail power law provided one of the earliest approaches in estimating the stability index of real measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The empirical distribution of the data, plotted on a log-log scale, should approach a straight line with slope if the data is stable. Another approach is based on quantiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Maximum likelihood (ML) methods developed by Du-Mouchel <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and by Brorsen and Yang <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> are asymptotically efficient but were considered difficult to compute. Recently, Nolan showed that ML estimation of stable parameters is feasible by designing an efficient program <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>One consequence of heavy tails is that only moments of order less than exist for the non-Gaussian alpha-stable family members, i.e., for</p><p>As a result, stable Paretian laws have infinite variance. In the past, the infinite variance property of the family has caused skeptics to dismiss the stable model. With the same reasoning, one could argue that the routinely used Gaussian distribution, which has infinite support, should also be dismissed as a model of bounded measurements. In practice, one should remember that it is important to capture the shape of the distribution and that the variance is only one measure of the spread of a density <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Modeling Results of Ultrasound Image Subbands</head><p>In the past, several authors have pointed out that, in a subband representation of images, histograms of wavelet coefficients have heavier tails and more sharply peaked modes at zero than what is assumed by the Gaussian distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In this section, we study whether the stable family provides a flexible and appropriate tool for modeling the coefficients within the framework of multiscale wavelet analysis of logarithmically transformed ultrasound images.</p><p>Two sets of test images, obtained from two different sources, are included in this research. The first set consists of a series of 44 abdominal ultrasound images (DICOM format) including liver, kidney, gall bladder, and pancreas images. These images were acquired from the same patient with a 4-MHz transducer frequency on a GE LOGIQ 500 system. They have been made available to us by the IT Lab at the Medical University of South Carolina. The second set of test data comes from a directory containing example DICOM image files that were donated by various vendors for the DICOM demonstrations held at the annual meetings of the Radiological Society of North America from 1993 to 1996 (ftp://wuerlim.wustl.edu/pub/dicom/images/). We considered two criteria for selecting images for our test set. First, we looked for good quality images in order to be able to consider them as noise-free. Moreover, since speckle appears to some extent in any ultrasound image, we have first processed the actual images using the homomorphic Wiener filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and considered the resulting images as reasonable approximations of the speckle free data. Also, we were interested in performing experiments on images of different organs and from various sources in order to be able to obtain modeling results, which we can claim to be general enough. Because of limited space, in this paper we describe the modeling of eight representative images. Each image is referred with the name of the organ that was imaged. All of them have a 256 gray-level resolution.</p><p>We proceed in two steps: First, we assess whether the data deviate from the normal distribution and if they have heavy tails.</p><p>To determine that, we make use of the normal probability plots. Characterization of data non-Gaussianity. The "" marks correspond to the empirical probability density versus the data value for each point in the sample. Since the circles are in a curve that does not follow the straight Gaussian line, the normality assumption is violated for this data.</p><p>Then, we check if the data is in the stable domain of attraction by estimating the characteristic exponent, , directly from the data and by providing the related confidence intervals. Several methods have been proposed for estimating stable parameters. Here, we use the ML method described by Nolan in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, which gives reliable estimates and provides the most tight confidence intervals. As further stability diagnostics, we employ probability density plots that give a good indication of whether the fit matches the data near the mode and on the tails of the distribution.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> depicts the normal probability plot of the vertical subband at the first level of decomposition of the gallbladder image (data denoted by "GLBD_Vsbd_1lvl," for short). The plot provides strong evidence that the underlying distribution is not normal. The circles in the plot show the empirical probability versus the data value for each point in the sample. The circles are in a curve that does not follow the straight Gaussian line and thus, the normality assumption is violated for this data. While non-Gaussian stable densities are heavy-tailed, not all heavy-tailed distributions are stable. Hence, in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> we assess the stability of the data. First, the characteristic exponent is estimated and the data sample is fitted with the corresponding stable distribution. For the particular case shown here, the characteristic exponent of the distribution which best fits the data was estimated to be 1.069. The stabilized p-p plot in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> shows a highly accurate stable fit for this data set.</p><p>Naturally, the real question is whether the stable fit describes the data more accurately than other PDF functions proposed in the literature. Here, we compare the fits with those provided by the generalized Laplacian density function proposed by Mallat in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and also used by Simoncelli in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> (9)  where</p><p>. The parameters and can be computed from the second and fourth moments of the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> where is the distribution variance, and is the kurtosis. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> shows that the distribution is superior to the generalized Laplacian distribution because it provides a better fit to both the mode and the tails of the empirical density of the actual data. For every image we iterated three times the separable wavelet decomposition described in Section II and we modeled the coefficients of each subband by using the family. The wavelet decomposition was done using Daubechies' Symmlet 4 basis wavelet because we found this basis to be the most effective in decorrelating the data. The results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>, which shows the ML estimates of the characteristic exponent together with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. It can be observed that the confidence interval depends on the size of the images and on the particular level of decomposition. The confidence interval becomes larger as the size decreases and as the level increases since the number of samples used for estimating gets smaller. The table demonstrates that the coefficients of different subbands and decomposition levels exhibit various degrees of non-Gaussianity. The important observation is that all subbands exhibit distinctly non-Gaussian characteristics, with values of varying between 0.9 and 1.6, away from the Gaussian point of 2. Our modeling results clearly point to the need for the design of Bayesian processors that take into consideration the non-Gaussian heavy-tailed character of the data to achieve close to optimal speckle mitigation performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. A BAYESIAN PROCESSOR FOR ULTRASOUND SPECKLE REMOVAL</head><p>Current state-of-the-art wavelet-based denoising and image enhancement techniques employ a combination of wavelet shrinkage by soft and hard thresholding together with a generalized adaptive gain (GAG) for feature emphasis (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and references therein). In particular, Zong et al. apply soft thresholding at fine scales (levels 1 and/or 2) and hard thresholding within middle levels 3 and/or 4 to eliminate noise, followed by nonlinear processing of feature energy to enhance contrast. The regularized threshold parameter used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> is related to the noise level, orientation, and scale through a judiciously chosen but at the same time ad hoc linearly decreasing function. Moreover, the five parameters which determine the empirical GAG function in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> are tuned experimentally to achieve the appropriate nonlinear stretching of wavelet coefficients that accomplishes the desired contrast enhancement.</p><p>In this section, our goal is the design of a formal Bayesian estimator that recovers the signal component of the wavelet coefficients in ultrasound images by using an alpha-stable signal prior distribution. The proposed processor is motivated by the modeling studies in Section III, it is based on solid statistical theory, and it does not depend on the use of ad hoc thresholding and stretching parameters.</p><p>In a Bayesian framework, referring to (5), , , and are considered as samples of the random variables , , and , respectively. The signal component is modeled according to a distribution with zero location parameter, while the noise component is modeled as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable. Our goal is to find the Bayes risk estimator that minimizes the conditional risk, which is the loss averaged over the conditional distribution of , given the set of wavelet coefficients, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> The Bayes risk estimator under a quadratic cost function minimizes the mean-square error (mse) and is given by the conditional mean of , given <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> Of course, the mse metric is defined for random variables that possess finite second-order moments. In this work, the signal component of the wavelet coefficients is modeled as an alphastable random variable that does not have finite second-order statistics. Hence, we use the absolute error as the loss function in expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. Under this loss function, expression ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) is well defined for all random variables with characteristic exponent grater than one. The Bayesian estimator that we consider minimizes the mean absolute error and can be shown to be the conditional median of , given <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. But, since the conditional density is symmetric around zero, the conditional median coincides with the conditional mean. Hence, the Bayesian estimator for the absolute error cost function is again given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</p><p>Bayes' theorem gives the a posteriori probability density function of based on the measured set of wavelet coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> where is the prior PDF of the signal component of the wavelet coefficients of the ultrasound image and is the likelihood function. Substituting ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) into (12), we get <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> where is the PDF of the wavelet coefficients corresponding to the noise.</p><p>In order to be able to construct the Bayesian processor in ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>), first we estimate the parameters of the prior distributions of the signal ( ) and noise ( ) components of the wavelet coefficients ( ). Then, we use the parameters to "build" the two prior PDFs and and the nonlinear (in general) I/O relationship . Observing ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>), we note that the denominator, referred to as the "evidence" is the PDF of the noisy observation, , computed as the convolution between the noise and signal PDFs. Hence, we need a parameterized model for the two PDFs that provides a good fit to the statistics of the ultrasound images. Furthermore, the distribution parameters should be estimated from the noisy observations in an efficient manner.</p><p>Motivated by our modeling results in Section III-B, we use a two-parameter model for the signal component while we use a zero-mean Gaussian model for the noise component. In other words, the observed signal is a mixture of signal and Gaussian noise. Moreover, we consider the signal and noise components to be independent. Because of the lack of closed-form expressions for the general PDF, we propose a method that is based on characteristic functions. In particular, since the PDF of the measured coefficients is the convolution between the PDFs of the signal and noise components, the associated characteristic function of the measurements is given by the product of the characteristic functions of the signal and noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> where and Using expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, we estimate the parameters , , and by fitting the Fourier transform of the empirical PDF of the measured coefficients with function in the least-squares (LS) sense arg <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> where denotes the empirical characteristic function. In practice, we first estimate the level of noise , and we optimize <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> only with respect to the parameters and . As proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, a robust estimate of the noise standard deviation, , is obtained in the finest decomposition scale by the measured wavelet coefficients as MAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> where the operator MAD signifies the median absolute deviation and denotes the highest level of wavelet decomposition. We found that this method for estimating the parameters gives reliable estimates, it is not computationally expensive and, more importantly, it allows us to estimate the parameters from the noisy measurements. We should note here that Paulson et al. used a similar approach to estimate the parameters of alpha-stable densities and observed that LS fitting in the characteristic function domain produces estimates within two standard errors of the actual values and with a bias that is inversely proportional to the sample size <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>As expected, in the general case the Bayesian processor described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> does not have a closed-form expression. Only for the case of Gaussian signal in Gaussian noise a well-known closed-form solution exists (18) where is the Gaussian signal variance. In other words, the processing is a simple linear rescaling of the measurement. For the general non-Gaussian signal case, we computed numerically the Bayesian processor function in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>(a) depicts the Bayesian I/O curves for four different values of signal characteristic exponent, , namely, 2 (Gaussian data), 1.95 (slightly non-Gaussian data), 1.5, and 1.05 (considerably heavy-tailed data). All curves except the case 2, correspond to a nonlinear "coring" operation, i.e., largeamplitude observations are essentially preserved while smallamplitude values are suppressed. This is expected since small measurement values are assumed to come from signal values close to zero. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>(a) also illustrates the processor dependency on the parameter of the signal prior PDF. Specifically, for a given ratio , the amount of shrinkage decreases as decreases. The intuitive explanation for this behavior is that the smaller the value of , the heavier the tails of the signal PDF and the greater the probability that the measured value is due to the signal.</p><p>On the other hand, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>(b) shows how the processor nonlinearity is varied for certain signal statistics ( 1.5) and various noise levels. It is evident from the curves that as the noise level increases, the amount of shrinkage also increases. We should note at this point that curves similar to the ones in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> are chosen adaptively by our processor since the PDF parameters are estimated by means of ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) at each level of wavelet decomposition and for each orientation. In actual ultrasound images, at the first decomposition levels where the wavelet coefficients arising from noise are predominant, the Bayesian shrinkage function would resemble to that corre-sponding to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). As the resolution decreases, in general the noise level decreases and the nonlinearity applied to the wavelet coefficients corresponds to the high SNR curves in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>(b) gradually approaching the identity function as the SNR becomes very high.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>We tested our proposed multiscale Bayesian speckle suppressing algorithm on the ultrasound images modeled in Section III-B. In order to obtain speckle images, we degraded the original test images by multiplying them with unit-mean random fields, as shown in expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. We generated spatially correlated speckle noise by lowpass filtering a complex Gaussian random field and taking the magnitude of the filtered output. We controlled the correlation length of the speckle by appropriately setting the size of the kernel used to introduce correlation to the underlying Gaussian noise. A kernel size of one corresponds to white noise. On the other hand, in order to allow the noise correlation to taper gradually to zero we could not set the kernel size arbitrarily large. Thus, a short-term correlation obtained with a kernel of size three was sufficient to model reality. In our experiments, we considered three different levels of simulated speckle noise.</p><p>We compared the results of our approach with other speckle reduction techniques including median filtering, homomorphic Wiener filtering, and wavelet shrinkage denoising using soft and hard thresholding. All the parameters involved in these methods were selected by trial-and-error in order to get an optimal result from each method. Specifically, for the median filter we used a 3 3 mask for the lowest level of noise and 5 5 masks for the other two levels. The homomorphic Wiener filter was implemented using a window of size 5 5 pixels for the highest level of noise and 3 3 pixels in all the other cases. For soft thresholding we used a threshold , while for hard thresholding we have chosen , being the standard deviation of the wavelet coefficients. Both wavelet shrinkage soft and hard thresholding schemes were developed using Daubechies' Symmlet 8 mother wavelet. Denoising results using this basis wavelet have been found to be less affected by pseudo-Gibbs phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Moreover, in order to minimize such side effects, we have embedded all wavelet-based methods (including the Bayesian approach) into the cycle spinning algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. This consists in averaging the result of the wavelet shrinkage method over all circulant shifts of the input image. In practice we found that a number of 8 translations is sufficient. The maximum number of wavelet decompositions we used was 5.</p><p>In order to quantify the achieved performance improvement, three different measures were computed based on the original and the denoised data. For quantitative evaluation, an extensively used measure is the mse defined as mse <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> where original image; denoised image; image size. The standard signal to noise ratio (SNR) is not adequate to evaluate the noise suppression in case of multiplicative noise. Instead, a common way to achieve this in coherent imaging is to calculate the signal-to-mse (S/mse) ratio, defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> S/mse <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> This measure corresponds to the classical SNR in the case of additive noise. Remember that in ultrasound imaging, we are interested in suppressing speckle noise while at the same time preserving the edges of the original image that often constitute features of interest for diagnosis. Thus, in addition to the above quantitative performance measures, we also consider a qualitative measure for edge preservation. More specifically, we used a parameter originally defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>  </p><p>The correlation measure, should be close to unity for an optimal effect of edge preservation.</p><p>The obtained values of mse, S/mse, and for all methods applied to the kidney image are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>. It is evident from the table that the three wavelet-based methods (i.e., soft and hard thresholding and our proposed Bayesian denoising technique) are more successful in speckle noise suppression than median and homomorphic Wiener filtering. In terms of mse and S/mse, the soft thresholding scheme achieves comparable performance with the homomorphic Wiener filter, but the visual quality of the soft threshold processed image seems to be better (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>). This is due to the fact that the soft thresholding approach is not intended to minimize the mse, the result being an estimator which achieves a low variance at the expense of bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Observing the metric values, we see that the multiresolution techniques exhibit a clearly better performance in terms of edge preservation, as expected. Among them, our proposed Bayesian approach exhibits the best performance according to all three metrics. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref> shows a representative result from the processing of the noisy kidney image. The simulated speckle image shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>(b) corresponds to a S/mse value of 9.69 dB. For this noise level, all the methods that we tested achieved a good speckle suppression performance. However, the median and homomorphic Wiener filters loose many of the signal details and the resulting images are blurred [cf.  speckle, it preserves step edges, and it enhances fine signal details, better than the other methods. Indeed, the problem with the mse, S/mse, and measures, or with any other metric, is their connection to the visual interpretation of an human observer. A radiologist, in analyzing ultrasound images, does not compute any of the above measures. Hence, in order to visually study the merit of the proposed subband coefficient modeling and the Bayesian processor, we chose a noisy ultrasound image, applied the algorithm without artificially adding noise, and visually evaluated the denoised image. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>. The figure only shows results obtained using the wavelet based schemes, which were proved to give better results for simulated speckle noise. Although qualitative evaluation in this case is highly subjective, the results of this experiment seem to be consistent with the simulation results. It appears that the Bayesian processor performs like a feature detector, retaining the features that are clearly distinguishable in the speckled data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we introduced a novel multiscale nonlinear homomorphic method for speckle suppression in ultrasound images. Three are the main processing stages of our approach. First, similarly to existing multiresolution techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the logarithm of the image is decomposed into several scales through a multiresolution analysis employing the 2-D wavelet transform. This step guarantees that the speckle is transformed from multiplicative into additive and its characteristics are differentiated from the signal characteristics in each decomposition level. The second and third steps differentiate our technique from existing ones. After decomposing the original image, the signal and noise components in various scales are modeled as and Gaussian processes, respectively. The parameters of the distributions are estimated from the measurements by means of a LS fitting in the characteristic function domain. We showed that the class of distributions is more effective in modeling detail image histograms than other exponentially tailed densities.</p><p>In the third step, a Bayesian processor based on a signal prior is built at each scale for statistically optimal signal feature extraction and speckle suppression. The main advantage of our method is that the obtained I/O shrinkage functions are optimal in the Bayesian sense. As a result, a more accurate signal reconstruction is achieved in each scale. Our processor was tested and found to be more effective than thresholding methods, which are ad hoc in the sense that they do not allow for an exact matching of the signal and noise distributions at different scales and orientations. The method could be easily adapted for the purpose of denoising other types of biomedical images where the noise can be (eventually after an appropriate transformation) modeled as additive Gaussian and signal-independent. Naturally, our approach is more computationally expensive due to the fact that the prior distribution parameters need to be estimated at each scale of interest. However, this is not a serious problem for off-line processing.</p><p>Currently, we are addressing several issues related to the work we presented in this paper. One major issue is the choice of a statistical model for the speckle noise component of the wavelet coefficients that is more appropriate than the currently used Gaussian model. It is to be tested whether the family is a good model also for the noise component. In this case, our problem will be formulated as Bayesian signal detection from measurements that are mixtures of signal in noise with different characteristic exponents, in general. Research in this direction is under way and it will be presented in a future correspondence.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
