<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nikita Barabanov and Romeo Ortega</head><p>Abstract-Friction is a nonlinear phenomenon difficult to describe analytically. To capture its effect in mechanical systems, a bristle-based dynamical model, known as the LuGre model, was recently proposed in the literature. It is difficult to assess whether this (or any other) mathematical model constitutes a bona fide friction model. It should, however, reflect the dissipative nature of friction, which mathematically translates into the requirement of defining a passive operator from velocity to friction force. In this note, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for this property to hold for the LuGre model.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION AND PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>It is well known that one of the major limitations to achieving good performance in mechanical systems is the presence of friction, which is a nonlinear phenomenon difficult to describe analytically. Different models have been proposed to capture this phenomenon, starting with the classical descriptions via static maps between velocity and friction force. However, it appears that classical models are unable to capture some of the behavior experimentally observed in systems subject to strong friction effects. It is argued in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> that dynamic models are necessary to describe the friction phenomena accurately. For a review of some of the existing dynamic friction models, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and references cited therein.</p><p>Inspired by the works of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, a new dynamical model of the friction force-based on a bristle deflection interpretation-is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> as follows:<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y = 0 x + 1 _</formula><p>x + 2 u N. Barabanov is with the Electrotechnical University, 197376, St. Petersburg, Russia (e-mail: nikita@freya.etu.ru). R. Ortega is with the Lab. des Signaux et Syst√®mes, CNRS-SUPELEC, Gif-sur-Yvette 91192, France (e-mail: rortega@lss.supelec.fr).</p><p>Publisher Item Identifier S 0018-9286(00)02292-3.</p><p>of defining a passive operator u 7 ! y. This property captures the dissipation nature of friction and should be reflected in any sensible model of it. 2 This problem has been extensively studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> it is shown that passivity is ensured for a modified model where the coefficient 1 is made velocity-dependent (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>).</p><p>A numerical example for which the passivity condition is violated is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In the latter reference, the following analysis is carried out. To simulate the scenario of a simple (unitary) mass with friction, the friction model above is placed in closed-loop with an integrator, i.e., _ u = 0y. For the resulting second-order dynamical system, it is then shown that there exists a positive definite function whose derivative is strictly positive in some nonempty subset of the state space provided some condition on the friction parameters is satisfied. Unfortunately this fact does not allow us to make any claim about passivity of the operator-nor of stability of the system for that matter-whose rigourous analytical proof remained an open issue. It is interesting, however, to point out that the condition of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> exactly coincides with the necessary and sufficient condition for passivity that we derive below.</p><p>In this note, we provide a complete answer to this question. Specifically, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the passivity property to hold. The conditions are expressed in terms of a simple algebraic inequality involving the parameters of the model. If this inequality does not hold, we construct an input signal that generates a periodic orbit along which the passivity inequality is violated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. MAIN RESULT</head><p>We shall solve the problem for the more general functions a(u). Namely, we assume only that the function a(u) in (1.2) is even and it satisfies following conditions:</p><p>1 juj a(u) 2 juj for all u  where we have used (2.4) to establish the last inequality. This completes the proof of sufficiency. Before proceeding with the necessity proof, we bring to the reader's attention the fact that, if (2.4) is satisfied with strict inequality, then the operator is actually input strictly passive. This follows immediately from the second before last inequality above.</p><p>Proof (Necessity): To prove necessity, we will construct a periodic solution along which (2.3) is violated.</p><p>It is easy to see that for the system (1.2) any value x 2 (1= 2 0 ; 1= 1 0 ) is reachable from zero in a finite time [use the control u u 3 such that 0 a(u 3 )x &lt; u 3 ].</p><p>Hence, it is sufficient to show that there exists a number T and a T -periodic functions u, x satisfying (1.2) such that T 0 uy dt &lt; 0:</p><p>We will create the periodic function u as (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">u const = u 0 if t 2 [0; T 0 ) u const = u1 if t 2 [T0; T0 + T1) u(t + T 0 + T 1 ) = u(t)</formula><p>for all t with T = T 0 + T 1 and the system (1.2) has a periodic solution. The values T0 and T1 will be chosen below.</p><p>To this end, consider a number x 0 2 1 0 2 1 + 2 1 ; 1 0 1 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(2.6)</formula><p>Such a number exists due to the inequality (2.4). Now we take a number u0 such that 0 a(u 0 ) u 0 x 0 &gt; 1 + 2 1 :</p><p>(2.7)</p><p>Note that, due to conditions (2.2) and inequality (2.6), we can take u0 arbitrarily large. We choose T0 = 1 0a(u0) ln 01a(u0) 2u0 x0 0 u0 0a(u0) :</p><p>Remark that the term in square brackets is greater than 1 due to the inequality (2.7). Define x 1 = x(T 0 ), where x(T 0 ) = u 0 0 a(u 0 ) 1 + 2 1 :</p><p>Routine calculations show that I(0; T0) = u 2 0 2 0 a(u 0 ) ln 1 + 0 1 a(u 0 ) 2 u 0 (x0 0 x1) 0 0 1 a(u 0 ) 2 u 0 (x0 0 x1) + u 2 0 0 a(u 0 ) 2   2 ln 1 + 01a(u0) 2u0 (x 0 0 x 1 ) + u0 a(u0) (x 0 0 x 1 ) where I(0; T0)=u0 ! const &lt; 0 as u0 ! 1. Now we choose the value u 1 such that x0 &lt; u 1 0 a(u 1 ) :</p><p>Such value u1 exists due to the inequality (2.6). The solution x of (1. T +T 0 uy dt &lt; 0 while x(0) = x0 = x(T0 + T1). We have thus generated a periodic solution for which the evaluation of the functional I along the period is negative. Hence, the system (1.1), (1.2), with the function a(u) satisfying conditions (2.1) and (2.2) is not passive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. CONCLUSION</head><p>We have provided a conclusive answer to the question of passivity of the generalyzed LuGre friction model (1.1), (1.2), (2.1), and (2.2). Namely, we have shown that the model defines a passive operator if and only if the coefficients satisfy the inequality (2.4). We have furthermore shown that, if the inequality is strict, the operator is actually input strictly passive.</p><p>It is interesting to try to check the passivity condition (2.4) in a real application. To this end, let us consider the experimental setup (consisting of a DC motor connected to a gearbox with significant friction) installed in the Laboratoire d'Automatique de Grenoble, (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for a detailed description). The identified parameters of the friction model (1.1)-(1.3) are [0; 1; 2; 0; 1; v0] &gt; = [260; 0:6; 0:0176; 0:28; 0:05; 0:01] &gt; :</p><p>Unfortunately, the key passivity inequality (2.4) is not satisfied for these data. Since the difference is of an order of magnitude (i.e., 0:0176 &lt; 0:107), the violation of the inequality can hardly be attributed to (unavoidable but small) identification errors. In spite of this discrepancy, the model seems to provide a good fit for the experimental data (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we hope the analysis presented here provides some guidelines for the refinement of the basic LuGre model. To some extent, this has already been done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> where a passive modified model with a velocity-dependent coefficient 1 is proposed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>It is difficult to assess whether the equations above (or for that matter any other mathematical model) constitute a bona fide friction model.
