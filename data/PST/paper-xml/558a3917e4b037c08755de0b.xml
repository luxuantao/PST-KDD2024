<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>OUNDARY representation is essential in shape description and recognition. It plays a key role in many applications such as image analysis, pattem recognition, computer graphics, and computer-aided animation. Many methods have been proposed to describe planar curves. The chain coding method <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref> approximates a curve with a sequence of directional vectors lying on a square grid. Some quantitative measurements of the object, known as the shape factors <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, can be used to characterize shapes. Examples include moments, areas, perimeters, and comers. The spline technique <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> uses a set of piecewise low-order polynomials to approximate a curve so that the curve can be determined by a small number of parameters. The spline-generated boundary curve can be translated, scaled, and rotated by performing the transformations on a set of control points. The Fourier descriptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[27]</ref>, 1401 describes a curve with coefficients via Fourier analysis of a certain parametric representation such as the curvature or spatial coordinates of the curve.</p><p>The multiresolution (or multiscale) technique <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>, [281, [3 11 for signal and image processing has grown very rapidly for the last several years. It was observed by study in psychophysics that the human visual system processes and analyzes image information at different resolutions. This motivated Rosenfeld <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[29]</ref> to develop a multiscale edge detection scheme. Marr <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22]</ref> used the first-or second-order derivatives of a Gaussian filter of different sizes for signal convolution and detected changes in the intensity or zero-crossing at different scales. More recently, Witkin <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[39]</ref> proposed a scale-space filtering approach that uses a set of parameterized Gaussian kernels to smooth a signal and extracts the descriptive primitives such as the locations of extrema or intervals bounded by the extrema. To characterize the features of local extremum, one can then detect the extrema at a certain coarse scale and track them across a couple of scales of finer resolutions.</p><p>For most curve matching or shape recognition tasks, it is important that the decision is made based on features that are insensitive to rotation, translation, and change in size. To match contours in a hierarchical manner is one of the main motivation for developing the scale-space methods so that the global alignment is conducted first, and local comparison is then performed at various resolutions. Permeuller and Kropatsch [ 151 presented a multiresolution descriptor of planar curves using comers with a hierarchical structure. Based on the scale-space plot of the curvature of a planar curve, Mokhtarian and Mackworth <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[23]</ref> proposed a multiscale shape representation that locates points of inflection on the curve at varying scales. Moreover, <ref type="bibr">Bajcsy and Kovacic [I]</ref> proposed a multiresolution elastic matching method in which they assumed that one of two objects was made of elastic material and the other served as a reference. By applying an extemal force to the elastic object, the shape of the elastic object was deformed to match the reference object along somwee scales. This matching method was shown to be effective in medical applications such as anatomical human brain altas matching. For the scale-space methods, the Gaussian function is the optimal kernel for reducing noise with minimal delocalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[21]</ref>. Nevertheless, a planar curve smoothed by the Gaussian kemel suffers from shrinkage <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[25]</ref>, i.e., the perimeter becomes smaller after convolving with the Gaussian kemel. This may cause a problem in some pattem recognition applications.</p><p>In recent years, the wavelet transform became an active area of research for multiresolution signal and images analysis. In this paper, we consider another type of multiscale planar curve descriptor by using the wavelet transform. Our main objective is to demonstrate the nice properties and interesting applications of this new descriptor. We show that the wavelet descriptor has the properties of invariance, uniqueness, and stability. Features extracted from the wavelet approach can be normalized so that we can handle the effect of rotation, translation, and scaling easily. In contrast with the scale-space filtering approach, which serves primarily as an analytical 10.57-7149/96$0.5.00 0 1996 IEEE tool, the wavelet descriptor provides an effective synthesis tool as well. The application of the wavelet transform does not yield a coarse resolution curve smaller than the original one so that there is no shrinkage problem, even though some detailed variations of the curve are removed. Compared with the Fourier descriptor that uses global sinusoids as the basis functions, the wavelet descriptor is more efficient in representing and detecting local features of a curve due to the spatial and frequency localization property of wavelet bases. Furthermore, we may interpret the wavelet coefficients as random variables and use the deformable stochastic wavelet descriptor to model a group of shapes that have the same topological structure but may differ slightly due to local deformations so that this descriptor can be conveniently used in multiscale matching. Since the forward and inverse wavelet transforms can be implemented via the cascade of quadrature mirror filter banks, the wavelet descriptor is computationally efficient and has a great potential for real-time applications such as target recognition and detection.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. We briefly review the wavelet theory and derive a wavelet representation for planar curves in Section 11. In Section 111, we examine several important features of the wavelet descriptor, including the effect due to scaling, translation, and rotation and the properties of invariance, uniqueness, and stability. These properties are essential for shape representation and recognition. The approximation capabilities of different wavelet bases with various vanishing moments and symmetry property are compared. In addition, we propose a procedure to normalize the wavelet coefficients contained in the feature set so that the recognition method is applicable to shapes with different sizes and variations. In Section IV, we study the application of the deformable wavelet descriptor to the model-based boundary extraction from noisy images using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation method and perform an experiment' to illustrate the performance of the wavelet descriptor. Some concluding remarks are given in Section V.</p></div>

In this section, we will briefly review the theory of periodized wavelets <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>.

Let us define a pair of filter coefficients It is easy to verify that j? and hy are periodic sequences with period 21ml. Then, the coefficients d z and c, ". can be computed from coefficients c? via the following recursive formulas:  Then, we can use the wavelet coefficients U?, e:, r r , and d;: given in (2.9) and (2.10) as the planar curve descriptor. By using only a subset of wavelet coefficients consisting of primarily coarser scale components, i.e., small values of Iml, we can have different multiresolution representation of the shape. In terms of mathematical expression, we can modify (2.8) to be where Mmo 5 k 5 M + 1. The curves with coordinates 2 ( k ; t ) and y ( k ; t ) provide a sequence of multiresolution approximations to the original curve. This dyadic approximation sequence can be best depicted by its two extremes. On one hand, we obtain the original curve at k = Mmo, and on the other hand, the approximating curve contains only the coarsest scale description, i.e., z:(tt) and yy(t) for k = M + 1. To give an example, we show the Koch's snowflake in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and its different approximations with a certain subset of wavelet coefficients. We perform an eight-level decomposition of wavelet transform using the biorthogonal cubic B-spline wavelets <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure">l</ref>(1)-( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) are its approximations from the finest to the coarsest resolution, whereas the original curve with 3072 samples is given in <ref type="bibr">Fig. I(0)</ref>. In practice, it is proper for the coarsest-scale in shape representation to contain between 4 to 16 sampled points in applications such as shape matching. One main advantage of the wavelet descriptor is that the hierarchical decomposition 'can lead to significant data compression. For example, Fig. l(3) shows the approximation of the curve reconstructed from 384 points. We see that the approximation is very close to the original.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">m = M f , . . . , Mc -2 , M c -1.</formula><p>The detailed signals at scale m can also be represented by using the polar coordinates, i.e. where (2.13) With this polar coordinate representation, we can plot a vector function with amplitude A? . 4,"(t) and phase e;. The wavelet vectors are the building elements of curves from a scale to its next higher resolution scale. The representation of wavelet vector depends on the wavelet basis G(t) it uses. In general, G ( t ) with shorter support offers better spatial locality property at the expense of the smoothness of reconstructed curves.</p><p>We want to point out similarities and differences between the expression in (2.12) and elliptic Fourier features discussed in <ref type="bibr">[20] and [30]</ref>, where the sinusoidal orthogonal bases, i.e., sine and cosine functions, were adopted. If the coefficients of the sine and cosine functions are equal, the building elements are circles. Otherwise, they are ellipses. The building elements are flattened to vectors if only the sine or the cosine functions are used. In (2.12), the wavelet curve descriptor is reduced to a vector via the Cartesian-to-polar coordinate transformation.</p><p>It is also possible to represent a smooth curve using the chain-coded tangent, cumulative tangent, or curvature. These kinds of differential representations [ 181, [40], are invariant under translation, rotation, and scaling. The curvature 6 of the planar curve is defined as the rate of change of the tangent angle with respect to arc length, i.e. where x and x (or y and y) denote, respectively, the first and second derivatives of the coordinate function ~( t )</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(or y(t))</formula><p>with respect to the parameter t of the curve representation.</p><p>We can apply the finite-scale orthogonal wavelet expansion to the curvature via Multiscale representation of Koch's snowflake using the biorthogonal However, for a closed curve with differential representation, its reconstruction based on a set of truncated wavelet coefficients may not be closed. Besides, it is difficult to compute the derivatives at sharp corners or under a noise-corrupted environment. Thus, we will focus on the coordinate-based wavelet descriptor in this paper.</p><p>It is worthwhile to review Fourier descriptor, which is a popular curve descriptor in many applications, for the comparison at the end of this section. The Fourier descriptor is a method of describing a closed planar curve by a set of Fourier coefficients. Let (.(TI), y(n)) be the N-point discrete parameterized coordinates of a curve. By assuming the contour to be traced repeatedly, the coordinate functions <ref type="bibr">~( n )</ref> and y(n) are periodic functions and can be represented by using the Fourier series as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">N -1 k=O N-1 y(n) = Y(k)eiZ"""N , n = 0 , 1 , 2 , .

To reconstruct the closed planar curve largely, one may only need a small set of coefficients of low-frequency components when the coefficients of higher frequency components are small.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Scaling, Translation, and Rotation</head><p>The scaling, translation, and rotation of a planar curve can be described via a suitable transformation of wavelet coefficients. First, we examine the scaling effect. The scaling of a curve by a factor can be written as Thus, by using the linearity of the wavelet transform, it implies that we can scale the wavelet coefficients CL?, e:, T:, and d z given in (2.9) and (2.10) by the same factor p As far as the polar coordinates (2.12) are concerned, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">= arctan (-) Pd; = arctan (f) = er Pr,"</formula><p>and Thus, the phase remains unchanged while the magnitude is scaled by the same factor p.</p><p>Next, we examine the translation of the curve by a distance ( b z , by).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Nonshrinking Property</head><p>One common problem in multiresolution curve representation occurs when the curve convolves many times with some smoothing kernels. That is, the perimeter of a shape may become smaller. This is known as the shrinkage problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[25]</ref>. For example, let us consider the Gaussian and discrete diffusion smoothing kernels that satisfy analog and discrete scale-space conditions [21], respectively. Note that the family of discrete diffusion smoothing kemel is of the form T ( n ; t ) = e -' I m ( t ) , where In(t) is the Bessel functions of integer order. The kemel T ( n ; t ) is the solution of a discretized version of the diffusion equation and is proved to be the discrete counterpart of the Gaussian kernel for scale-space filtering. By comparing Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>(a) and (b), we see that the perimeter of a curve is reduced by applying multiple times of Gaussian or discrete diffusion smoothings. In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the solid lines are the original curves, whereas the dashdot and dotted lines represent two curves as the results of multiple smoothing. The shrinkage problem in the Gaussian and discrete diffusion smoothings is due to the reduction in low-as well as high-frequency components. In contrast, the wavelet approximations have no shrinkage problem, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2(c</ref>). For the proof of the nonshrinking property of the wavelet transform, we refer to work of Oliensis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[25]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Invariance, Uniqueness, and Stability</head><p>Mokhtarian and Mackworth [24] discussed some desired properties of a general shape descriptor as stated the following:</p><p>Invariance: For two curves with the same shape, they should have the same representation. Uniqueness: For two curves with different shapes, they should have different representations.</p><p>Stability: Small differences in the shapes of curves correspond to small differences in their representations, and vice versa. We can rephrase the three properties with commonly understood mathematical terminologies. First, the invariance property means that the mapping of a shape to its representation in fact defines a function. Second, the uniqueness property says that the function is one to one. Third, the stability property implies that the function is well posed. It is clear that the wavelet descriptor given by (2.8) is a one-to-one function so that it satisfies the invariance and uniqueness properties. The stability property will be examined below.</p><p>Since the x and y coordinates of a curve can be handled separately, we will focus on the scalar function rather than the vector function. Here, to present our explanation in a more general setting, we consider a class of square-integrable functions f E L2 ([0, 11) and their corresponding wavelet frame representations [7], [12]. (Note that the frame is a concept that is more general than the basis. A basis is a frame, but a frame may not be a basis.) Based on the property of a Hilbert space, we want to explain that if two functions fl and f 2 are close to each other, their wavelet frame representations W ( f 1 ) and W(f') are also close, and vice versa.</p><p>By choosing $(x) such that functions It is easy to see that if two representations are close, the curves that they represent should be close as well. In the case that the functions ~F ( x )</p><p>are the orthonormal set A = B = 1, and the computation of the transform is numerically stable. The limitation of these properties is that the parametrizations of curves must have the same starting point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Approximation by Different Wavelet Bases</head><p>A good wavelet basis allows a signal to be approximated with a small error up to a certain resolution. "Which wavelet should we choose?' is a question with no quick answers. In this section, we compare the approximation capability of different wavelet bases in representing smooth curves. Following the idea of Daubechies [ 121, we investigate wavelet bases with different vanishing moments and symmetry property.</p><p>We will discuss the importance of vanishing moments of wavelets first. By definition, we say that a wavelet basis has L vanishing moments if the corresponding mother wavelet 4 ( t ) satisfies t+j(t)dt = 0, I = 0 , . . . L -1 J By expanding a scalar function f ( t ) with Taylor series at to = Zmn, where m is a negative integer, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">f ( t ) = f(2-n) + f(')(2"n)(t -amn) 1 2! + -f'"(a-n)(t -2mny +</formula><p>where IR(t)I &lt; 00 if f E CL-l. Let us multiply both sides of the above equation by 2-"/'7,&amp;(2-"t</p><p>n ) and integrate from 0 to 1. If the basis has L vanishing moments, the first L terms will become zero. Therefore, for a very fine scale (or a large value of Iml), the wavelet coefficient l(f,4z)I will be small unless t = 2mn is near one of the singularities of f. Suppose we decompose a function into wavelets and throw away all the detailed coefficients at finer scales. To this end, the wavelet 4 with higher vanishing moments tends to pack more information in the approximate coefficients.</p><p>For some applications, the scaling function &amp;t) characterizes the coarsest scale approximation (zE,y?). Thus, it is also important to consider the vanishing moments of &amp;t). Coiflets, which we will discuss later, fall into this category. Physiological and psychological studies show that the human visual system is sensitive to the error induced by asymmetric reconstruction. It was proved that complete symmetry of 4 and 6 cannot be achieved by using compactly supported orthonormal wavelet bases except for the Haar basis [12], (371. The orthonormal wavelets with noncompactly supported bases can only be implemented by the IIR filters. The implementation is generally recursive, which may lead to instability and limit cycles. Some other alternatives are biorthogonal wavelets [ 81 with different filters for decomposition and reconstruction.</p><p>To compare the performance of different wavelet bases in representing planar curves, we use the <ref type="bibr">Daubechies [lo]</ref>, least asymmetric <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>, Coiflets [4], [ l l ] , Battle-Lemarik [2], biorthogonal spline-variant [ 121, and biorthogonal cubic Bspline <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref> bases and show the results in Figs. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and<ref type="figure">4</ref>. The previous four are orthogonal wavelets. Among them, the Daubechies and least asymmetric bases are both compactly supported wavelets with a maximum number of vanishing moments for a given support region. Coiflets are constructed by Daubechies and Coifman [ 111 from a class of orthonormal wavelet bases with an equal number of vanishing moments for 4 and d. It turns out that the mother wavelet 4 and the scaling function 4 of Coiflets are much more symmetric than their counterparts in Daubechies and least asymmetric bases. However, Coiflets require longer support of the basis function (and, hence, more computation efforts) to achieve the same order of vanishing moments. The BattleLemarit, biorthogonal spline-variant and cubic B-spline wavelets are constructed from spline functions and have prefectly symmetric scaling functions. We summarize the properties of these wavelets in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref>, where IIRFIR means that the analysis and synthesis filters are IIR and FIR, respectively.</p><p>The approximations of a square by wavelet bases with various vanishing moments are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. It appears that the biorthogonal spline-variant wavelet gives the best results for this symmetric test case since it represents both the corners and edges well. Furthermore, we compare the approximations of California's outline by different basis with similar computational complexity (12 filter taps in most cases) in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. At M = -7, the results are almost of no difference, except the Battle-LemariC wavelets show some reconstruction errors due to the infinite convolution sum being replaced with a finite one. On the other hand, at M = -6, the Daubechies wavelets preserve sharp comers, whereas Coiflets nicely represent the right angle. The errors due to nonperfect reconstruction accumulate when more levels of decompositionheconstruction are performed. Hence, higher noise appears in the Battle-LemariC's approximation at M = -6 than at M = -7. This truncation error can be significantly reduced by increasing the number of taps of the IIR filters. Note also that it can be catastrophic if computation is done by the nonperiodic wavelet transform. We performed many other experiments and obtained the following three observations. First, in representing the symmetric pattern such as the square and the Koch's curve, the wavelet bases with symmetric (or almost symmetric) scaling functions such as the biorthogonal  spline-variant or Coiflets give better results. Second, a basis with higher vanishing moments gives better approximations at the price of a higher computational cost. Third, with relatively light computations, the Daubechies wavelets preserve sharp corners in approximating not-so-smooth curves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Normalization of Wavelet Coeficients</head><p>The invariance, uniqueness, and stability properties of the wavelet descriptor proved in Section 111-C is important in the shape recognition application. Due to the invariance and uniqueness properties, it is convenient to perform clustering based on the wavelet representation rather than the spatial coordinates. The significance of the stability criterion is that it guarantees that a small change in the shape of a curve will not cause a large change in its wavelet representation, and hence, the wavelet representation is stable with respect to noise. Thus, by measuring the distance between two boundary curves in terms of their wavelet coefficients, we can perform classification by the nearest-neighbor clustering rule.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. An Example: Character Recognition</head><p>We use an example to demonstrate the the performance of the wavelet descriptor and will compare the result with that of the Fourier descriptor.</p><p>We work with the character set {2,z, U , V, D , 0 , Q, 5 , S, E , F, P, R, L , M , NI Finite resolution approximations of the outline of California with applied to the wavelet transformed data. It is clear from (3.2) that the wavelet coefficients r," and d: are invariant under translation. The centroid of the contour can be obtained by taking the average of the prime signals a, " and e,", and the translation effect can be offset by setting the centroid of the contour to the origin. The scale normalization can be accomplished by dividing the magnitude A,'I" of wavelet coefficients with the averaged values A over the significant set. By calculating the averaged phase 8 of wavelet vectors over the significant set, we can offset the orientation effect by performing an inverse rotation.</p><p>In short, by performing the wavelet transform on the coordinate representation <ref type="bibr">( ~( l )</ref> , y ( l ) ) of a contour via (2.6) and choosing a feature set, we can normalize the parameters, or wavelet coefficients, for each individual curve as follows:</p><p>1) For displacement normalization: (a,", e,") The reason for choosing such a character set is that elements in subsets { 2 , Z } , { U , V } , { D , O , Q } , and so on, are easily misclassified due to similar contour shapes. We trace the boundary of each character with a piecewise linear contour to represent the shape of the original image array. We have to mention that wavelet models depend on the choice of the starting points t o of curves. Fourier descriptors, however, can be normalized <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[38]</ref> to global shift invariance, even though the normalization procedure is complicated. In this experiment, we suppose that the documents are aligned and scanned so that the choice of starting point is not a problem. Once the length of the contour is computed, we interpolate and resample the boundary contour so that the total number of samples is 256. (Note that both 128 and 512 points have also been tried, and we see any significant difference in the final results.) Then, the coefficients of Fourier and wavelet descriptors are computed by using (2.14) and (2.6), respectively. For the wavelet transform, we decompose the curve description into six levels with four coefficients at the coarsest scale. Three fonts for each character, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, were used in the training phase. It was observed that the regularity, vanishing moments, or even the choice of wavelets does not play a significant role in this character recognition experiment. In the following, we report the result based on the Daubechies D8 wavelet basis. Since only some lower resolution (or frequency) coefficients have substantially large values while the magnitudes of other coefficients are negligible, we choose a subset of the Fourier or wavelet coefficients as the feature vector. A reference feature vector for each character was obtained by averaging the feature vectors over all three fonts in the training stage. To perform nearest-neighbor rule clustering, we use the Euclidean distance. In the case of classification with only 4 features, which correspond to the coarsest scale wavelet coefficients, we found that the three characters 5 , S , and 2 were misclassified by the Fourier descriptor, whereas the two characters Q and 0 were misclassified by the wavelet descriptor. It is also possible to select the set of coefficients with the highest magnitudes as features. In the case of classification with seven features by using this approach, the character S was misclassified to 5 by the Fourier descriptor, whcreas all characters were classified correctly by the wavelet descriptor. The above experiment is by no means complete, but the result supports that the wavelet descriptor can be an alternative to the Fourier representation that suffers from the drawback of not being sufficiently localized in space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. DEFORMABLE WAVELET DESCRFTOR</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Basic Idea</head><p>To model a group of shapes that have the same topological structure but may differ slightly due to deformation, we can interpret the wavelet coefficients as random variables and propose a deformable stochastic wavelet descriptor to describe them. The possible applications of deformable wavelet descriptors include motion tracking, stereo matching, and computer animation.</p><p>Staib and Duncan [30] used coefficients of the Fourier descriptor as the parameters of deformable models. However, the basis functions of the Fourier descriptor are the sinusoids that are periodic and global (not sufficiently localized in space) so that a small perturbation of one parameter will affect the entire outline of a shape. This deformable model is not efficient in describing shapes with only local deformation. In contrast, the wavelet descriptor uses a set of basis functions with local support and multiscale dilations and, therefore, provides a scheme to model local as well as global deformation. In Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, we model the amplitude of a certain wavelet vector as a Gaussian random variable and assume that all other wavelet vectors (defined as in (2.13)) are deterministic. The deformation using the Fourier descriptor is also plotted for comparison. The superior local deformation property of the wavelet descriptor can be easily seen in this example.</p><p>Furthermore, we use the entropy as a measure of the averaged uncertainty of Coefficients. The entropy H ( x ) of a random variable x is defined as N ( x ) = -Pr(z) lnPr(z), where Pr(x) is the probability density function of x. For a Gaussian random variable x, the entropy is equal to H</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">(x) = ha=,</formula><p>where CT is the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution of the random variable x <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>. Now, consider a set of deformable curves with independent Gaussian-distributed spatial coordinates <ref type="bibr">~( t )</ref> and y(t). Then, the corresponding Fourier and wavelet coefficients are also Gaussian distributed. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distributions of transform coefficients for a Gaussian deformed curve</head><p>We plot the statistical distribution of the Fourier and wavelet transformed coefficients in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, where the mean of the transform coefficient is indicated by the solid line, and the standard deviation for each transform coefficient is depicted with a vertical bar. Since the coefficient with a larger standard deviation has a larger entropy, we conclude that the neighborhood deformation of a curve can be more efficiently described by the wavelet descriptor than the Fourier descriptor.</p><p>For the case of a nonclosed curve, a straightforward representation of the curve would result in discontinuities; therefore, the boundary problem occurs when the wavelet transform is performed. This problem can be avoided by letting the parameter t start at one end of the curve, trace along the contour to the other end, and then trace back to the starting point to form a closed path. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref> shows an example of a nonclosed curve and its deformations, where the solid, dash, and dashdot lines represent the mean curves and curves with minus and plus one standard deviation, respectively. The curves are locally deformed in the x and y directions in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8(c)</ref> and<ref type="figure">(d</ref>). Note that these locally deformed curves cannot be easily achieved by using the Fourier descriptor deformable model. The locally deformable property makes the wavelet descriptor an attractive tool for handwritten signature generation and recognition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Model-Based Contour Extraction</head><p>We consider one particular application of the deformable wavelet descriptor that extracts the boundary of an object from noisy images with a model-basedBayesian approach. The idea of extracting the object boundaries from noisy images using the model-based Bayesian approach is inspired by the work of Staib and Duncan 1301. However, it is worthwhile to point out some differences. First, we propose a hierarchical matching scheme by exploiting the multiscale representation capability of the wavelet descriptor. Second, to avoid exhaustive numerical line integrals for continuous gradient formulation in [30], we adopt the chamfer matching.</p><p>Let 3 be the parameter vector of the wavelet descriptor of a contour where p' includes a set of N wavelet coefficients of the z, y coordinates as its elements. Given a contour template C&amp;i, k ) corresponding to a particular value of the parameter vector 5, we want to detect the template C,from an image F ( j , IC), where j and k are the indices of pixels in the image.</p><p>To extract the contour of an object, some preprocessing of the image F ( j , IC) is needed. We apply the Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22]</ref> operation to F ( j , IC) to obtain an estimate of the edge location. The LOG operator is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">I ( j , k ) f LoG(F)(j, IC) = F ( j , IC) * (-V2G)(j, IC)</formula><p>where V2 is the Laplacian operator, and G is the Gaussian smoothing kernel. The lowpass Gaussian filter reduces the noise sensitivity of the Laplacian operator while preserving the location of zero crossings.</p><p>Based on the preprocessed information I ( j , IC), we can formulate MAP estimation problem. Let CMAP denote the MAP estimation of boundary curve C. Then, the MAP problem of our interest can be written as where Pr(C,-) is some a priori knowledge of the contour, and Pr(I I C,-) is the the likelihood function of detected edge information I with given Cg. Since the term Pr(I) is independent of p', we can take the logarithm on both sides and change the optimization problem (4.1) to be max[lnPr(l I CF) + lnPr(Cg)].</p><p>(4.2) By assuming independent zero-mean Gaussian noise with standard deviation on, we know that the likelihood function of is of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">P Pr(1 I Cg) = Pr(n = I -C,-) I -[1(3,k)-Cg12 - -n -e j , k E A</formula><p>In the above equation, the noise at each pixel n(j, k ) is independently and identically distributed with the probability density Pr(n), and that probability for noise over the entire picture area A is nothing but the product of noise on the individual pixel. The maximization problem (4.2) is equivalent to maximizing the objective function <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[28]</ref> r 1 (4.3)</p><p>The second term of (4.3) is the natural logarithm of the a priori probability that confines the solution CMAP to a group of curves within the prescribed model, whereas the first term and is, in some sense, a cross correlation of the contour Cg and S(j, k ) . Note also that the cross correlation is weighted by a factor k/c: that decreases as the energy of Gaussian noise increases. This implies that the estimation depends more heavily on the information of likelihood than the a priori knowledge when the noise is small and the apriori information prevails in the objective function when the noise corruption becomes more severe.</p><p>We will assume that all wavelet coefficients are Gaussian distributed. This assumption is in fact close to what we observed in the beating heart image sequence in the experiment described in Section IV-C. Let us choose where the mean mi and the standard deviation mi of each wavelet coefficient p; are parameters of the deformation model. We assume that they are known in advance. Note that if no a priori information is available, the uniform probability yields a constant a priori term and therefore has no influence to the solution of the objective function.</p><p>The MAP estimation CMAP can be calculated in a pyramidal structure. We first solve the MAP problem in a very coarse scale (by setting the wavelet coefficients in other finer scales to zero) and use the result as the initial guess at the next finer scale. That is, by fixing the coarse scale coefficients obtained from the coarse scale optimization, we solve the MAP problem by adjusting only the wavelet coefficients that are responsible for variations in this fine scale. The same procedure is applied recursively scale by scale until the highest resolution is reached. The hierarchical algorithm reduces the computational cost significantly.</p><p>It is worthwhile to compare our approach with a commonly used approach known as the snake [19]. The snake is an active contour model where a curve is deformed due to a certain extemal force. The proposed MAP estimate deforms the curve to maximize the probability of estimation given the a priori information and the a posteriori knowledge, whereas the snake scheme changes the curve shape to minimize the energy due to internal and external forces. The internal force acts as the smoothness constraint, whereas the external force guides the active contour toward image features. The smoothness constraint of snake is to minimize the first-and the second- order derivatives of curves, but our scheme restricts the curve representation in the wavelet coefficient space to achieve multiscale matching. However, both the snake and wavelet deformable model share the advantage of having local control property so that the modification of the position of a control point results in only a local variation of the curve.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Experiments</head><p>In this experiment, we use the deformable model to extract the contour of a heart from a certain computer tomography (CT) image. The extraction of the cardiac contour is important in assessing the regional diastolic function [ 141. To collect the a priori information of the contour, we consider a set of 15-frame noiseless CT images of size 128 x 128 that forms a full cycle of the heartbeat. We use the contours of these images to calculate the mean and the standard deviation of the deformable model. Note that the proposed method relies on other mechanisms to register the contours in the image sequence such that the starting points are identical. By using the MAP estimation method, we show how to extract the contour of the heart from a certain frame, say, the second frame, with high-level additive white noise and compare the results of using the deformable Fourier and wavelet descriptors.</p><p>Since the gradient of the objective function provides information of the new search direction, most numerical optimization methods require it for fast convergence. However, it is sometimes difficult to obtain the analytic form of the gradient as well as its discrete approximation. In the current setting, to calculate the analytic form of a gradient vector involves a numerical line integral that is too tedious to be practical while its discrete approximation is sensitive to error resulting from an inadequate choice of step sizes. Thus, we propose to do the following.</p><p>In the experiment, we first ignore the first term in (4.3) by setting it to zero and focus on the optimization of the second term. To be more precise, we choose the quasi-Newton [13] method to maximize this term, which has a quadratic form as shown in (4.4), with the objective to match features in the coarsest scale. The interpolated solution obtained from the coarsest scale is then served as the initial guess for the optimization in the next finer scale. For all optimization problems in the finer scales, we consider the objective function consisting of both terms as given in (4.3). We use Powell's method to solve the optimization problem and progress from the coarsest scale to the finest scale. Powell's method [ 131-a special example of conjugate direction methods-does not involve explicit computation of the gradient of a function but takes more iterations to converge. To use Powell's method for optimization, we found that direct cross correlation fails to provide the direction that leads to optimum if a template C,has no coincident points with the object data I . Thus, we turn to a technique known as chamfer matching [6], which determines the best fit of imperfect edge data from two images. Chamfer matching offers a generalized correlation that shows the direction to achieve the maximum cross correlation. We calculate the normalized chamfer correlation image of the contour template C,-and perform the cross correlation between the chamfer correlation image and the zerocrossing image I ( j , k ) . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9</ref> gives an example of the normalized chamfer correlation image and the zero-crossing image (which is the Laplacian of Gaussian of the cardiac image).</p><p>The normalized chamfer correlation image is derived from the conventional chamfer distance by taking two to the power of -vj,/c, i.e., 2 -" 3 z k , where v j , k is the corresponding chamfer distance image, and j , k are the row and column indices of the image. We normalize the image so that chamfer correlation gives the value 1 if the estimated and the original curves are totally coincided, the value 0 if totally irrelevant, and all values in between if they are proportional to the degree of coincidences. Fig. <ref type="figure">l0</ref>(a) is an example of the normalized chamfer image of a synthesized image. The binary edge image is a circle. The brightest pixels represent the value 1. The value decreases gradually to 0 as the distance from the circle increases. In the optimization process, the chamfer correlation is also helpful in improving the convergence rate, especially when the template is too far from the edge. We use Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref> as an example to demonstrate how the chamfer matching works for a nonmodel-based (maximum likelihood) optimization with Powell's method. We first calculate the normalized chamfer correlation image in Fig. <ref type="figure">1O(a)</ref>, where the circle of brightest grey level is the object to reach. In Fig. <ref type="figure">10(b)</ref>, we superimpose the initial guess and the objective (the inner circle), whereas Fig. <ref type="figure">1O(c</ref>) gives the final result of multiscale elastic matching. Now, we are ready to show an example of contour extraction from a set of noisy images, which are obtained by adding white Gaussian noise of different levels to the second frame of the 15-frame image sequence. The noise level ranges from on = 10 as shown in <ref type="bibr">Fig. ll(a)</ref> to cr, = 160 as given in Fig. ll(f), or the corresponding SNR values range from 21.3 dB to -2.8 dB. The proposed MAP estimator extracts the contour accurately for these noise levels, but the estimation tends to be trapped to the local maxima for images with an even lower range of SNR. The applicable SNR region depends on the structure and the contrast of the image. Some external features tend to give erroneous results and hamper the estimator's ability to find the real contours. In addition, the applicability of the proposed scheme to structured (instead of Gaussian) noise remains an open problem. The multiscale matching process can be best illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>, where four levels of scales are used in this experiment. We show, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>(a), the contour extraction done at the coarsest scale by using four wavelet coefficients as the feature vector. The result is then used as the initial curve for matching at the next finer scale. The results of intermediate scales are given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>(b) and (c) by using eight and 16 wavelet coefficients as feature vectors, respectively. Finally, the optimal estimation is achieved at the finest scale as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12(d)</ref>, where the feature vector consists of 32 wavelet coefficients. This hierarchical process avoids the undesirable local minima resulting from noise or spurious details existing in finer scales.</p><p>We compare the results of the MAP estimation using wavelet and Fourier descriptors in Table <ref type="table">11</ref>, where a quantitative comparison for even frames of the cardiac image sequences with additive noise on = 80 is reported, and the normalized chamfer correlation is chosen as the performance measure. The reason that the wavelet descriptor has better results in this case is that it is more effective in representing the local deformations of a group of deformable contours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>v. CONCLUSION AND EXTENSIONS</head><p>By using the wavelet transform, we developed a planar curve descriptor that has a multiscale analysis capability and can be computed effectively. The effect of scaling, translation, and rotation of a planar curve on its wavelet coefficient vectors was explored. The invariance, uniqueness, and stability properties of the wavelet descriptor were derived. We also compared the performance of a class of wavelet bases with different vanishing moments and symmetry properties. The application of the wavelet descriptor to the modeling of deformable objects was studied.</p><p>The multiresolution bases provide a powerful tool for localto-global shape description and will have impact in the analysis and synthesis of 2-D and 3-D shape deformation. We have recently found research using the wavelet transform for 3-D multiscale deformable modeling by Vemuri and Radisavljevic <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[36]</ref>. They made an improvement on the dynamic 3-D deformation model of Terzopoulos <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[32]</ref> with superquadrics and a global deformable model characterized by the coarsest level wavelet coefficients. Their work considered 2-D wavelets constructed from the tensor products of 1-D wavelets and examined the applications of surface deformation in a 3-D space. In this research, however, we focused on the planar curve descriptor, i.e., 1-D wavelet descriptor in a 2-D space. Since this is a relatively simpler mathematical problem, we were able to discuss their properties in a more detailed way from a better perspective. Besides, most of the properties derived can be straightforwardly extended to the 3-D case, and the applications examined in this work also have their own practical values.</p><p>There are many interesting topics worth further study, including the application of wavelets to the description of object shapes in the 3-D space, dynamic shape warping in computer animation, and optimum surface reconstruction.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>M</head><label></label><figDesc>One can also obtain the coefficients C , via the synthesis formula from d, " and ctlc1EZ,+1 m = Mcl,Mc -2,. . . , M f .</figDesc></figure>
