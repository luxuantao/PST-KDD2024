<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Static always-on wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are affected by the energy sink-hole problem, where sensors nearer a central gathering node, called the sink, suffer from significant depletion of their battery power (or energy). It has been shown through analysis and simulation that it is impossible to guarantee uniform energy depletion of all the sensors in static uniformly distributed always-on WSNs with constant data reporting to the sink when the sensors use their nominal communication range to transmit data to the sink. We prove that the energy sink-hole problem can be solved provided that the sensors adjust their communication ranges. This solution, however, imposes a severe restriction on the size of a sensor field. To overcome this limitation, we propose a sensor deployment strategy based on energy heterogeneity with a goal that all the sensors deplete their energy at the same time. Simulation results show that such a deployment strategy helps achieve this goal. To solve the energy sink-hole problem for homogeneous WSNs, we propose a localized energy-aware-Voronoi-diagram-based data forwarding (EVEN) protocol. EVEN combines sink mobility with a new concept, called energy-aware Voronoi diagram. Through simulations, we show that EVEN outperforms similar greedy geographical data forwarding protocols and has performance that is comparable to that of an existing data collection protocol that uses a joint mobility and routing strategy. Precisely, we find that EVEN yields an improvement of more than 430 percent in terms of network lifetime.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>C URRENT advances in miniaturization, low-cost and low- power circuit design, and wireless communications have led to the emergence of sensor networking technology. A wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of a large number of low-cost, low-power, and tiny communication devices, called sensors. Like nodes (i.e., computers, laptops, etc.) in traditional wireless networks such as mobile ad hoc networks, sensors have energy, storage, processing, and communication capabilities. Also, sensors have a sensing capability by which they sense phenomena and perform innetwork processing on the sensed data before sending their results to a central gathering node, called the sink. WSNs can be used in a variety of monitoring, control, and surveillance applications. Akyildiz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> provided an excellent survey on WSNs.</p><p>Particularly, the sensors possess several scarce resources, with battery power (or energy) being the most critical one. One way to extend the lifetime of a WSN is through load balancing so that all the sensors deplete their energy as slowly and uniformly as possible. Also, the behavior of the sink has an impact on the network lifetime. Indeed, sensors in the proximity of a static sink act as the traffic hot spots and have significantly reduced lifetime than all other sensors in the network. Those sensors nearer a static sink would suffer from a severe depletion of their battery power, which may result in possible network disconnection and disruption of the data from reaching the sink.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Motivations and Problem Statement</head><p>In this paper, we investigate the energy sink-hole problem in static always-on WSNs, where sensors located around a static sink are heavily used in forwarding sensed data to it. Indeed, those sensors close to the static sink act as relays to it on behalf of all other sensors, thus suffering from severe energy depletion. Our study of the energy sink-hole problem in WSNs is motivated by the common deployment of static sink and sensors in real-world applications, and hence, efficient solutions should be provided to tackle this problem. We believe that WSNs' lifetime depends on three key design metrics, namely, the type of data forwarding (long range versus short range), the type of sensors (homogeneous versus heterogeneous), and the type of sink (static versus mobile). This motivates us to account for these three design metrics when solving the energy sink-hole problem. First, we consider the transmission distance that distinguishes between short-range and long-range data forwarding. Second, we consider sensor heterogeneity when deploying sensors for its ability to improve the reliability of WSNs and extend their lifetime <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Third, when sensors are homogeneous in terms of their initial energy, we consider sink mobility for its ability to evenly distribute the data dissemination load among all sensors. Our goal is to balance the energy consumption of all sensors in data dissemination in order to extend the network lifetime. Specifically, we want to address the following questions:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">How and to what extent can uniform energy</head><p>depletion of all sensors in the network be guaranteed so as to avoid the energy sink-hole problem in WSNs? 2. How can the energy sink-hole problem in homogeneous WSNs be tackled?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Our Approach</head><p>It has been shown through analysis and simulation that the energy sink-hole problem cannot be solved for static uniformly distributed always-on WSNs with sensors constantly reporting data to a static sink using their nominal communication range <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Our approach to address the energysink-hole problem can be summarized as follows: To answer the first question, we focus on a data forwarding scheme for disseminating data from source sensors (or simply sources) to the sink. The objective of this forwarding scheme is to evenly distribute the total data dissemination load on the individual sensors. We also tackle the energy sink-hole problem by considering a sensor deployment strategy where sensors equipped with different initial energy are placed in a circular sensor field based on their data forwarding activity, as well as their initial energy. We slice a circular field into concentric circular bands (or simply bands) of constant width equal to the radius of the nominal communication range of sensors. To answer the second question, the neighbors of the sink should change over time, thus allowing different subsets of sensors to act as forwarders to the sink.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Contributions and Organization</head><p>Our contributions can be summarized as follows:</p><p>1. We prove that it is possible to solve the energy sinkhole problem in static uniformly distributed alwayson WSNs with constant data reporting to a static sink provided that sensors adjust their communication ranges when they send or forward sensed data to the sink. In particular, we solve two problems, called perfect uniform energy depletion and partial uniform energy depletion. The first one checks whether the network can guarantee uniform energy depletion of sensors located in all bands. The second identifies a subset of bands whose sensors can deplete their energy uniformly. These solutions, however, suffer from the restriction on the size of the sensor field with regard to the number of its bands. 2. To alleviate the above shortcomings, we propose another solution that suggests a deployment strategy exploiting energy heterogeneity with a goal that sensors in all bands deplete their energy uniformly. Simulation results show that such a sensor deployment strategy helps sensors in all bands deplete their initial energy at the same time.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and hence covers the entire sensor field. The concept of energy-aware Voronoi diagram enables the selection of neighbors with the highest remaining energy to act as data forwarders, while sink mobility helps its neighbors change over time, thus allowing different subsets of sensors to act as relays to the sink. Haenggi and Puccinelli <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> took an extreme position by arguing that long-hop routing is a very competitive strategy compared to short-hop routing.</p><p>We believe that a more balanced approach should be used to guarantee a fair load distribution among all sensors. Our simulation results show that the concept of energy-aware Voronoi diagram combined with sink mobility extends the network lifetime. Precisely, we show that EVEN yields an improvement in terms of network lifetime of more than 430 percent compared to a similar data forwarding protocol using static sink and has performance comparable to that of a data collection protocol using joint mobility and routing <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work, and Section 3 presents the network and energy models. Sections 4 and 5 investigate the energy sink-hole problem. Section 5 presents simulation results of our sensor deployment strategy using heterogeneous sensors. Section 6 discusses EVEN and compares it with existing protocols. Section 7 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Data dissemination protocols for WSNs can be categorized into two main classes. The first one consists of protocols that attempt to minimize the energy consumption of sensors. Unfortunately, these protocols do not consider some particular regions in the network whose sensors are heavily used compared to others and hence deplete their initial energy very quickly. This behavior may result in WSN disconnections although most of the remaining sensors have enough amount of energy to work correctly. The second class, however, includes protocols that attempt to balance the energy consumption among all sensors in the network. The next two sections review protocols for the above classes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Balancing Energy Consumption</head><p>The energy sink-hole problem in WSNs has gained relatively less attention in the literature. It is worth noting that this problem was originally addressed by Guo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. They proposed an energy-balanced transmission scheme that adjusts the ratio between direct transmission to the sink and next-hop transmission. Precisely, sensors far away from the sink send a larger percentage of data to the next hop, while sensors near the sink send more data directly to the sink. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> also exploited this combination of hop-byhop transmission and direct transmission to find a trade-off between them. Efthymiou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> proposed a probabilistic data propagation algorithm for balancing energy consumption among all sensors. Powell et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> used the probabilistic data propagation algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and proved that there is a relationship between energy balancing and life-span maximization <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Leone et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> considered nonuniform sensor distribution and proposed a blind algorithm that computes a solution to the energy-balancing problem online without prior knowledge on the occurrences of the events. Li and Mohapatra <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> characterized the energy hole around the sink with an analytical model and investigated the effectiveness of a few approaches for mitigating the energy hole problem. Olariu and Stojmenovic <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> proved that energy-efficient routing can be guaranteed when the coronas of a circular field have the same width, but this would lead to uneven energy depletion of sensors. Hence, they computed the widths of coronas and their number to achieve even energy depletion of sensors. They also proved that uneven energy depletion is unavoidable for the free-space model, but can be prevented for the multipath model. Lian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> showed that up to 90 percent of the total initial energy is unused due to the static WSN model with uniformly distributed homogenous sensors and a stationary sink. They also proposed a nonuniformsensor-distribution-based deployment strategy and showed by simulation that it can increase the total data capacity. Nonuniform node distribution was also considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> to achieve balanced energy depletion. Luo and Hubaux <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> proposed a data collection protocol for WSNs that makes use of multihop routing and base station mobility to solve the energy sink-hole problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Minimizing Energy Consumption</head><p>Chang and Tassiulas <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> proposed different approaches for maximizing the network lifetime based on finding the best link cost function. Intanagonwiwat et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> proposed a data-centric paradigm, called directed diffusion, for sensor query dissemination and processing in static WSNs. Boukerche et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> proposed power-efficient data dissemination protocols that combine sleep/awake and probabilistic forwarding techniques. Boukerche et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> also proposed a novel protocol, called energy-aware data-centric (EAD), which constructs a broadcast tree rooted at the sink. Antoniou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and Boukerche et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> proposed a protocol, called Variable Transmission Range Protocol (VTRP). VTRP contributes to solving the energy sink-hole problem by varying the transmission range of sensors in order to bypass sensors lying close to the sink and avoid their overuse. While EAD and VTRP assume that the sink is static, our protocol considers sink mobility. However, our protocol assumes that all sensors are active during forwarding and hence do not consider duty cycling. Our future work will address this issue. Gao and Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> proposed greedy forwarding algorithms for load-balanced routing in wireless networks when nodes lie either on a line or in a narrow strip. Sankar and Liu <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> proposed a distributed routing algorithm that checks whether it is possible to route flow in the network while satisfying all the demands in terms of the total energy consumed by all nodes before the threshold for lifetime expires. Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> investigated the problem of finding energy-efficient paths to the sink using the notion of transmitter power control. Kim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> proposed a Scalable Energy-efficient Asynchronous Dissemination (SEAD) protocol for WSNs using mobile sinks. Shah et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> proposed a three-tier architecture for data dissemination in sparse WSNs using the concept of MULES. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> proposed distributed self-deployment protocols to discover coverage holes and cover those using mobile sensors that move from dense to sparse areas to maximize coverage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">NETWORK AND ENERGY MODELS</head><p>In this section, we describe the network and energy models and give some key definitions used throughout this paper to investigate the energy sink-hole problem in WSNs.</p><p>We consider always-on WSNs, where static sensors are randomly and uniformly distributed in a circular field of radius &lt; with sensor spatial density and constantly report their data to a single static sink. Moreover, the sensors and the sink are aware of their geographic locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. We assume that the energy consumption of sensors is due to data reception and transmission. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the energy spent in transmitting one message of size bits over a distance d, called transmission distance, is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E tx ðdÞ ¼ ð"d þ E elec Þ;</formula><p>where E elec represents the electronics energy, " 2 f" fs ; " mp g is the transmitter amplifier in the free-space ð" fs Þ or the multipath ð" mp Þ model, and is the path-loss exponent, 2 4. Also, the energy spent in receiving one -bit message is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">E rx ¼ E elec :</formula><p>Hence, the total energy consumption when a sensor receives a -bit message and forwards it over a distance d is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">E tot ðdÞ ¼ ð" d þ 2 E elec Þ:</formula><p>Thus, the energy consumption rate in transmitting over a distance d is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ER tx ðdÞ ¼ ð" d þ E elec Þb;</formula><p>and the energy consumption rate in receiving is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ER rx ¼ E elec b;</formula><p>where b (in bits per second) is the sensor's data rate. We assume that all the sensors have the same data rate. For a fixed message size, the energy consumed by the sensors mainly depends on the transmission distance d and the path-loss exponent .</p><p>Definition 1 (Voronoi diagram). Let S ¼ fs 0 ; . . . ; s mÀ1 g be a finite set of m sites in the plane. The Voronoi diagram <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> of S, denoted by V orðSÞ, is a subdivision of the plane containing</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">S into m Voronoi regions V Rðs i Þ, 1 i m.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">ENERGY SINK-HOLE PROBLEM ANALYSIS</head><p>In this section, we investigate the energy sink-hole problem in static uniformly distributed WSNs, where sensors are always on and report their data constantly to the sink. Precisely, we study the cases in which sensors use either their nominal or adjustable communication range for sending data to the sink.</p><p>First, we discuss a base protocol, where the network has a static sink and uses a short-path routing protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The static sink is supposed to be located at its optimum position in terms of energy-efficient data gathering, which corresponds to the center of the sensor field <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. We will show that the sensors around the sink have higher energy consumption than all other sensors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Base Protocol Average Energy Consumption</head><p>The model that we use to compute the maximum average energy consumption of sensors is similar to the model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The average energy consumption of a node located in an area of size A 2 that forwards traffic for other nodes located in another area of size A 1 is proportional to A 1 þA 2 A2 . Our model focuses on the nodes within a distance ' R from the sink, where R is the radius of the nominal communication range of sensors and ' ( R. Specifically, we consider a circle C of radius around the sink s m that includes the most active forwarders to the sink, where ' R, and ' is an infinitesimal value, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>. The number of sensors inside and outside C is 2 and ð&lt; 2 À 2 Þ, respectively, where &lt; is the radius of the circular field C &lt; , and is the sensor spatial density. Let r be the radius of an infinitesimal circular region whose area is dA ¼ r dr d, where 0 r , and 0 2. The average distance between a sensor in C and the sink s m is computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">d avg ¼ 1 2 Z C r dA ¼ 2 3 :</formula><p>The energy consumption rate per sensor in C is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ERðC Þ ¼ ERðC ; s m Þ þ ERðC ; s m Þ;</formula><p>where ERðC ; s m Þ is the average energy consumption rate per sensor in C to directly send its data to the sink, and ERðC ; s m Þ is the average energy consumption rate per sensor in C to forward a subset of sensed data packets originated from sensors in C ¼ C &lt; À C to the sink. Using the energy model in Section 3, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ERðC ; s m Þ ¼ 1 2 Â Z C ER tx ðrÞdA ¼ E elec þ 2" þ 2 b; ERðC ; s m Þ ¼ ð&lt; 2 À 2 Þ 2 2E elec þ " 2 3 b:</formula><p>Thus, the energy consumption rate per sensor using the base protocol is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">ERðC Þ ¼ b " 2 þ 2 þ 2 3 þ 2&lt; 2 2 À 1 b E elec :</formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows that ERðC Þ increases significantly as we approach the center of the sensor field (i.e., location of the sink). It is clear that all sensed data will be forwarded by sensors whose distance from the sink is at most equal to R ¼ 300 m. Hence, we slice the field C &lt; into concentric circular bands (or simply bands) of width R (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>) and assume that the field has k &gt; 1 bands such that &lt; ¼ k R.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Nominal-Communication-Range-Based Data Forwarding</head><p>Under the above-mentioned field-slicing method, the energy consumption rate of sensors depends on which band they belong to, as well as the communication range used in reporting their data to the sink. We assume that sensors are homogeneous and use their nominal communication range. Lemma 1 proves that sensors located in the kth (i.e., outmost) band consume less energy than all other sensors. Lemma 1. Assume a uniform sensor distribution with spatial density and that sensors constantly transmit their data to the sink using their nominal communication range of radius R.</p><p>Sensors located in the kth band have a longer lifetime than all sensors in the WSN.</p><p>Proof. Any sensor located in the kth band has only to report its own data to the sink. Indeed, given that the communication range of sensors coincides with the width of the bands, none of the sensors in the kth band can participate in forwarding data to the sink on behalf of others. Using the energy model in Section 3, the energy consumption rate per sensor in the kth band is computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">ERðkÞ ¼ ER tx ðRÞ ¼ ð" R þ E elec Þb:</formula><p>Let E init be the initial energy of a given sensor. The average lifetime of a given sensor in the kth band is equal to E init ERðkÞ . On the contrary, all sensors located in any other band forward data on behalf of others. Precisely, a sensor in the ith band forwards data originated from sensors in the jth band, where i &lt; j k. The number of sensors in the ith band is equal to</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">NðiÞ ¼ i 2 À ði À 1Þ 2 R 2 ¼ ð2i À 1ÞR 2 :</formula><p>Let s i be an arbitrary sensor located in the ith band. Thus, under uniform sensor distribution and constant data reporting, the average number of messages forwarded by s i (including its own message) per unit of time is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">MðiÞ ¼ P k l¼i NðlÞ NðiÞ ¼ R 2 k 2 À ði À 1Þ 2 R 2 ð2i À 1Þ ¼ k 2 À ði À 1Þ 2 2i À 1 :</formula><p>Hence, the average energy consumption rate of a sensor in the ith band is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">ERðiÞ ¼ MðiÞ À 1 ð ÞER tx ðRÞ þ ER rx ð Þ þ ER tx ðRÞ:</formula><p>Using the energy model in Section 3 and the value of MðiÞ, the above equation leads to</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">ERðiÞ ¼ k 2 À ði À 1Þ 2 2i À 1 b "R þ 2k 2 À 2i 2 2i À 1 þ 1 b E elec :<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>Hence, the average lifetime of the sensors in the ith band is Einit ERðiÞ , where i &lt; k. It is easy to check that Einit ERðiÞ &lt; Einit ERðkÞ , meaning that the lifetime of sensors in the kth band is longer than that of sensors in all other bands. t u</p><p>Claim 1, which follows from Lemma 1, states that uniform energy depletion cannot be guaranteed under the assumption of constant data reporting by sensors using their nominal transmission range. Thus, all sensors do not have same lifetime.</p><p>Claim 1. Assume a uniform sensor distribution with sensor spatial density . Also, suppose that sensors are always on and constantly report their sensed data to the sink using their nominal communication range of radius R. It is impossible for a given pair of sensors in two different bands to have the same energy consumption rate in their lifetime.</p><p>Next, we investigate the case where sensors may use their adjustable communication range (Definition 2) to transmit or forward data to the sink.</p></div>

Precisely, we want to compute the number k of bands of a sensor field such that the sensors located in the first and kth bands have the same lifetime. Let N ¼ &lt; 2 be the total number of sensors forming the network. Now, consider two arbitrary sensors s 1 and s k that belong to the first and kth bands, respectively. Given that sensors are uniformly distributed in the field, the average number of sensors in the first and the remaining ðk À 1Þ bands, denoted by Nð1Þ and Nð2 ! kÞ, respectively, are equal to</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Nð1Þ ¼ R 2 ; Nð2 ! kÞ ¼ ð&lt; 2 À R 2 Þ ¼ ðk 2 À 1ÞR 2 : Fig. 3.

In <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, it was proved that that unbalanced energy depletion is unavoidable for ¼ 2. Using our analysis, however, we have proved that providing uniform energy consumption of sensors in all the bands (i.e., perfect uniform energy depletion) is possible although hard to achieve, especially for ¼ 2. Indeed, the number of bands cannot exceed two, which imposes a severe restriction on the size of the sensor field. This is due to the gap in the energy consumed by sensors in the first and kth bands. Indeed, most sensors in the kth band never forward data on behalf of others, regardless of their transmission distance D. Thus, our result is in sharp contrast with the one reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Furthermore, while our analysis shows that the number of bands has a certain upper bound that does not depend on the size of the field but depends only on the transmission distance D and whether the freespace or multipath model is being considered, Olariu and Stojmenovic <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> found that the number of coronas (or bands) is based on the size of the field.</p><p>Next, we consider the following relaxed version of the above-mentioned problem.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Multitier Architecture</head><p>In this approach, heterogeneous sensors are assigned to the bands of the sensor field in such a way that they all deplete their initial energy at the same time. In real-world scenarios, WSNs can have heterogeneous sensors with different capabilities, thus increasing the network reliability and lifetime <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. For the tractability of the problem, we assume that energy is the only criterion that decides whether sensors are homogeneous or heterogeneous. Now, the bands do not contain the same type of sensors regarding their initial battery power. Precisely, each band has homogeneous sensors (i.e., sensors having the same amount of initial energy). However, any two bands have heterogeneous sensors (i.e., sensors with unequal amounts of initial energy). Sensors are supposed to use their nominal communication range when they forward data to the sink. Our goal is to guarantee uniform energy depletion of all sensors regardless of their bands.</p><p>Yarvis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> proposed a three-tier architecture for heterogeneous WSNs. The top layer contains only one sink that receives sensed data and analyzes them. The second layer includes sensors with no energy constraint. These sensors, called line-powered sensors, have unlimited energy resources by connecting them to a wall outlet. The third layer contains battery-powered sensors that are one hop away from line-powered sensors. The rationale behind this architecture is that sensors closer to the sink in a multihop sensor network with many-to-one delivery consume more energy than all other sensors in the network. Thus, those sensors should be line powered. As can be observed, this three-tier architecture forms a dominating tree where each battery-powered sensor communicates with the sink via only line-powered sensors to transmit its sensed data. There is no communication among battery-powered sensors in order to save their energy, and hence, no battery-powered sensor can play the role of data forwarder on behalf of other sensors. Definitely, there should be a sufficient number of line-powered sensors.</p><p>In this section, we propose a multitier WSN architecture, where each band represents a tier, and no sensor is supposed to be line powered. The data forwarding algorithm used by sensors is called next-band-based data forwarding (NEAR) and is mainly based on the following premise: each sensor selects a neighbor in its adjacent band as its next-hop forwarder, the one whose remaining energy is the highest among all sensors in that band. Also, their transmission distance is R. We prove that with such a sensor distribution, all sensors in the network deplete their initial energy at the same time. Consider the kth band. As discussed earlier, the average energy consumption rate per sensor in this band is ER tx ðRÞ ¼ ð"R þ E elec Þb, where b (in bits per second) is the sensor's data rate.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">NEAR Performance Evaluation</head><p>In this section, we evaluate the performance of our approach presented in Section 5.1. We assume that R ¼ 300 m, ¼ 2, and &lt; ¼ 1;500 m, i.e., k ¼ 5 (there are five concentric circular bands in the circular sensor field). The corresponding values of the constants " fs and E elec are given in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Moreover, we assume that every sensor continuously generates data at a constant bit rate (CBR) of 1,024 bps, i.e., four data packets per second ðb ¼ 1;024 bpsÞ. Sensors are randomly deployed in the circular sensor field, and their initial energy is determined based on their bands, following ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_41">9</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_42">10</ref>). The simulation is run multiple times, and the simulated time for each run is equal to 1,000 seconds. Then, we average the results of all those runs.</p><p>In the first simulation, the number of sensors varies from 800 to 1,600 (i.e., we vary the sensor spatial density). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref> shows that sensors in all bands do not consume the same amount of energy. This remains true given that sensors are randomly and uniformly deployed. Indeed, sensors located in the bands closer to the sink still consume more energy than those placed in higher bands. However, the average energy consumption of sensors in a given band stays almost constant as we vary the total number of sensors deployed in the field. This implies that the energy sink-hole problem cannot be solved by simply increasing the number of sensors.</p><p>In the second simulation, the number of sensors is fixed to 1,600. Assume that the initial energy of sensors in the kth band is e 0 ðkÞ ¼ 0:97 J. By Theorem 2, the initial energy of sensors in all other bands are computed based on e 0 ðkÞ. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">11</ref> shows that the total remaining energy of sensors in all bands decreases as time advances since those sensors are continuously sending or forwarding sensed data to the sink. The simulation results almost totally agree with the theoretical results, which are omitted for the clarity in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">11</ref>. Notice that the curves related to those five bands do not have the same slope. This is due to the fact that sensors in those bands do not have the same and hence, the remaining energy of the inner bands depletes faster than that of the outer bands. More importantly, all sensors in all bands deplete their initial energy at the same time. This result confirms with the analysis of our sensor deployment strategy that assigns initial energy to sensors based on their load in data forwarding to the sink. Definitely, sensors closer to the sink have the highest initial amount of energy, given that any sensed data should go through them before reaching the sink. Next, we propose a novel data forwarding protocol for homogeneous WSNs, which uses sink mobility and a new variant of Voronoi diagrams whose structure is time varying.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">SINK MOBILITY AND ENERGY-AWARE VORONOI DIAGRAM</head><p>Here, we assume that the sink is mobile, so its neighbors change over time. Moreover, all sensors are homogeneous and randomly and uniformly distributed in a circular field of radius &lt; with sensor density . We also assume that the mobility trajectory of the sink follows the RWP mobility model <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, thus covering the entire field (i.e., all locations in the field are equally likely to be visited). Initially, the sink randomly selects a waypoint and a speed between 0 and v max and moves toward the selected waypoint at this constant speed. When it reaches a waypoint, the sink stays for a pause time and randomly selects a new waypoint and speed. The sink repeats this process during the network lifetime. We assume that data collection continues via multihop forwarding wherever the sink stays. Thus, only the pause time has an impact on data dissemination.</p><p>To answer both questions raised in Section 1, we propose a new concept, called energy-aware Voronoi diagram, where all sensors in SCNðs i ; s m Þ act as candidate forwarders. When the sink arrives at a waypoint, it randomly selects its next waypoint and broadcasts it along with its current one and pause time in a single info packet, i.e., info ¼frwp cur ; rwp fut ; ptimeg. Each sensor that receives this info packet decides whether it would transmit its data to either the current or future waypoint of the sink based on its location and the average transmission delay. For a field whose size is in the order of a few miles, the average propagation delay is negligible compared to the average transmission delay <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Next, we discuss the concept of energy-aware Voronoi diagram and compare it to a weighted Voronoi diagram.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Why an Energy-Aware Voronoi Diagram?</head><p>The newly proposed concept of energy-aware Voronoi diagram differs from a weighted Voronoi diagram <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. While the Voronoi edges of the latter are not straight segments, the ones generated by the former are, indeed, straight segments. Also, the energy-aware Voronoi diagram depends on both the locations of sensors and their remaining energy. Hence, the structure of the energy-aware Voronoi diagram is dynamic in nature. As will be seen later, the energy-aware Voronoi diagram is an appropriate structure for data forwarding in WSNs for the following reasons: First, it helps us design a localized routing protocol for WSNs in the sense that each sensor builds its energy-aware Voronoi diagram based on its neighbors' information. Second, most of the existing geographical routing protocols, except GeRaF <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, consider the closest sensor to destination as a candidate forwarder. However, in GeRaF, a sensor may have the same subset of sensors alive as candidate forwarders. The concept of energyaware Voronoi diagram enables a sensor to have a subset of candidate forwarders from which it chooses the best one with respect to some metric. Third, it gives an equal chance to all sensors in the network to act as candidate forwarders on behalf of others to the sink. This is due to the randomness caused by the remaining energy metric to construct such a Voronoi diagram.</p><p>Next, we describe our protocol, evaluate its performance through simulations, and compare it with existing ones.</p></div>

First, a source s 0 identifies its reference sensor s ref . All other neighbors will be positioned relative to s ref based on their remaining energy. If there are multiple reference sensors, EVEN selects the s ref with the smallest distance to the shortest path ½s 0 ; s m . The relative ðx; yÞ-coordinates of a neighbor s j of s 0 are computed as follows: The intuition behind this computation is to "virtually" move sensors with low remaining energy away from the sink. Thus, these sensors will not be considered as "good" candidate forwarders until their available energy reaches a certain value.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">EVEN Performance Evaluation</head><p>In this section, we study the performance of EVEN based on simulation programs written in the C programming language. Our simulation setups consider 800 sensors randomly and uniformly distributed in a circular sensor field of radius &lt; ¼ 3;000 m. The radius of the communication range of the sensors is R ¼ 300 m. Also, when mobility is considered, the maximum speed of a mobile sink is v max ¼ 5 m=s.</p><p>Impact of sink mobility. In this experiment, we consider a Voronoi-diagram-based greedy forwarding (VGF) protocol. VGF is similar to a greedy geographic routing algorithm, called Bounded Voronoi Greedy Forwarding (BVGF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. On one hand, BVGF chooses the sensor that has the shortest distance to the sink and does not consider energy as a selection metric. On the other hand, VGF considers both the closeness of sensors to the sink and their remaining energy to build a localized Voronoi diagram and select the best candidate forwarders. Notice that VGF and EVEN are quite identical except that the former uses the actual locations of sensors, while the latter uses the virtual locations of sensors (computed in Section 6.2). We evaluate the performance of VGF for both cases of WSNs using a static sink and a mobile sink, respectively. We compute the average energy consumption of sensors as a function of their distance from the center of the sensor field. A static sink is positioned at the center of the sensor field, which corresponds to its optimum location in terms of energy-efficient data gathering <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. As can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">13</ref>, VGF has better performance with a mobile sink than with a static sink. Indeed, sink mobility distributes the data forwarding load among all the sensors. EVEN versus VGF. In this experiment, we consider a mobile sink and compare the performance of EVEN with that of VGF. EVEN leads to better load balance than VGF, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">14</ref>. While EVEN allows a sensor to select the best forwarders among all of its neighbors, VGF considers only the closest sensors to the sink. As expected, EVEN distributes more evenly the data dissemination load among the neighbors of each sensor and hence outperforms VGF. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">15</ref> shows the impact of the pause time of the mobile sink on the average energy consumption of sensors. As the pause time increases, more sensors will have the to transmit sensed data to the sink. Thus, sensors close to the sink become more active as they receive more data from sources. When the pause time has a large value, those heavily used sensors surrounding the sink deplete their energy more quickly than all other sensors. The performance of EVEN tends to that of VGF with a static sink. It is worth noting that no matter how energy efficient a data forwarding protocol is, the use of a static sink significantly degrades its performance, and hence the use of sink mobility.</p><p>EVEN versus another protocol. Luo and Hubaux <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> showed through simulations that under the short-path routing strategy, a mobile sink reduces the average load of sensors by about 75 percent compared to a static sink. This reduction implies an approximately 400 percent increase of the WSN lifetime. They also showed by simulation that their joint mobility and routing strategy further reduces the load by about 10 percent, which corresponds to an overall improvement of the WSN lifetime of about 500 percent compared with the case of a static sink. Their joint mobility and routing strategy is elegant and efficient in that it exploits the available energy at the sensors close to the network border, which are rarely used in data forwarding.</p><p>EVEN does not necessarily choose a short path. Using the concept of energy-aware Voronoi diagram, all neighbors of each sensor have the chance to participate in data forwarding toward the sink. Thus, a mixture of short-range and long-range data forwarding patterns would take place. This helps the sensors deplete their energy slowly and uniformly. Also, as the sink is moving randomly, all areas in the sensor field are equally likely to be visited, including those on its periphery. Thus, sensors close to the border of the network would be selected to act as forwarders toward the sink as their remaining energy permits. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the network lifetime is inversely proportional to the maximum average energy consumption of the sensors. Thus, as can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">15</ref>, EVEN improves the network lifetime by more than 430 percent compared with VGF that uses a static sink. Thus, EVEN has performance that is comparable to that of the joint mobility and routing strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have studied the energy sink-hole problem in static always-on WSNs. We have proved that uniform energy depletion of all the sensors can be achieved provided that the sensors adjust their communication ranges when forwarding data to a static sink. We have also proposed a deployment strategy using heterogeneous sensors that guarantees uniform depletion of sensors' initial energy. We have found that our simulation results agree almost perfectly with our theoretical results. Moreover, we have proposed a data dissemination protocol, called EVEN, which uses the concept of energy-aware Voronoi diagram to evenly distribute the load of data forwarding on all neighbors of a sensor and exploits sink mobility to update the neighbors of the sink. Our results demonstrate that the concept of energyaware Voronoi diagram and sink mobility lead to more than  to the case of a static sink. Our future work is threefold. First, we plan to extend this work for three-dimensional WSNs such as underwater WSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Second, in real-world scenarios, sensors are dutycycled to save energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. We plan to extend NEAR and EVEN to handle highly dynamic WSNs due to duty cycling. Finally, we focus on implementing NEAR and EVEN on a sensor testbed to assess their performance.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
