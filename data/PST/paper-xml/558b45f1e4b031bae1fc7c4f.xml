<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A deep theoretical discussion proves that in Joglekar's and Biolek's models the memductance-flux relation of a memristor driven by a sign-varying voltage source may only exhibit single-valuedness and multi-valuedness respectively. This manuscript derives a novel boundary condition-based Model for memristor nanostructures. Unlike previous models, the proposed one allows for closed-form solutions. More importantly, subject to the nonlinear behavior under exam, this model enables a suitable tuning of boundary conditions, which may result in the detection of both single-valued and multi-valued memductance-flux relations under certain sign-varying inputs of interest.

INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HE VOLTAGE-OR current-controlled memristor is a fundamental two-terminal passive element with conductance depending on the time history of voltage across or current through it. It was theoretically introduced in 1971 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and then classified within the larger class of memristive systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. However, it was only after the 2008 first-ever recognition of memristor behavior at the nano-scale from Hewlett-Packard (HP) engineer Williams <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> that it started to receive significant attention for the large spectrum of opportunities it opens up in integrated circuit (IC) design, mostly for the realization of large-capacity nonvolatile memories <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and neuromorphic systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. An optimal design of such ICs require a preliminary thorough study of their nonlinear dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. With such a target in mind, it would be extremely helpful to develop a simple, accurate and general model capturing the behaviors of distinct memristor nanostructures.</p><p>The HP nanoscale device (which we take as reference element for the class under modeling) is a thin film of titanium dioxide (TiO ) sandwiched between two platinum contacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The film consists of a conductive layer of oxygen-deficient titanium dioxide ( %) and of a insulating layer of stoichiometric titanium dioxide (TiO ). The film conductivity may be suitably adjusted by applying an external input to the nanodevice. Swapping the two layers, i.e., considering an oxide film with opposite polarity, determines the occurrence of distinct dynamics.</p><p>In the following, the dimensionless input-controlled length of conductive layer in the device with polarity coefficient set to 1 are denoted as and respectively ( , the normalization factor, is the entire length of the thin oxide film). Further, and respectively denote voltage across and current through the nanostructure. Finally, without loss of generality, we assume to control the device through a voltage source.</p><p>The merit for the first memristor model may be ascribed to Williams himself <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Linear <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and nonlinear <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> dopant drift models fall into the following class (here dimensionless time variable</p><p>, where is the time normalization factor, is renamed as for simplicity):</p><p>(1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> where state variable represents the dimensionless length of conductive layer, is a normalization factor, 1  denotes the memductance, expressed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> with</p><p>, where and indicate the device memductance respectively in the fully conductive and fully-insulating state (i.e., as sets to 1 and 0 respectively), while is a nonnegative parameterized window function assuming values in [0, 1] and allowing one:</p><p>• to account for nonlinear effects on the ionic transport ( modulates the degree of such nonlinearities); • to impose system-dependent boundary conditions. The linear model, originally proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, assumes constant ionic drift rate throughout the film length under application of an external input. The window function is thus defined as: <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref>This model, frequently adopted in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> for its simplicity, qualitatively reproduces the dynamics of the mem- 1 </p></div>

However, since it does not specify boundary conditions, thus imposing no bounds on state , it is valid only as long as the control source is chosen so as the layer interface does never reach any end.</p><p>Literature was later enriched with a number of nonlinear dopant drift models. Those proposed by Williams himself <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, Joglekar <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and Themis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> introduce a decrease in rate of ionic transport as the layer boundary approaches any of the two ends. In particular, Joglekar proposed a window function-let us call it -independent on [see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>(a)]:</p><p>where controls the window decrease rate (from the maximum unitary value at ), occurring as approaches either 0 or 1. For (4) is identical (for less than a proportionality factor) to another window previously proposed by Williams himself in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Furthermore, a slight modification of (4) was recently proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Due to the independence of (4) on the control source, Joglekar's model may only allow for single-valued memductance-flux characteristics under any (and particularly under sign-varying) input.</p><p>In Biolek's model <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> the dopant drift rate depends on a discontinuous window decreasing towards 0 as the layer boundary approaches any of the two ends and exhibiting vertical upward transitions each time source reverses polarity (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(b) as reference). Biolek's window function-let us call it</head><p>-is expressed by (5a) (5b) Due to its input-dependent expression, Biolek's model may only allow for multi-valued memductance-flux characteristics under sign-varying input.</p><p>Summarizing, no model hitherto available in literature may reproduce both single-valued and multi-valued memductance-flux characteristics under sign-varying input.</p><p>The aim of this work is to fill such gap in literature.</p><p>We propose a unique and accurate model-we name it boundary condition-based Model (BCM)-revolving around the linear dopant drift assumption, which simplifies its analytical integration and endows it with a closed-form solution under any state initial condition/input combination.

Particularly, under periodic zero-mean input with one change of polarity per period, necessary and sufficient conditions for single-valued memductance-flux relations are derived.</p><p>This boundary behavior tuning feature allows the reproduction of a wide gamut of memristor behaviors recently observed in experiments on distinct nanoscale double-layer films <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, including all the dynamical scenarios reported in the sensational paper on the first measurement of memductance in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>As for the structure of the manuscript, Section II presents a deep theoretical analysis of Joglekar's and Biolek's models. In particular, mathematical proofs for the single-valuedness and multi-valuedness arising in the memductance-flux relation under sign-varying input respectively in Joglekar's and Bioleks' models are given. Section III proposes the proposed model, proves the existence of a closed-form BCM solution under each state initial condition/input combination, presents a pseudocode-based algorithm yielding the time interval over which each boundary condition holds under a periodic input with one change of polarity per period, and, provided such input also has zero-mean, determines the necessary and sufficient conditions for single-valued memductance-flux characteristics. Section IV is devoted to the BCM validation, including its use for modeling memristors employed in a chaotic oscillator. Finally, Section V outlines conclusions and future research developments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. ANALYTICAL STUDY OF EXISTING MODELS</head><p>In this section we deeply investigate the properties of the most important models hitherto available in literature so as to explain the reasons behind their inability to capture some of the dynamics reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>This analysis requires a brief preliminary description of the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of Joglekar's and Biolek's nonlinear dopant drift models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Critical Discussion of Existing Models</head><p>Joglekar's window function (4) is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a)</ref>. Under sign-varying input, its time evolution occurs along a single curve. The window is traveled from left to right when increases (i.e., for ) and in the opposite direction when decreases (i.e., for ). As gets bigger and bigger, the two -values at which decreases to 90% of its unitary value get farther and farther away from and from such states the window decrease rate becomes larger and larger. This window is responsible for the existence of two equilibria, specifically and , in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Therefore, if state initial condition is set to either 0 or 1, then keeps unaltered for all subsequent times, no matter what the input is. However, in a real case scenario, reversing the control source sign may cause to change in the opposite direction. Due to the independence of (4) on the input, Joglekar's model may only yield single-valued memductance-flux characteristics. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref> This shall be demonstrated in Section II-B.</p><p>Unlike (4), Biolek's window function (5a)-(5b) depends on the control source, i.e., it consists of a distinct branch per source polarity. Further, switching between these branches occurs through discontinuous vertical transitions. Let us consider a simple numerical example in order to clarify the time evolution of with variation in input . Here we choose and . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(b) displays (5a)-(5b) for this case. . (c) .</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Single-valued memductance-flux characteristics for the memristor modeled by ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), with boundary conditions defined through Joglekar's window (4) where and input given by ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>). For such input, in (13) we have .</p><p>Setting and assuming an initially positive voltage, i.e., is expressed by (5a) and starts from 1. The positive voltage causes to increase towards 1 according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Correspondingly window function decreases with -dependent rate towards 0 along curve number . For clarity's sake, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(b) the positive sign, negative sign and 0 value of the voltage associated to each numbered curve is respectively reported as subscript and 0 on the curve number. Assuming voltage sign is kept positive, at some instant and become respectively equal to 1 and 0. Thereafter they shall maintain their respective values as long as voltage sign is kept unaltered.</p><p>Note that for a negative or zero voltage it is (5b) which describes . Therefore, when voltage assumes the 0 value the window experiences a sudden transition from 0 to 1 (vertical solid line number ). Obviously, voltage could set to 0 before that takes the unitary value. If this occurs when equals 0.9, jumps upwards along another curve, i.e., vertical dashed line . Assuming that afterwards voltage sign becomes negative, state variable shall decrease towards 0 with a rate set by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Correspondingly the window, expressed by (5b), decays towards 0 with -dependent rate along curve number . As long as voltage sign is kept unaltered, at some time instant both and shall equal 0. Provided that voltage sign is kept negative or voltage value gets equal to 0, no variation in the values of and occurs thereafter. Only a new change in voltage sign produces a sudden 0-to-1 transition in the window (vertical solid line number ) since for a positive voltage is defined by (5a) once again. Certainly voltage sign could get positive before that gets equal to 0. If this occurs when equals 0.1, jumps upwards on another curve. i.e., vertical dashed line . Unlike Joglekar's window, whose unitary maximum is at , Biolek's has unitary maxima at and at . Keeping , as gets bigger and bigger, the -value at which the window decreases to 90% of its unitary value with gets farther and farther away from end and from that state the window decrease rate becomes larger and larger.</p><p>Contrary to Joglekar's case, due to the dependence of (5a)-(5b) on the input, Biolek's model may only allow for multi-valued memductance-flux relations under sign-varying input. This shall be demonstrated in Section II-C.</p><p>The next two sections report analytical integration of Joglekar's and Biolek's models. This mathematical analysis-where, without losing generality, is taken equal to 1-allows one to gain a deep insight into the memductance-flux relations arising from the models. In the numerical examples we consider a nanostructure with nm, S and . State initial condition is set to . Furthermore, the time normalization factor is set as the device characteristic time <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, where V denotes the amplitude of a sine-wave control voltage source, expressed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> with the normalized frequency, i.e., , set to 0.01, and denoting the frequency in Hz. Finally, as it was done for time and length of conductive layer, in the simulation results we shall normalize all the physical quantities of interest: voltage , flux , charge and current are respectively normalized with respect to and . For the above specified parameter setting we have: s (implying Hz), and A.</p></div>

No other model exhibits such attractive feature.</p><p>The proposed linear dopant drift-based model is then endowed with boundary condition tuning capability, which, depending on the system under consideration, permits the detection of the desired single-valued or multi-valued memductance-flux characteristic under certain sign-varying inputs of interest. The derivation of the proposed model was inspired by the work of Williams et al., who, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, stated that "the switching characteristic observed for a particular memristive system helps to classify the nature of the boundary conditions on the state variable of the device".</p><p>Next section shall introduce the proposed model.</p></div>

Conditions for Single-Valuedness of Under Certain Sign-Varying Inputs of Interest</head><p>The following proposition presents the conditions ensuring the single-valuedness of the state-flux characteristic (and, consequently, also of the memductance-flux characteristic) observed in the proposed BCM under certain sign-varying inputs of interest.  <ref type="formula">46</ref>) are similar to conditions for zero net flux injection over a certain time interval <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The fulfillment of such conditions is necessary in memristor-based memories to avoid corruption of memristor state after read cycles.

The current-voltage plots (the blue and black curves, respectively associated to , i.e., Hz, and , i.e., Hz, show the collapse of the bow-tie-shaped hysteretic loop to a straight line with a tenfold increase in frequency, a distinctive feature of a memristor) of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> resemble Fig. <ref type="figure">2(b</ref>) from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The blue arrows show the direction of the loop relative to the excitation source at frequency Hz. The insets (a) and (b) of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, relative to the simulation with Hz, respectively visualize the time plot of the oscillating state variable and the single-valued memductance-flux characteristic.

As in the previous scenario, we use an ode solver to numerically integrate the proposed model and take zero matched threshold voltages in boundary conditions (36)-(38).

By contrast, by hard-switching scenario we denote a case where at least one of conditions (37) and (38) is met for some time. In this scenario multi-valuedness arises in the memductance-flux characteristics unless the occurrence of suitable conditions for single-valuedness, such as (45)-( <ref type="formula">46</ref>) derived in Section III-C for certain sign-varying inputs of interest, is ensured.</p><p>In this case temporarily gets stuck to both boundaries over period . In 8 (blue curve) we observe a multi-valued memductance-flux characteristic, since the earlier specified conditions for single-valuedness, i.e., (45)-(46) (see Section III-C), are not satisfied. This is demonstrated for (45) by the fact that and (blue points) do not overlap on the characteristic.
