<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Despite the impressive results large pretrained language models have achieved in zero-shot settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Brown et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Radford et al., 2019)</ref>, we argue that current work underestimates the zero-shot capabilities of these models on classification tasks. This is in large part due to surface form competition-a property of generative models that causes probability to be rationed between different valid Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: While humans select from given options, language models implicitly assign probability to every possible string. This creates surface form competition between different strings that represent the same concept. Example from CommonsenseQA <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Talmor et al., 2019)</ref>. strings, even ones that differ trivially, e.g., by capitalization alone. We show such competition can be largely removed by scoring choices according to Domain Conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI DC ), which reweights scores by how much more likely a hypothesis (answer) becomes given a premise (question) within the specific task domain.</p><p>More specifically, consider the example question (shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>): "A human wants to submerge himself in water, what should he use?" with multiple choice options "Coffee cup", "Whirlpool bath", "Cup", and "Puddle." From the given options, "Whirlpool bath" is the only one that makes sense. Yet, other answers are valid and easier for a language model to generate, e.g., "Bathtub" and "A bathtub." Since all surface forms compete for finite probability mass, allocating significant probability mass to "Bathtub" decreases the amount of probability mass assigned to "Whirlpool bath." While the total probability of generating some correct answer may be high (i.e., across all valid surface forms), only one of these is a listed option. This is particularly problematic here, because "Whirlpool bath" will be much lower probability than "Bathtub," due to its rarity. More generally, methods that do not account for surface form competition will favor answers with fewer lexical paraphrases of this type, without any consideration of the task or question under consideration. PMI DC factors out the probability of a specific surface form, instead looking at how much more probable a hypothesis becomes when conditioned on a premise. We use a domain premise string to estimate the unconditional probability of a hypothesis in a given domain. For CommonsenseQA, for example, we compute the probability of each answer option immediately following the string "? the answer is:", and then divide the conditional by this estimate to calculate PMI DC . This scaling factor renormalizes according to the surface form competition that is inherent to the domain or task, e.g. completions of the domain premise that are just inherently unlikely will be upweighted more. After reweighting we can much more directly measure what the question tells us about the answer and vice versa (the mutual information, see ยง3 for a full derivation and discussion). Hypotheses no longer need to compete: both "Whirlpool bath" and "Bathtub " will be considered similarly connected to the question after the domain premise reweighting, and so both will attain a high score.</p><p>PMI DC is the only method that consistently outperforms raw, normalized, and calibrated probability scoring methods on more than a dozen multiple choice datasets and it does so for every model in the GPT-2 and GPT-3 families ( ยง4). To better explain these gains, we show it is possible to use the distinct structure of the COPA dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Roemmele et al., 2011)</ref> to remove surface form competition entirely, which we call scoring-by-premise, and show that all methods perform well in this ideal-ized setting ( ยง5). Finally, we analyze three exceptions where PMI DC does worse than other methods and discuss how inherent differences in dataset construction and task specification cause different methods to work better or worse ( ยง6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background and Related Work</head><p>Zero-shot vs. Few-Shot Zero-shot inference has long been of interest in NLP, Computer Vision, and ML in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Socher et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Guadarrama et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Romera-Paredes and Torr, 2015)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Radford et al. (2019)</ref> popularized the notion that language models have many zero-shot capabilities that simply need to be discovered by prompting the model. For instance placing "TL;DR" (internet slang for Too Long; Didn't Read) at the end of an article causes the model to generate a summary. Efficiently discovering the right prompt is difficult and has become an active area of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Reynolds and McDonell, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Shin et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jiang et al., 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Brown et al. (2020)</ref> demonstrated that few-shot learning without fine-tuning is possible with very large language models. Very recent work has shown it is possible to get smaller models to exhibit few-shot learning behavior, but again using finetuning <ref type="bibr">(Schick and Schรผtze, 2020b,a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Shin et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zhao et al., 2021)</ref>. Improving zero-shot inference of large models has been a less active area, as most zero-shot behavior is assumed to be directly tied to model quality. It is unclear how to train a better model for a particular task without any task-specific data.</p><p>Surface Form Competition When applying generative models to multiple choice problems simply choosing the highest probability answer becomes problematic due to valid surface forms competing for probability. Indeed, recent work in question answering has demonstrated the importance of considering all multiple choice options together <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Khashabi et al., 2020)</ref>, rather than independently assigning each answer a score and simply choosing the highest. This is a difficult strategy to adapt to left-to-right generative language models, which implicitly choose between all possible strings. The use of unsupervised language models pretrained on relatively expansive corpora exacerbates surface form competition because such language models generate a much wider distribution than a given question answering dataset contains.</p><p>"What is the most populous nation in North America?" Posed with this question, a language model such as GPT-3 can generate a correct response such as "USA", "United States", or "United States of America" with high probability. While correct strings like this all contribute to the probability of a correct generation, they may have vastly different probabilities: a common string "United States" will be much more likely than rarer forms like "U.S. of A.". In generative scenarios, as long as most of the probability mass goes to valid strings the generation is likely to be valid. This is not the case for multiple choice problems. Posed with two possible answers, "USA" and "Canada", GPT-3 may still choose the correct answer by probability. However, if we substitute out "USA" for "U.S. of A.", it becomes very likely that GPT-3 will assign higher probability to "Canada", a less likely answer conceptually, but a much more likely surface form. Beyond this, incorrect generic answers such as "I don't know" can take up much of the probability space, relegating the desired answers to the tail of the distribution where calibration with softmax is less trustworthy <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Holtzman et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>PMI Work in dialogue has used PMI to promote diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Zhou et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Yao et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Li et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mou et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tang et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Recently, Brown et al. (2020) used a scoring function resembling PMI DC for zero-shot question answering, though they only use the string "A:" as a prompt for the unconditional probability estimate, whereas we use a task-specific domain premise (see ยง3 for details). Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Brown et al. (2020)</ref> only report this scoring method on three datasets (ARC, OpenBookQA, and RACE, included here) out of the more than 20 tested and do not compare scores with their standard method, averaging loglikelihoods (AVG in this work). In contrast, we complete a comprehensive comparison on GPT-3 and GPT-2, as well as shedding light on the underlying issue of surface form competition in ยง5.</p><p>Contextual Calibration Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zhao et al. (2021)</ref> describe a new method for calibrating the probabilities of an LM so that straightforward probability-based scoring works better. Though geared towards few-shot learning, the authors devise a clever means of using "dummy" answers for zero-shot learning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zhao et al. (2021)</ref> calibrate for three forms of bias: (1) majority label bias, (2) recency bias, and (3) common token bias. Of these, only (3) applies to the zero-shot case, as "majority label" and "recency" refer to the given few-shot examples' labels and ordering. PMI DC directly compensates for common token bias by dividing by the domain conditional probability of each answer without the need for new model parameters, and performs superior to contextual calibration (CC) in the majority of cases.</p><p>Prompt Sensitivity Recent work highlights the sensitivity of LMs with respect to the inputs, and proposes to consider various paraphrases of the prompt to overcome this sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Davison et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jiang et al., 2020)</ref>, as well as noting that certain trigger tokens <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Shin et al., 2020)</ref> can strongly effect the output of such models. In this work we focus on fixing issues regarding the surface form of possible outputs.</p><p>Interpreting Language Models Language models tend to model selectional preferences and thematic fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Pantel et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Erk et al., 2010)</ref> which are different from semantic plausibility because the former is more concerned with typicality <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Wang et al., 2018)</ref>. Probability, possibility and plausibility give distinct and relevant notions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Van der Helm, 2006)</ref>, but reporting bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gordon and Van Durme, 2013)</ref> means that language models only model what people are likely to write (on websites, that were reachable under the given scrape, etc.). PMI DC aims to adjust for these challenges to better measure the underlying agreement between language models and human judgements, but of course is still subject to the limits of the language models it is used with.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Zero-shot Scoring Strategies</head><p>This paper does not define any new modeling or finetuning methods. Rather, we propose the broad use of PMI DC scoring for any given model and prompt. PMI DC compensates for the fact that different correct answers compete for probability, even though only one will be listed as the correct multiple choice option. We begin by describing the two most common methods currently in use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Standard Methods</head><p>The first baseline approach is simply selecting the highest-probability option, e.g. baselines in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zhao et al. (2021)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jiang et al. (2020)</ref>, which we here refer to as LM. Given a prompt x (e.g. "The man broke his toe because") and set of possible answers Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>: An example from COPA <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Roemmele et al., 2011)</ref> with the template we use as well as the scoring functions we test. LM returns the highest probability option, while AVG length-normalizes log-likelihoods and chooses the highest option. PMI DC is a measurement of the mutual information between hypothesis and premise, intuitively how much x explains y i and vice versa. CC computes an affine transform of LM (adding extra parameters W and b), adjusting to a given answer set which must be finite and fixed for a given task; PMI DC does not require knowledge about possible answers and is readily applied to tasks where answers vary from question to question. y 1 , y 2 , โข โข โข , y n (e.g. "he got a hole in his sock.", "he dropped a hammer on his foot"), LM is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">arg max i P (y i |x).<label>(1)</label></formula><p>However, using length normalized log-likelihoods <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Brown et al., 2020)</ref> has become standard due to its superior performance, and is commonly used for generation tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mao et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Oluwatobi and Mueller, 2020)</ref>. For causal language models, e.g., GPT-2 and GPT-3, Equation 1 can be decomposed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P (y i |x) = j=1 P (y j i |x, y 1 i , โข โข โข , y jโ1 i )</formula><p>where y j i is the jth token of y i and i is the number of tokens in y i . The AVG strategy is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">arg max i i j=1 log P (y j i |x, y 1โขโขโขjโ1 ) i .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Domain Conditional PMI</head><p>Direct probability is not an adequate zero-shot scoring function due to surface form competition. A natural solution is to factor out the probability of specific surface forms, which is what Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) does:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">PMI(x, y) = log P (y|x) P (y) = log P (x|y) P (x) . (2)</formula><p>In effect, this is how much more likely the hypothesis ("he dropped a hammer on his foot") becomes given the premise ("The man broke his toe because"). In a multiple-choice setting-where the premise x does not change across hypotheses-this is proportional to P (x|y), i.e., the probability of the premise given the hypothesis. We experiment with this scoring-by-premise in Section 5. While Equation 2 estimates how related premise x is to hypothesis y in general, we found that estimates of P (y) vary wildly. We believe this is because many possible answers are extremely rare in a general setting and therefore their unconditional probability is not well calibrated for the purposes of a given task.</p><p>We are specifically trying to measure P (y) in a given domain, e.g., for the "because" relation in our running example, shown in Figures <ref type="figure">2 &amp; 3</ref>. To quantify this, we propose Domain Conditional PMI:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">PMI DC (x, y, domain) = P (y|x, domain) P (y|domain) (3) = P (y|x, domain) P (y|x domain )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>or how much x tells us about y within a given domain.</p><p>Typically, P (y|x, domain) = P (y|x) because the premise x implies the domain in the datasets considered here and for most modern datasets, e.g., "The man broke his toe because" sets the model up to predict a dependent clause that is the cause of some event, without further representation of the domain. In order to estimate P (y|domain)-the probability of seeing hypothesis y in this domain-we use a short domainrelevant template x domain , which we call a "domain premise", often this is just the ending of the conditional premise x. For example, to help predict a causal relation like in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> we use x domain = "because" and thus divide by P (y|because). For details about templates see Appendix ??.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Non-standard Baselines</head><p>Unconditional We also compare to the unconditional (in-domain) estimate as a scoring function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">arg max i P (y i |x domain ).</formula><p>(5)</p><p>We refer to this as UNC. It ignores the premise completely, only using a domain premise x domain (e.g., using P (y|because) as the score). Yet, it is sometimes competitive, for instance on BoolQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Clark et al., 2019)</ref>. UNC is a sanity check on whether zero-shot inference is actually using the information in the question to good effect. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Setup</head><p>We use GPT-2 via the HuggingFace Transformers library <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Wolf et al., 2020)</ref> and GPT-3 via OpenAI's beta API. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> We do not finetune any models, nor do we alter their output. Our code is public, complete with data loading scripts for each dataset to support maximum reproducibility. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> See the appendix ( ยง??) for example instances from each dataset in our templated format.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Datasets</head><p>We report results on 16 splits of 13 datasets, and briefly describe each dataset here.</p><p>Continuation These datasets require the model to select a continuation to previous text, making them a natural way to test language models. Choice of Plausible Alternatives (COPA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Roemmele et al., 2011)</ref> asks for various "because" and "so" relationships, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. StoryCloze (SC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mostafazadeh et al., 2017)</ref> gives the model a choice between two alternative endings to 5 sentence stories. Finally, HellaSwag (HS) uses GPT-2 to generate, BERT to filter, and crowd workers to verify possible continuations to a passage.  <ref type="figure">C</ref>) are standardized tests described as "natural, grade-school science questions," with the "Easy" split found to be solvable by either a retrieval or word co-occurrence system, and the rest of the questions put in the "Challenge" split. Open Book Question Answering (OBQA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Mihaylov et al., 2018)</ref> is similar to both of these, but was derived using and intended to be tested with a knowledge source (or "book") available; we do not make use of the given knowledge source, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Brown et al. (2020)</ref>. Finally, Common-senseQA (CQA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Talmor et al., 2019)</ref> leverages CONCEPTNET <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Speer et al., 2017)</ref> to encourage crowd workers to write questions with challenging distractors.</p><p>Open Set vs. Closed Set Datasets The above datasets are all "open set" in that multiple choice answers may be any string. Below we describe "closed set" datasets with a pre-specified set of answers. These are more difficult for the zeroshot case, as this closed set of answers is often somewhat domain specific, but we do not adapt the model to this closed set of answers in any capacity, unlike Contextual Calibration <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Zhao et al., 2021)</ref>. tions based on a multi-sentence passage, with a "yes" or "no" answer.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Boolean</formula><p>Entailment Entailment datasets focus on the question of whether a hypothesis sentence B is entailed by a premise sentence A. Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dagan et al., 2005)</ref> requires predicting an "entailment" or "contradiction" label while Commitment Bank <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(De Marneffe et al., 2019)</ref> allows for (a small fraction of) questions to be marked "neutral".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Text Classification</head><p>We consider three more complex classification datasets: SST-2 &amp; -5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Socher et al., 2013)</ref> for various granularities of sentiment classification, AG's News <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Zhang et al., 2015)</ref> (AGN) for topic classification, and TREC <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Li and Roth, 2002)</ref> for question classification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Results</head><p>We report results for GPT-3 and GPT-2 in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">1  and 2</ref>. The trend favoring PMI DC is clear in these tables, but a more digestible summary is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> which aggregates the percentage of splits over which a given method achieves the best score or ties for first-place. In this summarized view it is clear that PMI DC consistently outperforms other scoring methods when aggregated over a variety of datasets. Indeed, the smallest margin (in number of datasets won or tied) between PMI DC and the best competing method is on GPT-3 13B with AVG, but that margin is 50 percentage points. This does not imply that PMI DC is always better or that it will be better by a large margin, though it often is. It does suggest that PMI DC is a significantly better bet on a new dataset, as it more consistently matches or outperforms every other method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Removing Surface Form Competition</head><p>What if we used the probability of the premise given the hypothesis P (x|y i ) instead? While we are still measuring the probability of a surface form (e.g. "the man broke his toe"), it is the same surface form across different options ("he had a hole in his sock", "he dropped a hammer on his foot"), eliminating the surface form competition between options. y i and y i can now both attain high scores if they are both correct answers and cause x to be likely. We call this scoring-by-premise.</p><p>Due to the nature pretrained causal language models like GPT-2 and GPT-3, it is not usually possible to measure the premise given the hypothesis. This is because the phrasing of the connection between the premise and hypothesis often only works one way, e.g. it is strange to see an answer before a question. We exploit the structure of the COPA dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Roemmele et al., 2011)</ref> to create a "COPA Flipped" dataset via a simple alternative template, shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. COPA consists of cause and effect pairs (CAUSE so EFFECT, and EFFECT because CAUSE). In the original dataset, whatever comes second (either CAUSE or EFFECT) has multiple options that a model must choose between. These can be reversed by flipping the order of CAUSE and EFFECT, then substituting the natural inverse relation ("because"โ โ"so" and "so"โ โ"because" ). Table <ref type="table">4</ref> shows scores on COPA and COPA Flipped side-by-side. The clearest trend is that in COPA Flipped everything except UNC (Unc in the table) produces the exact same result. This is because flipping the hypothesis and premise means that it's the context that changes and not the continuation. LM, AVG, and PMI DC only differ from each other over different continuations, not over different contexts for the same continuation.</p><p>The second important observation is that in COPA Flipped all of these methods generally do about as well as PMI DC on the unflipped version. Indeed, on average they do a little bit better! This is because surface form competition has been eradicated: as the continuation being scored is always the same, it does not matter if other continuations would have been equally good. In COPA Flipped, it only matters how well the context explains the continuation, as measured via ease of prediction. This is not subject to surface form competition because there is only one hypothesis to explain, it is not competing with any other hypotheses for probability mass. Not all datasets are so easily flippable, so manually flipping individual questions is not a generally applicable strategy. Luckily, PMI DC is symmetric across flipping:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">arg max i P (y i |x, domain) P (y i |domain) = arg max i P (x|y i , domain) P (x|domain) = arg max i P (x|y i , domain)</formula><p>In theory, PMI DC 's selected answer should be the same between on COPA and COPA Flipped, though we expect small differences due to "so" and "because" not being perfect inverses. Actually, the flipped score meets or exceeds PMI DC on the unflipped data on most models in this setting. One possible reason for this is that on COPA Flipped there is no division to calculate PMI DC ; since lan-Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>: Experiment from ยง5, where the premise and hypothesis are flipped and the hypothesis that leads to the highest probability premise is chosen as the answer i.e. scoring-by-premise. In this case, LM, AVG, and PMI DC all yield the same solution, since they only differ between different hypotheses, not between different premises.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Analysis</head><p>Failure Cases There are three datasets on which PMI DC does not consistently perform better than other scoring methods: HellaSwag, ARC Easy, and BoolQ. Interestingly (and without any foreknowledge on our part) each one is dominated by a different scoring method. HellaSwag is most amenable to AVG. After examining a number of data points and the scores of each algorithm, we observe that HellaSwag is more focused on the internal coherence of the hypotheses themselves (given basic topic information from the premise), rather than external coherence, e.g., a hypothesis being a valid or specific answer to a posed question. This is appears to be largely because it was generated by GPT-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Radford et al., 2019)</ref> and filtered with BERT, which results in relatively on-topic but somewhat odd hypotheses that humans can distinguish from natural data.</p><p>ARC Easy yields highest scores to LM, i.e. just selecting the highest probability option. Upon manual observation, the strongest pattern we were able to find was the presence of stock answers, e.g., the fact that clouds are generated when "ocean water evaporates and then condenses in the air." Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Clark et al. (2018)</ref> note that ARC Easy are the questions that were solved either by a retrieval or word co-occurrence baseline, while examples that were answered incorrectly by both were put into the ARC Hard split. This appears to adequately explain our observations. Finally, BoolQ, a binary reading comprehension dataset, in which all answers are either "yes" or "no" is best solved by an unconditional baseline. This is largely because the dataset presents truly complex questions, that require more reasoning than GPT-2 or 3 are capable of doing out-of-thebox. The unconditional baseline simply manages to infer the majority label without data, but none of the methods reported actually do better than the majority baseline. The one exception is PMI DC with the largest GPT-3 model, but that is a less than 2 percentage point improvement.</p><p>Why does length normalization work? Past work offers little explanation for why AVG should be a successful strategy for choosing the correct answer, other than the vague intuitive notion that estimates are strongly length biased and require some kind of length compensation. Length bias may be caused by the final softmax layer of current language models assigning too much probability mass to irrelevant options at each time-step, a</p><p>property noted in open-ended generation, characterlevel language modeling, and machine translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Holtzman et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Al-Rfou et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Peters et al., 2019)</ref>. If this is the issue, it would mean that longer sequences are even less probable than they should be, biasing the model towards shorter answers.</p><p>Another possible argument is that length normalization may account for unconditional probability in a similar way to PMI DC . Length normalization is measured over Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokens <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Sennrich et al., 2016)</ref> and BPE tends to produce a vocabulary such that most tokens are equally frequent <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Wang et al., 2020)</ref>. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that language is approximately uniformly information dense <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Levy, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Levy and Jaeger, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Jaeger, 2006)</ref>. As such, length in BPE tokens may correspond roughly to a unigram estimate of log-probability, supposing that BPE tokens have approximately uniform unigram log-probability. The adjustment made by AVG is still somewhat different than PMI DC , (division of log terms rather than subtraction) but could have a similar effect. On inspected examples AVG and PMI DC often agreed on answer ranking more than other pairs of methods. We leave exploration of this phenomenon to future work.</p><p>7 Discussion ยง5 shows that surface form competition is the cause of certain inadequacies with the standard probability-based scoring methods. PMI DC alleviates this, but so does scoring-by-premise in which the probability of the premise given the hypothesis is used as the score. The takeaway here is that generative models assigning probability to a given option isn't the same as selection. PMI DC is not a panacea for zero-shot inference. Rather, it is a technique that aligns the prediction being made by the model with the actual task humans would like to get done, which is closer to "choose the hypothesis that explains the premise" than "generate the exact surface form of the hypothesis".</p><p>Generative models are density estimation functions that assign probability to every possible string, which is a very different task than the human act of selecting an answer. We expect surface form competition anywhere that generative models are used for selection where there is sufficient uncertainty. There are also many more complex tasks we would like to apply generative models to, such as giving a model a prompt and having it write an essay, but they largely still elude us. Perhaps some of the difficulty comes from using these models in a way that doesn't align with the specific nature of the task.</p><p>Consider long-form generation, where currently the best we can do is sample from a large language model. This strategy is clearly problematic because language models marginalize over the contextual probability of every author they've encountered (weighted by the frequency with which they've encountered them) and then draw from this wide and extremely noisy distribution, a kind of "authorship competition".</p><p>No explicit modeling of concepts was needed to counteract surface form competition, instead using a variation of PMI for a scoring function was enough. We tentatively posit that similarly general methods (in contrast to explicit structure) may help in many other areas, especially as training becomes infeasible for most individual labs due to the cost and engineering effort required to build extremely large language models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>We conduct a large-scale comparison of standard and recent scoring functions for zero-shot inference across all GPT-2 and GPT-3 models. We show that Domain Conditional PMI consistently outperforms previous scoring functions on a wide variety of multiple choice datasets. We also argue that compensating for surface form competition is the cause of this boost, by demonstrating that other methods work just as well as Domain Conditional PMI when surface form competition is eliminated. We analyze failure cases of our proposed method and show that they are tied to dataset construction and task definition. Finally, we report a set of qualitative analyses to explain why Domain Conditional PMI outperforms existing zero-shot scoring methods. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="1,314.00,199.99,205.35,297.89" type="bitmap" /></figure>
