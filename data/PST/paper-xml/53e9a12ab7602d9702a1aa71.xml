<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We propose CONFlexFlow (Clinical cONtext based Flexible workFlow) as a novel approach for integrating clinical pathways into Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Workflows play an important role in clinical environments by delineating the steps through which the treatment of a patient progresses. The temporal order and correct coordination of the various steps are clearly important. The workflows in these environments are called clinical pathways. These pathways generally follow wellestablished standards or clinical guidelines. However, they differ from other workflows found in business and production environments because clinical processes involve frequent deviations, and hence there is a need for considerable flexibility. Typically, a medical facility develops clinical pathways from clinical guidelines on the basis of its local resources and settings. Moreover, the pathway is further customized into a treatment scheme to suit an individual patient's needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Clinical workflows are highly dynamic, context sensitive, event driven, and knowledge intensive. In this respect, they are quite unique. In general, a patient interacts with a Primary Care Physician's (PCP) office, a pharmacy, labs, and one or more specialists, etc. In this setting, it is important to maintain coordination and flow of information among these various entities to ensure an optimal outcome. The need for new modeling techniques for designing such flexible workflows is motivated by several considerations. First, although many research efforts are geared towards establishing international healthcare standards (e.g., HL7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>) and a representation for sharable guidelines (e.g., GLIF <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>) for clinical practice, formal models of executable and flexible clinical workflows are very few (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">55]</ref>). The execution of a clinical workflow is highly dependent on the existing body of medical knowledge, available resources, and specific case data. For example, doctors with different skill levels and fields of expertise may offer differing treatments to the same patient. A sudden rise in a patient's blood pressure may require an additional test and alter her treatment in the subsequent pathway. Thus, different pathways can arise based on case specifics and the proclivities of attending doctors, and it is important to formally model these scenarios. Second, since medical staff handles a lot of cases each day, they are prone to making mistakes in prescribing medications, performing procedures, and even making diagnoses <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">51]</ref>. Hence, Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) and Computer Interpretable Guidelines (CIGs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref> can assist care professionals in reducing the likelihood of errors and improving care quality.</p><p>Our goal is to show how flexible clinical pathways can be designed taking into account medical knowledge in the form of rules, and also detailed contextual information, for a medical workflow involving multiple participants to improve care quality. We propose a methodology for designing formal workflow models that capture medical knowledge and context in a common framework, and yet allow flexibility. Since a clinical workflow should naturally be aligned with clinical guidelines, it is necessary to ensure that it is formal and correct so that integrating decision support into this workflow can be helpful. The methodology is based on a formal rule and context taxonomy using ontologies. The rule taxonomy organizes the rules into a hierarchy while context encompasses aspects of patients, providers, resources, and environment. We will focus on how context is captured, described and summarized, and how rules are developed. A proof of concept prototype is built and preliminary results are given to show the feasibility of our approach. In this paper, the terms pathway and workflow are used interchangeably.</p><p>The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 provides background and related work. Then we introduce a meta-model for our CONFlexFlow system and present the architecture for system implementation in Section 3. Next, Section 4 presents an ontology-based context model and discusses rule-based medical reasoning. Based on this knowledge framework, we present our approach for designing flexible clinical workflows using BPMN 2.0 ad hoc subprocesses and describe a preliminary implementation in Section 5. Later, Section 6 gives a brief discussion and plans for future work, followed by a conclusion in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background and related work</head><p>A Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) is an interactive computer software designed to assist health professionals with decision making tasks, such as preventing adverse drug events at the point of care <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref>. Although many methodologies are employed in designing CDSS, including Bayesian networks, neural networks, and genetic algorithms, we focus on rule-based approaches in this study. Rulebased CDSS, derived from expert systems research <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>, are knowledge based systems that integrate a medical knowledge base, patient data, and an inference engine to generate case specific advice. An overview of the state of the art of rule-based CDSS is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">49]</ref>.</p><p>Although CDSS are said to be very helpful to assist in the clinicians' work, still they are reluctant to adopt CDSS because of unnecessary workflow disruptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>. The importance of integrating a CDSS with a clinical workflow has been stressed by other studies as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">52]</ref>. Kawamoto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> note that CDSS interventions that are presented automatically and fit into a workflow of medical staff are more likely to be adopted, and a CDSS that makes recommendations is better than one that only gives an assessment. Another challenge is to ensure the correctness of decision support by following standard guidelines. The objective of a CDSS is to deliver the "right knowledge to the right people in the right form at the right time" <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref>. Thus, integrating medical guidelines along with clinical data into a CDSS aims to deliver evidence-based recommendations to care providers at various points of care. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes a variety of approaches from different research communities and compares them in terms of their knowledge base organization and workflow integration capability. Further details of these studies are discussed next along with the role of ontology in healthcare.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Clinical workflow</head><p>The business process management community has devoted a lot of effort in designing customized and flexible clinical processes using formal workflow languages (e.g., BPMN and BPEL) that are executable by existing workflow engines. Lenz and Reichert <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref> conducted a survey of IT support for healthcare processes and emphasized the importance of flexible workflow design in supporting clinical decisions. Such systems have been developed to enable dynamic changes in predefined process models, such as ADEPT flex <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref> and AgentWork <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>. Research on context-aware workflow design <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20]</ref> also belongs to this area, but focuses more on the integration of context in binding specific services or constructing subprocesses, whereas medical knowledge is deemphasized. These techniques are useful and highlight the criticality of context in designing a flexible workflow.</p><p>However, there has also been work from the software engineering community on modeling medical processes. In particular, limitations of current workflow languages have been observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[56]</ref>, and an alternative approach based on Little-JIL language <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref> has been proposed. Little-JIL is a language that centers on a coordination diagram of the process described by a hierarchical task decomposition. It helps to coordinate agents and their activities, and allows steps to be performed in sequence or parallel. A Little-JIL description can be verified using finite state machine verification techniques. Approaches for formally defining and analyzing medical processes using Little-JIL are discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">39]</ref>. This stream of research is useful for its focus on improving patient safety and detecting medical errors, but it does not emphasize flexibility or decision support. Mathe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref> developed the Model-Integrated Clinical Information System using model-based design techniques to represent complex clinical workflows in a service-oriented architecture. Thus, treatment protocols are transformed into executable constructs such as Web services or BPEL processes to promote software reuse and maintainability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Clinical guidelines</head><p>The medical informatics community models clinical processes as guidelines or care plans. Their focus is on medical decision making by interpreting situations based on best practice. They also formalize process definitions in a way that reflects clinical tasks and constraints as clinicians perceive them.</p><p>Medical guidelines were originally expressed as free-format text documents to assist medical decision-making during diagnosis, management and treatment within different areas of healthcare. Recently, various approaches have been proposed to represent Computer-Interpretable Guidelines (CIGs), such as Arden Syntax, Asbru, EON, GLIF, GUIDE, PRESTIGE, PRODIGY, PROforma, and SAGE (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">44]</ref>). CIGs can produce personalized recommendations during patient encounters and reduce variance in patient treatment. Peleg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref> reviewed six CIG modeling approaches and established a consensus on their common structure. They represent clinical guidelines as plans, whose components represent decisions, actions, and the relationships among them. Decision steps are used for conditional and unconditional routing of the flow, while action steps are used to specify a set of tasks or a sub-plan to be carried out. A review of systems using CIGs was conducted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>. The main disadvantage is that all CIGs require an execution engine that is not freely available. Complex workflow patterns cannot be easily modeled in this way, and validation (e.g., checking for possible deadlocks) of such workflows is difficult.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Ontology in healthcare</head><p>An ontology is a formal specification of the concepts within a domain and their interrelationships.

It is becoming a standard for sharing ontologies among people and also software agents on the web. Since OWL uses first-order logic, the models, and description of data in these models, can be formally verified. Thus, inconsistencies in the model can be detected, and new information can also be inferred, by machine reasoning. The use of ontology in healthcare has spanned a variety of research areas including domain conceptualization, clinical context modeling, and workflow modeling. The biomedical community has invested much effort towards building domain ontologies, such as UMLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref> and GALEN <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>, which focus on various medical disciplines and also allow medical terminologies to be shared. Researchers from the computer and information science community have used ontology to build context models in healthcare to generate contextaware alerts and reminders <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">40]</ref>. These approaches are applied in pervasive environments where embedded devices are available and used for collecting medical data. An ontology-based context model provides interoperability among heterogeneous devices and systems, and allows context reasoning based on user-defined rules.</p><p>Recently, ontology-based approaches have been used to enhance the semantics of clinical workflows and make customizations accordingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">55]</ref>. For example, Dang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref> built an ontological knowledge framework to represent important entities (such as roles and resources) in healthcare by capturing the context in clinical pathways. Based on this framework, they developed a system <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref> that enables the creation and execution of personalized medical workflows using the BPEL language. Similar studies include SEMPATH <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and KON 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref> but they focus more on rule-based reasoning. Ye et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[55]</ref> proposed a clinical pathway ontology to represent and exchange pathway-related knowledge. They presented clinical pathways as interconnected hierarchical models including the top-level outcome flow and intervention workflow level along a care timeline with the assistance of semantic rules for modeling temporal knowledge. Compared to these approaches, our clinical processes are well structured in general; however, some complex groups of medical activities are only loosely-defined at design time. This allows a customized pathway to be dynamically generated on the fly at runtime. Further, we argue that a BPMN model is more understandable by care professionals since it provides a graphical representation. It also has rich semantics for modeling medical tasks and thus is suitable for modeling clinical processes.</p><p>Next, we discuss our framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">An integrated framework-CONFlexFlow</head><p>We propose a Clinical cONtext based Flexible workFlow (CONFlexFlow) approach for designing the medical knowledge base and providing decision support. Our study complements earlier </p></div>

We aim to bridge the gap among research from the medical informatics, business process management and the semantic web communities. Our main contributions are to: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> develop an integrated ontology model to capture contextual knowledge that has an impact on clinical practice; (2) use semantic rules to encode medical procedural knowledge from clinical guidelines; (3) model clinical processes using a standard workflow language (BPMN 2.0) and make them adaptable to the continuously changing context; and (4) present a system architecture for implementing CONFlexFlow and develop a proof of concept prototype using multiple open source tools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">A running example</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> represents a simplified BPMN clinical workflow created in the web-based Signavio-Oryx editor <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref>. BPMN 2.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref> can support various types of tasks and workflow patterns. It is executable and supported by existing workflow engines. In this diagram, pools (represented by rectangular blocks) correspond to workflow participants, including patient, CDSS, PCP office, pharmacy, and lab. A message flow (shown by dotted lines) is used to coordinate communication between two participants. Lanes are used to organize and categorize activities within a pool, say between a doctor and a nurse. The control flow among activities within a pool is shown by solid lines. This pathway shows that a patient having any symptoms visits the PCP office and is examined by the care providers. The doctor writes a prescription (Rx) and sends it to the pharmacy. The pharmacy prepares and dispenses the medicine, and the lab is responsible for various tests. Activities or tasks are shown in round rectangles, while events are in circles. Complex gateways (shown in diamonds with an asterisk) allow one or more outgoing branches based on the results of conditions. Parallel gateways (shown in a diamond symbol with an asterisk) create parallel paths without checking any conditions. This is a formal description of the coordination among activities in this process.</p><p>In this diagram, "Prepare Rx" is a reusable subprocess whose execution semantics are strictly and explicitly defined, while "Do tests" is an ad hoc subprocess that is realized from other isolated activities. It is "loosely defined" at design time because its instantiation is dynamically determined by the outcome of previous activities. For example, if a doctor upon examination suspects that a patient may have suffered a heart attack, then "EKG" and "ECG" would be executed in the subsequent pathway. In contrast, a "Blood test" might be needed if a patient is suspected of hypertension. Thus, using a strictly predefined subprocess to design an uncertain and dynamic activity is not practical since it lacks flexibility and adaptability. Context is needed to provide execution semantics for the "loosely-defined" regions of such clinical processes at runtime.</p><p>When a generic process model like the one in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> is actually executed for a specific patient, it is called a process instance. Thus, the process instance for patient 'Sue' with id 'P1001' is different from that for patient 'Jack' with id 'P1003', and so on.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">A meta-model</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> represents a meta-model that describes the semantic relationships among key concepts used in CONFlexFlow. It also introduces some of the terminology used in this paper.</p><p>Clinical workflows are composed of activities performed by roles or participants. Rules are derived from clinical guidelines and use medical ontologies for clinical reasoning. Semantically related rules are categorized into rule groups. A rule group can be associated with one or more workflow activities and it is automatically triggered when the activity node is reached. The data required to evaluate the rule conditions is modeled as a context, which captures all entities that have an impact on the clinical practice. It has subclasses, low-and high-level context. Low-level context is explicit and is directly collected from user inputs or other through data sources like medical sensors. Examples of such context are: patient name, physical location, body temperature, etc. They are used to deduce high-level, implicit context, e.g. about patient diagnoses, by rule-based reasoning. Rules are triggered by contextual data and produce actions, which are generally in the form of reminders, alerts, and recommendations. They can provide evidence-based suggestions for medical decision making within atomic and composite activities.</p><p>We employ a variety of BPMN 2.0 elements (see Fig. to compose processes and composite activities. There are various types of atomic activities. For example, a human task requires user interaction with the assistance of a software application while a manual task is expected to be performed without the aid of any application. A service task is done automatically by a Web service, while a rule task handles complicated business logic. They are used for modeling different types of medical tasks. Composite activities include embedded and reusable subprocesses. In this study, we mainly use ad hoc subprocesses, which are "loosely defined" at design time.</p><p>Then at runtime a more specific (or "concrete") description is realized based on the actual context. The "Do tests" activity in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> is an example of such a process because we do not know at design time what tests will be prescribed by the doctor. In contrast, a structured process is strictly defined and the execution semantics are the same for all its running process instances. More details about this notation can be found in the BPMN 2.0 specification <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">System architecture</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref> depicts the system architecture of CONFlexFlow based on our meta-model. Several roles are involved in this system. Knowledge engineers communicate with domain experts and collect medical knowledge. Other medical resources and documents published by health organizations can be consulted as well for this purpose. Then they use ontology and rule editors to build medical ontologies and rules to formalize clinical guidelines. A Context ontology is developed to capture clinical context acquired from a variety of distributed sources, such as laboratory information systems, surgical information systems, sensors and workflow engines. Then the rule engine triggers rules, evaluates conditions and takes actions accordingly. The produced actions are tightly integrated into running clinical process instances. Various tools used in implementing several of the modules in this architecture are shown in the figure.  Meanwhile, process designers use workflow design tools to create clinical process models and store them in the process repository. They can be initialized and executed by the workflow engine to automate patient flow. At runtime, a process instance is executed and fed with specific case data (e.g., patient body temperature). Workflow participants, e.g. various care professionals, manage clinical workflows through a web-based management console to perform clinical activities and monitor their current process instances. They are presented with reminders, alerts, and recommendations based on the clinical reasoning carried out in the rule engine. Furthermore, the clinical workflow is adapted based on the execution semantics generated from the current context of an individual patient. Every activity may produce additional case data (e.g., patient symptoms and lab test results) and update the context continuously.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Process</head><p>Thus, this architecture captures the nexus of workflow, rules and context. It is important to note that a clinician will still be in control. The pathways and alerts generated by the CDSS can be overridden and adjusted per users' stated preferences.</p><p>In the following sections, we describe the critical components of our framework in more detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Clinical knowledge representation and semantic rules</head><p>The knowledge used for medical decision making in patient encounters includes shared understanding of medical domain concepts, contextual data that characterize a specific clinical process and the procedural knowledge encapsulated in rules. In this section, we discuss the representation of and reasoning with clinical knowledge in CONFlexFlow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Ontological knowledge model</head><p>As discussed above, ontologies are explicit formal specifications of terminologies in a domain and the relationships among them. They can facilitate knowledge sharing, logical inference and knowledge reuse. Ontologies are widely accepted as a useful instrument for modeling context; thus, we use them to model clinical context that can be obtained from heterogeneous sources and represented in different formats. Further, domain ontologies from medical disciplines are included in our knowledge framework since they are critical for decision support. We use Web Ontology Language-Description Logic (OWL-DL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref> to encode our model using Protégé 3.4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[50]</ref>, which is a popular tool for ontology editing and representation. This model can be shared across a healthcare network for collaboration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1.">Clinical context ontology</head><p>According to Dey <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>, context is any information that is used to characterize the situation of an entity. Moreover, a system is context-aware if it uses context to bring to bear in the provision of relevant information and/or services, where relevance is naturally situation dependent. In a clinical workflow, we define context as any information that can be used to influence medical decision making or clinical workflow routing. For example, a patient's medical history might affect a doctor's prescription, and a patient's lab test result could likely affect her subsequent treatment. A normal test result would lead to a "follow up check," while an abnormal result may necessitate customized treatment along a new clinical pathway. Clearly, proper representation of context plays a critical role in the CDSS. Here, we formally model the clinical context using an ontology-based approach by capturing the important concepts in the clinical process. At a preliminary level, we consider the following categories of context:  of available wheel chairs, stock levels of medicines, etc. Additional information is required about the environment at a particular facility such as a surgery room's humidity, temperature, and schedule. • Location-related context concerns the current location of persons, devices, and other movable assets. This information is captured by RFID devices, smart phones, or through other technologies. It is helpful in dealing with emergencies, such as, say, the need for an OXRB bottle in surgery.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> shows a partial representation of our ontology-based clinical context model that describes the main entities of interest, their properties and semantic relationships. Example entities include hospital staff, patients, resources, facility, etc. Their relationships are also described: e.g., "locatedIn" between Person and Location to denote that a person has a location. The pair of relations "treatedBy" and "treats" between Patient and Staff helps to manage the medical staff needed for patient treatment.</p><p>We encoded this context ontology in OWL-DL <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>, which is a sublanguage of OWL and has become a standard ontology language in the semantic web community. OWL-DL strikes a good balance between computational and expressive power requirements. It follows an object-oriented approach to describe the structure of a domain in terms of classes, their properties and semantic relationships. It offers inference capabilities through the OWL properties like inversion, symmetry and transitivity.</p><p>We used an open source platform Protégé 3.4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[50]</ref> to create our ontology since it provides a graphical interface to model ontologies in OWL-DL. Our model was based on an existing hospital ontology which is now available on the web <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[54]</ref>. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>, six individuals are created as instances of the class Patient. The asserted properties are low-level context directly entered by the user or fed by other services. For example, the ID, name, gender and vital signs can be entered by the nurse, while physical location can be detected by the RFID tracking service. This patient shows symptoms of chest pain, such as coughing, dyspnea, fatigue, and nausea, which are pre-defined in the medical ontologies and available for nurses to select. Similarly, the other asserted properties show the current activities of this patient and attending clinicians, which will likely change as this process proceeds. The inferred properties are high-level context deduced from ontology-and rulebased reasoning. For example, a hypothetical diagnosis, such as chronic heart failure, is inferred from these symptoms according to practice guidelines. Our CDSS makes recommendations about patient diagnoses and treatments based on medical guidelines as well as the clinical data. The details of rule-based reasoning are discussed Section 4.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2.">Medical domain ontologies</head><p>Medical domain ontologies are created to provide a shared understanding of concepts in specialized medical disciplines. Thus, they provide important and formal vocabularies for a CDSS. In this study, it is impossible to include every specialty in the medical domain. Hence, we adopted the already published heart failure ontology named HF_ontology <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref> in our prototype. This ontology was developed by the HEARTFAID team at University of Calabria in accordance with the guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology. It is useful for medical decision making related to heart disease.</p><p>We use the HF_ontology to infer patient conditions, diagnosis and treatment, as well as the level of severity. Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> shows a partial hierarchy of the HF_ontology. Important concepts such as patient characteristics, tests, and treatments are formally modeled and their relationships are represented as well. Treatment includes medication, device therapy, surgical therapy, patient education, etc. Medication can further be categorized into ACE inhibitor, Angiotensin receptor blocker, Beta blocker, Digoxin, Diuretics, and Spironolactone. This ontology is relatively stable and is updated when there is any change in the shared understanding of heart disease.</p><p>The concepts from the HF_ontology are integrated with our context ontology in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>. For example, patients have signs, symptoms, suggested tests, suggested treatment, etc. These constraints or attributes are captured by object properties, such as hasSigns, hasSymptoms, suggestedTest, suggestedTreatment, etc., accordingly between class Patient in the context ontology and classes Signs, Symptoms, Tests and Treatment in the HF_ontology. This model is implemented using Protégé 3.4 and encoded in OWL-DL. Although we only consider the heart failure ontology in this study, domain ontologies for other diseases can be easily incorporated in future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Semantic rules for clinical reasoning</head><p>Rules embody medical procedural knowledge and are used to help make complex clinical decisions through logical reasoning, often in real time and in response to critical events. They can also handle exceptional situations. This section discusses how semantic rules are represented and rule-based reasoning is performed. We also discuss their integration into clinical workflows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Medical rules</head><p>A clinical workflow may have thousands of rules for a variety of purposes (e.g., patient diagnosis, treatment) that are applicable in different areas of medicine (e.g., heart failure, diabetes, pediatrics, etc.). But only a small part of the rule set is triggered for a specific activity within a process instance. Managing and integrating medical knowledge in the form of rules and applying results from rule-based reasoning into a clinical pathway are important in a CDSS. We organize rules into rule categories according to the stage at which they are applied in the clinical process. To obtain these rules we consulted the American Heart Association (AHA) [5] and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref> shows a hierarchy of our rules categorized into patient evaluation, diagnosis, treatment and prescription checking. Each rule category is associated with a medical activity in a clinical pathway and contains one or more rules that represent relevant knowledge. It is further divided into sub-categories. For instance, "prescription checking" is subdivided into "allergy checking," "drug interaction checking," "dose checking," and "insurance checking." So, if a prescribed drug Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. A partial representation of the heart failure ontology. Adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>. interacts with a patient's medication, the system can propose an alternative to the doctor for approval. New rules can also be developed and added in this hierarchy. Thus, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref> serves as a guide for organizing rules systematically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Semantic rules in SWRL</head><p>We use Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref> to encode rules for user-defined reasoning. SWRL is the standard rule language for the semantic web based on OWL and RuleML. SWRL utilizes the typical logic expression "antecedent → consequent" to represent semantic rules. Both the antecedent (rule body) and the consequent (rule head) can be conjunctions of one or more atoms written as "atom 1 Λ atom 2 …Λ atom n ." If all the atoms in the antecedent are true, then the consequent must also be true. Note that the symbol Λ means conjunction; ?x stands for a variable (i.e., an instance or individual); and → means implication. The consequent part of a triggered rule can be used to update the context database, issue reminders and alerts, and more importantly, customize an ad hoc subprocess. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref> shows several example rules from different rule categories and their triggering conditions. The information embodied in these rules is provided to care professionals as recommendations to avoid deviation from clinical guidelines. Patient Evaluation Rules (PER) evaluate a patient's medical history, social background, habits, symptoms, etc. prior to a physical examination; thus, a hypothetical diagnosis can be presented to a clinician during patient examination. Patient Diagnosis Rules (PDR) evaluate a patient's signs, lab test results, other relevant medications, and provide recommendations for diagnosis decisions, such as systolic or hypertensive heart failure. Although signs and symptoms describe the same conditions, they are essentially different.</p><p>Signs are what a doctor observes (e.g., high blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythm), while symptoms are what a patient experiences (e.g., fatigue and dyspnea). Symptoms can characterize a disease and reported by a patient to a nurse; signs are usually detected and logged by a doctor during examination. Patient Treatment Rules (PTR) provide suggestions for treatments such as medications, therapy or patient education, according to the confirmed diagnosis. Prescription Checking Rules (PCR) deal with drug interactions (e.g., Carbidopa and Levodopa), dosage checking and allergy-drug effects to avoid prescription errors. For example, rule PCR1 will generate an alert message if a patient who is allergic to Aspirin is given any medication that contains Aspirin. In addition, there are other rules that concern resources such as staff, and pertain to their schedules, availability, etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3.">Semantic reasoning using Jess rule engine</head><p>The execution of SWRL rules requires the availability of a rule engine that performs reasoning using a set of rules and facts as input. Any new facts that are inferred are used as input to potentially fire more rules (i.e., forward chaining). In our implementation, we use the Jess rule engine <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref> to enable SWRL reasoning on the Protégé data set since it is small, light, and one of the fastest available. The Jess rule engine is implemented in Java and supports forward and backward chaining. It is stable, well supported, and has been successfully used by others. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref> shows the translation of ontologies and SWRL rules to enable this process. Here, SWRL rules are stored as OWL individuals with their associated knowledge base. First, SWRL rules are translated into Jess rules using a SWRLJessBridge <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>, which is a Protégé plug-in, and added to the Jess rule engine; then, the ontologies and the knowledge base are translated into Jess facts and introduced into the rule engine as well; third, the Jess rule engine enables the reasoning and produces results in the Jess format; and finally these results are translated back into the OWL format. In this figure, we have shown the format of Jess facts as well as the format of Jess rules for PTR1 from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref>. SWRL rules can be easily modeled in SWRLJessTab <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref> which is a Protégé plug-in and provides a graphical interface to interact with SWRLJessBridge. SWRLJessTab allows us to insert, remove and edit SWRL rules. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10(a)</ref> shows the implementation of rule PER1 in this editor. With the symptoms asserted by a nurse (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10(b)</ref>), this rule infers that the patient may have chronic heart failure, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10(b)</ref>. Meanwhile, another triggered PER2 rule uses results generated by PER1 to induce forward chaining and produces suggested tests as output. These results are presented to a doctor during physical examination. As this clinical process proceeds other rules may be triggered as more data is asserted into the knowledge base. For example, signs are asserted by the doctor and lab test results are asserted by lab staff. Accordingly, treatments are recommended, such as ACE inhibitor and Beta blocker medication.</p><p>In this example, rule-based reasoning is conducted recursively, which means that a rule can use the results of another rule as input data until no rules can be fired. This process is called forward chaining and is widely used in rule-based systems. Thus, the knowledge base is kept continuously updated by the inserted facts. The results of rule-based reasoning are tightly integrated with clinical pathways and provide evidence-based decision support for clinicians through a user-friendly interface. In the next section, we discuss how the knowledge derived from SWRL rules is used to implement flexible clinical pathways.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Integration of clinical pathway and rules for flexibility</head><p>The key innovation in CONFlexFlow is the tight integration of pathways and rules to improve the operation of a CDSS, while   recognizing that at some stages in a clinical workflow the subsequent path is determined by the context. Hence, flexibility is of the essence. Actually, the decision on the next path to take is influenced by both the medical plan and the contextual information of an individual patient. The context is derived not only from the current case data, but is also based on the specific pathway that was taken to reach this point in the workflow. Here, we first give a framework for integration and then discuss our implementation in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">A framework for integration</head><p>There is an m-to-n relationship between (activity, context) on the one hand, and rules on the other. This means a certain contextual situation with regard to an activity may need the application of many rules, while a given rule may apply to many (activity, context) situations. Thus, a context where a patient is not allergic to any substance will not trigger allergy check rules, and similarly if a patient does not carry insurance, an insurance check is omitted. Some examples of these "(Activity, Context) → Rules" are:</p><p>(Medication, allergic) → allergy check rule(s) (Admission, broken leg) → wheel chair check rule(s) (Admission, emergency) → emergency procedure rule(s) (Revaluation, overweight) → diet recommendation rule(s) Hence, if a patient exhibits allergies to some drug during the medication activity, then an allergy check is needed. At the admission time, if there is an emergency then a different admission procedure from the normal one is followed. But clearly, at admission time we do not need to check whether the patient has an allergy. Thus, only a small set of rules related to a specific activity should be triggered before the activity is executed according to the current context.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref> presents our proposed methodology for integrating context and rules to design a customized subprocess at runtime. The main idea is that after relevant rules are extracted based on the (context, activity) combination as discussed above, they are fired to determine the execution semantics for the isolated activities contained in the loosely coupled composite activity. Thus, a subprocess fragment is generated and executed as the subsequent pathway for the currently running process instance. 5.2. Designing a flexible clinical workflow using BPMN 2.0 BPMN 2.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref> not only defines a standard for how to graphically represent a process model, but also includes execution semantics for the defined elements. It uses an XML format to store and share process definitions. This new standard provides a large variety of node types including events, activities, gateways, etc. Specifically, we use human task, rule task, reusable subprocess and ad hoc subprocess frequently in our implementation. Their semantics have been introduced earlier. A human task is very useful for modeling clinical scenarios since most medical activities cannot be completely automated, but instead require a lot of user interaction. The recommendations and reminders are presented to clinicians through a user friendly interface. A reusable subprocess refers to those strictly defined processes that can be reused in many scenarios, such as ECG and X-ray process. Moreover, we use an ad hoc subprocess to realize our notion of workflow flexibility because it allows context-aware customization of a loosely defined composite activity.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref> shows such a BPMN 2.0 workflow model for treating heart diseases and it is implemented using Drools-Flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>. We make medical plans or protocols, which are originally presented in flow charts or plain text, executable through workflow modeling. An example of such guidelines for treating heart attack patients is presented in Appendix A. This process has several human tasks, e.g., "Physical examination" and "Diagnosis," which require interaction with clinicians. Clinical data is obtained from human tasks by user input and is then accessible to the workflow engine. In particular, we have four ad hoc subprocesses (ASP) for composite activities to be customized at runtime.  ASP1," "Medication-ASP3," and "Therapy-ASP4" are three composite activities that contain a number of atomic activities, while "Treatment-ASP2" is a nested ASP with other ASPs nested inside it. Whether the contained activities will be executed, and if so in what order they are executed, is unknown at design time. For example, "Do tests-ASP1" refers to the set of scheduling and testing activities that are likely to follow the doctor's examination. But, it is not possible to predict what tests the doctor will prescribe until the patient is examined. Similarly, the therapy activity is loosely defined and it may include Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) depending upon the diagnosis. Hence, the execution semantics for instantiating an ASP are only known when this node is reached. A concretely defined subprocess will be produced dynamically based on the new data inserted into the context base. Similarly, the procedure for patient treatment depends on her test results, further diagnosis and medical history.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Workflow engine-Drools-Flow 5.2</head><p>We used an open source tool, Drools-Flow 5.2 (also known as jBPM5) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>, as the workflow engine. It implements most element types defined in BPMN 2.0, and allows us to execute the clinical process in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>. In addition, we used Drools-Expert <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>, which is essentially a rule engine, as a complementary tool to support the rerouting of subsequent pathways. Fig. <ref type="figure">13</ref> shows the CONFlexFlow implementation using the Drools framework.</p><p>We created a stateful knowledge session that will load required BPMN process models and the Drools rule files into the production memory at runtime. In this study, we have the heart failure process (i.e., HeartFailureProcess.BPMN), ECG process (i.e., ECGProcess.BPMN), and some other medical processes in BPMN files. Besides, heart failure rerouting rules (i.e., HeartFailureReroutingRules.drl) are loaded to demonstrate workflow flexibility. Drools rule files have a .drl (Drools Rules Language) extension. The Drools workflow engine manages the status of process instances along with their associated data. The Drools rule engine is informed about processes by inserting their current state into the working memory. On the other hand, the actions determined by the Jess rule engine for the current process instance are passed to the workflow engine through the working memory.</p><p>In the Drools framework, Drools-Expert is a forward chaining inference engine that implements an enhanced and extended RETE algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>, called ReteOO. It will then be able to derive the next steps taking Drools rules and processes into account jointly. If a part of the process needs to be executed, the rule engine will request the workflow engine to execute that step. This can be done easily since the process engine is equipped with a WorkingMemoryEventListener (WMEL) that "listens" for any events sent from the rule engine. Once the current step is completed, the process engine returns control to Drools-Expert to again derive the next step. The Drools implementation gives the control to the rule engine to decide and notify the workflow engine of what step(s) to do next. Thus, the Drools rules allow us to alter process behavior dynamically.</p><p>The Drools workflow engine comes with several event listeners for responding to different types of events. For example, upon triggering a signalEvent the WMEL listener can activate any event or activity in the running process instance. Event related data can be passed from the parent process to a subprocess or activity as well. The ProcessEventListener "listens" for events from current instances, such as beforeNodeTriggered, beforeProcessStarted and afterProcessStarted. They provide real time updates on process status and are widely used to support medical tasks. For example, after the human task node "Physical Examination" is triggered, the system gets results from medical reasoning rules and prepares the data to be shown to clinicians. The AgendaEventListener is aware of rule creation, activation, firing, etc. The Drools rules can be updated (i.e., inserted or deleted) in the production memory at runtime, and such events should be captured by the system to provide a response.</p><p>The Agenda manages the execution order of conflicting rules using the conflict resolution strategy. The default strategies employed by Drools are salience and LIFO (Last in, First out). We use salience to specify the priority of rules, and the one with the higher salience value is preferred. In addition, we use a ruleflow-group to associate a set of Drools rules to a rule task or an ad hoc subprocess. Any rule has the attribute ruleflow-group with the same name as the activity that will be triggered before the activity node is activated. The workflow process will immediately continue with the next node if it encounters a ruleflow-group where there are no active rules at that point. To allow clinicians to interact with clinical process instances, we use the web-based process management console provided by Drools. They can input clinical data that will be used in the subsequent pathways.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Customizing an ad hoc subprocess at runtime</head><p>Next, we show how to realize the execution semantics for an ad hoc subprocess at runtime. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">14</ref> shows the representation of the ad hoc subprocess "Treatment-ASP2" in BPMN 2.0 XML. It is nested with two other ASPs "Medication-ASP3" and "Therapy-ASP4", which must be carried out in sequence, while the activities within these two ad hoc subprocesses occur in parallel. This is specified using the attribute ordering. A subprocess is completed when there is no active instance running (i.e., specified by the attribute completionCondition). We can see that for an ad hoc subprocess, there is no connection between containing nodes (i.e., activities) thus their execution order is not known at design time. There can be a number of execution semantics for connecting these nodes and they are specified in a rule group with the same name (i.e., "Treatment-ASP2"). The activation of rule groups is maintained by the Agenda and the workflow engine is notified of rule activation by the AgendaEventListener (see Fig. <ref type="figure">13</ref>).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">15</ref> shows sample rules associated with their ad hoc subprocess (comment lines start with //). The first rule R1 is associated with the "Treatment-ASP2" subprocess, since they belong to ruleflow-group "Treatment-ASP2". This rule shows that therapy and medication will only be carried out when a patient needs thrombus (or blood clot) breaking. Similarly, R2 and R3 belong to the "Medication-ASP3" activity. Rule "R2-General Medication" will always be triggered but it will assign different medications (i.e., ACE inhibitor or ARB) depending on whether the patient is intolerant of ACE inhibitor. R3 will prescribe statins (or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) when a patient has high Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL). R2 is given a higher priority than R3 by using the salience attribute since ACE inhibitor or ARB medication should be given first to heart failure patients to control their blood pressure, treat heart failure and prevent strokes. Our implementation has more such rules for handling different kinds of scenarios.</p><p>In this way, a variety of scenarios can be created for an ad hoc subprocess according to different contexts. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">16(a)</ref> shows the process log generated by Drools when the workflow model in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref> is instantiated for a specific patient who needs thrombus breaking, is not intolerant of ACE inhibitor and shows signs of high LDL, etc. It reflects the operational semantics for the ASP "Do-tests-ASP1" and "Treatment-ASP2" in a particular context. The visualization of the actual pathway for treating this patient (i.e., "Treatment-ASP2") is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">16(b)</ref>. More complicated workflow patterns can be modeled and instantiated in this approach as well.    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>Above we have described a novel and practical framework CONFlexFlow for designing a clinical context and guideline integrated CDSS. We argue that flexible integration of CDSS with a clinical workflow is a key to its success. Moreover, semantic web technologies like OWL can help to create ontologies that are exchangeable across various healthcare departments and organizations. This promotes the understanding of medical knowledge across different providers and also enables sharing and extensibility. Thus, one provider can import an existing ontology and extend it further without having to reinvent the wheel. This approach is formal, yet also flexible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Results of ontology analysis</head><p>The clinical context model is developed following a formal methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>. First, we enumerated healthcare use cases and checks on existing ontologies. Then, we defined the five top-level classes and 43 sub-classes in the hierarchy. The third step involved creating all the properties for the existing classes, including 47 object properties and 106 datatype properties. Their domain and range were then defined accordingly. Next, 126 restrictions were created for all the classes to enrich the ontology semantically. When the ontology schema was completed, we added 30 patients, 25 hospital personnel, 40 assets, and 40 locations as test cases. Our implementation is available on the web <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[54]</ref> for further extension.</p><p>To validate our model, we installed Pellet Reasoner Plug-in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref> for Protégé 3.4. This tool can check an OWL-encoded ontology for inconsistencies and infer new instances or classes. After each iteration of ontology development, we ran Pellet against the ontology to check its validity and revised it if any inconsistency or redundancy existed. The final result showed that our context ontology was valid in terms of logical consistency, concept satisfaction and classification. In our knowledge base, we also include the heart failure ontology developed by the HEARTFAID team <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>. This ontology contains more than 200 classes, 100 properties, and 1000 individuals. Note that for now we only focus on the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure patients based on context information. Of course, other medical domain ontologies can also be integrated into our model in a similar way. Reusing mature existing medical ontologies can make the model more complete for real environments.</p><p>Based on these ontologies, we developed 18 SWRL rules for describing heart failure procedural knowledge. They include the detection, diagnosis and treatment of chronic heart failure, systolic heart failure, hypertensive heart failure, etc. The Jess rule engine is used to automate the reasoning process. We aim to add more semantic rules in the future to cover more complete medical knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Contributions, success factors and KPIs</head><p>Another contribution of this work is the tight integration of flexible clinical pathways with medical decision support. Our study differs from contemporary workflow modeling approaches in the following ways: (1) we use a standard process modeling language BPMN 2.0 to model the care processes. It provides rich semantics (e.g., human task, rule task and subprocess) for modeling clinical activities and coordinates interactions among various healthcare entities; (2) clinical processes are strictly defined in the overall structure, yet some knowledge intensive activities are loosely defined using ad hoc subprocesses. The actual execution semantics are triggered by the clinical context that is derived from previous medical tasks and the current environment. This contextual information is only available at runtime and is unique for each individual patient. In addition, an ad hoc subprocess can be nested to handle complicated, dynamic scenarios; and (3) the decision support provided during patient encounters is based on formal context and medical ontologies that are aligned with clinical guidelines. Thus, we can ensure the correctness of medical recommendations.</p><p>Many studies have discussed the factors leading to successful CDSS implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">49]</ref>. The most critical factors are: (1) capture of evidence in machine-interpretable knowledge base; (2) computerized decision support instead of paper-based; (3) timely advice; (4) workflow integration; (5) response to user needs; (6) maintenance and extension; and (7) clinical effects and costs. Our CONFlexFlow framework has covered most of these aspects but the evaluation of our system in terms of user satisfaction is out of the scope of this paper. A key objective in developing and implementing such a system is to improve quality as reflected in concrete measures. Although detailed discussion of quality is beyond the scope of the current work, some key measures of quality (KPIs) for our purposes are: number of treatment errors because of drug interactions (or allergies), number of diagnosis errors, number of cases of treatment not covered by patient's insurance, number of treatment failures for lack of available resources, complication rate per patient, patient satisfaction, etc. These metrics will inform the evaluation of the impact of the proposed system. One way to use these metrics is by means of a post hoc audit. For example, we can compare the number of treatment errors from drug interactions after the CDSS is in place versus the corresponding number before installing such a system by examining the patient log over two different periods of equal lengths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>The goal of this research is to study new approaches for designing clinical decision support systems. We proposed a framework called CONFlexFlow, and showed how flexible and adaptable clinical pathways can be designed taking into account medical knowledge in the form of rules and contextual information to achieve a high quality outcome. A clinical workflow charts a path for a patient through the various steps in interacting with a PCP's office, lab, pharmacy and other participants in the process of patient care. These pathways are selected during workflow execution based on rules that encapsulate medical knowledge and patient conditions that are constantly changing. The ontologies described in this paper were implemented in Protégé 3.4. Furthermore, we developed a proof of concept prototype using the Drools framework.</p><p>Although we use SWRL rules to model medical knowledge, we further plan to use a mapping mechanism to make the knowledge convertible between an Arden-like syntax and SWRL to make our approach more acceptable in the medical domain. Next, we plan to enhance the current prototype and test it in a practical environment using the proposed quality metrics. An audit of past errors without a CDSS, and errors under the CDSS operation, can reveal the improvement realized from the new system. Other issues of interest are, how to create a contextual summary automatically for a doctor based on a patient's record, and how to allow a doctor to customize her alert settings so the alerts are useful but not distracting.</p><p>Thus, the proposed research poses several technical challenges and promises many benefits to the healthcare community at a time when costs are running out of control. It can lead to better, "smarter" routing of clinical workflows by applying rules with a deeper understanding of context. Moreover, various kinds of alerts can help to reduce the incidence of treatment errors and lead to improved patient safety. Finally, better and quicker recommendations can be generated at various decision points.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig.2represents a meta-model that describes the semantic relationships among key concepts used in CONFlexFlow. It also introduces some of the terminology used in this paper.Clinical workflows are composed of activities performed by roles or participants. Rules are derived from clinical guidelines and use medical ontologies for clinical reasoning. Semantically related rules are categorized into rule groups. A rule group can be associated with one or more workflow activities and it is automatically triggered when the activity node is reached. The data required to evaluate the rule conditions is modeled as a context, which captures all entities that have an impact on the clinical practice. It has subclasses, low-and high-level context. Low-level context is explicit and is directly collected from user inputs or other through data sources like medical sensors. Examples of such context are: patient name, physical location, body temperature, etc. They are used to deduce high-level, implicit context, e.g. about patient diagnoses, by rule-based reasoning. Rules are triggered by contextual data and produce actions, which are generally in the form of reminders, alerts, and recommendations. They can provide evidence-based suggestions for medical decision making within atomic and composite activities.We employ a variety of BPMN 2.0 elements (see Fig.3) for modeling a flexible clinical workflow. An atomic activity is indivisible and is used</figDesc></figure>
