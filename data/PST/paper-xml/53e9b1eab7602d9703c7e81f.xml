<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this contribution the authors show how the extended Kalman filter (EKF), used as an observer for nonlinear discrete-time systems or extended Kalman observer (EKO), becomes a useful state estimator when the arbitrary matrices, namely R R R k k k and Q Q Q k k k in the paper, are adequately chosen. As a first step, they use the linearization technique in [4] which consists of introducing unknown diagonal matrices to take the approximation errors into account. It is shown that the decreasing Lyapunov function condition leads to a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem, which points out the connection between a good convergence behavior of the EKO and the instrumental matrices R R R k k k and Q Q Q k k k . In order to satisfy the obtained LMI, a particular design of Q Q Q k k k is given.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Observer design for nonlinear continuous-time systems has received particular attention in the last few years. Most of the proposed techniques are based on coordinate changes to bring the original system into canonical forms which, in general, necessitate conservative assumptions; therefore, only a restricted class of nonlinear systems can be dealt with. However, when these conditions are satisfied, global and exponential convergence are ensured; we have in mind the recent work of Deza et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and Gauthier et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Few efforts, however, have been done to design state observers for nonlinear discrete-time systems. Recent results show that the use of simultaneous nonlinear equations may improve the local convergence significantly <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>An alternative approach for state observers design that can be applied to a large class of nonlinear continuous and/or discrete-time systems consists of using approximate models. No doubt, one of the most popular techniques is the celebrated extended Kalman observer (EKO). If the convergence mechanisms in the linear case are well understood by now, the stability analysis is far from being solved when nonlinear models are considered. The main results in this field were developed earlier by Deyst et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, Baras et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and well clarified by Song et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In particular, it was shown that, under the observability rank condition, boundedness of the error "covariance" matrix P k is assured. This strong property will be exploited later in our developments. Using a nice transformation technique, Moraal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> set up how the Newton observer is related to the extended Kalman filter (EKF) (see also the work of Bell et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>).</p><p>In order to improve stability and rate of convergence, slight modifications of the standard EKF were recently performed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Based on the incremental norm approach, Fromion et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> proposed a globally exponentially stable and bounded modified EKF while Reif et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> have shown that the introduction of a fictitious additive term of instability in the Riccati equation may significantly increase performances of the EKF.</p><p>In a recent paper, Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> have shown through numerical examples that for a particular design of the error covariance matrix they obtain efficient results with the EKF applied to the Friedland's algorithm. Few theoretical developments, however, were established while a large number of design parameters have to be selected.</p><p>It should be noticed that the influence of the arbitrary matrices R k and Q k on the convergence mechanisms of the EKO was neglected in most of the works established by now. Indeed, when the above matrices are arbitrarily chosen, in general R k = Ip and Q k = In with 0 ; 1, the EKO fails to converge if it is not initialized closely enough to the actual states.</p><p>Our interest in this problem is, in fact, motivated by the encouraging results recently developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Only the influence of R k , while Q k is setting to zero, on the EKO behavior was analyzed. On the other hand, a large class of nonlinear systems may be considered, under weak conditions, for stability and without the need of coordinate changes.</p><p>The aim of this contribution is to relax sufficient conditions established in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and to analyze in depth the role of both instrumental matrices mentioned above in studying their connection with behavior of the EKO. The technique that we propose here consists of first introducing unknown diagonal matrices to quantify linearization errors. With the aid of the Lyapunov approach, we show that the stability analysis of the EKO comes to solving a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem where R k and Q k play a central role to improve the convergence of the EKO. The design of the above matrix is given so that strong tracking, under the observability rank condition, of the observer is assured even if the state error vector belongs to a very large convex compact set. In order to illustrate the accuracy and high performances of the modified EKO two numerical examples, which can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, under bad initial conditions are provided.</p></div>

However, in order to ensure lim k!1 (x k 0 xk ) = 0, we need to introduce the local observability condition (44) to assure that P k is a bounded matrix from above and below (see Remark 3-2) with <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>). Indeed, since V k is a strictly decreasing sequence and P k is a bounded matrix, it follows that (50)</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">(1 0 ) F k P k F T k + Q k (F T k )(P k )(F k ) 1=2<label>(</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_30">0 x T k xk V k (1 0 ) k V0 (<label>48</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_31">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_32">) 0 lim k!1 xT k xk lim k!1 (V k ) V 0 lim k!1 (1 0 ) k = 0<label>(</label></formula><p>Therefore, convergence of the error dynamics to zero follows.

Indeed, we notice that when x k 6 = xk , the term e T k e k in Q k and then the upper bound</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">(1 0 ) F k P k F T k + Q k (F T k )(P k )(F k ) 1=2</formula><p>is large, the value on the nonlinearities of f u (x k ), hu (x k ) and the arbitrary positive scalar and consequently we may enlarge the attraction domain. On the other hand, when x k to xk , i.e., k and k decrease to one and zero, respectively, the term e T k e k goes to zero and the proposed observer becomes the classical EKO.</p><p>In the same way, the choice of R k is also important. Indeed, it is easy to verify that the choice proposed in both examples, i.e., R k+1 = H k+1 P k+1=k H T k+1 + I p , where is a positive scalar fixed by the user, may enlarge the interval</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">0 (R k+1 ) H k+1 P k+1=k H T k+1 + R k+1 ; (R k+1 ) H k+1 P k+1=k H T k+1 + R k+1</formula><p>in order to satisfy (34).</p><p>2) The relation between the N-observability rank condition (44)</p><p>and the observability of the linearized system along the EKO's trajectory is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> in the case of uncontrolled nonlinear systems. We notice that when inputs are handled, the observability properties of both the original system and the linearized system along the EKO's trajectory become inputdependent so we have to introduce the concept of uniform observability as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, if conditions (44) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_28">45</ref>) are verified, the linearized system along the EKO's trajectory is locally uniformly observable, and therefore there exist positive real numbers 1 and 2 so that for all k N 0 1 we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">1 I n O T e (k 0 N + 1; k) diag R 01 k0N+1 ; 111 ; R 01 k 1 Oe(k 0 N + 1; k) 2In<label>(52)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">O e (k 0 N + 1; k) = H k0N+1 H k0N+2 F k0N+1 1 1 H k F k01 F k02 1 11 F k0N+1 :</formula><p>Under uniform observability condition (52), the boundedness of the covariance matrix P k follows from <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>3) We notice that in practice, the local uniform observability of system (1a) and (1b) may be checked by a literal validation of condition (44) using derivatives of fu (x k ) and hu (x k )</p><p>or at least by a numerical rank test on the observability matrix Oe(k 0 N + 1; k) given in (52).</p><p>4) The study proposed by Deza et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> concerns the class of nonlinear multi-input/single-output systems affine in the input. They use a nonlinear change of coordinates to bring the system into a canonical form. This transformation needs strong assumptions under which global and exponential stability is guaranteed. The approach that we consider here concerns a large class of nonlinear multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) systems, under weak conditions and not necessarily affine in the input, but only local asymptotic convergence is ensured.</p><p>It should be noticed that the examples proposed in our paper cannot be treated by the approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. We also have in mind the problem of combined states and parameters estimation.</p></div>

An accurate choice is R k+1 = 0:1H k+1 P k+1=k H T k+1 + 10 03 I2 and Q k = 10 10 e T k e k I5 + 10 03 I5:</p><p>The initial conditions for the observer and the system are taken as The input signals are u 1k = 350 cos(0:03k) and u 2k = 300 sin(0:03k).</p><p>Example 2: The second numerical example concerns the famous bearings-only measurement problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> for which special observer structure forms were introduced in order to enhance the convergence behavior of the EKF. It should be noticed that for a rigorous comparison with the approaches developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, extension of the proposed technique to stochastic models will be the topic of the next paper.</p><p>A two-dimensional discrete-time model is described as follows:</p><p>x 1k+1 = x 1k + hx 3k 0 0:5h 2 u 1k x 2k+1 = x 2k + hx 4k 0 0:5h 2 u 2k x 3k+1 = x 3k 0 hu 1k x 4k+1 = x 4k 0 hu 2k y k = tan 01 x 2k</p><p>x 1k where x 1k ; x 2k and x 3k ; x 4k denote target positions and velocities at time instant k, respectively, and u T k = (u 1k u 2k ) is the twodimensional missile acceleration used as the control vector. h = 5 ms is the sampling period. The guidance law u k <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is used to generate nominal trajectories from which the observer performances are tested. We suppose that, starting with a constant speed, the target adopts a new constant velocity trajectory, to avoid the missile for example, after 4 s. By this abrupt change (that can be seen as a perturbation), we want to test if the modified EKO remains to be a convergent observer. The plots confirm our findings that with a relevant choice of instrumental matrices Q k and R k , the modified EKO remains extremely robust not only when observer initializations are very far from the actual values (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">3</ref>) but also when abrupt changes in the  target speed occur (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">3</ref>) while the usual EKO fails to converge.</p><p>This approach has also been successfully applied to several examples treated in the literature even with initializations outside the physically feasible set of initial values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>From the above study we point out that design of R k , and more particularly Q k , makes the EKO one of the efficient techniques for state estimation of a large class of MIMO nonlinear discretetime systems. Perhaps the main feature in this paper is that weak conditions, in comparison with those established in the literature, are needed to ensure asymptotic convergence without the need of any preliminary transformations. Furthermore, few parameters have to be selected in order to design the above matrices; this has the advantage of easy implementation in real time applications. Finally, the proposed technique was successfully applied to a large number of numerical examples treated in the literature, and two of them are detailed in this paper.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>R</head><label></label><figDesc>k and Q k so that the proposed modified EKO can tolerate, for example, very bad initial conditions. The aim, in what follows, is to determine conditions for which fV k g k=1; 111 is a decreasing sequence taking k and k+1 into account. This problem returns, in fact, to show what limitations are in using the EKO and at the same time the influence of R k and Q k on the convergence behavior. Next, from (3) and (6), we have K k+1 = P k+1 H</figDesc></figure>

Remark 2: 1) Most certainly, (34) and (35) cannot be checked (in the global sense) before the process is started, since the parameters ik and jk are unknown; however, a qualitative analysis from the sufficient conditions (34) and (35) is of great interest since they determine domains to which ik and jk should belong so that V k is a decreasing sequence. At the same time we point out the role of the arbitrary matrices R k and Q k to satisfy (34) and (35) and consequently to enlarge the attraction domain. For example, one intuitive idea consists of setting, in particular, the matrix Q k sufficiently large so that (35) is satisfied. This means that the proposed state observer can tolerate arbitrary large initial state estimation errors, i.e., k and k+1 may be large and not necessarily very close to identity matrices. On the other hand, it should be noticed that as long as (34) and (35) are satisfied, xk converges to x k and consequently k and k+1 go to identity matrices. Along this reasoning, we propose in the following a relevant design of R k and Q k to make the EKO a useful state estimator. 2) Now let us give some remarks on how to put in practice the proposed modified EKO. It is reasonable to assume, from the local property inherent to the used state observer, that the unknown parameters ik and jk are bounded. Moreover, the upper bounds k and k [used in (34) and (35)] may be estimated before the process is started. Indeed, in practice, we have in general a reasonable estimation of the state vector of the physical process to be observed (for example, concentrations in chemical reactors, fluxes, and speed in induction motors, . . .) and by the use of the analytic functions h u (:) and f u (:) of the system we can evaluate k and k . As we mentioned before, with a relevant design of R k and Q k that ensures (34) and (35), in particular when the algorithm starts, xk converges to x k ; consequently k and k+1 go to identity matrices, or equivalently k and k decrease to one and zero, respectively.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Consider the single-input/single-output linear time-invariant (SISO LTI) system shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The plant is assumed to be composed of two fixed proper transfer functions, P 1 and P 2 , and it is assumed that there exists at least one proper internally stabilizing LTI controller C. The disturbance d is assumed to be generated by filtering white noise of unity power spectral density (PSD) through the LTI filter KF , where K is a scaling parameter and F is the stable transfer function as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Variance has useful interpretations in many engineering applications. For example, there is an empirical relationship between the variance of acceleration and the comfort of passengers in airplanes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In terms of the closed-loop transfer function from d to y, G 1 = P 2 H=(1 + P 1 P 2 C), the output variance is</p><p>To ensure that the variance is finite, it is assumed throughout that G 2 RH1, i.e., G is a stable proper transfer function. Note that the quantity in (2) also has deterministic interpretations as (the square of) the L2 to L1 gain and, assuming the white noise signal is replaced with an impulse, as the energy of y.</p><p>The problem addressed in this paper is to investigate the following questions.</p><p>Q1: How does disturbance rejection performance vary with ! b and K?</p><p>Q2: How can disturbance rejection robustness be quantified? Q3: Are there fundamental limitations on disturbance rejection robustness? Q4: Is there a tradeoff between nominal and robust disturbance rejection?</p><p>Q5: Can C be designed to achieve a desired level of disturbance rejection robustness? The five questions are considered in, respectively, Sections II-VI, and conclusions are provided in Section VII. For brevity, proofs are omitted but can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. THE V -TRANSFORM</head><p>Although expression ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) provides an answer to Question Q1, a more useful formula relating the output variance to the uncertain disturbance model parameters can be derived using the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. where L 0 is the observability Gramian of (C; A), i.e., the unique solution to A T L 0 + L 0 A + C T C = 0.</p><p>Note that only a single Lyapunov equation has to be solved to determine the output variance for all ! b and K. It is convenient to denote the variance expression in (3) by V (KG)(! b ), i.e., explicitly show the dependence of the output variance on G, ! b , and K. The "V " denotes "variance," and we refer to V (KG) as the "Vtransform" of KG since it transforms KG, a function of !, into V (KG), a function of ! b . This definition depends on the structure of F , but since that structure is restricted to (1) here, this dependence is not explicitly shown. It is possible to prove that, for any G 2 RH1 and K &gt; 0, V (KG) is an analytic, nonnegative, and bounded function of ! b (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). 0018-9286/99$10.00 © 1999 IEEE</p></div>			</div>
