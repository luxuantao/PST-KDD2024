<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Spatial reasoning can be defined as the domain of spatial knowledge representation, in particular spatial relations between spatial entities, and of reasoning on these entities and relations. This field has been largely developed in artificial intelligence, in particular using qualitative representations based on logical formalisms. In image interpretation and computer vision, it is much less developed and is mainly based on quantitative representations. A typical example in this domain concerns modelbased structure recognition in images. The model constitutes a description of the scene where objects have to be recognized. This description can be of iconic type, as for instance a digital map or a digital anatomical atlas, or of symbolic type, as linguistic descriptions of the main structures. The model can be attached to a specific scene, the typical example being a digital map used for recognizing structures in an aerial or satellite image of a specific region. It can also be more generic, as an anatomical atlas, which is a schematic representation that can be used for recognizing structures in a medical image of any person. In both types of descriptions (iconic and symbolic), objects are usually described through some characteristics like shape, size, appearance in the images, etc. But this is generally not enough to discriminate all objects in the scene, in particular if they are embedded in a complex environment. For instance in a magnetic resonance image of the brain, several internal structures appear as smooth shapes with similar grey levels, making their individual recognition difficult. Similar examples can be found in other application domains. In such cases, spatial relationships play a crucial role, and it is important to include them in the model in order to guide the recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The importance of spatial relationships has been similarly recognized in many different works. Many authors have stressed the importance of topological relationships, but distances and directional relative position are also important. Freeman <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> distinguishes the following primitive relationships: left of, right of, above, below, behind, in front of, near, far, inside, outside, surround. Kuipers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> considers topological relations (set relations, but also adjacency which was not considered by <ref type="bibr">Freeman)</ref> and metrical relations (distances and directional relative position). In this paper, we will consider all these relations.</p><p>Moreover, imprecision has to be taken into account in such problems. Imprecision is often inherent to images, and its causes can be found at several levels: observed phenomenon (imprecise limits between structures or objects), acquisition process (limited resolution, numerical reconstruction methods), image processing steps (imprecision induced by a filtering procedure for instance). This may induce imprecision on the objects to be recognized (due to the absence of strong contours or to a rough segmentation). But imprecision can be found also in semantics of some relationships (such as 'left of', 'quite far', etc.), or in the type of knowledge available about the structures (for instance anatomical textbooks describe the caudate nucleus as 'an internal brain structure which is very close to the lateral ventricles') or even in the type of question we would like to answer (in mobile robotics for instance, we may want a robot 'go towards an object while remaining at some security distance of it').</p><p>In summary, the main ingredients in problems related to spatial reasoning include knowledge representation (including spatial relationships), imprecision representation and management, fusion of heterogeneous information and decision-making. Fuzzy set theory is of great interest to provide a consistent mathematical framework for all these aspects. It allows to represent imprecision of objects, relationships, knowledge and aims, it provides a flexible framework for information fusion as well as powerful tools for reasoning and decision-making.</p><p>The aim of this paper is to review the main approaches for modeling spatial relationships under imprecision in the fuzzy set framework. We distinguish between relationships that are mathematically well defined and relationships that are intrinsically vague. Topological relationships (such as set relationships and adjacency) and distances belong to the first class. If the objects are precisely defined, their relationships can be defined and computed in a numerical (purely quantitative) setting. But if the objects are imprecise, as is often the case if they are extracted from images, then the semi-quantitative framework of fuzzy sets proved to be useful for their representation, as spatial fuzzy sets. Definitions of relationships have then to be extended to be applicable on fuzzy objects. Results can also be semi-quantitative, and provided in the form of intervals or fuzzy numbers. Some metric relationships, like relative directional position, belong to the second class. Even for crisp objects, fuzzy definitions are then appropriate.</p><p>Section 2 contains some preliminaries about spatial fuzzy sets, some basic definitions, and general principles to extend a crisp relation to a fuzzy one. Set theoretical relationships (intersection and inclusion) are described in Section 3. Then, other topological relations (local such as neighborhood or more global such as adjacency) are addressed in Section 4. Distances are reviewed in Section 5 and finally directional relative position in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Preliminaries</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Spatial fuzzy sets</head><p>Let S be the image space, typically Z 2 or Z 3 for digital 2D or 3D images, or, in the continuous case, R 2 or R 3 : A spatial fuzzy set (or fuzzy image object) is a fuzzy set defined on S. Its membership function m represents the imprecision in the spatial extent of the object. For any point x of S (pixel or voxel), m(x) is the degree to which x belongs to the fuzzy object. As usual in the fuzzy set community, and for the sake of simplicity, m will denote both the fuzzy set and its membership function. Using fuzzy sets may represent different types of imprecision, either on the boundary of the objects (due for instance to some partial volume effect or to the spatial resolution), or on their individual variability, etc. In the sequel, F denotes the set of all fuzzy sets defined on S.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Notations and basic definitions</head><p>We recall here a few basic definitions for the sake of completeness and introduce some notations. A complete description of fuzzy set theory can be found in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. From m 2F; some particular crisp (binary) sets can be derived, such as its core: CoreðmÞZ fx 2S; mðxÞZ 1g; its support: SuppðmÞZ fx 2S; mðxÞO 0g; its a-cuts (for a2]0,1]): m a ðxÞZ fx 2S; mðxÞR ag:</p><p>A fuzzy number is a convex upper semi-continuous (and unimodal) fuzzy set on R C having a bounded support.</p><p>A few basic operators on membership values will be used in the following, such as t-norrns, t-conorms and complementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. A t-norm is an operator t from [0,1]![0,1] into [0,1] which is commutative, associative, increasing in both variables and that admits 1 as unit element. It represents a conjunction and generalizes intersection and logical 'and'. Typical examples are min(a, b), ab, max(aC bK1, 0), the last one being known as the Lukasiewicz t-norm. A t-conorm is an operator T from [0,1]![0,1] into [0,1] which is commutative, associative, increasing in both variables and that admits 0 as unit element. It represents a disjunction and generalizes union and logical 'or'. Typical examples are max(a, b), aCbKab, min(aCb, 1), the last one being the Lukasiewicz t-conorm. A complementation is an operator c from [0,1] into [0,1] which is strictly decreasing, involutive, and such that c(0)Z1, c(1)Z0. The most used complementation is defined as ca2[0,1], c(a)Z1Ka. From a t-norm t and a complementation c a dual t-conorm T can be derived as </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">c(a,b)2[0,1]![0,1], T(a, b)Zc(t(c(a), c(b))). A strictly monotonous Archime- dian t-norm is a t-norm t such that ca2[0,1], t(a,a)!a and c(a,b,b 0 )2[0,1] 3 , b!b 0 0t(a,b)!t(a,b 0 ).</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">(for instance if R B is a distance), or R B (X, Y)2[0,1]</formula><p>. The aim of this paper is to extend spatial relationships to the fuzzy case, i.e. to relationships between two fuzzy sets. We will denote by R the extension of R B to fuzzy sets.</p><p>Several definitions in this paper are based on mathematical morphology <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and its extension to fuzzy sets, and more precisely on dilation and erosion. In the crisp case, the dilation D B (X) of a set X by a structuring element B (a subset of S) is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">D B ðXÞ Z fx 2S; Xh B x s;g;<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where B x denotes the translation of B at x. The erosion E B (X) of a set X by a structuring element B is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">E B ðXÞ Z fx 2S; B x 4Xg:<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Dilation and erosion are dual operators:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">E B (X)ZD B (X C ) C</formula><p>where X C denotes the complement of X in S: Applying successively dilation (respectively erosion) by the same structuring element n times will be denoted by D n B ðXÞ (respectively E n B ðXÞ). If B is a ball of radius n of the Euclidean distance in S (or of a digital distance), then the dilation and the erosion by B are simply denoted by D n (X) and E n (X).</p><p>Several definitions of fuzzy mathematical morphology have been proposed in the literature during the last decade. Here, we just give an example, chosen for its nice properties with respect to classical morphology, where dilation and erosion of a fuzzy set m by a structuring element n are, respectively, defined, for all x 2S; by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> D n ðmÞðxÞ Z supft½nðy K xÞ; mðyÞ; y 2Sg;</p><p>E n ðmÞðxÞ Z inffT½cðnðy K xÞÞ; mðyÞ; y 2Sg;</p><p>where t is a t-norm and T the associated t-conorm with respect to the complementation c. Applying successively dilation (respectively erosion) n times by the same structuring element n will be denoted by D n n ðmÞ (respectively E v n ðmÞ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Constructing fuzzy relations from crisp relations</head><p>Common and generic methods that can be used for defining a fuzzy relationship from its equivalent binary (crisp) one can be categorized into three main classes. The first type relies on the 'extension principle', as introduced by Zadeh <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The second class relies on computation on a-cuts. These two classes of definitions explicitly involve the relations on crisp sets. The third class of methods consists in providing directly fuzzy definitions of the relationships, by substituting all crisp expressions by their fuzzy equivalents.</p><p>Originally, the first generic method for extending crisp operators to fuzzy operators is due to Zadeh <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and known as the extension principle. Let us first consider a function f from U to V: Let m be a fuzzy set defined on U: The extension of f to a fuzzy set is a fuzzy set m 0 defined on V: It is constructed as follows: </p><formula xml:id="formula_7">cy2V; m 0 ðyÞ Z 0 i f f K1<label>ðyÞ</label></formula><p>This extends to the more general case where f is defined on a product space.</p><p>A typical example of application of the extension principle is the compatibility between two fuzzy sets, as defined by Zadeh <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Let us consider a fuzzy set m on some space U: The value m(x) may be interpreted as a degree of compatibility of x with the fuzzy set m <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> (m being for instance a fuzzy number). The compatibility of a fuzzy set m 0 of U with m can be evaluated using the extension principle as a fuzzy set m comp on [0,1]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ct2½0;1; m comp ðtÞ Z 0 i f m K1<label>ðtÞ</label></formula><p>Z;; sup x2UjtZmðxÞ m 0 ðxÞ otherwise:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">8 &lt; :<label>(6)</label></formula><p>This notion of compatibility has been used in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> to define directional spatial relations (see Section 6.3). One way to define crisp sets from a fuzzy set consists in taking the a-cuts of this set. Conversely, a fuzzy set can be reconstructed from its a-cuts. Therefore, a class of methods for defining fuzzy operations from crisp ones relies on the application of the crisp operation on each a-cut and then combining the results to reconstruct a fuzzy operation by stacking up the a-cuts. Let us denote by m and n the membership functions of two fuzzy sets defined on the space S: Let us now consider a relation R B between crisp sets. The fuzzy equivalent R of R B , applied to m and n, is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Rðm; nÞ Z ð 1 0 R B ðm a ; n a Þda;<label>(7)</label></formula><p>or by a double integration as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Rðm; nÞ Z ð 1 0 ð 1 0 R B ðm a ; n b Þda db:<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Other fuzzification equations are possible, like <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> Rðm; nÞ Z sup </p><p>Another method for combining the results on a-cuts is similar to the extension principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. </p><p>A last class of methods consists in translating binary equations into their fuzzy equivalent. This approach completely differs from the two previous ones in the sense that it does not use explicitly the crisp relation or operation. Indeed, in the extension principle as well as in approaches based on a-cuts, the definition of a fuzzy operation is a function of the corresponding crisp operation. Here, a fuzzy operation is given directly by an equation involving fuzzy terms, that just mimics the crisp equation. This translation is generally done term-by-term.</p><p>For instance, intersection is replaced by a t-norm, sets by fuzzy set membership functions, etc. This translation is particularly straightforward if the binary relationship can be expressed in set theoretical and logical terms. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref> summarizes the main crisp concepts involved in set equations, and their fuzzy equivalent. The many possibilities to translate for instance set union using a t-conorm induce that many definitions are issued from this method, depending on the choice of the fuzzy operators used for translating the crisp corresponding ones. Links between extension principle and combination of a-cuts using Eq. ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) have been established in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Other links exist between some definitions. For instance, if R B is a crisp relationship taking values in {0,1}, its extension using Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">12</ref>) is a value in [0,1] and is equivalent to the two fuzzification procedures given by Eqs. ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. The question of which extension should be used does not have a definite answer until now. However, it can be noted that the extension principle is well adapted for translating analytical expressions, while the formal translation method is well-adapted if the operators to be extended can be expressed using set theoretical and logical terms. The properties of the obtained extended operators have to play an important role in the choice of a method, since they may vary depending on it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Set theoretical operations</head><p>Let us start our review of fuzzy relationships by set operations. We do not consider here the point of view of constructing a fuzzy set which is the result of the combination of two fuzzy sets by a set operation, but we take another point of view, which addresses the question: are two fuzzy sets satisfying some set relationships? For instance: is m included in n? In the crisp case, such questions receive binary answers. When the objects are fuzzy, imprecisely defined, the answer to such questions becomes a matter of degree, and amounts to define a degree to which the relation is satisfied. We consider here degrees of intersection or non-intersection (corresponding to the 'outside' relation of Freeman) and degree of inclusion ('inside' relation of <ref type="bibr">Freeman)</ref>. They belong to the class of topological relations according to Kuipers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Degree of intersection</head><p>Saying that two sets intersect translates in the fuzzy case as a degree m int (m, n) to which two fuzzy sets m and n intersect. In the crisp case, the set equation expressing that two crisp subsets X and Y of S intersect is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">X h Y s; or equivalently d x 2S; x 2Xh Y:<label>(13)</label></formula><p>On the other hand, the fact that X and Y do not intersect is expressed by the non-satisfaction of this equation. These two possible states in the crisp case correspond to a binary 'degree' of intersection, which is equal to 1 if the equation is satisfied, and to 0 if it is not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">Direct extension</head><p>In the fuzzy domain, this binary degree becomes a degree in [0,1], which expresses the degree of satisfaction of this equation. It can be defined for instance using the formal translation method. The simplest fuzzy translation (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref>) provides m int ðm; nÞ Z sup x2S t½mðxÞ; nðxÞ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> where t is any t-norm. This expression may vary from 0, which corresponds to no intersection at all (typically if m and n have disjoint supports) to 1 if at least one point x belongs completely to both m and n. Note that in this case, the other fuzzification methods (combination of a-cuts, extension principle) provide the same result, or a particular case where tZmin. This form has been used for instance to define fuzzy morphological dilations (see Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> for more developments on this). Indeed, Eq. (3) corresponds to the degree of intersection of m and the translation of n at x. From the degree of intersection, a degree of empty intersection (or of disjunctness) is then derived as m lint ðm; nÞ Z c½m int ðm; nÞ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> where c is a fuzzy complementation (for instance defined as ca2[0,1], c(a)Z1Ka). This form has already been widely used in the fuzzy set literature. In particular, it is often interpreted as a degree of conflict between two fuzzy sets or two possibility distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">Introducing the volume of the overlapping domain</head><p>However, this form is not always adequate for image processing or vision purpose since it does not include any spatial information. This may even lead to counter-intuitive results: the expression sup x2S t½mðxÞ; nðxÞ only represents the maximum height of the intersection. Although it is generally low for fuzzy sets that have almost disjoint supports, its value does not account for different overlapping situations. This will be illustrated in Sections 3.3 and 4.3. The degree of intersection and of non-intersection can therefore be reformulated in order to better represent the notion of spatial overlapping by considering the fuzzy hypervolume V n (in a space of dimension n) of the intersection. This also corresponds to a translation process, in the sense that disjunctness can be expressed in the crisp case as: Xh Y Z ;5 V n ðXh YÞZ 0: For defining the hypervolume of a fuzzy set, we simply use the classical fuzzy cardinality. This provides for a fuzzy set m (having a bounded support) in the discrete case V n ðmÞZ P x2S mðxÞ; and in the continuous case V n ðmÞZ Ð x2S mðxÞ: From the hypervolume of t(m, n), we can derive a degree of intersection in [0,1]. It should be equal to 0 if m and n have completely disjoint supports, be high if one set is included in the other, and increasing with respect to the hypervolume of the intersection. The following definition satisfies these requirements<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> : m int ðm; nÞ Z V n ½tðm; nÞ min½V n ðmÞ; V n ðnÞ :</p><p>Again a degree of non-intersection can be derived from this expression using Eq. (15).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.">Properties</head><p>An important property of these various definitions is that the intersection degrees defined by Eqs. ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">16</ref>) are both consistent with the binary definition. Moreover, they satisfy the following properties: † symmetry: cðm; nÞ 2F 2 ; m int (m,n)Zm int (n,m);</p><p>† reflexivity (Eq. ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>)) if the fuzzy sets are normalized: dx 2S; m(x)Z10m int (m,m)Z1; for Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">16</ref>), reflexivity holds if tZmin; † if one of the sets is empty ðcx 2S; nðxÞZ 0Þ; then the degree of intersection is always 0; † if one of the sets is equal to Sðcx 2S; nðxÞZ 1Þ; the degree of intersection is always equal to 1 using Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">16</ref>), and to 1 for normalized fuzzy sets using Eq. ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>); † invariance with respect to geometrical transformations (translation, rotation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Degree of inclusion</head><p>We consider here the inclusion relation. It should be noted that a degree of equality can be derived from a degree of inclusion, by combining in a conjunctive way (using a t-norm) the degree of inclusion of one set in the other, and the degree of inclusion of the second set in the first one. Moreover, a fuzzy morphological erosion can be defined from a degree of inclusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> by computing the degree to which the structuring element translated at each point x is included in the considered fuzzy set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Inclusion from other set operations</head><p>In the crisp case, we have for two sets X and Y:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">X 4Y 5 Xh Y C Z ;5 X C g Y Z S:<label>(17)</label></formula><p>Using the degree of intersection, we obtain for the degree of inclusion of m in n: </p><formula xml:id="formula_18">Iðm;</formula><p>where t is a t-norm, T is a t-conorm and c is a fuzzy complementation. This definition leads to the erosion introduced in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">4</ref>). The properties of the degree of inclusion are directly derived from those of intersection since the degree of inclusion of m in n is equal to the degree of non-intersection of m and c(n): † consistency with the binary definition;</p><p>† if m is empty ðcx 2S; mðxÞZ 0Þ then Iðm; nÞ always equals 1; † if n is empty, then Iðm; nÞ is equal to 0 for normalized fuzzy sets; † if m is equal to Sðcx 2S; mðxÞZ 1Þ; Iðm; nÞ is equal to 0 for bounded support fuzzy sets; † if n is equal to S; Iðm; nÞ is always equal to 1; † invariance with respect to geometrical transformations (translation, rotation).</p><p>A fuzzy inclusion based on integration over a-cuts has been proposed in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. It consists in computing, for each a-cut of m and n the ratio r a between the surface of their intersection m a h n a and the surface of n a ; and then in integrating r a over a. The main drawback of this approach is its computational cost.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Discussion</head><p>Set theoretical operations have a very large interest and constitute fundamental operations. Their extensions to fuzzy sets enable the management of imprecision in all applications of these operations. We already mentioned how degree of inclusion and degree of intersection can be used for defining morphological erosion and dilation. Other application domains include fusion (for instance fusion of two images providing imprecise spatial location of an object), registration (for instance based on criteria on the overlap area of two object images), measure of conflict, measure of information, etc. All these applications are important components of spatial reasoning.</p><p>The number of possible extensions of operations to fuzzy sets raises the problem of choosing the most appropriate definition. Although there is a large overlap between different classes of definitions and numerous common properties guaranteeing similar behaviors in practice, one problem remains concerning the consideration of the spatial overlapping. This problem has already been mentioned for intersection: the expression sup x2S t½mðxÞ; nðxÞ represents the maximum height of the intersection and may depend on one point only while not accounting for different overlapping situations. This is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> (for sake of clarity, S is represented in 1D only).</p><p>Such situations are avoided by using the fuzzy volume of the overlapping area as in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">16</ref>) which leads to different values for m int (m,n) and m int (m,n 0 ), in accordance with the fact that m and n 0 have a larger overlap than m and n.</p><p>Similar questions occur for the degree of inclusion, since the definition in Eq.

Another approach consists in using the notion of contours, frontiers, and neighborhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Discussion</head><p>The choice of the degree of intersection plays an important role in the definitions of adjacency between fuzzy sets. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the results obtained with Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_37">34</ref>) with the t-norm minimum. Using the maximum of the intersection for m int (Eq. ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>)) we obtain m adj (m, n)Z0.36 and m adj (m, n 0 )Z0.35, which are very similar values. On the contrary, using the fuzzy hypervolume to define the degree of intersection (Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">16</ref>)), Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_37">34</ref>) accounts for the differences in intersection and provides m adj (m, n)Z0.67 and m adj (m, n 0 )Z0.34, which are this time very different.</p><p>Let us now compute this fuzzy adjacency on a few objects extracted from a real image. As an illustrative example, a slice of a brain image is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. It is obtained using a T1 weighted acquisition in magnetic resonance imaging. A few internal structures are represented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> as spatial fuzzy sets, where membership degrees are represented using grey levels. The adjacency degrees between some of these fuzzy objects are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">2</ref>. The results are in agreement with what can be expected from a brain model (an anatomical atlas for instance, where objects and adjacency are defined in a crisp way). Two classes of values are obtained: very low values which correspond to non-adjacency in the model and a set of higher values corresponding to adjacency in the model. In this case, crisp adjacency would provide completely different results in the model and in the image, preventing its use for recognition. This suggests that fuzzy adjacency degrees can indeed be used for pattern recognition purposes, as introduced in Section 1, of course combined with other spatial relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Distances</head><p>The importance of distances in image processing and interpretation is well established. Their extensions to fuzzy sets can be useful in several problems in image processing under imprecision. Several definitions can be found in the literature for distances between fuzzy sets (which is the main addressed problem). They can be roughly divided in two classes: distances that take only membership functions into account and that compare them pointwise, and distances that additionally include spatial distances. The wide literature on fuzzy similarities, dissimilarities and distances is rather silent on methods dealing with spatial information, and, unfortunately, not all approaches are suitable to this purpose. The presentation given below is directly inspired by the classification proposed in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, but adapted to image processing and vision purposes, by underlining for each definition its properties and the type of image information on which it relies. A complete review can be found in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Representations</head><p>Before reviewing the main definitions, we address some representation issues.</p><p>The most used representation of a distance between two fuzzy sets is as a number d, taking values in R C (or more specifically in [0,1] for some of them). However, since we consider fuzzy sets, i.e. objects that are imprecisely defined, we may expect that the distance between them is imprecise too <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. Then, the distance is better represented as a fuzzy set, and more precisely as a fuzzy number.</p><p>In Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, Rosenfeld defines two concepts that will be used in the sequel. </p><p>While the distance distribution value D(m, n) (n) represents the degree to which the distance between m and n is less than n, the distance density value d(m, n) (n) represents the degree to which the distance is equal to n.  Histograms of distances inspired from angle histograms (see Section 6.3), carrying a complete information about distance relationships but at the price of a heavier representation, have been introduced in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. They will not be detailed here.</p><p>The concept of distance can be represented as a linguistic variable. This assumes a granulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> of the set of possible distance values into symbolic classes such as 'near', 'far', etc. each of these classes being defined as a fuzzy set. This approach has been drawn, e.g. in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. For instance in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the relation 'far' is defined as a decreasing function of the average distance between both sets.</p><p>Finally spatial representations are useful to define the regions of the space where some distance constraint to a reference object is satisfied <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. Such constraints are often expressed as imprecise statements or in linguistic terms, which reinforces the usefulness of fuzzy modeling.</p><p>In the following sections, we will mainly present methods providing numbers or fuzzy numbers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Comparison of membership functions</head><p>In this section, we review the main distances proposed in the literature that aim at comparing membership functions. They have generally been proposed in a general fuzzy set framework, and not specifically in the context of image processing. They do not really include information about spatial distances. The classification chosen here is inspired from the one in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Similar classifications can be found in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. More details and properties are given in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>The functional approach is probably the most popular one. It relies on a L p norm between m and n, leading to the following generic definition <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">d p ðm; nÞ Z ð x2S jmðxÞ K nðxÞj p 2 4 3 5 1=p ;<label>(38)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_40">d N ðm; nÞ Z sup x2S jmðxÞ K nðxÞj:<label>(39)</label></formula><p>In the discrete finite case, these definitions use discrete sums and max, respectively. A noticeable property of d p is that it takes a constant value if the supports of m and n are disjoint, irrespectively of how far the supports are from each other in S:</p><p>Among the information theoretic approaches, definitions based on fuzzy entropy or fuzzy divergence have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. But one main drawback of most of these approaches is that the obtained distance is always equal to 0 for crisp sets.</p><p>In the set theoretic approach, distance between two fuzzy sets is seen as a dissimilarity function, based on fuzzy union and intersection. Examples are given in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The basic idea is that the distance should be larger if the two fuzzy sets weakly intersect. Most of the proposed measures are inspired from the work by Tversky <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> that proposes two parametric similarity measures between two sets A and B: qf ðAh BÞ K af ðA K BÞ K bf ðB K AÞ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref> and in a rational form</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">f ðAh BÞ f ðAh BÞ C af ðAh B C Þ C bf ðBh A C Þ ;<label>(41)</label></formula><p>where f(X) is typically the cardinality of X, and a, b and q are parameters leading to different kinds of measures.</p><p>Let us mention a few examples (they are given in the finite discrete case). A measure being derived from the second Tversky measure by setting aZbZ1 has been used by several authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> </p><p>It does not satisfy the triangular inequality, and always takes the constant value 1 as soon as the two fuzzy sets have disjoint supports. It also corresponds to the Jaccard index <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. With respect to the typology presented in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, this distance is a comparison measure, and more precisely a dissimilarity measure. Moreover, 1Kd is a resemblance measure. Applications in image processing can be found, e.g. in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, where it is used on fuzzy sets representing object features (and not directly spatial image objects) for structural pattern recognition on polygonal 2D objects. A slightly different formula has been proposed in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> and modified in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> in order to achieve better properties:</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">dðm; nÞ Z 1 K 1 jSuppðmÞg SuppðnÞj !

It is always equal to 1 if the supports of m and n are disjoint.

These measures actually rely on measures of inclusion of each fuzzy set in the other (see Section 3.2). Indeed, the distance should be small if the two sets have a small degree of equality (the equality between m and n can be expressed by 'm included in n and n included in m', which leads to an easy transposition to fuzzy equality). Other inclusion indexes can be defined, e.g. from Tversky measure by setting aZ1 and bZ0, leading to f(AhB)/f(A) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. As an example, these measures have been applied in image processing for image database applications in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p><p>The last definitions given by Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_45">44</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">45</ref>) are, respectively, equivalent to 1KP(m; n) and 1Kmax[N(m;n), N(n;m)] (where P and N are possibility and necessity functions) used in fuzzy pattern matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>, which has a large application domain, including image processing and vision (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>).</p><p>Finally, the pattern recognition approach consists in first expressing each fuzzy set in a feature space (for instance cardinality, moments, skewness) and to compute the Euclidean distance between two feature vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> or attribute vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. This approach may take advantage of some of the previous approaches, for instance by using entropy or similarity in the set of features. It has been applied for instance for database applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. A similar approach, called signal detection theory, has been proposed in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. It is based on counting the number of similar and different features. These approaches are somewhat apart from our main focus since they do not use directly the fuzzy sets but features extracted from them.</p></div>

This has been done for instance for nearest point distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>, mean distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, Hausdorff distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and could easily be extended to other distances (see e.g. Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> for a review of crisp set distances). These generalizations can be obtained according to a fuzzification by integration over a-cuts (see Section 2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>.</p><p>Another method consists in weighting distances by membership values. For the mean distance this leads for instance to <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> </p><p>A third approach consists in defining a fuzzy distance as a fuzzy set on R C instead of as a crisp number using the extension principle (see Section 2).

Extensions of this distance have been defined using fuzzification over the a-cuts and using the extension principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. One potential problem with these approaches occurs in the case of empty a-cuts <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>.</p><p>Boxer <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> proposed to add a crisp set to every set, but the result is highly dependent on this additional set, and does not reduce to the classical Hausdorff distance when applied on crisp sets. The solution proposed in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> consists in clipping the distance at some maximum distance, but similar problems arise. Other authors use the Hausdorff distance between the endographs of the two membership functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> (but the additional dimension has not the same meaning as the spatial dimension). Several generalizations of Hausdorff distance have also been proposed under the form of fuzzy numbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Extensions of the Hausdorff distance based on fuzzy mathematical morphology has also been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> and is presented below. These distances share most of the advantages and drawbacks of the underlying crisp distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>: computation cost can be high (it is already high for several crisp distances); moreover, interpretation and robustness strongly depend on the chosen distance (for instance, Hausdorff distance may be noise sensitive, whereas average distance is less). Extensions of these definitions may be obtained by using other weighting functions, for instance by using t-norms instead of min.</p><p>A morphological approach has been proposed in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>. We just give the examples of nearest point distance and Hausdorff distance. The main idea here is to use links between distances and morphological dilations to derive algebraic expressions of distances (instead of classical analytical ones), which are then easy to translate into fuzzy expressions.</p><p>In the binary case, and in a digital space S; for nO0, the nearest point distance d N can be expressed in morphological terms as Also the triangular inequality is not satisfied in general.</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">d</formula><p>Another morphological approach has been suggested in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, based on links between the minimum distance and the Minkowski difference. In the crisp case, we have d N ðX; YÞZ inffjzj; z 2Y2Xg; if X and Y are non-intersecting crisp sets. In order to account for possible intersection between the two sets, the authors introduce also the notion of penetration distance, defined along a direction s as the maximum translation of X along s such that X still meets Y : dðs; X; YÞZ maxfk; ðXC ksÞh Y s;g: The extension to fuzzy sets is done by assuming fuzzy numbers on each axis. This leads to nice reasonable computation times, but can unfortunately not be directly extended to any fuzzy objects because of this assumption.</p><p>A tolerance-based approach has been developed in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. The basic idea is to combine spatial information and membership values by assuming a tolerance value t, indicating the differences that can occur without saying that the objects are no more similar. Note that this approach has strong links with morphological approaches, since the neighborhood considered around each point can be considered as a structuring element.</p><p>According to a graph theoretic approach, a similarity function between fuzzy graphs may also induce a distance between fuzzy sets. This approach contrasts with the previous ones, since the objects are no more represented directly as fuzzy sets on S or as vectors of attributes, but as higher level structures. Fuzzy graphs in structural recognition can be used for representing objects, as in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, or a scene, as in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. In the first case, nodes are parts of the objects and edges are links between these parts. In the second case, nodes are objects of the scene and edges are relationships between these objects. These two examples use different ways to consider distances (or similarity) between fuzzy graphs. In Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, the distance is defined from a similarity between nodes and between edges (both being fuzzy sets), given a correspondence between nodes (respectively between edges). The similarity used compares only membership functions, using a set theoretic approach (see Section 5.2) and corresponds to Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>. Although it has not been considered in this reference, spatial distance can then be taken into account if we include it in the attribute set. This idea is probably worth to be further developed. In a similar way, several distances between graphs have been proposed as an objective function to find the correspondence between graphs. This function compares attributes of nodes of the two graphs to be matched, and attributes of arcs. One of the main difficulties is to deal with non-objective matching. This has been addressed for instance in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, where a formalism for defining fuzzy morphisms between graphs is proposed, as well as optimization methods for finding the best morphism according to an objective function including spatial distance information as an edge attribute. Another way to consider distances between objects is in terms of cost of deformations to bring one set in correspondence with the other. Such approaches are particularly powerful in graphbased methods. The distance can then be expressed as the cost of the matching of two graphs, as done in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> for image processing applications, or as the Levensthein distance accounting for the necessary transformations (insertions, substitutions, deletions) for going from the structural representation of one shape to the representation of the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. In Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, the fuzzy aspect is taken into account as weighting factors, therefore the method is quite close to the weighted Levensthein distance of Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. Spatial distances could also be introduced as one of the relationships between objects in these approaches. A distance between conceptual graphs is defined in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>, as an interval [N, P] where N represents the necessity and P the possibility, obtained by a fuzzy pattern matching approach. Although the application is not related to image processing, the idea of expressing similarity as an interval is interesting and could certainly be exploited in other domains. A second interest of this approach is that the nodes of the graph are concepts, which could be (although not explicitly mentioned in this reference) represented as fuzzy sets (like linguistic variables). Although these examples are still far from the main concern of this paper, it is worth mentioning them, since they bring an interesting structural aspect that could be further developed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Discussion</head><p>In the first class of methods (Section 5.2), the only way m and n are combined is by computation linking m(x) and n(x), i.e. only the memberships at the same point of S: No spatial information is taken into account. A positive consequence is that the corresponding distances are easy to compute. The complexity is linear in the cardinality of S: Considering image processing and vision applications, we suggest that the first class of methods (comparing membership functions only) be restricted when the two fuzzy sets to be compared represent the same structure or a structure and a model. Applications in model-based or case-based pattern recognition are foreseeable.</p><p>On the other hand, the definitions which combine spatial distance and fuzzy membership comparison (Section 5.3) allow for a more general analysis of structures in images, for applications where the topological and spatial arrangement of the structures of interest is important (segmentation, classification, scene interpretation). This is enabled by the fact that these distances combine membership values at different points in the space, therefore taking into account their proximity or farness in S: The price to pay is an increased complexity, generally quadratic in the cardinality of S:</p><p>When facing the problem of choosing a distance, several criteria can be used. First, the type of application at hand plays an important role. While both classes of methods can be used for comparing an object and a model object, only the second class can be used for evaluating distances between objects in the same image. Among the distances of the first class, the results we obtained show that entropy and divergence-based approaches are not satisfactory. Also normalized distances should be avoided in most cases. The choice among the remaining distances can be done by looking at the properties of the distances (for instance, do we need d(m,m)Z0 for the application at hand?), and at the computation time. Among the distances of the second class, similar choice criteria can be used. Although we may speak about distances between image objects in a very general way, this expression does not make necessarily the assumption that we are dealing with true metrics. For several applications in image processing, it is not sure that all properties are needed. For instance the triangular inequality is not always a requirement.</p><p>In order to illustrate the differences between various definitions, we have computed distances from all structures shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> to v2, using most of the definitions reviewed in this paper. The results obtained with the distances of the first class are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">3</ref>. For definitions involving min and max as intersection and union, we computed the results obtained with extended definitions, using other t-norms and t-conorms. The results using distances of the second class are given in Table <ref type="table">4</ref> for the geometrical approach, and in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">5</ref> for the morphological approach.</p><p>As can be observed from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">3</ref>, the d p distances (lines 1-3) are not able to differentiate the structures with respect to v2: a value 0 is obtained for v2 (since d p (m,m)Z0) and for all other objects almost the same value is obtained. The problem of the constant value if the supports of m and n are disjoint can also be observed: in this example, v2 and nc1 have disjoint supports, as well as v2 and t1. Using these distances, nc1 and t1 have the same distance to v2, although t1 is farther from v2 than nc1 in S:</p><p>Since the distance based on fuzzy entropy (line 4) does not combine points of m with points of n, but only a global measure of the fuzzy sets, made separately, the results can even be counter-intuitive. In this example, nc1 has a lower distance to v2 than v1, although v1 is closer to v2 than nc1 in S (spatially). For the fuzzy divergene (line 5), similar problems occur: some counterintuitive results are obtained, nc1 and t1 have a null distance to v2.</p><p>The distances presented in lines 6-18 are not able to differentiate between nc1 and t1, and even v1 and nc2. Very similar values are obtained for all these structures, although they are spatially at very different distances from v2. The property d(m, m)Z0 does not always hold (see lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In lines 19-21, similar problems are observed. Additionally, the normalization leads to very low values for all structures. This is a general problem due to normalization for all these distances.</p><p>Using distances taking into account spatial information, more satisfactory results are obtained. Using the geometrical approach (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>), the lowest value is always obtained for v2. A null value is obtained only using the minimum and the Hausdorff distances, since they are the only ones which satisfy d(m,m)Z0. Objects nc2 and v1 have similar distances to v2, as it appears in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>.</p><p>Then nc1 is found farther, and then t1. These results fit well the intuition. Using different t-norms in the weighted average distance changes the absolute values that are obtained, but not the ranking. Since the following inequalities hold: c(a, b)2[0,1] 2 , maxð0; aC bK 1Þ% ab% minða; bÞ; similar inequalities between the derived distances are obtained. For this distance, the choice of the t-norm is not really important, since it does not change the properties of the distance, and for image processing purposes, the ranking between distance values is often more important that their absolute value.</p><p>All previous examples provide results as numbers. When using the morphological approach, the results take the form of fuzzy numbers as seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">5</ref>. The curves in this table show the degrees to which the distance is equal to n as a function of n. Again the results fit well the intuition. The distributions obtained for v2 are concentrated on the low distance values. Then, when the structures become farther from v2, the curves are shifted towards higher distance values. Here again, the choice of a specific t-norm is not crucial as it changes mainly the absolute values. Lower membership degrees are obtained when using a smaller t-norm. The fact that the Hausdorff distance provides higher values than the nearest point distance corresponds to the fact that the size of the dilation applied to one set needed to reach the other is less than the size of the dilation needed to completely include the other set. This is the case for crisp sets, and the same property holds in the fuzzy case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Directional relative position between objects</head><p>Now we consider a completely different type of relationships, directional relative position, which is a typical example of relations that defy precise definitions. Distances between fuzzy sets of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> using the morphological approach, for the nearest point distance and the Hausdorff distance, using two different t-norms Although such relations are very important and explicitly mentioned by Freeman and by Kuipers, crisp definitions are clearly not appropriate. Therefore, in this case, the general principles presented in Section 2 cannot be applied. The usual way to consider such relations in common language is as a matter of degree and in a non-exclusive manner (several relations between two given objects can be satisfied to some degree). Fuzzy set theory appears then as an appropriate tool for such modeling even for crisp sets. The main fuzzy approaches are reviewed here. More details can be found in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>.</p></div>

This angle, denoted by q(a, b), takes values in [Kp,p], which constitutes the domain on which primitive directional relations are defined.</p><p>The four such relations 'left', 'right', 'above' and 'below' are defined in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> as cos 2 q and sin 2 q functions. Other functions are possible: in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> trapezoidal shaped membership functions are used, for the same relations. Whatever the equations, the membership functions for these relations are denoted by m left , m right , m above , and m below , and are functions from [Kp,p] into [0,1]. The equations are chosen according to simplicity (e.g. cos or sin functions), to the fact that they define a fuzzy partition of [Kp,p], and to their invariance properties with respect to rotation (i.e. a rotation should correspond to a translation of the membership functions).</p><p>In the work relying on these definitions, only these four basic directions are used, other relations being expressed in terms of these. However, we can propose a straightforward extension to any direction. In 2D, a direction is defined by an angle a with the x-axis. Using this convention, the relationship 'right' corresponds to aZ0. From m right Zm 0 , we derive m a ; representing the relationship 'in direction a', for any a as follows cq; m a ðqÞ Z m 0 ðq K aÞ <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(58)</ref> with for instance:</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">m 0 ðqÞ Z cos 2 ðqÞ if q 2 K p 2 ; C p 2 h i 0 elsewhere (<label>(59)</label></formula><p>This makes the definitions based on angle computation more general. Moreover, it guarantees geometric invariance. Another solution for defining relations intermediate between the four basic ones can be based on logical combinations of these four basic relations. For instance, 'oblique right' is defined by '(above and right of) or (below and right of)'. The advantage of this approach is that only four membership functions have to be defined, which is consistent with the usual way of speaking about relative position. The drawback is that, contrary to the definition proposed in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">58</ref>), we cannot achieve a great precision in direction using this approach. Also, the shape of the membership function will vary depending on the considered direction, leading to a high anisotropy and therefore a loss of rotation invariance, while it remains the same using Eq. (58).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Centroid method</head><p>A first simple solution to evaluate a fuzzy relationship between two objects consists in representing each object by a characteristic point.

More precisely, the angle histogram is computed from the angle between any two points in both objects as defined before, and normalized by the maximum frequency. Let us denote by H R (A) this normalized histogram, where R is the reference object and A the object the position of which with respect to R is evaluated. H R (A) represents the spatial directional relations of the object A with respect to the reference object R. Expressing H R (A) in terms of the basic relations can be performed using compatibility (see Section 2) of the two fuzzy sets m a (for some direction a of interest) and H R (A). The center of gravity of the compatibility fuzzy set provides then a global evaluation.</p><p>Another solution is to use a fuzzy pattern matching approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref> (between m a and H R (A)) by computing both the degree of inclusion of m a in H R (A) and their degree of intersection using the definitions of Section 3, as suggested in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>. Then, the global evaluation is given in the form of a pair necessity/possibility.</p><p>The fuzzy extension of this method is based on a weighted histogram <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> which is equivalent to compute a histogram on each a-cut and to combine the obtained results by summation as in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</p></div>

The degree to which an object A is in the direction a with respect to a reference object R is computed using successively points, segments, and longitudinal sections. This leads to a so called 'histogram of forces' which allows to compute the weight supporting a proposition like 'object A is in direction a from object R'.

It is based on a projection of the considered object on the axis related to the direction to be assessed (e.g. the x-axis for evaluating the relations 'left to' and 'right to'). Let us detail the computation for the relation 'A is left from R'. The same construction applies for any direction. Let us denote by R f (x) the normalized projection of the set R on the x-axis.

This makes use here of a spatial representation of the relation. Therefore, the fuzzy landscape m a ðRÞ is directly defined in the same space as the considered objects, contrary to the projection method <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>, where the fuzzy area is defined on a one-dimensional axis. (2) Then the object A is compared to the fuzzy landscape m a ðRÞ; in order to evaluate how well the object matches with the areas having high membership values (i.e. areas that are in the desired direction). This is done using a fuzzy pattern matching approach, which provides an evaluation as an interval or a pair of numbers instead of one number only.</p><p>The evaluation of relative position of A with respect to R is given by a function of m a ðRÞðxÞ and m A (x) for all x 2S: The histogram of m a ðRÞ conditionally to m A is such a function. While this histogram gives the most complete information about the relative spatial position of two objects, it is difficult to reason in an efficient way with it. A summary of the contained information could be more useful in practice. An appropriate tool for defining this summary is the fuzzy pattern matching approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, which provides an evaluation as two numbers: a necessity degree N (a pessimistic evaluation) defined as a degree of inclusion and a possibility degree P (an optimistic evaluation) defined as a degree of intersection. They can also be interpreted in terms of fuzzy mathematical morphology, since the possibility is equal to the dilation of m A by m a ðRÞ at origin, while the necessity is equal to the erosion, as shown in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. These two interpretations, in terms of set theoretic operations and in terms of morphological ones, explain how the shape of the objects is taken into account.</p><p>Several other functions combining m a ðRÞ and m A (x) can be constructed. The extreme values provided by the fuzzy pattern matching are interesting because of their morphological interpretation, and because they provide a pair of extreme values and not only a single value and may better capture the ambiguity of the relation if any. One drawback of these measures is that they are sensitive to noise, since they rely on infimum and supremum computation. An average measure can also be useful from a practical point of view (it is much less sensitive to noise).</p><p>The key point in the previous definition relies in the definition of m a ðRÞ: The requirements stated above for this fuzzy set are not strong and leave room for a large spectrum of possibilities. This flexibility allows the user to define any membership function according to the application at hand and the context requirements. The definition proposed in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> looks precisely at the domains of space that are visible from a reference object point in the desired direction. This applies to any kind of objects, including those having strong concavities.</p><p>This amounts to dilate m R by a fuzzy structuring element defined on S as cP 2S; nðPÞ Z max 0; 1 K 2 p arccos ÕP,ũ a jj ÕPjj " # ;</p><p>(or another function having the same variations) where O is the center of the structuring element.

A similar approach has been proposed in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, but with a linear function of q instead of a trigonometric one. The extension to fuzzy sets is done by integration over a-cuts, which can be computationally heavy. This type of definition is not necessarily adapted to any types of shapes and is difficult to extend to 3D objects. Slightly different approaches for visual surroundness and topological surroundness have been proposed in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Another approach consists in combining in a disjunctive way several directional relations such as left, right, above, below, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref>, which extends directly to 3D and to fuzzy objects. But the difficulty is to distinguish between situations where A surrounds B and situations where B surrounds A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.9.">Discussion</head><p>A formal comparison of these approaches is given in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, based on their properties, the type of basic elements on which they rely, their behavior in extreme situations, in case of concavities, of distant objects, and on their computational cost. The main conclusions that can be drawn are as follows. While most approaches reduce the representation of objects to points, segments or projections, only the morphological approach considers the objects as a whole and therefore better accounts for their shape. Approaches providing evaluation as intervals or fuzzy numbers are better suited for representing the ambiguity inherent to such relationships. If the distance between objects increases, an object is seen as a point from the reference object, which could be intuitively expected, for all methods but the projection approach. All approaches have a similar complexity, except the centroid method which is computationally simpler but which also reduces too much the information.</p><p>The extension to 3D objects requires to represent a direction by two angles, which generally increases the complexity. The extension of the angle histogram method to 3D objects amounts to computing a bi-dimensional histogram, i.e. as a function of these two angles, and then applying the same principle using the relations defined in 3D. The computation of the histogram is heavy in 2D, and becomes even more so in 3D. Another problem when computing bi-histograms is that the domain of possible angle values may be underrepresented, depending on the size and the sampling of the considered objects. This may result in a noisy and hole containing histogram. This effect already appears in 2D. Extension of the force histogram method to 3D objects could be probably done, but with a high complexity. The morphological approach is directly applicable in 3D, without changing the complexity with respect to the number of points. All approaches can been extended to fuzzy objects using their a-cuts, at the price of a high computational cost. The morphological approach can be directly applied, without cost increase. The angle histogram approach can be extended easily too, by computing weighted histograms.</p><p>Another aspect that is very important is the type of questions each definition is able to answer, or dedicated to. This could be the main ingredient for a choice among all possible approaches. These questions can take different forms, e.g. † what are the spatial relationships between two given objects? † to which degree a given spatial relation holds between two objects? † what are the regions of the space where a spatial relationship is satisfied (to some degree) with respect to a reference object?</p><p>An important feature of angle histogram and force histogram is that they provide a general description of the directional relationships. From this general information, several ones can be deduced, as the degree of satisfaction of one specific relationship (for a particular direction), or the dominant relationship. This is not easy to obtain with the morphological approach, that needs one computation for each direction of interest. This approach is more dedicated to cases where we are interested in specified relations.</p><p>For problems where we have to assess the relative position of several objects with one reference object, the morphological approach may be more appropriate if the computation time is a strong requirement.</p><p>Another advantage of the morphological approach is that the first step directly provides a spatial representation of a directional constraint with respect to a reference object (thus answering the third type of question), which can be used in order to guide the search for another object <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84]</ref>.</p><p>In order to illustrate the reviewed definitions, we choose two simple examples, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Despite their apparent simplicity, they lead to eloquent results, and allow us in particular to show how different parts of the objects can be taken into account.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">6</ref> shows the results for object A with respect to object R, according to various methods. They all agree to say that A is mainly to the right of R. The degree of being to the right increases with the value of r, since the part of A which is to the right of R is the closest one to R. On the contrary, the degree of being above decreases with r. The values are somewhat different for all approaches, but since the ranking and the general behavior is the same, no conclusion concerning a more favorable approach can be derived from this example.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">7</ref> shows the results for object B with respect to object R. For these objects, two main relations are satisfied: right and above. The centroid method does not account well for the above relation, for which it gives a very low value. This shows one of the limitations of this approach, which is too simple in that it reduces too much the data. Since the part Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Two examples where the relative position of objects with respect to the reference object is difficult to define in a 'all-or-nothing' manner.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">6</ref> Relative position of object A (rectangle) with respect to object R (square) of Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, using centroid, aggregation, compatibility methods, and using the morphological approach (the [N, P] intervals are given, as well as the average value) Angle or force histograms are computed using rZ0, rZ2 and rZ5 (the angle histogram method corresponds to rZ0).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 7</head><p>Relative position of object B with respect to object R of Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, using centroid, aggregation, compatibility methods, and using the morphological approach (the [N, P] intervals are given, as well as the average value) of B which is above R is closer than the one to its right, the values of being right decrease with r while the values of being above increase. The morphological approach highlights the ambiguity of the relations for these objects. Parts of B satisfy completely the above relation for instance, while other parts do not satisfy it at all. The non-zero degrees obtained for the relation below for instance are due to some points of B that are indeed partially below R.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>We briefly presented in this paper the main fuzzy approaches to define spatial relationships, as well as some comparative discussions. More details as well as illustrative examples can be found in the referenced papers.</p><p>The most representative relationships according to Freeman <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and Kuipers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> have been addressed. However, other relations may be useful for scene description, interpretation and recognition. For instance, symmetry can play an important role in several applications. Exact symmetry usually does not exist in real objects and one has to deal with approximate symmetries. Many works quantify the degree of symmetry using a symmetry measure often based on a distance. However, except in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>, most results have been obtained for precisely defined objects. In Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>, a symmetry measure is defined, which characterizes the degree of symmetry of a fuzzy object or between two fuzzy objects with respect to a given plane. This degree is based on a measure of comparison or similarity between the object and its reflection (or the reflection of the second object) with respect to this plane. It would be also interesting to address other relationships such as 'between' (a ternary relation, briefly addressed in 2D in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>) or 'along', or any other relation involved in scene description in natural language. Such terms being often contextdependent, additional difficulties are raised.</p><p>Digital aspects and algorithms are also worse to be further developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Crisp relationships are often very sensitive in the digital case. In the fuzzy case, the problem is much less crucial. Indeed, there is no more strict membership, the fuzziness allows us to deal with some gradual transition between objects or between object and background, and relations become then a matter of degree. Therefore, we can expect to gain in robustness when assessing the relationships between two objects. In this respect, the fuzziness, even on digital images, could be interpreted as a partial recovering of the continuity lost during the digitization process. As for algorithms, propagation algorithms have already been developed for directional relative position <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>, providing good approximations in a fast way. It could be interesting from a practical point of view to develop similar algorithms for fuzzy distances for instance.</p><p>Applications in structural object recognition and scene interpretation have been already developed based on fuzzy relationships and this field certainly deserves to be further investigated. More generally, fuzzy relationships are an important feature in spatial reasoning under imprecision. In the proposed review, mathematical morphology appears as a unifying framework. Moreover, due to its strong algebraic structure, it leads also to qualitative representations, in the context of formal logics <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>, which can be useful in qualitative spatial reasoning.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Z;; sup x2UjyZf ðxÞ mðxÞ otherwise: (</figDesc></figure>
