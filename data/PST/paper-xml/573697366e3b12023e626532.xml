<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The World Wide Web has fueled an unprecedented commercialization of the Internet by turning a system designed for academic data exchange into a widely used social medium. The economic foundation of many services in this medium is online advertisements (ads) which allow content and services to be offered free of charge to users.</p><p>The history of this business model goes back to the first clickable Web ads, which emerged around 1993 with the first commercial Web sites. HotWired was among the first to sell banner ads to companies such as AT&amp;T and Coors. The first central ad servers emerged in 1995 to enable the management, targeting, and tracking of users and online ads. This started the proliferation of Web ads, which brought with it an increasingly complex infrastructure to serve these advertisements. DoubleClick introduced the process of online behavioral advertising in the late 1990s which used 3rd party cookies to track users across sites and present ads based on the users' browsing patterns. Today, online advertisement has become a large and complex industry where entire exchanges trade userspecific information for the purpose of better ad placements <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[58]</ref>.</p><p>This user specific profiling has raised many privacy and security concerns in particular among privacy and consumer advocacy groups. The debate has, for instance, led to agreements about the expiration dates of cookies as well as clear statements regarding the collection of user information <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[8]</ref>. While the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) identifies problems with online behavioral advertisement, it allows advertisers to continue this practice with some safeguards such as greater transparency, provisions for consumers to opt out, and special handling of sensitive data, e.g., those related to health and financial information <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[13]</ref>. The motivation underlying the FTC's position is that the FTC views online advertisements as the key enabler for "free" content on the Web.</p><p>However, to Web users, online advertisements can be perceived as being not only invasive to privacy, but also annoying, since they can distract them from the primary content they wish to consume. This situation has resulted in a proliferation of tools to evade or block the ads. We refer to these tools as ad-blockers. Among the most convenient and popular ad-blockers are extensions for Web browsers like Adblock Plus and Ghostery. According to Google and Mozilla usage statistics of browser add-ons, Adblock Plus is among the most popular. More than 30M users surf the Web daily using a browser with this extension enabled <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">15]</ref>.</p><p>The use of ad-blockers is, however, perceived by the advertisement industry and content publishers as a growing threat to their business model <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">19]</ref>. Their rationale is that ad-blockers provide users a way to "evade paying" for the content they consume. Thus, some players try to put pressure on the developers of ad blocking browser extensions in order to be excluded from the blocking. This exclusion is envisioned to be implemented by i) removing them from the filter lists, or ii) by adding them to a whitelist <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[6]</ref>. Others also try to detect ad-blockers and explicitly appeal these users to either whitelist their site or completely disable the ad-blocker.</p><p>Another claim regarding the rise of ad-blockers is that "as more end users adopt them, revenues decline and the number of obnoxious advertisements increases" <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[3]</ref>. To break this vicious cycle some players in this domain encourage advertisers to adopt "acceptable ads" as a compromise. The most important implication of this initiative is that advertisements that conform to these guidelines are by default whitelisted by Adblock Plus <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[5]</ref>, a setting that end users can still override.</p><p>Moreover, the ad-blocking debate is not uniquely centered on adblockers like Adblock Plus. In fact, some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have already stated their intention to block advertising on their networks and thereby, force some companies in the advertising business to share their revenues <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[12]</ref>. In light of this tussle between users, advertisers, publishers, and ISPs, we inform the ongoing debate with a passive measurement study about the "ad-scape" and how end users interact with it.</p><p>Our work: We complement previous work with a passive measurement study on advertisements. Namely, we collect traces from a residential broadband network (RBN) of a major European ISP to i) elaborate on the prevalence of ad-blockers in this vantage point, and ii) characterize ad traffic in the wild. The contributions of this paper are as follows:</p><p>• We present a methodology to extract structural Web site information from packet header traces. With this methodology at hand, we can use the Adblock Plus functionality to classify ad traffic in passive measurements. We validate the effectiveness of this methodology with an active measurement study based on different configurations of an instrumented browser, e.g., running Adblock Plus. • We leverage two indicators to infer Adblock Plus usage: i) low ratio of ad requests, and ii) connections to the Adblock Plus servers. Based on these metrics we estimate that 22% of the most active users likely use this extension. Moreover, we have indications that, perhaps, most Adblock Plus users do neither subscribe to EasyPrivacy (the list that protects them from trackers), nor opt out from the list of non-intrusive ads. • We find that advertisement traffic contributes to a significant percentage of requests, roughly 18% in both of the studied traces. We dissect ad requests by type and find that 11% of them match the list of non-intrusive ads, while the rest is distributed among advertisers and trackers. Given the prevalence of this traffic in terms of requests, we also characterize various aspects thereof, including object types, server-side infrastructure as well as back-end functionality, i.e., realtime bidding.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: we first discuss the basic functionality of Adblock Plus and the corresponding filter lists in §2. We then describe in §3 our measurement methodology and its subsequent evaluation in §4. Section §5 summarizes the two data sets as well as the involved vantage points. We present our first results about Adblock Plus usage in §6. We then elaborate on traffic-and infrastructure-centric aspects of advertisements in §7 and §8. Section §9 presents the related work. We discuss the limitations of our methodology in §10 and present our conclusions in §11.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">AD BLOCKERS -A SHORT REVIEW</head><p>There is a wide range of browser extensions available to endusers who want to evade or protect themselves from the ad-scape. Adblock Plus is arguably among the currently most popular adblockers <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[17]</ref>. Users can configure this browser extension to i) block or hide advertisements, and to ii) protect their privacy by blocking trackers. Another popular tool is Ghostery, which mainly focuses on protecting end-users' privacy. The Electronic Frontier Foundation's Privacy Badger <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[10]</ref> shares the same objective; but in contrast to Ghostery, which is proprietary software, Privacy Badger is open source-and based on Adblock Plus. Another option is the NoScript plugin which is designed to interactively disable executable Web content such as JavaScript, which is often used by advertisers and trackers.</p><p>To assess the popularity of these extensions we can refer to statistics reported by popular browsers or to recent work by Metwalley et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[46]</ref>. They report, relying on a passive measurement study, that 80% of the households visible at their vantage point do not use any of these popular plugins. Among those that do, Adblock Plus dominates, i.e., Adblock Plus is installed at 10%-18% of the households. Indeed, less than 3% of the households exhibit evidence of other installed plugins. Given the popularity of Adblock Plus, we next describe how this particular extension operates. Adblock Plus. At the heart of Adblock Plus is the mechanism to filter adverts based on filter rules that appear in filter lists. The regular expressions that form the set of filter rules follow a specific syntax, which is described in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">21]</ref>. If a filter rule matches a URL that is not otherwise whitelisted, Adblock Plus will prevent the Web browser from requesting the URL. Hence, this extension reduces network traffic as it averts undesired ad-related objects from being fetched.</p><p>However, some Web pages embed advertisements into the (main) HTML document, e.g., textual advertisements. Since this document is required to render the page, the tool does not block the download of these HTML documents. However, Adblock Plus includes functionality to hide such-otherwise displayed-embedded ads via CSS modification. Note that these ads are still transferred over the network even though they will not be displayed in the browser to the user. Filters Lists. Adblock Plus users can obtain various lists of filter rules via a subscription mechanism. There are several filter lists available for different purposes. When an end user installs the Adblock Plus extension for the first time, the plugin subscribes itself to two filter lists. The first one is named EasyList and its goal is to remove ads from English Web pages. The second list is called non-intrusive advertisements (acceptable ads) and its purpose is to whitelist the advertisements that are blacklisted by EasyList but comply with the directives summarized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[5]</ref>.</p><p>This list and, in particular, its activation by default is most likely the origin of the controversy described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[6]</ref> (i.e., advertisers paying to be whitelisted). Note that users may still opt to deactivate this list with a single click. There are additional lists to which Adblock Plus users can subscribe. Examples include i) customizations of EasyList to non-English Web pages, or ii) EasyPrivacy, which aims to protect the end users' privacy by blocking Web trackers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement challenges.</head><p>At first glance, given that this adblocker only uses filter lists, it should be easy to emulate its behavior on a passively collected network trace. However, this is not that simple as Adblock Plus relies on the information contained in the DOM tree of the Web site to classify Web elements as adverts. For example, the classification can be based on whether an image is displayed in an iframe, which cannot be detected by inspecting the URL. Thus, this ad-blocker relies on the entire structure of a Web page rather than purely the URLs.</p><p>To reconstruct the entire structure of the Web page one needs parse the payload part of the traces. For privacy reasons we cannot and do not have access to this part. Our traces only include HTTP header information (see §5). Hence, our methodology has to rely on the information available in the HTTP headers. How we tackle this challenge is discussed in the next section. Our methodology enables us to approximately reconstruct the Web page meta-data from the HTTP headers.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">METHODOLOGY</head><p>In this section we describe our approach for identifying ad-blocker users from passive traces. The premise is that ad-blocker users access fewer ads than non ad-blocker users. Thus, we need a methodology for identifying Web objects and separating them into ad or non-ad objects. This is where we rely on Adblock Plus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Identifying ad traffic</head><p>The goal of our methodology is to classify ad traffic in TCP/HTTP header traces captured via passive measurements. For this classification we rely on Adblock Plus functionality as it is the most popular ad-blocker to date. But rather than using a Adblock Plus browser directly we use libadblockplus <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[16]</ref>, a C++ wrapper around Adblock Plus, developed by the same project. This allows us to classify Web objects from the traces in an off-line fashion without the need to operate a full browser. A summary of the classification methodology is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>We use Bro <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[48]</ref> HTTP analyzer to extract information about all HTTP transactions in network traces. This information includes i) both the Host and the URI fields in the request header, ii) the referer field in the request, iii) the Content-Type field in the response, and iv) the Content-Length field present in HTTP responses. We also extended the Bro analyzer to parse and include v) the Location header field present in response headers that relate to HTTP redirections.</p><p>Processing passive traces with Bro gives us a list of Web objects. We then invoke libadblockplus to classify each of these objects into ad and non-ad objects. However, libadblockplus cannot properly classify a URL as an advert using only the information that is self-contained in the URL's string. Many rules in the filter lists apply to specific combinations of domains, i.e., a Web object hosted in a specific (advertiser) domain from a specific (publisher) domain. Thus, libadblockplus requires the following information to properly classify a URL: i) the requested URL itself, ii) the rest of URLs in the Web page that triggered the request that is currently processed, and iii) the type of the content that is being requested e.g., document, script, stylesheet, image, media or object.</p><p>As mentioned above, the Adblock Plus browser extension relies on information contained in the DOM tree. We, in contrast, have only the information available in the HTTP headers. However, we can still use this information to obtain a partial view of the relationships between the Web objects in a Web page. We tackle this</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Identification of ad-blocker users</head><p>To identify if an end user has installed an ad-blocker we rely on the following observation: a browser with such an extension should issue less ad requests than a browser without any ad-blocker. In other words, a low number of ad requests is a strong indicator for the presence of an ad-blocker.</p><p>Hence, we have to identify all requests of a particular end user and compute the ratio of ad requests. The ratio for an end user depends on i) the browser configuration, i.e., whether there is an ad-blocker installed and, if so which ad-blocker with which configuration, and ii) which sites the user visits. Given that many of the most popular sites do indeed have extraneous content <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">25]</ref>, the likelihood that an active user visits such a site is substantial. Thus, we can use an active measurement study (see §4) to find ad-ratio thresholds that distinguish between ad-blocker and non adblocker users.</p><p>Although our primary goal is to identify any ad-blocker user, we can additionally rely on plugin updates to identify specific adblockers like Adblock Plus or Ghostery. For instance, the former plugin regularly checks for updates of the filter lists to which the user has subscribed. The update frequency is driven by the expiration time specific to each list, e.g., EasyList has a soft expiration date of 4 days [1] and EasyPrivacy soft-expires already after a single day <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. In fact, the Adblock Plus contact frequency is quite high: typically upon browser bootstrap or once per day <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[46]</ref>. Hence, monitoring connections to Adblock Plus servers is a good indicator for the presence of Adblock Plus. To identify Adblock Plus servers in the traces we rely on multiple DNS resolvers to obtain an up-to-date list of Adblock Plus server IPs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">METHOD EVALUATION &amp; VALIDATION</head><p>We complement our passive analysis with an active measurement study that has two goals i) validate that our methodology can classify ad traffic, and ii) identify ad-ratio thresholds to differentiate between end users that browse the Web with an ad-blocker and those who do not.</p><p>Accordingly, we instruct a popular Web browser to fetch Web sites using different configuration modes, e.g., with Adblock Plus enabled or disabled. In parallel we capture the browsers network traffic with tcpdump and apply the above methodology to the passive traces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Active measurement setup</head><p>We instrument the widely used browser Chromium with Selenium <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[20]</ref> to crawl the Alexa top 1000 sites. We run the browser in a virtual frame-buffer on a dedicated GNU/Linux machine connected to a university campus network. For each URL in the Alexa top list we start a new browser instance with an empty cache, wait 5 seconds before starting a tcpdump traffic trace, load the URL and wait another 5 seconds before closing the browser and tcpdump.</p><p>For each URL we repeat this process 7 times, once for each of the following browser profiles: Vanilla: We do not activate any plugin. AdBP-{Ads|Privacy|Paranoia}: We activate the Adblock Plus plugin and configure three separate profiles using the following lists i) the EasyList and non-intrusive advertisements (Ads), ii) EasyPrivacy (Privacy), and iii) EasyList and EasyPrivacy (Paranoia). Ghostery-{Ads|Privacy|Paranoia}: We activate the Ghostery plugin and configure three separate profiles, which block the following object categories i) Advertisements (Ads), ii) Privacy (Privacy), and iii) all categories, including Analytics, Beacons and social media widgets (Paranoia).</p><p>This experiment results in seven sets of passive traces for each of the top-1000 Alexa Web sites corresponding to the seven different browser profiles viz., with and without Adblock Plus and/or Ghostery enabled. With this information-the configuration of the Web browser that produced the network trace-we can apply our methodology to each set of traces and, thereby, assess the accuracy of our methodology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Impact of ad-blockers on traffic</head><p>As described in §3, we use Bro HTTP analyzer to extract the HTTP information from the set of traces collected during the experiment. We then classify the requests using libadblockplus. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> summarizes the total number of HTTP(S) requests in the traces and the corresponding classification of requests according to the filters of EasyList and EasyPrivacy.</p><p>Our first observation is that ad-blockers indeed significantly reduce the number of HTTP and HTTPS requests. For instance, in the AdBP-Paranoia mode the browser issues 9K less HTTP requests than in the Vanilla mode. The number of HTTP requests issued by a browser configured with Adblock Plus in the most aggressive mode is roughly 80% of the corresponding value for the Vanilla mode. In this context, 6% of the ad requests in the trace for the Vanilla mode either match a filter in EasyList (8.1%) or one in EasyPrivacy (8.3%). These observations are consistent with those reported in related work, e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">27]</ref>. The number of HTTPS connections follows likewise this trend, i.e., 2.9K connections less. This implies that browsers and servers also exchange ad traffic over HTTPS, a case not covered by our methodology.</p><p>The number of requests for both plugins configured in the Paranoia mode also differs. We remark that the numbers reported in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> are subject to configurations and do not strictly reflect the actual filtering performance of each plugin; rather, they reflect the existence of the filtering process.</p><p>Nonetheless, Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows that the number of objects classified as ad requests is a strong indicator for the presence of an adblocker. As expected, ad-blockers hinder many requests from being issued and thus, the number of identified ads with our methodology is small (indicated in bold numbers in the table). In the absence of an ad-blocker, the number of ad requests is significantly larger (see the vanilla browser configuration row).</p><p>We note that our approach mis-classifies a small number of requests. We indicate false positives with a * in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. False positives are requests that the Adblock Plus browser plugin does not block but our methodology classifies as ad-related objects. We manually investigate these cases and offer the following explana- Our methodology maps this request to the content type object, but a manual inspection of the object reveals that this object is in reality a JavaScript object. Remapping the content type to script triggers an exception filter that prevents the mis-classification. In fact, the main source of mis-classifications are URLs to JavaScript objects where the Content-Type field is set to text/html. Modern browsers circumvent this problem since they infer the type of the object without relying on the HTTP headers. Our methodology has to rely on the HTTP headers and thereby is affected by such inconsistencies.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • % of ad-requests V a n i l l a A d B P -P a G h o s t e</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Identifying ad-blocker users</head><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> illustrates the effectiveness of our approach for classifying ad requests in a network trace in a fashion similar to an adblocker. Next, we tackle the question from §3.2: what ratio of ad to non-ad requests is a useful indicator to infer ad-blocker usage? To answer this question we show in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> a series of box-plots for the ratio of ad requests across browser configurations (for space reasons we only include the results for Vanilla, AdBP-Pa and the Ghostery-Pa configuration modes). For each of these three modes we execute three experiments. We randomly select 1, 5 and 10 sites of the Alexa top 1K list, and compute three ratios of ad requests. Our motivation for choosing different number of sites is to represent users with different levels of activity. We repeat this 1K times. When comparing the box plots we can see that the ad-ratios differ significantly if the number of page loads is sufficiently large, i.e., when users are active. Accordingly, we use a discrimination threshold of 5% when the number of requests is sufficiently large, e.g., 10 page loads or 1K requests. Using a slightly higher or lower threshold does not alter the results significantly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">DATA SETS</head><p>We had access to two anonymized traces from a Residential Broadband Network (RBN) of a large European ISP. These two traces were collected within two customer aggregation networks in the same city. The first trace was captured at a low level which carries the traffic of about 7.5K DSL customers to the Internet. The second trace was captured at the next higher level, which carries the traffic of about 19.7K DSL customers. The up-link speeds are 3 and 10 Gbps, respectively. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> reports the dates when the traces were collected.  The monitoring infrastructure uses Endace DAG network monitoring cards <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[11]</ref>. These cards support a port-based classification, which is appropriate for HTTP(S) traffic (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">51]</ref>). Hence, HTTP traffic can be associated to TCP traffic from (or to) port 80. Likewise, HTTPS traffic relates to EasyList downloads can be associated to TCP traffic from (or to) port 443 from (or to) IPs in the list of Adblock Plus servers that host these lists. We obtained this list with active measurements (see §3.2) before and after the trace was captured. They did not exhibit differences.</p><p>Like many other ISPs, most of the customers of this ISP have a home gateway at their premises that performs Network Address Translation (NAT). These gateways multiplex many user devices, and thereby also browsers, to a single IP address. To report the prevalence of ad-blockers in residential broadband networks we have to identify unique devices and more specifically Web browsers. Maier et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[45]</ref> showed that a good indicator for separating HTTP traffic from multiple devices behind the same NAT is the HTTP User-Agent strings of the browsers (in contrast to the strings used, e.g., by software update tools or media players). The rationale behind it is that the User-Agent string includes information about the operating system, browser version, etc. Thus, we use the pair end-host IP and User-Agent to separate our data by end device. Given that most ISPs assign addresses to their customers dynamically, we can only associate an IP address to a household for traces with short duration.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> gives an overview of the two traces collected in this ISP. The first data set corresponds to a 4-day long trace of the smallest set of customers for which we only capture HTTP traffic, i.e., 7.5K . The second trace is a shorter trace, but it captures peak time traffic for a larger number of end users, i.e., 19.7K . In the remainder of this work we use the latter trace to elaborate on ad-blocker usage, and the former to describe general characteristics of ad traffic.</p><p>We pay careful attention to respect and preserve the privacy of end users in our study. First and foremost, we process, aggregate, and analyze the data on a private and secured infrastructure. Second, the IP addresses of the end users are anonymized at the time of the packet capture, i.e., the real IP addresses of the end users were never stored to disk and are unknown to us. Third, we automate the ad classification process which, when completed, truncates every URL in the logs to a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), thereby removing sensitive information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">AD-BLOCKER USAGE IN THE WILD</head><p>Using the methodology from §3 we can proceed to assess adblocker usage in the residential broadband network trace RBN-2. To infer if an end user<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> is using an ad-blocker, we use the following two indicators: i.e., i) the ratio of ad to non-ad requests, and ii) automatic EasyList downloads by Adblock Plus (see §3.2).</p><p>To this end, we have first to identify browsers in the trace. Along with browsers, residential broadband networks indeed manifest a rich and complex mix of other HTTP-based applications. To illustrate this mix, we show in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> the total number of retrieved HTTP objects vs. the number of retrieved ads<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref>,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> for each IP address and User-Agent pair on a log-log scale. Due to the large number of data points, we use a heat map to capture the density within each area of the plot. We find in total 508.7K tuples of IP and User-Agent in RBN-2. We see the whole range: some pairs only account for a few requests while others issue orders of magnitude more requests. Overall, we observe 18.89% ad requests in this data set.</p><p>Most relevant for us is that there is a substantial number of pairs that request many Web objects but hardly any ads. These are the ones in the lower right hand side of Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. They are most likely browsers that have an ad-blocker installed or visit only sites without advertisements.</p><p>However, there are many more points in this plot than we would have expected given the number of monitored DSL-lines (19.7K different households); more than 25 different User-Agent strings per household in average. Upon closer manual inspection we find pairs that identify devices like consoles and Smart TVs. On the other hand, given that most modern end-user devices run many HTTP-based applications in parallel, we also find pairs that correspond to desktop-based gaming applications or mobile apps (these applications use custom User-Agent strings). Since advertisements typically appear within Web sites and mobile applications, we can discard User-Agent strings that do not correspond to this type of applications. Moreover, since in-app ads differ substantially from browser ads, we limit our analysis to Web browsers in this paper. Namely, we restrict our analysis to sessions for which we can associate the User-Agent either to a well-known desktop browser or to a mobile device browser. Indeed, a manual inspection of the pairs shows that some of the points on the right hand side of Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> correspond to mobile apps, which we do not want to consider. Thus, we next use the User-Agent strings to identify popular Web browsers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Annotation of active users</head><p>Our approach is to manually label the User-Agent strings in a subset of the data. We use this as a starting point to subsequently classify the entire data set. Our starting subset is the active users. More precisely, we select tuples that issue more than 1K requests (the heavy hitters) e.g., those corresponding to a few page retrievals. As a result, we obtain a more tractable set of 15.2K pairs, with 1.6K unique User-Agent strings. Among this set of strings, we are able to manually annotate 601, which appear in 9.6K of the heavy-hitter tuples.</p><p>With this set of annotated strings, we proceed to classify browsers in the entire set of pairs. We identify 44.1K additional browsers. All these browsers generate 57.2% of the observed requests and 82.2% of the ad requests in the RBN-2 trace. As expected, the heavy hitters issue most of these requests, i.e., 50.6% requests and 72.5% ad requests. We thus continue our study with the set of heavy hitters, i.e., the most active browsers.  We separate these browsers into i) mobile and ii) desktop versions. We identify 1.9K browsers in the mobile category. They correspond to iPhone and Android phones. These browsers issue 5.9% of both the ad and the total number of requests in the RBN-2 trace. The desktop category accounts for the rest of requests and it is constituted by 7.7K browsers which we further separate into Firefox <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr">423)</ref>, Chrome (2,267), Internet Explorer (654) and Safari (1,324) browsers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Inferring ad-blocker usage</head><p>With this set of annotated browsers, we continue our analysis of ad-blocker usage at our vantage point. We use two indicators: (a) ratio of ad requests, which applies to any ad-blocker, and (b) HTTPS connections to check for filter updates, which is specific to Adblock Plus. First indicator: low ratio of ad requests. We use this indicator to detect the presence of an ad-blocker from the HTTP requests. Our motivation for this indicator stems from the insights of the active measurement study (see §4). The rationale is that users that installed an ad-blocker retrieve significantly smaller number of ads than those that have not.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of the percentage of ad requests per browser for the annotated set of active browsers. Since not all filter lists are installed by default, e.g., the EasyPrivacy list, we only consider ads classified by EasyList, which indeed is installed by default. In this context, 40% of the Firefox and Chrome active browsers issue less than 1% ad-requests; they qualify as ad-blocker candidates. By contrast, only for 18% of the Safari and 8% of the IE instances the ratio of ad requests is below the threshold. This can be due to the fact that installing and ad-blocker like Adblock Plus in these browsers is a bit more cumbersome and thus might deter their usage. Based on these observations and the results from the active measurement study (see §4), we set the threshold for identifying ad-blocking browsers to 5%, to i) tolerate mis-classifications due to content type (see §4.2), and ii) take into consideration users that disable blocking for specific sites. Second indicator: downloads of filter lists. As mentioned above, Adblock Plus frequently checks for updates to the filter lists. These updates typically occur during browser bootstrap or when a list soft-expires (see §3.2). Thus, we can estimate the number of Adblock Plus users by monitoring EasyList downloads. However, the Adblock Plus browser extension uses HTTPS to download the lists. Hence, we cannot differentiate between multiple browsers hidden behind a single IP (e.g., in the presence of a NAT), since the User-Agent is not visible. Instead, we can only report the number of households in which there is at least one device with an Adblock Plus installation.</p><p>We find several thousands of HTTPS connections to Adblock Plus servers in the RBN-2 trace. These connections are issued from 19.7% of the households in this data set. This number is slightly larger than what has been previously reported. Metwalley et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[46]</ref> reports that the fraction of households with at least one device using an Adblock Plus plugin is between 10% and 18%. As stated previously, this information is not sufficient to discern browsers that likely run an ad-blocker, but we can leverage it as indicator and correlate it with the ad-ratio indicator. Correlation of indicators to assess Adblock Plus usage. We proceed to correlate the ad-ratio with the EasyList downloads indicator. We obtain four classes as the cross product corresponding to a combination of the two indicator values. We summarize these 4 classes along with their corresponding traffic statistics in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>. We find that 46.8% of the 9.6K active browsers neither classify as an ad-blocker candidate nor contact Adblock Plus servers (denoted in the table with the type name A). The orthogonal case, i.e., those annotated with type C, constitute 22.2% of the active browsers population. As expected, this class is dominated by Firefox and Chrome browser User-Agents. These two types of browsers represent 51% and 32% of the occurrences respectively. Safari on the other hand accounts for 11%. In practice 31% of the Firefox and Chrome instances fall into this class and thereby they probably have Adblock Plus installed. This share is slightly larger than the official statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">15]</ref>. This difference could be explained by a permissive threshold value or by a bias due to the population at our vantage point.</p><p>There are many browsers for which the download information and the ratio of ad requests produce inconsistent outcomes (types B and D). Type-D browsers exhibit ad-blocker-like behavior, albeit they did not attempt to download EasyList. Browsers in this category sum up to 15.3% of the active browser population. There are two possible explanations for this apparent inconsistency. The end users might i) have installed a different plugin, e.g., Ghostery or NoScript, or ii) have requested content from sites with few advertisements. Based on the observation that other ad-blockers are much less prevalent than Adblock Plus <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[46]</ref>, we speculate that the most likely cause for this inconsistency is the latter scenario.</p><p>The second type of inconsistency relates to type-B browsers. They add up to 15.7% of the active browser population. For these instances we observe an EasyList download but the ratio of ad requests is higher than 5%. The most plausible explanation for this  contradictory information is that there may be many users in the same household, some of them using Adblock Plus and others not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Adblock Plus configurations</head><p>There are various filter lists with different objectives available for Adblock Plus users. Most notably, there are lists to i) block and hide adverts (e.g., EasyList), ii) whitelist adverts (list of non-intrusive ads), and iii) protect user privacy by blocking Web trackers (e.g., EasyPrivacy). To further elaborate on ad-blocker usage we dissect our corpus of adverts by the list that triggered the classification.</p><p>Our first observation is an unexpected high share of ad requests among the likely Adblock Plus users (type-C). For this observation, we refer to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>, which reports the contribution of each user category to the total number of ad requests in RBN-2. One would expect the relative share of ad requests for Adblock Plus users to be close to 0%. Instead, we find a share of 6.5% ad requests. The explanation for this high percentage is that our threshold-based classification is based on EasyList hits. We use this list because it is by default activated upon Adblock Plus installation; along with the list of non-intrusive advertisements whitelist. However, the numbers that we report in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref> correspond to all hits, including those triggered by the other lists, i.e., EasyList derivatives and EasyPrivacy. Indeed, we observe that 82.3% and 11.1% of the positive classifications for Adblock Plus users relate to filters in EasyPrivacy and in the list of non-intrusive ads respectively. This observation motivates the consequent analysis about the lists that Adblock Plus users subscribe to. EasyPrivacy. Metwalley et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[46]</ref> report that 77% of the users contact a tracker immediately after they start browsing the Web. We can leverage this observation to estimate the extent to which (if at all) an Adblock Plus user interacts with a tracker. Our assumption is that such interactions should only occur for those users who do not install the EasyPrivacy list. We observe that only 0.1% of the non-adblock users do not issue requests matching EasyPrivacy filter rules, i.e., almost every user contacts a tracker. By contrast, the corresponding fraction for Adblock Plus users is 5.1%. If we use a more permissive value, i.e., 10 requests to account for misclassifications, then the percentage of Adblock Plus users that likely installed EasyPrivacy is 13.1%. Overall, we see a consistent difference around 15% using different values.</p><p>In light of these observations, we speculate that most Adblock Plus users, i.e., more than 85%, do not subscribe to EasyPrivacy but just to EasyList. In fact, this argument is supported by a blog post from the EasyList maintainers, which reported back in 2011 that only 4.1% of their 12 million users subscribed to EasyPrivacy <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. The key take-away is that it seems that Adblock Plus users install this software to block annoying advertisements but do not configure it to protect their privacy.</p><p>Non-intrusive adverts. We conduct a similar analysis to elaborate on the prevalence of the non-intrusive ads list. We find that Adblock Plus users issue 7.9% of the total number of whitelisted requests. In comparison, non-adblocker users generate 37.9% of this type of requests, despite the fact that the population of this set is almost twice the population of the former set. This first observation highlights the importance of this list for advertisers and publishers alike, i.e., Adblock Plus users still generate a significant fraction of ad requests.</p><p>When trying to elucidate whether an Adblock Plus user opts out of this whitelist, we find that 11.8% of the Adblock Plus users issue no requests of this kind. The corresponding percentage for nonadblock users is 6.1%. The reason why many non-adblock users do not issue ad requests of this kind is because this type of adverts are less prevalent (see §7). At less than 10 issued whitelisted requests, the difference between both groups is roughly 20%, a pattern that is repeated across different values. This is, perhaps, an indication that at most 20% of the users actually deactivate this list, thus disabling the whitelisting of adverts that conform the non-intrusive ads guidelines. We emphasize a word of caution on this last statement and remark that corroborating this observation would require to conduct an analysis of the browsing patterns of Adblock Plus users.</p><p>Summary: Our main observation is that a significant fraction of the most active users in our traces browse the Web with Adblock Plus, i.e., 22.2% of the active users. This extension is especially popular among Chrome and Firefox users, i.e., 30%; and less popular among Safari and Internet Explorer users. We find that most Adblock Plus users do not install the EasyPrivacy list that protects them from trackers. Hence, it seems that Adblock Plus users are mostly interested in blocking ads rather than protecting their privacy. However, this might be an awareness problem. We also find that most Adblock Plus users probably do not opt out from the list of acceptable ads (non-intrusive ads) which is enabled by default. In fact, we find that the set of heavy-hitter Adblock Plus users still generates a substantial number of such ads, even when compared to non-adblock users. This observation suggests that conforming to the acceptable ads guidelines may benefit some players in the advertising domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">ADS IN THE WILD</head><p>One under-explored aspect of the ad-scape is the prevalence of ads that end users experience during regular browsing sessions. Most previous work (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">42]</ref>) has relied on active measurements and therefore cannot capture how the average user interacts with the ad-scape while browsing the Web. Thus, in this section we use our passive measurement methodology to study basic properties of ad traffic in the wild. Concretely, we investigate i) basic ad-traffic properties, ii) content-related properties of the observed ads, and iii) whitelisted ads.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Ad-traffic characterization</head><p>To comment on the temporal characteristics of the ad-traffic we conduct our analysis on the RBN-1 trace, as it spans a longer period than RBN-2. We find that 17.25% and 1.13% of the requests and bytes respectively correspond to ad objects in the RBN-1 trace. To put these numbers into perspective, we refer to our active measurement results (see Section 4). For the Alexa top 1K sites we classified 16.4% of the total requests as adverts (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p>We highlight the variability of ad traffic in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>(a), where we depict a time series for the number of requested Web objects vs. the number of ad requests using bins of 1 hour. The non-ad re-  Ad traffic exhibits a daily pattern, both in terms of number of requests and in terms of its ratio to all requests in the trace.</p><p>quests manifest the characteristic time of day and of week pattern of residential networks. During the night there are relatively fewer requests and the busy time is in the evenings, right before midnight. On the weekend there are fewer requests than during the week, in particular on Saturday. Moreover, the lunch break is also clearly visible. Surprisingly, the ad-related requests do not show the same pattern. To visualize these differences we plot in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>(b) the percentages of ad requests and ad bytes over time. Here we only consider ads reported by filters in EasyList and EasyPrivacy (excluding non-intrusive ads). The figure reveals that, surprisingly, the ratio of ad requests also manifests a diurnal pattern, ranging from 6% up to 12%, instead of having a constant rate.</p><p>To explain this surprising diurnal pattern we offer two possible explanations. The first one is that users request different content and that the pages that serve this content have a different ratio of advertisements. For example, streaming video chunks might result in a very low ratio of ads. Another example are Web site categories, e.g., the news category has more objects than other categories (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[27]</ref> for a detailed study about the complexity of popular Web sites). Our second explanation for the diurnal pattern is that the share of ad-blockers users varies at different times of the day. We leverage the classification described in §6.1 to investigate this for RBN-2. Our finding is that at peak time the number of non-adblocker active users is twice the number of active Adblock Plus users. By contrast, during the off hours the number of active Adblock Plus and non-adblocker users is roughly the same.  Our next question relates to the type of adverts that we see. To answer it we dissect the ad requests by the list that triggers the classification. EasyList causes significantly more hits than EasyPrivacy, which in turn triggers more classifications than the non-intrusive ads list. More precisely, EasyList classifies 55.9% of the ad requests in RBN-1. The EasyPrivacy is responsible for 35.1% of the requests. The non-intrusive ads list triggers the remaining matches. We observe the same trend in RBN-2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Ad-related objects by Content-Type</head><p>Next, we consider the types of the requested ads (e.g., image vs. video ads) and their prevalence. Therefore, we analyze the Content-Type of the Web objects in RBN-1. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4</ref> shows the most prevalent objects according to the MIME type reported by Bro HTTP analyzer along with their corresponding contribution to the total traffic and to the ad traffic in terms of requests and bytes. Most ads are either image/gif, text/html, or text/plain. The fraction of bytes is dominated by text/html objects, while the fraction of bytes for the type image/gif is relatively small. The latter is not surprising given that many of the ad objects used to track users are small, i.e., 43 bytes. At the other extreme are videos (i.e., video/mp4, video/xflv), flash objects (i.e., x-shockwave), and non-gif images such as image/jpg. All these types contribute a higher fraction of bytes than requests.</p><p>To highlight the different distributions, we show in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>(a) the density of the ad-object size on a log scale separated by the Content-Type. We consider four different classes: images (gif, jpeg, and png), text (html, plain), video (mp4, flv), and applications (xml, flash). The density of the logarithm highlights that most images are very small (43 bytes), while most videos are rather large (&gt; 1 MByte). If we compare these values to the typical object size of non-ad objects, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>(b), we notice significant differences. Most non-ad videos are smaller than ad videos, while most non-ad images are larger. One of the reasons is that most videostreaming providers split regular videos into multiple chunks and each chunk corresponds to one Web object. Since most video ads only last for 15-45 seconds and advertisers expect end users to see the complete video stream, chunking may be considered to be unnecessary. Moreover, most ad videos typically have a length in the same order of magnitude. Surprisingly, we see that non-ad text objects are likely to be smaller. These are likely requests involving high-interactive sites, e.g., for auto-completion or for suggestions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Non-intrusive advertisements</head><p>Next, we look at the relevance of the list of non-intrusive ads. On the one hand, ad-blockers threaten the financial backbone of the Web. On the other hand, they also ensure some balance by preventing ads from becoming too intrusive <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[19]</ref>. The result is the non-intrusive ads list which whitelists adverts and is enabled by default. Indeed, according to Financial Times <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[6]</ref> some companies including Google, Microsoft and Amazon, pay money to Adblock Plus to be whitelisted. But what is the effect of this list? Given our vantage point and our ability to classify traffic the same way Adblock Plus does, we can investigate the impact of the whitelist using the RBN-2 trace. We first ask how many of the ad-related requests match the whitelist. This is the case for 9.2% of the ad requests. While this number may seem low at first, we calculated it using also the hits triggered by an EasyPrivacy filter. If we restrict ourselves to ad requests identified by EasyList and non-intrusive ads, then the percentage that is subject to whitelisting grows up to 15.3% viz., these adverts would not be blocked by the default Adblock Plus installation. List accuracy. However, these numbers likely overestimate the real impact that this list has. We manually inspected the filter rules and found some anomalies: some rules are overly general, e.g., they whitelist an entire domain rather than specifically addressing ad-related parts. For example, many requests match the @@||gstatic.comˆ$document filter rule, which whitelists the entire gstatic.com domain. This domain hosts unsuspected fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) e.g., fonts.gstatic.com and services such as Street View. Hence, this filter list may also whitelist non-ad-related traffic. On the other hand, and referring to the previous example, font objects may very well be necessary to display an advertisement e.g., Google's AdSense.</p><p>Therefore, we ask how much of the whitelisted traffic would have been otherwise blocked by a blacklist, i.e., when Adblock Plus users choose to stop allowing non-intrusive advertisements. The ratio is surprisingly small: only 57.3% of the whitelisted requests would have been blacklisted. Moreover, 23.2% of those would be filtered by EasyPrivacy. These observations highlight that the list of non-intrusive ads should be handled with caution when trying to identify adverts. In the remainder of this subsection we consider only those whitelisted requests which "match the blacklist". Publishers. Recall, we can identify the main page that originated the request using the methodology described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[56]</ref>. We find 991 unique FQDNs with more than 1K blacklisted requests to which we can associate 84.0% of the total requests blacklisted by EasyList and its language derivatives. The non-intrusive ads list whitelists 8.6% of these requests.</p><p>We find that some sites in the dating, shopping, translation, audio and video streaming categories, as well as some sites in the mixed content categories benefit the most from the whitelist <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> . On the other side, we find that most of the sites without whitelisted requests belong to the adult content category, followed by Webs in the mixed content category. Here, we also find another one in the file sharing / video streaming category. It is not surprising to see that these sites are not whitelisted. However, it is surprising to find a few instances of popular sites in the news category (in fact they appear in the Alexa top 1K). Thus, an Adblock Plus user would block every ad-related request related to these sites. We manually checked these sites with Adblock Plus to corroborate this observation. Ad-tech companies. We repeat the same analysis to shed light on how the non-intrusive ads list affects ad-tech companies. We select FQDNs with more than 10K blacklisted requests. These domains sum up to 82.1% of the total blacklisted requests, from which 11.1% are whitelisted.</p><p>Like in the publisher case, we see a mix. The list of non-intrusive ads whitelists 47.9% of Google's requests (recall we exclude HTTPS traffic). Some of its services do get most of their requests through (e.g., analytics, ad-services) while others do not. While the bulk of these requests corresponds to Google, we also see other companies benefiting from the non-intrusive ads list. One particular example is a technology/Internet Web site that operates its own ad-platform, for which the non-intrusive ads list whitelists 94% of the otherwise blacklisted requests. Summary. Our main observation is that a significant share of the requests and bytes in a residential broadband network are due to online advertising e.g., 17.25% and 1.13% of the requests and bytes respectively for trace RBN-1. We observe that ad-related traffic exhibits a different diurnal pattern than regular traffic. Moreover, ad objects have more characteristic sizes than non-ad objects. In ads gif images dominate in terms of number of requests, followed by text/plain objects, which in turn dominate the share of ad traffic in terms of bytes.</p><p>Moreover, our analysis of the potential benefits of whitelisting i.e., the list of non-intrusive ads, shows that some content publishers substantially benefit from this list, while others not. Among the latter are sites in the adult category. However, we also find popular sites in the news category among them. Some ad-tech companies also benefit from this list; for instance Google, which carries the bulk of the whitelisted traffic and for which 47.9% of the ad-related traffic is whitelisted. Another example is a popular technology/Internet Web site. This site operates its own ad-platform, for which the non-intrusive ads list whitelists 94% of the otherwise blacklisted ad traffic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">ADVERTISEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE</head><p>Next, we turn our attention to the infrastructure that serves adrelated objects. This study is motivated by the need to better understand the ad-scape <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[7]</ref>, a complex and diverse ecosystem composed by hundreds of companies that provide numerous services and closely interact with each other, e.g., ad-networks and exchanges. In this section we study the server-side infrastructure from the perspective of an end user using Adblock Plus. Namely, which infrastructures end users contact, how often and how many, and if we can find signs of real-time bidding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">Server side ad infrastructure</head><p>The first aspect of the ad-scape infrastructure are the characteristics of the Web servers that deliver ad objects to the end users. We use the term server to refer to an IP address. Note, that any of these addresses may on the one hand be only a front-end of a large server farm or on the other hand a server that is co-located with other virtual servers. We find 29.0K and 19.6K servers in RBN-1 that serve ad objects according to EasyList and respectively EasyPrivacy. Some servers (i.e., 5.2K) serve objects matching both lists. As one may expect-like almost every other distribution in the Internet-the distribution of requests per server is heavy-tailed (not shown). If we use only EasyList driven classification, the median number of ad objects per server is 7, the mean is 438, and the 90 th / 95 th / 99 th percentiles are respectively 320 / 1.1K / 6.8K ad objects. The busiest server in the RBN-1 trace, which is operated by Liverail, received 312.3K ad requests in total.</p><p>The second aspect relates to the objects served by these servers: do they exclusively serve ad-related objects or do they serve regular content as well? One argument for the first case is that by now there is a separate infrastructure and market dedicated to the ad-tech ecosystem. The opposing argument is that one can take advantage of synergy effects by delivering ads via the same infrastructure as regular content. We find 222.2K servers in RBN-1. For 21.1% of them we classify at least one request as an ad object. These IPs serve 54.3% of the total number of non-ad objects in RBN-1. However, about 6.9K servers deliver exclusively ad objects. Here, we consider that a server is exclusively dedicated to deliver ad objects if our methodology identifies more than 90% of its requests as adverts. We consider this reasonable since our methodology may not be able to identify all ads and thus provides only a lower bound. We use the previous threshold to find 10.1K ad servers, which altogether deliver 32.7% of the adverts. Likewise, we define the notion of "tracking server" to refer to the set of servers that only serve adrelated objects identified using EasyPrivacy. We find 3.3K of these servers, which deliver 18.8% of all the ad-related objects reported by EasyPrivacy.</p><p>Next, we consider the Autonomous Systems (ASes) which host the ad servers since we want to understand if ad traffic is highly concentrated in a few large infrastructures. To this end we use the global routing information in order to determine the AS that is responsible for the IPs of the servers. The top-10 ASes contribute to the majority of the ad objects in the RBN-1 trace, namely 56.8%. Among these ASes, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">5</ref>, we find four categories of players: search engines, cloud providers, CDNs and two ad-tech ASes, i.e., AppNexus and Criteo. Google leads this ranking with 21.0% and 33.9% of all ad requests and bytes, respectively. The relative ratio of ad objects for Google traffic is 50.7% and 15.9% of the total ad requests and bytes to this AS. This ratio may at first seem large and one may ask if our methodology is sound. However, recall that Google switched many of its services to HTTPSapparently mostly for their "core" content, i.e., search results and video streaming.  Among the other top contributors are also cloud providers, including Amazon, Hetzner, and MyLoc. Finding cloud providers in the list of top contributors highlights that clouds are also used by the advertisement industry. While some companies opt to manage their own AS to better control and operate their ad infrastructure, others opt to take advantage of the massive amount of resources and flexibility that cloud providers offer. Finally, CDNs like Akamai (which deploys caches within ISPs or within their own address space) and SoftLayer form the third category of ASes that serve ad objects. The presence of CDNs in this list of top contributors supports the argument that the same infrastructure that serves regular content delivers also ad objects.</p><p>The last category of ASes in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">5</ref> includes the relatively unknown ASes AppNexus and Criteo. These are companies whose main business is online advertising. They operate just a few servers (those visible in our traces), e.g., 39 for Criteo. Excluding the landing pages of these companies, we expect these ASes to mostly serve adverts, which is not strictly the case. While we classify 50.2% of the AppNexus bytes as advertisement traffic, the ratio of the requests is much lower (32.9%). Hence, our methodology probably underestimates the number of ad requests for this AS. One possible explanation for this mismatch is that the lists are conservative and do not address all possible URLs to prevent blacklisting desired traffic. Another possible explanation is that fetching an advert can require several JavaScript executions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[25]</ref>) and thereby involve multiple non-ad requests as well. If we do not classify all requests in this chain as ad objects, except for one, the ratio of adverts per AS may decrease. In contrast to AppNexus, the percentage of ad traffic for Criteo in terms of requests and bytes is as high as 78.1% and 88.2%, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2">Ad-exchanges and real-time bidding</head><p>Real-time bidding (RTB) refers to the process of selling advertisement space on a per-impression basis, i.e., per user. This is a standard process in today's Internet (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">25]</ref>). The process works as follows. When a user requests an advert from an ad exchange, this exchange contacts multiple advertisers and the highest bidder among them wins the right to display the ad to the user. Advertisers can use many pieces of information to decide on their bid, including but not limited to geographical location, age, or gender. Usually, exchanges wait for around 100 ms before closing the auction <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[14]</ref>. Earlier work revealed the complexity of the ad-ecosystem which involves multiple players <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">49]</ref>.</p><p>With our traces we can identify real-time bidding in the wild by leveraging a threshold of 100 ms for answering a request. The key observation here is that the bidding threshold adds extra delay to the HTTP hand-shake i.e., the time difference between the first HTTP response and the first HTTP request packet. If the delay is larger than 100 ms it may be due to RTB. However, it may also be due to large network delays. To avoid mis-classifications we use the TCP hand-shake time-the difference between the TCP SYN-ACK and the TCP SYN packets-as a proxy for the network round trip time (RTT) to the server. Note, that given the location of our monitor within the aggregation network, the TCP hand-shake time only captures the wide area delays and thus automatically removes access network variations. Likewise, we remove biases due to the servers' locations viz., otherwise data in Europe can be expected to be served faster than that in the US or even Asia. Finally, if the HTTP object is fetched via a persistent connection we still use the TCP hand-shake time from this connection as the delays usually do not vary that significantly within a few seconds-the expected durations of these persistent connections.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> shows the density of the logarithm of the difference between the HTTP and TCP hand-shake times for the RBN-2 trace, dissected into ad and non-ad HTTP transactions. The first observation is that most of the hand-shake time differences are small, i.e., 1 ms. They relate to noise on the network path or to the processing overhead at the server to determine the HTTP response. The second observation is that while most of the non-ad objects have a short hand-shake time, namely less than 10 ms, ads havemore often than non-ads-larger hand-shake times. This can be seen from the three clear modes at 1 ms, 10 ms and 120 ms in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>. Compared to the non-ad objects a much larger share of ad objects exhibit a time difference between hand-shakes of more than 100 ms. This suggests the presence of back-offices, which include ad-exchanges to enable RTB and CDN to fetch objects from other distant servers <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[49]</ref>.</p><p>In fact, a manual inspection of the fully qualified domain names with such large hand-shake time differences (≥90 ms) reveals that these host names belong to ad-tech companies. To give an example, Google's DoubleClick, which offers RTB, contributes to 14.5% of the ads in this range. We also find other organizations offering RTB, e.g., Mopub (an RTB exchange for mobile in-app ads), the Rubicon project, Pubmatic or Criteo. Each of these organizations contributes roughly 5% to the total number of ads in this range. We also find Web tracking companies here, e.g., AddThis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary:</head><p>The ad infrastructure is mostly concentrated in a few ASes. Along with the expected players, e.g., Google, we observe that some ad-tech companies opt to either deploy their infrastructure in clouds or rely on CDNs, while others choose to manage their own AS, e.g., AppNexus and Criteo. Moreover, our data suggests that often the same infrastructure serves ad content as well as regular content, although some servers do indeed only serve adrelated content. Finally, we show that ad requests typically involve more back-end functionality, i.e., RTB, than non-ad requests, which again highlights the complexity underlying this ecosystem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">RELATED WORK</head><p>Content and services which are offered for free on the Internet are primarily monetized through online advertisement. A rich body of literature seeks to broadly understand the scale, dynamics, mechanisms, economics and general interest concerns related to advertisements on the Web. In this section we provide a summary of the most relevant lines of research concerning our work. Privacy and security aspects. The first and largest line of research includes studies that investigate the extent to which advertisements violate or are in conflict with end users' privacy <ref type="bibr">[35, 40,</ref> HTTP hand-shake -TCP hand-shake (ms)  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>36]</head><p>. Other studies propose to address these issues with privacyaware ad technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[37]</ref>. Security-centric studies report the prevalence and properties of malicious ads <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">43]</ref> and how to detect them <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">53]</ref>. Another related study concerns ad injecting browser extensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[57]</ref>. Other studies in this area paid special attention to targeted advertisements. The goal of these advertisements is to improve the effectiveness of the displayed ads to the user by matching the users' interest. Farahat et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[31]</ref> report an empirical evaluation and confirm the effectiveness of such advertisements. However, they also outlined ways in which more sophisticated targeting algorithms can cause harm. A large body of related work investigates privacy issues related to such user profiling, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">30]</ref>.

Krishnamurthy and Wills <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[41]</ref> investigate privacy diffusion in a longitudinal study, where they report about the increasing aggregation of user-related information by a few companies, as well as the limitations of existing protection techniques. Ad content and traffic characterization. Another notable line of research concerns the empirical characterization of the online advertisement landscape as well as its impact on Web site complexity. Guba et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[34]</ref> and Barford et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[25]</ref> characterize the ad-scape and highlight its underlying complexity. For instance, how ad exchanges enable real-time bidding to sell advert placements on a per user basis. Pujol et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[49]</ref> report the scale of such "hidden" interactions in a passive measurement study. However, advertising has also a very visible and pronounced influence on today's Web site complexity. Krishnamurthy and Wills <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[42]</ref> report that 25-30% of the Web objects in the Alexa most popular sites are extraneous. Mobile ads. There is one branch of related studies that focuses on advertising in the mobile domain. For example, Rodríguez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[55]</ref> quantify empirically mobile ad traffic via passive measurements. They reveal insights in the delivery mechanisms and outline means for optimized ad delivery. Targeting mechanisms used in the mobile world (e.g., location-based or user-based targeting) are not rare in today's Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[26]</ref>. In this regard, Nath <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[47]</ref> characterizes the ads displayed in mobile applications and reports about the information that these apps collect for targeted advertising. Moreover, energy consumption is an important topic in the mobile domain. Thus, some studies also devoted their attention to quantify the energy consumed by mobile advertisements <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">55]</ref>. In this regard, energy savings can be achieved by either pre-fetching ads <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[28]</ref>, or by blocking them to reduce radio traffic <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[50]</ref>.</p><p>Ad-blocking tech and tracking services. Butkiewicz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[27]</ref> report the share of extraneous content like ads in Web pages, and conclude that an ad-blocker can reduce the median number of requested objects per site by up to 75%. Guglemann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[33]</ref> investigate how to detect privacy-intrusive trackers and services from passive measurements. Kontaxis and Chew <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[39]</ref> describe a tracking protection mechanism for the Mozilla Firefox browser. Metwalley et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[46]</ref> contribute to this line of research with a passive measurement study about the extent to which Web trackers follow users in a residential broadband network. One of their findings is that while many users install Adblock Plus (roughly 18% of the households), most of them do not install an extension to protect their privacy. Previous research on online advertisements mainly focused on the empirical classification and characterization of advertisements via active measurement studies. In the passive measurement domain, related work has mostly focused on assessing privacy issues. Our work complements this body of work with a passive measurement study about advertisement traffic and ad-blocker usage in a residential broadband network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.">DISCUSSION</head><p>Our methodology leverages Adblock Plus functionality to provide insights into how ad-blockers may influence ad traffic dynamics and thereby, Web traffic. Although we show that the proposed methodology is capable of classifying ad requests in HTTP header traces, the classification approach comes at a price.</p><p>First of all, the classification of ad requests in header traces is complicated by the lack of structural information in the absence of the HTML payload; individual HTTP requests cannot be associated with Web objects (e.g., if an image is embedded in an iframe). This structural information is leveraged by Adblock Plus to improve the ad detection.</p><p>To tackle this challenge, we propose a methodology to partially reconstruct the Web page structure. Our methodology mainly employs the construction of a referrer map which associates individual requests (e.g., images, video, CSS, or JavaScript) with the accessed page. While this approach allows us to cluster related requests by page, it cannot reconstruct the entire Web page structure as needed by Adblock Plus to achieve higher detection accuracy. We suggest that a complete reconstruction is only possible by accessing the payload and executing the embedded JavaScript code, which might further manipulate the Web page structure.</p><p>Moreover, ad and non-ad objects can be transferred over HTTPS, or a mixture of HTTP and HTTPS (e.g., the landing page over HTTPS and the ads over HTTP). Since URLs in HTTPS transfers cannot be analyzed, we cannot always associate all requested objects with a page when constructing the referrer map of such a page. We are, thus, also unable to reason about the prevalence of ad traffic carried over HTTPS connections.</p><p>Second of all, our methodology can underestimate the volume of ad traffic in the presence of hidden ads, i.e., ads embedded in the main HTML of the page whose retrieval cannot be blocked. To identify these kind of ads we would require access to the entire HTML document (i.e., packet payload), which is not possible in our study. In cases where the payload can be analyzed, our methodology can be extended to detect hidden ads and address the challenges discussed above.</p><p>Lastly, we remark that there are many other ad-blockers available to end users besides Adblock Plus. We may not be able to detect users with different extensions (or even Adblock Plus with custom configurations) if they are tailored to block different objects than those affected by EasyList.</p><p>Furthermore, analyzing the number of ad requests (indicator 1, see §6.2) involves a set of potential biases: i) custom configurations and different filter lists (e.g., Web site whitelisting), ii) cascaded effects in which the blocked ad request who have triggered subsequent requests, or iii) the interaction of Adblock Plus with other blocking extensions. The immediate consequence of such biases is that we may underestimate the overall usage of ad blocking browser extensions. Moreover, caches and ad blocking middle-boxes or proxies can also decrease the number of observed ad requests. Consequently, confusing Adblock Plus instances with ad blocking proxies will lead to overestimation of the number of Adblock Plus users. To limit the effect of these biases, we introduced the filter list download indicator ( §6.2) which monitors updates triggered by Adblock Plus. However, since such updates are fetched via HTTPS, we cannot observe the User-Agent string required to differentiate different browsers behind a NAT.</p><p>We point out that this is a general limitation of the presented results, which we produced using the lists mentioned in Section 2, rather than of the applied methodology. We selected Adblock Plus based on its popularity among end users and note that our approach can be extended to consider other ad-blockers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">CONCLUSION</head><p>The goal of our work is to elucidate the interactions between the end users and the ad ecosystem. We conduct a passive measurement study using traces collected at a residential broadband network of a major European ISP with two objectives in mind. First, elaborate on the prevalence of ad-blockers to inform the ongoing debate regarding these tools. Second, complement related work by characterizing ad traffic at this vantage point using Adblock Plus functionality.</p><p>Our main observation is that a significant fraction (22%) of the most active users in our traces browse the Web with Adblock Plus. Surprisingly, we find little evidence that Adblock Plus users install the EasyPrivacy list of filters, which aims to protect end users' privacy by blocking trackers. Likewise, our results suggest that most Adblock Plus users do not opt out from the list of acceptable ads that is enabled by default in Adblock Plus. Based on these observations we conjecture that Adblock Plus users are mostly interested in blocking annoying ads rather than protecting their privacy, or that they are not aware of these options or how to change them.</p><p>Motivated by these observations, we also investigate the potential benefits of whitelisting, i.e., the list of non-intrusive ads. This list can be tremendously beneficial to some content publishers and ad-tech companies given the number of Adblock Plus users. We find that 9% of the ad-related requests are whitelisted by this list, while 56% and 35% of the ad-related requests are blacklisted by EasyList and EasyPrivacy, respectively.</p><p>Overall, we find that 18% and 1% (requests and bytes) of the total traffic at our vantage point relates to ad traffic. This share of ad traffic is distributed across different infrastructures, including content and cloud providers and CDNs. However, these infrastructures are concentrated in a few ASes. The top 10 ASes include the expected players, e.g., Google (which dominates the list in terms of requests and bytes). We further observe that some ad-tech companies opt to either deploy their infrastructure in clouds or rely on CDNs, while others choose to manage their own AS, e.g., App-Nexus and Criteo. Moreover, our data suggests that often the same infrastructure serves ad content as well as regular content, although some servers do indeed only serve ad-related content.</p><p>We also show that ad-related requests typically involve more back-end functionality than non-ad requests. This complexity results in higher observed response times for ad objects than non-ad objects. These latency inflations suggest the presence of real-time bidding within ad exchanges.</p><p>This paper takes a first step towards understanding how users employ ad-blockers and what advertisement traffic is potentially affected by this software. Yet, our study also poses new questions. In future work we plan to extend our analysis to better understand the reasons that drive end users to use ad-blockers. Moreover, we also plan to explore the economic impact and implications that adblocking tech has for the "free" Web.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Approach to classify ad requests.</figDesc></figure>
