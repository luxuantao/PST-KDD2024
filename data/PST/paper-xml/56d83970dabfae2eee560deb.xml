<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), diagnosis is a crucial and challenging task due to the distributed nature and stringent resources. Most previous approaches are supervised, relying on a-priori knowledge of network faults. Our experience with GreenOrbs, a long-term large-scale WSN system, reveals the need of diagnosis in an agnostic manner. Specifically, in addition to predefined faults (i.e., with known types and symptoms), silent failures that are unknown beforehand, account for a large fraction of network performance degradation. Currently, there is no effective solution for silent failures because they are often diverse and highly system-related. In this paper, we propose Agnostic Diagnosis (AD), an online lightweight failure detection approach. AD is motivated by the fact that the system metrics (e.g., radio-on time, number of packets transmitted) of sensor nodes usually exhibit certain correlation patterns. Violations of such patterns indicate potential silent failures. We implement AD on a working WSN consisting of 330 nodes. Our experimental results demonstrate the advantages of AD to discover silent failures, effectively expanding the capacity and scope of WSN diagnosis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>obvious drawback is that they are limited to faults with known types and symptoms, and hence, they cannot be easily generalized to different application scenarios. On the other hand, the interactions within the WSN and the causal dependencies between root causes and symptoms are usually unknown. As a result, silent failures remain undetected.</p><p>This paper is motivated by the need for long-term reliable operation of GreenOrbs, a large-scale WSN system in a forest <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Currently, GreenOrbs includes 330 nodes and has been in continuous operation for over eight months. During the deployment, we often observe system performance degradations, e.g., low packet delivery ratios. A portion of faulty nodes can be easily identified since they generate apparently abnormal system metrics (e.g., measurements that are clearly beyond the reasonable scope). The other faulty nodes, however, cannot be identified in this way. For instance, we adopt low-power listening mode so the radio is switched on only for receiving, sending, or idle listening. Consequently, the radio-on time should be closely correlated with the amount of traffic passing the node. We noted that during a five-minute period, a node kept its radio on for 47.5 seconds, transmitting only 3 packets in total. In the next five-minute period, it kept its radio on for 51.6 seconds and transmitted 550 packets. Any individual value of the metrics is not abnormal, but the correlation between radio-on time and number of transmitted packets clearly suggests inconsistency on that node.</p><p>A straightforward solution would be to develop a set of static correlation rules for identifying the faulty nodes. However, this is inapplicable for two reasons: (i) usually there is insufficient domain knowledge to enumerate all the rules; (ii) WSN deployment is often evolutional, so that the correlation rules change over time; both software upgrades and environment conditions may have a great impact on the correlations.</p><p>To overcome these problems, we propose Agnostic Diagnosis (AD), an online lightweight approach for WSNs. AD exploits the correlations among metrics of each sensor using a correlation graph that describes the latent status of the node. Such a correlation graph is updated periodically using the node's metrics. By mining the correlation graphs, we identify the underlying rules of a normally running system, and detect abnormal correlations.</p><p>Our main contributions are summarized as follows:</p><p>• Unlike previous approaches, Agnostic Diagnosis does not rely on predefined rules. It relies on minimal a-priori knowledge and thus can be applied to a wide variety of WSN applications. • We propose the correlation graph, a compact structure 1536-1276/13$31.00 c 2013 IEEE that efficiently characterizes the internal correlations inside a node.</p><p>• We implement AD and evaluate it with traces from a 330node GreenOrbs deployment. Case studies and statistics demonstrate the effectiveness of AD. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 motivates the problem. Section 3 presents AD. Section 4 evaluates our design and Section 5 surveys related work. Finally, Section 6 concludes this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. MOTIVATION</head><p>Diagnosis is a fundamental task for long-term large-scale WSN systems. This section first introduces the basic information and application requirements of GreenOrbs, including several observations in the form of concrete examples. These observations reveal the existence of correlation patterns among the nodes' operational metrics and the feasibility of AD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. GreenOrbs</head><p>GreenOrbs is an ecological surveillance project deployed in a forest. It collects a group of sensory data such as temperature, humidity, illumination and carbon dioxide concentration to support various applications. Since the deployment is in a remote area, the overhead of in-situ debugging and troubleshooting is very high. Therefore, the diagnostic system is designed so that each node periodically transmits its current status to the sink. Specifically, we collect 22 types of metrics (Table <ref type="table">I</ref>) from each node that are classified into four categories: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> timing metrics e.g. RadioOnTimeCounter, which denotes the accumulative radio-on time; (2) traffic metrics, e.g. TransmitCounter, which records the accumulative number of packets transmitted by a node; (3) task metrics, e.g. TaskExecCounter, which is the accumulative number of tasks executed; (4) other metrics such as ParentChangeCounter, which counts the number of parent changes.</p><p>The difficulty of diagnosis in GreenOrbs stems from the absence of a-priori knowledge on the possible faults and their symptoms, which renders general diagnostic rules inapplicable. Instead, we design a diagnostic system requiring minimal domain knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Silent Failures</head><p>In this section, we demonstrate an example of silent failures that could hardly be discovered using rule-based methods, as well as an example that could be mistakenly flagged. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> plots the number of packets transmitted by a node in two time periods. Its value is counted in every fifteen-minute time frame. For example, point (0,6) means the node transmitted six packets within the first fifteen minutes. During time period one, the metric changes dramatically, with its values ranging from 6 to 13. One would think that the node might be faulty in this time period. However, a manual analysis of the whole trace reveals that the node works well. On the other hand, during time period two, this metric appears to be stable, and the difference between maximum value and minimum value is only 2. Nevertheless, after manually checking the network trace, we find that the node actually encounters routing loops (a fatal routing problem). This example demonstrates that the individual examination of metrics on the same sensor node may overlook silent failures, or may flag failures by mistake.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> shows another example. In this figure, the same metric is studied, but on different sensor nodes during the same time period. It shows that the curve of node 4 is flat, while curves of node 2 and 24 are steep. The reason why they have different curves is as the following: (1) First, node 2 and node 4 play different roles in the network. Node 4 is a leaf node, and it seldom has to forward packets for other nodes. So the number of packets transmitted is 3 most of the time. However, node 2 is an intermediate node. It has to forward packets for its children, so the number of packets transmitted is always above 6. (2) Second, radio irregularity may cause changes in the number of node 2's children. When node 2 has more child nodes, it transmits more packets. (3) Third, since nodes in the network are not synchronized, they wake up and sleep according to their local clock. As a result, traffic patterns in network do not remain stable. This may also cause fluctuations in the packets transmitted by node 2. Although the metric on node 4 exhibits a quite different pattern from those of the other </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Observations</head><p>We conduct the correlation patterns of the 22 metrics and visualize them using gray-scale images (the details will be presented later). The cell (i, j) in the image denotes the correlation score between metrics i and j. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a)-(c</ref>) displays three images constructed from metrics of a same node. The node is normal in the first two periods, but faulty in the third one. Interestingly, the first two images are very similar to each other, whereas they differ significantly from the third one. Analogous results are observed in the spatial domain as well. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(d</ref>)-(f) shows the images of three nodes in the same period. The first two nodes are normal, while the third one is faulty. Observe that the first two images follow a similar pattern, which is clearly distinguishable from the last one.</p><p>The difference of correlation patterns can be explained with the following example. There are two metrics called LoopCounter and SuccAckCounter. The former is the number of times that a same packet passes through the current node, and the latter is the number of packets that are successfully transmitted by the current node. If the node is normal, the value of LoopCounter should be zero most of the time. Thus, these two metrics have weak correlation. If the node is out of order and produces routing loops, the same packet passes multiple times. Eventually, LoopCounter dominates SuccAckCounter, and these two metrics are highly correlated, differentiating the faulty node from of the normal ones.</p><p>In summary, proper diagnosis of WSNs, especially longterm large-scale systems like GreenOrbs, is crucial and challenging. This is partially due to resource constraints and hardness to track in-network status. Even a more important, but often overlooked fact is that the diagnostic capacity is restricted by our incomplete knowledge of possible failures. Our experience with GreenOrbs reveals that independent investigation of metrics is insufficient for capturing all the problematic nodes. On the other hand, exploiting correlations of metrics uncovers significantly more failures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. AGNOSTIC DIAGNOSIS</head><p>We assume a WSN consisting of N sensor nodes. In each time frame t, a sensor s i measures its working status, obtaining a status vector S i,t = (m 1,t , m 2,t , . . . , m p,t ), where p is the number of metrics and m u,t is the value of the u-th metric </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Correlation Graphs</head><p>The correlation graph is a symmetric matrix representing the pair-wise correlations of system metrics:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ c k (1, 1) c k (1, 2) . . . c k (1, p) c k (2, 1) c k (2, 2) . . . c k (2, p) . . . . . . . . . . . . c k (p, 1) c k (p, 2) . . . c k (p, p) ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ .</formula><p>It is constructed and maintained periodically, for each node in the WSN.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. AD Framework</head><p>AD is a sink-based framework. It instruments the source code of TinyOS programs and thus is able to track the performance of programs using a number of performance counters, a.k.a, metrics. The values of these counters are important indicators of sensor nodes' performance. Thus they are required to be sent back to the sink periodically. On receiving the metrics from the network, AD starts to build correlation graphs in the current time window. After that, AD identifies anomalies in both temporal and spatial domain. Specifically, temporal detection refers to detecting sudden changes in the correlation graphs from a same node, while spatial detection discovers pattern inconsistencies using multiple nodes. If an anomaly is identified by both temporal and spatial detection, it has a high chance of signifying a real problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Temporal Detection</head><p>The problem of Temporal Detection is defined as the following.</p><p>Problem 1. (Temporal Detection) Given the correlation graphs CG(i) = {CG i,1 , CG i,2 , . . . , CG i,t , . . .} of node s i , detect the time when an abrupt change happens in time series  Convert it into a column vector with length p(p -1)/2; 4: end for 5: for d = 1 → p(p -1)/2 do 6:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">{c 1 (u, v), c 2 (u, v), . . . , c t (u, v), . . .}, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ p and u = v.</formula><p>For each vector, take its d-th element; end if 15: end for Considering that the system maintains p = 22 metrics, for each node, there are totally p • (p -1)/2 = 231 different time series. At the end of each time window, AD detects whether there is an abrupt change in each time series. The detection process is modeled as a change point analysis problem. We adopt a classical CUSUM algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to discover change points. In our application, it includes three steps.</p><p>Step 1: Cumulative Sums Calculation. In this step, CUSUM charts are constructed based on the original time series. Let {c 1 (u, v), c 2 (u, v), . . . , c n (u, v)} be the correlation scores between metrics u and v from the first time window to the current one. The cumulative sums {CS 0 , CS 1 , CS 2 , . . . , CS n } are calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">• CS 0 = 0; • CS i = CS i-1 + c i (u, v) - n i=1 c i (u, v)/n.</formula><p>The intuition behind cumulative sums is that if there are no abrupt changes in correlation scores, then the cumulative sums just shrink near zero. Otherwise, supposing at the beginning all the scores are above the average, the term c i (u, v) -n i=1 c i (u, v)/n is always larger than zero, causing cumulative sums CS i to increase steadily. If c k+1 (u, v) is an abrupt change, CS k+1 should be much smaller than CS k . Thus, CS k will dominate both the preceding and the subsequent cumulative sums. The change score is denoted as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">CS dif f = max(CS i ) -min(CS i ).</formula><p>Step 2: Bootstrap Analysis. Bootstrap analysis provides a way to test the significance of the change by mimicking the behavior of CUSUM if there are no change points. In this step, the time series {c 1 (u, v), c 2 (u, v), . . . , c n (u, v)} is reordered randomly. Based on the random ordered time series, a new sequence of cumulative sums {CS 0 , CS 1 , CS 2 , . . . , CS n } are computed. The new change score is CS dif f = max(CS i )min(CS i ). After performing bootsraps M times, among which there are X times that CS dif f is larger than CS dif f , the confidence level of CS dif f is calculated using X/M . With sufficiently high M , we can accurately estimate the confidence. However, since each window has 10 data points, it is infeasible to iterate all the 10! cases. We found that M = 1000 is a reasonable value, for it is both large enough to accurately estimate the confidence and small enough to run the algorithm in a short period of time.</p><p>Step 3: Change Point Detection. Once the confidence level of CS dif f is higher than a predefined threshold, we say that an abrupt change happens in the current time series. We select the index k so that CS k = max|CS i |. Therefore, k is the last index before the change point c k+1 (u, v). Through our experiments, we choose 90% as the confidence threshold to determine an abrupt change.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>, the original time series has an abrupt change at index 10. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>, at the same position, the original CUSUM curve encounters a sudden change, which is consistent with the original time series. However, in the other CUSUM curves with random ordering, there is no sudden change, and all the curves tend to shrink near zero.</p><p>Algorithm 1 illustrates the details of temporal detection. This algorithm runs at the end of each time window, and uncovers the sensor nodes whose correlation graphs change acutely. It is possible that a node may experience multiple temporary failures, such that there are multiple change points in the CUSUM curve. We focus on the most significant change point because if it passes the confidence threshold, we can already say that the node is suspicious. Meanwhile, if it does not pass the confidence threshold, it means other change points will not pass the threshold either.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Spatial Detection</head><p>Spatial detection takes snapshots of correlation graphs of all nodes in each time window, and groups similar ones together. Sensor nodes whose correlation graphs diverge from the common patterns are considered suspicious.</p><p>Problem 2. (Spatial Detection) Given a set of nodes {s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s n }, as well as their correlation graphs in time window t, i.e., {CG 1,t , CG 2,t , . . . , CG n,t }, divide them into K clusters with cluster centers C 1 , C 2 , . . . , C K . The confidence level for a sensor node s i to be suspicious is defined as: min j (dist(CG i,t , C j )), where dist(CG i,t , C j ) is a binary distance function between two correlation graphs.</p><p>Considering the symmetry of the correlation graph, we can take the upper triangular part of it and transform it to a ddimensional vector, where d = p • (p -1)/2. Therefore, an intuitive solution is to apply K-Means clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> directly and find the farthest nodes from the centers. However, this approach is ineffective due to the high dimensionality of correlation graphs. In high dimensions, the concept of distance becomes meaningless <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, causing the clustering results to be imprecise. Another problem is the dependencies among dimensions. For instance, suppose metrics u, v, and w are highly correlated pair-wisely. As a result, the three correlation scores c(u, v), c(u, w), c(v, w) are very likely to be dependent, suggesting that the actual dimensionality of the correlation graphs is much smaller than d. Convert it into a row vector X i with length p(p -1)/2; 4: end for 5: Construct the data matrix X = [X 1 , X 2 , . . . , X n ]; 6: Compute the m largest eigenvalues of matrix X T X; The probability that sensor node s i is faulty ← min j (dist(Z i , C j )); 14: end for 15: Return the list of sensor nodes sorted by their probabilities of being faulty.</p><p>Following the idea of PCA, our algorithm first projects correlation graphs to a low-dimensional space and then clusters the projected data <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Let X 1 , X 2 , . . . , X n denote the d-dimensional row vectors consisting of elements drawn from the upper triangles of CG 1,t , CG 2,t , . . . , CG n,t respectively. Without loss of generality, assume X i has zero mean. The original data matrix can be written as X = [X 1 , X 2 , . . . , X n ], which is of size d × n. After projection (line 6-9 in Algorithm 2), we perform K-Means clustering on the columns of projected data matrix Z = [Z 1 , Z 2 , . . . , Z n ]. The confidence of Z i to be suspicious is proportional to its distance to the nearest center. The details of spatial detection is shown in Algorithm 2. Besides PCA, other techniques such as manifold learning and compressive sensing can also be used here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EVALUATION</head><p>In this section, we provide both case studies and experiments to show the effectiveness of AD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Case Studies</head><p>We use data collected from 330 nodes in three months from GreenOrbs project. Using AD, we have identified four types of failures.</p><p>The first type is ingress drops, which is detected by correlating ReceiveCounter and TransmitCounter. Since the sampling rate of a sensor is fixed (i.e., three packets every fifteen minutes), the number of packets transmitted by a healthy node should be very close to the number of packets it receives from its children in the routing tree. However, if ingress drops occur, a portion of the incoming packets is dropped. Consequently, a change point in the time series of correlation score between ReceiveCounter and TransmitCounter suggests an ingress drop. As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>, the correlation score has a significant change point at 2:00. An inspection of the raw data confirms that at that time, this sensor node received packets from its children but did not forward all of them, causing ingress drops. However, if we investigate ReceiveCounter and TransmitCounter separately, this failure cannot be detected since the values of both metrics are within the normal range.</p><p>The second type is routing failures. A typical symptom is a node changing its parent too frequently. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref> depicts one row of the correlation graph for three sensor nodes. Each cell in the row stands for the correlation score between ParentChangeCounter and another metric. Note that node 73 has a quite different pattern compared to the others. As an example, consider the second cell in the row, which corresponds to the correlation between ParentChangeCounter and RadioOnCounter. For healthy nodes 70 and 100, the two metrics are not correlated, as they signify the number of times a node turns on the radio and the number of times it changes its parent node in the routing tree, respectively. For node 73, the correlation score is so high that almost every time it turns on its radio, a parent change happens. Again, if we merely focus on the values of the two metrics independently, such failures cannot be found.</p><p>The third type is link failures. The detection of link failures exploits the correlation between RetransmitCounter and other metrics such as RadioOnTimeCounter. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref> illustrates the time series of these two metrics. Initially, they are weakly correlated, since a node may retransmit some packets when its radio is on, but it does not always happen. Starting from 8:30, the correlation score increases, indicating that a large portion of radio-on time is used to retransmit packets. Thus, the transmission from this node to its parent suffers from poor link quality. On the other hand, it is difficult to simply set a threshold for the ratio of retransmitted packets because it may change depending on the time and the location. For instance, a threshold equal to 0.5 may be acceptable in an indoor environment where links are easily interfered, but too low in an open space where link quality is very good.</p><p>The fourth kind refers to node failures that may be caused by software or hardware problems. The correlation between TaskPostCounter (i.e., the number of tasks posted in TinyOS) and TaskExecuteCounter (i.e., the number of tasks actually performed) can be employed to uncover software faults. We do not address hardware failures because they can be readily detected through a simple rule: when a node crashes, it disappears from the neighbor tables of nearby sensors.</p><p>In summary, among the failures discussed in this subsection, only hardware failures can be detected by some simple rules, while other failures require AD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Effectiveness</head><p>Temporal Detection: We depict both packet delivery ratios (PDRs) and temporal detection results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. PDR is defined as the ratio between the number of packets received by the sink and that sent by the source node. For each point in the curve, its x-axis value corresponds to the time, while its y-axis value corresponds to the packet delivery ratio at that time. Each square in the figure stands for the time when a change point is reported. We can observe that nearly every square corresponds to a local minimum or maximum in PDRs. It means that the temporal detection results confirm to the variation of system performance. However, some local minima/maxima are not captured by squares, possibly because they do not necessarily signify failures. For example, if a node is healthy but its parent is faulty, it also causes its PDRs to produce a local minimum. Moreover, temporal detection also captures the time when a node recovers from temporary failures, i.e., the squares that correspond to local maxima in PDRs.</p><p>Spatial Detection: To validate the effectiveness of spatial detection, we randomly pick a piece of data and investigate 30 faulty nodes that are identified in this phase. Specifically, 23 of them are flagged because failures take place, while 5 of them are false alarms. The other 2 nodes exhibit a sudden increase in the number of packets received, leading to different correlation scores between PacketReceiveCounter and other metrics. However, after manually inspecting the raw data, we believe that these two nodes are healthy since the number of packets transmitted by them increases accordingly. The involved faults include packet loops, frequent parent changes, link failures, mismatch between radio-on time and packets transmitted/received, ingress failures, and stack overflows. These failures are not independent because several types of failures may occur in the same sensor node simultaneously. Packet loop is the most frequent type of failures.</p><p>Overall: We also examine the overall detection ratio and false alarm rate of our approach using a test bed. We vary the network size from 10 nodes to 50 nodes. With different network sizes, we randomly select 10% to 15% of the nodes and inject two kinds of bugs to them respectively. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> plots results of case one in which the software bug causes selected nodes to send each packet multiple times as if they do not receive ACKs from their parent nodes. According to Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, with small network sizes the detection ratio is almost 100%. As network size grows, the detection ratio tends to decrease and false positive rate increases. The reason is that with small network sizes, only one or two nodes keep sending duplicated packets. Their low volume traffic does not affect other nodes. However, as the number of faulty node increases, the growing number of duplicated packets may lead to congestions in other nodes and raise the false positive rate.</p><p>In the second case, we mimic the behavior of ingress drops by reducing the receiving queue length. It can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> that similar trends can also be found as in case one. The reason is that as the number of faulty nodes increases with network size, their child nodes cannot deliver packets. Even if these child nodes switch to other parents, the high volume of data will still cause congestions in the new parent nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. RELATED WORK</head><p>Diagnosis of WSNs has been tackled from various perspectives. The first type aims at software debugging. Clairvoyant <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> is a GDB-like source-level tool that provides a suit of standard debugging commands such as break, set, watch and backtrace. Declarative Tracepoint <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>   declarative, SQL-like language, allowing developers to insert a set of action-associated rules to applications at runtime. Our approach differs in that we do not debug the source code. Instead, our goal is to discover the silent failures caused by nodes, ambient environment, and protocols.</p><p>The second type of diagnosis is achieved through rulebased mining, or specific inference models. Sympathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> periodically gathers information such as nodes' next hops and then builds decision trees to analyze the root causes. DustMiner <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> collects runtime event logs and performs frequent pattern mining to uncover root causes of performance anomalies. PAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> leverages a packet marking strategy for constructing and maintaining the inference model. PowerTracing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> employs a special power meter to identify patterns of power consumption. Unlike these approaches, our work addresses the problem when there is little domain knowledge.</p><p>There are also studies closely related to diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> focus on data faults. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> provides an experimental study on link performance. LiveNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> uses passive monitoring to reconstruct dynamics of live sensor networks. PD2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> pinpoints the root causes of application performance problems. SNMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> proposes a sensor network management system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper presents Agnostic Diagnosis, a novel approach that relies on minimum domain knowledge to detect faulty nodes. AD is a sink-based scheme and requires sinks to collect data from all sensors. Consequently, there might exist a delay between fault time and detection time. In the future, we will extend AD such that it can work in a distributed manner. Thus both energy consumption and detection delay can be further reduced. We will also address node mobility <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> in diagnosis.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
