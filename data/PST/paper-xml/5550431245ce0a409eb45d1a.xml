He is on leave from the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, U.K. (e-mail: qzhang@essex.ac.uk). R. Battiti is with the Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento 38122, Italy (e-mail: battiti@disi.unitn.it).</p><p>Digital Object Identifier 10.1109/TCYB. <ref type="bibr">2013.2295886</ref> where is the feasible region in the decision space, F : → R m consists of m real-valued objective functions. The attainable objective set is {F (x)|x ∈ }.</p><p>Let u, v ∈ R m , u is said to dominate v, denoted by u v, if and only if u i ≥ v i for every i ∈ {1, . . . , m} and u j &gt; v j for at least one index j ∈ {1, . . . , m}. 1 Given a set S in R m , a point in it is called nondominated in S if no other point in S can dominate it. A point x * ∈ is Pareto-optimal if it is nondominated in the attainable objective set. F (x * ) is then called a Pareto-optimal (objective) vector. In other words, any improvement in one objective of a Pareto optimal point must lead to a deterioration of at least another objective. The set of all the Pareto-optimal points is called the Pareto set (PS) and the set of all the Pareto-optimal objective vectors is the Pareto front (PF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In many real life applications, the PF is of great interest to decision makers for understanding the tradeoff nature of different objectives and selecting their final solutions.</p><p>If is a finite set, then (1) is called a combinatorial MOP. Finding the exact PF of a real world combinatorial MOP is often NP-hard by nature even though its single objective counterpart is not <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. For this reason, heuristics, particularly, hybrid heuristics, have been widely used and studied for approximating the PFs of combinatorial MOPs. Elements and ideas from many different single objective heuristics such as variable neighborhood search <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, tabu search <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, iterative local search <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, guided local search <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, simulated annealing <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, ant colony optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and reactive search optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> have been generalized to combinatorial multiobjective optimization. In most hybrid heuristics developed over the last two decades, the following three highly related basic techniques are frequently employed.</p><p>1) Pareto local search (PLS): It is a natural extension of single objective local search methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. PLS works with a set of mutually nondominated solutions. It explores some or all of the neighbors of these solutions to find new solutions for updating this set at each iteration. Several variants of PLS have been proposed and investigated on various problems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>). 2) Aggregation: An MOP can be transformed into a single objective optimization problem by linearly or nonlinearly aggregating all the individual objectives f 1 , . . . , f m into one single objective. Under mild conditions, an optimal solution to this single objective 1 In the case of minimization, the inequality signs should be reversed. problem is Pareto-optimal to (1). Thus, a single objective optimization method can be used for finding a set of Pareto optimal solutions by solving a set of such single objective problems with different weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. 3) Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA): A typical MOEA evolves a working population (i.e., on-line population) of a prefixed size by using selection and reproduction operators. An MOEA selection operator can be based on Pareto dominance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>), aggregation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>) or some performance indicators (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>). A second population (i.e., archive), is often employed in MOEAs to store nondominated solutions generated during their evolutionary process <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. One of the most successful and simplest hybrid multiobjective heuristic frameworks is the two phase Pareto local search (2PPLS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. It combines PLS and aggregation. As its name suggests, 2PPLS consists of two phases. Phase 1 generates an approximation to the set of all the efficient supported solutions (their definitions will be given in Section II) by solving a number of linear aggregation problems. Phase 2 applies a PLS to every solution generated in Phase 1 to find non-supported Pareto optimal solutions. Since it has only two phases, it is necessary that the initial solutions provided by Phase 1 are of high quality and as many as possible. Therefore, as pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, Phase 1 often incurs very heavy computational overhead. For this reason, 2PPLS is not very suitable for dealing with more than three objectives. Another disadvantage is that it has no mechanism to escape from locally optimal solutions and it may stop when there is still computational time available. Arguably, a very natural way for overcoming these disadvantages is to implement the 2PPLS idea in an iterative framework, which makes it possible for the search to use any given amount of computational time and to implement a mechanism for jumping out of attraction basins of local optima.</p><p>The multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> uses aggregation to decompose an MOP into a number of single objective subproblems. Solutions to these different subproblems are evolved and improved in a collaborative way. Single objective optimization methods can be easily employed in the MOEA/D framework. Since MOEA/D is an iterative algorithm, any amount of computational time can be, at least in principle, used to improve the quality of its solutions. The MOEA/D algorithmic framework has been adopted in a number of MOEAs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>).</p><p>This paper combines the ideas from 2PPLS and MOEA/D and proposes a Multiobjective MOMAD. It is simple yet efficient and makes use of all the three basic techniques mentioned earlier in this section. MOMAD maintains three populations: Each solution in the first population (denoted by P L in this paper) is associated with a weighted sum aggregation subproblem. The second population (denoted by P P ) stores some very promising solutions selected from P L . The third population P E is an archive for recording all the nondominated solutions found so far. A problem-specific single objective heuristic can be applied to these subproblems to initialize the three populations. At each generation, a Pareto local search method is first applied to search a neighborhood of each solution in P P to update P L and P E . Then a single objective local search is applied to each perturbed solution in P L for improving P L and P E , and reinitializing P P . The procedure is repeated until a stopping condition is met. Extensive experiments have been conducted in this paper to study MOMAD and compare it with some other state-of-the-art algorithms on the multiobjective traveling salesman problem (mTSP) and the multiobjective knapsack problem (mKP). The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms or performs similarly to the best so far heuristics on these two problems.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents all the details of our proposed MOMAD. Section III gives an implementation of MOMAD on the biobjective traveling salesman problems. Experimental studies on the effects of some control parameters on the performance of MOMAD are also conducted in this section. Section IV implements MO-MAD for the multiobjective knapsack problem and compares it with four other algorithms. Section V concludes this paper and outlines some avenues for future research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Decomposition and Algorithmic Framework</head><p>A widely used multiobjective optimization methodology in traditional mathematical programming community is to cast an MOP into a single objective optimization problem by (linearly or nonlinearly) aggregating all the individual objectives f 1 , . . . , f m with a weight coefficient vector. To obtain an approximation to the PF, one can solve a set of such single objective problems with carefully selected weight coefficient vectors. This idea has been successfully used in some MOEAs such as MOGLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> and MOEA/D <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>There are a number of aggregation approaches for decomposing an MOP into a number of single objective optimization subproblems. For simplicity, this paper uses the weighted sum approach. It considers the following single objective optimization problem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">maximize f ws (x|λ) = m i=1 λ i f i (x) subject to x ∈<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where λ = (λ 1 , . . . , λ m ) is a weight vector with m i=1 λ i = 1 and λ i ≥ 0 for all i = 1, . . . , m.</p><p>For any nonnegative weight vector, (2) has an optimal solution which is Pareto optimal to (1). In the case of positive weight vectors, any optimal solutions to (2) are Pareto optimal to (1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. A Pareto optimal solution is called supported efficient if it is an optimal solution to (2) with a particular weight vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Let X se and PF se be the set of all the supported efficient solutions and the set of their corresponding Pareto optimal objective vectors respectively, it is well-known that PF se = PF when PF is concave. In the case of nonconcave PFs, although PF se = PF as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, a basic assumption in this paper is that, in an appropriately defined neighborhood of a locally or globally optimal solution to (2), more Pareto optimal solutions can be found with a reasonable amount of computational effort. This assumption, illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, has been used in several successful metaheuristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> including MOGLS and 2PPLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>MOMAD, the algorithm proposed in this paper, adopts the MOEA/D framework. More specifically, MOMAD first selects N weight vectors λ 1 , . . . , λ N and forms N single objective optimization subproblems. Subproblem k is defined by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) with λ = λ k . At each generation, MOMAD maintains three populations, which are as follows.</p><p>1) P L = {x 1 , . . . , x N }: x k is the current solution to subproblem k. The solutions in this population will be undergone perturbation and single objective local search operators. 2) P P : the solutions in this population will be undergone PLS. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>) P E : it is an external population for storing all nondominated solutions found so far. The MOMAD works as follows.</p><p>Step </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.5</head><p>Updating P P : If y k has been added to P E in 3.4, P P = Update2(y k , P P ). End of for Go to Step 1. In Step 0, the three populations are initialized. Since solution x k in P L is for single objective subproblem k, one can use a well-developed single objective heuristic to obtain the initial x k . Then, based on Pareto dominance, it compares the solutions in P L to find all the nondominated solutions in P L which are then used for initializing P E and P P .</p><p>Step 2 conducts PLS to explore the neighborhoods of the solutions in P P to update P L and P E . After this step, P P will be set to be empty. The purpose of this step is to find those Pareto optimal solutions that may not be found by perturbation and local search in Step 3. A major computational overhead of MOMAD comes from this step.</p><p>Step 3.1 is to drive the search into a new region. The perturbation should be big enough such that the generated solution xk is out of the attractive basin of current x k . Too big a perturbation, however, may take xk to an unpromising search area. y k , generated in Step 3.2 by a single objective local search on xk , could be a better solution to subproblem k or other subproblems. Steps 3.3-3.5 use y k to update P L , P E and P P . P P contains all the new nondominated solutions generated in Step 3, and it is a subset of P L .</p><p>In Update1(x , P L ) (Algorithm 1), its inputs are x and P L . As mentioned earlier, each solution x k in P L is the current solution to subproblem k. Update1(x , P L ) compares x and solutions in P L in a random order based on their aggregated objective function values. Due to the use of flag variable Replacement, x is allowed to replace only one solution in P L , which is useful for maintaining the diversity of P L .</p><p>In Update2(x , P) (Algorithm 2), x is compared with every solution in P, it will be added to P if there is no solution in P which can dominate it. All the solutions in P which are dominated by x will be removed from P.</p><p>We would like to make the following comments on the above algorithmic framework.</p><p>1) Since each solution x i in P L is for single objective subproblem i, single objective optimization techniques can be used in Step 0.1 and Step 3.2. Many effective approaches have been developed and studied in single objective combinatorial optimization for utilizing problemspecific knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>. Thus, this framework provides a natural way for using these working experiences in combinatorial multiobjective optimization. 2) In the existing two phase local search methods such as 2PPLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and PD-PLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, each subproblem undergoes a single objective local search only once for generating one supported efficient solution. In contrast, MOMAD adopts an iterative fashion and applies a local search precedure to every subproblem many times with different starting solutions during the search. Therefore, with Pareto local search, MOMAD can explore the neighborhoods of different locally optimal solutions to each subproblem. The motivation behind the use of iteration in MOMAD is supported by the assumption illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. 3) In some other MOEA/D variants (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>), a neighborhood relationship among all the subproblems is defined based on the distances among their weight vectors. Correspondingly, a neighborhood relationship among all the current solutions can be established. These MOEA/D variants update a current solution mainly by an offspring of its neighboring solutions. This is based on the assumption that two neighboring subproblems have similar optimal solutions. Although this assumption is often true in combinatorial multiobjective optimization, some exceptions can be observed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>). For this reason, MOMAD does not employ the neighborhood concept, a new solution has a chance to replace any other current solutions in P L . 4) A major computational overhead of MOMAD is incurred by PLS. To avoid unbearable computational cost, P P is set to be empty at the end of Step 2. A solution is added to P P in Step 3 only if it has entered into P E . As a result, P P contains all the new nondominated solutions generated in Step 3 and it is a subset of P L . Therefore, the size of P P cannot exceed N and neither can the number of PLS calls at each generation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Pareto Local Search</head><p>MOMAD conducts PLS in Step 2. Several different versions of PLS have been developed and studied during the last several years. The PLS algorithm used in our experimental studies is a modified version of Pareto local search proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Its detail is given in Algorithm 3.</p><p>In this PLS algorithm, Max is the maximal number of passes in the while loop (line 2-16). It is used to bound the computational overhead. In line 1, j, the index of the current loop pass, is initialized to be 0. P α , which is initialized to be empty in line 3, is to reset P P at the end of each while pass in line 15. For each x in the neighborhood of every x in P L , Update1(x , P L ) is executed in line <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref>  In such a way, the computational overhead can be significantly reduced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. Comparison Study on Multiobjective Traveling Salesman Problem A. Problem</head><p>The multiobjective traveling salesman problem is defined on an undirected complete graph G = (V, E), where V = {1, • • • , n} is the set of cities (or nodes) and E = {e = (i, j)|i, j ∈ V } is the set of edges. Each edge e has m distance metrics d e,1 , . . . , d e,m . Each feasible solution is a subset of edges which can form a Hamiltonian cycle. The i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ m) objective function to be minimized is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f i (x) = e∈x d e,i<label>(3)</label></formula><p>In our experiments, we use biobjective test instances collected by Lust <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, 2 which have been used to test 2PPLS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Implementation of MOMAD</head><p>1) Initialization of P L (Step 0.1): Each subproblem k in the mTSP is a single objective TSP with the following objective:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">e∈x ( m i=1 λ k i d e,i ).

The CE list consists of all the edges of the solutions in the current P P . It will be updated once P P has been updated. 2 http://sites.google.com/site/thibautlust/research/. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Performance Metrics</head><p>1) Hypervolume indicator (I H ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>: Let y * = (y * 1 , . . . , y * m ) be a point in the objective space which is dominated by any Pareto optimal objective vectors. Let S be the obtained approximation to the PF in the objective space. Then the I H value of S (with regard to y * ) is the volume of the region which is dominated by S and dominates y * . The higher the hypervolume value, the better the approximation.</p><p>2) Set Coverage (C-metric) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>: Let A and B be two approximations to the PF of an MOP, C(A, B) is defined as the percentage of the solutions in B that are dominated by at least one solution in A, that is</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">C(A, B) = |{u ∈ B|∃v ∈ A : v dominates u}| |B| × 100%</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C(A, B) is not necessarily equal to 100 -C(B, A). C(A, B)</head><p>= 100% means that all solutions in B are dominated by some solutions in A, while C(A, B) = 0 implies that no solution in B is dominated by any solution in A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Experimental Parameter Setup</head><p>1) Size of P L (N) and Weight Vectors (λ) in MOMAD: Too large N will result in very high computational cost at each generation, while too small N may make the search miss some parts of the PF. Based on these considerations, N is set as follows.</p><p>1) N = n when n = 200, 300, 400, 500, where n is the number of cities. 2) N = 600 when n = 750, 1000. λ k (k = 1, . . . , N) is set as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">λ k = k -1 N -1 , N -k N -1<label>(5)</label></formula><p>2) Max in PLS: Max is set to be 10 in our experiments.</p><p>3) The Stopping Condition: The algorithm stops after 500 generations.</p><p>4) The Number of Independent Runs: The algorithm is run 20 times on each test instance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Compared Algorithms</head><p>1) 2PPLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>: This algorithm is the best-so-far heuristic for the biobjective TSP instances used in our experimental studies. It consists of two phases. Its first phase generates a good approximation of the supported efficient solutions. A heuristic proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref> is adopted to obtain a minimal complete set of extreme supported efficient solutions. This heuristic uses the chained Lin-Kernighan heuristic <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> to solve a set of linear aggregated TSPs. The second phase uses a PLS for generating non-supported solutions. The PLS used is the same as that described in Section II-B except it stops when no nondominated solutions can be found. The experimental results of 2PPLS used in our comparison are from its author's web 2 . 2) MOEA/D-ACO <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>: It is a multiobjective ant colony algorithm using the MOEA/D framework. In this algorithm, the MOP is decomposed into a set of single objective subproblem. Each ant is responsible for one subproblem. The ants are partitioned into groups and each ant has several neighboring ants. The ants in the same group share one pheromone matrix and each individual ant has its own heuristic information matrix.</p><p>During the search, each ant records the best solution found so far for its subproblem. To construct a new solution, an ant combines information from its group's pheromone matrix, its own heuristic information matrix and its current solution. In the experiment, the CPU time used by this algorithm is the same as that by MOMAD, and the other parameters are set to the same values as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>. 3   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Results</head><p>To compute the hypervolume values of these algorithms on each instance, y * i (i = 1, . . . , m) is set to be the largest value 3 The source code is available at http://dces.essex.ac.uk/staff/zhang/ of the i-th objective among all the final solutions generated by the three compared algorithms. The hypervolume values of the final solution sets produced by these algorithms are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>. We compute the mean C-metric values of all the 20×20 comparisons on each instance and report them in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">I</ref>. The average running time consumed by each algorithm is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">II</ref>.</p><p>From these results, we can make the following remarks.</p><p>1) In terms of the coverage metric, MOMAD outperforms 2PPLS on all the test instances. For example, on kroab1000, the instance with 1000 cities, a solution set produced by MOMAD can on average dominate 61.2% of a solution set by 2PPLS, and 37.6% vice versa. 2) On 16 out of 18 test instances, the hypervolume values shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> are consistent with the coverage metric values, which further confirms the competitiveness of MOMAD. On rdAB300 and rdAB500, the two exception instances, we have tested MOMAD with larger population sizes and found that MOMAD can perform better with regards to the hypervolume metric as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref>.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">II</ref> indicate that they have consumed about the same amount of CPU time on each test instance. We also want to emphasize that, unlike 2PPLS, MOMAD is an anytime algorithm. As shown in the next section, MOMAD can find better solutions if more computational resources are allocated to it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. More Discussions</head><p>MOMAD has two control parameters: N and Max. We have experimentally investigated the effects of the two control parameters on the algorithm performance. We have taken kroab200 as a test instance in our experimental studies and each parameter configuration has been tested on 20 independent runs.</p><p>1) Influence of the Number of Subproblems N: N is also the size of P L , which thus decides how many times perturbation and single objective local search operators are conducted at Steps 3.1 and 3.2 in each generation. We have tested MOMAD with N = 100, 200, 300, and 1700, the running time limit is set to be 600 seconds and all the other settings are the same as in the previous section.

From the experimental results, the following are evident.</p><p>1) As expected, N is a crucial factor in determining the computational overhead and performance of the initialization step in MOMAD. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">III</ref>, when N = 50, the running time consumed by the initialization step is 38 seconds, and the hypervolume value of initial P E is 8.85177 × 10 10 . In the case of N = 1700, the running time increases to 582 seconds and the hypervolume value to 8.87253 × 10 10 . These results are not surprising. The larger N value is, the more times the chain Lin-Kernigham heuristic will be conducted and the more solutions will be generated in   '-' means that the initialization procedure is not completed within the given amount of CPU time.</p><p>Initialization. Therefore, more running time and better P E can be expected. 2) For all the different settings of N, the iteration steps after initialization can improve the quality of P E effectively. For example, in the case of N = 200, the hypervolume value of P E has been increased from 8.86107 × 10 10 to 8.88140 × 10 10 . These results should be due to two reasons. The first one is that the initial P E is generated by the chain Lin-Kernigham heuristic, thus some of its solutions may not be globally Pareto optimal and the size of the initial P E is also limited. As a result, there is room for improving the initial P E . The second reason is that perturbation and local search in Step 3.1 and Step 3.2 can explore new search areas and produce better solutions.</p><p>3) The best value of N depends on the available running time. For example, if the available running time is 100 seconds, the best value of N is 200. However, if the running time is 600s, the best value is N = 300.</p><p>2) Influence of Parameter Max: This parameter is a key parameter determining the overall computational overhead of the PLS procedure. To study its effect on the algorithm performance, we have conducted experiments with its four   <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">V</ref>. We can make the following comments. IV. Experimental Studies on Multiobjective 0-1 Knapsack Problem In the above section, the test instances are the mTSP with two objectives. Taking the multiobjective 0-1 knapsack problem (mKP) as a test bed, this section compares MOMAD with some other state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly with respect to their ability for dealing with more than two objectives.</p></div>

The mKP is NP-hard <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and can model a variety of applications in resource allocation. It has also been widely used in testing multiobjective heuristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. A set of nine test instances proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> are used in our experimental studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Implementation of MOMAD</head><p>1) Initialization of P L (Step 0.1): x k to subproblem k is constructed as follows. A utility value of each item j is first defined and computed</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">σ k j = m i=1 λ k i p i,j m i=1 w i,j<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where m i=1 w i,j is the overall weight of item k, and m i=1 λ k i p i,j is its weighted profit, i.e., the coefficient of x i in the objective function of subproblem k defined by (2) in the mKP case.</p><p>We first initialize x k = ∅, and then add items one by one to x k until no item can be added to x k without violating any constraint. Each item added to x k should have the largest σ k j among all the items which can be added to x k without violating any constraint.</p><p>2) N(x) in Pareto Local Search (Step 2): If the neighborhood in PLS (Algorithm 3) is too large, the computational overhead of PLS may be very high. Our neighborhood definition is inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. To define N(x), we first define a domination relationship among all the items. An item u is said to dominate another item v if and only if</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">p i,u m k=1 w k,u ≥ p i,v m k=1 w k,v</formula><p>for all i = 1, . . . , m, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">p i,u m k=1 w k,u &gt; p i,v m k=1 w k,v</formula><p>for at least one index j ∈ {1, . . . , m}. Then we divide all the items into different subsets such that F 1 contains all the nondominated items in {1, . . . , n}, F 2 contains all the nondominated items in {1, . . . , n} \ F 1 , and so on. The rank of the items in F r is set to be r. The lower the rank of an item is, the better it is. Let U = {1, . . . , n} \ x and θ ∈ (0, 1] We select the θ × |x| best ranked items from set x. If there is any tie in selection, we randomly select one. Let x be the set of all these selected items. We also select θ × |U| worst items from U and let them constitute Ū. Roughly speaking, x consists of the worst items in x and Ū consists of the best items in U.</p><p>Then we define N(x) as the set of all the feasible solutions which can be obtained from x by removing one item in x and adding one item from Ū to x. Obviously, θ determines the size of N(x).</p><p>3) Perturbation (Step 3.1): Let x k in P L be the current solution to subproblem k. The output of perturbation xk is generated as follows: Let S be the number of items in x k . To perturb x k , we first remove α × |x k | randomly-selected items from x k to form initial xk , where α ∈ (0, 1) is a control parameter. Then as in Initialization of x k in Step 0.1, add items to xk in a greedy way until any item addition will violate some constraint. Therefore, the size of P L (i.e., the number of weight vectors) is</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">N = C m-1 H+m-1</formula><p>where m is the number of objectives. Following the practice in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> N is set as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">VI</ref>. 2) Max is set to be 1 in our experiments. 3) θ in N(x): It is set to be 0.02. 4) α in Perturbation: It is set to be 0.05. </p></div>

The experimental results of MOTGA used in our comparison were obtained from its authors. 2) MEMOTS <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>: It is a memetic algorithm. A dynamic hypergrid in the objective space is used to guide selection. Tabu search is applied to improve each offspring. The experimental results of MEMOTS used in our comparison are from its authors' web 2 .</p><p>3) 2PPLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>: It adopted a greedy heuristic to obtain an initial population. In the second phase (i.e., Pareto local search phase), the neighborhood is defined by using two candidate lists. The experimental results of 2PPLS used in our comparison are from its author's web. As pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>, 2PPLS could involve very heavy computational overhead if the number of objectives is more than two, there is no experimental results available on instances with three or more objectives 2 . 4) MOEA/D-ACO <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>: In this experiment, the initial population was obtained by solving a set of weighted sum subproblems and the number of subproblems was the same as the number of ants.

Conclusion and future research issues Evolutionary algorithms, decomposition approaches and Pareto local search methods are often used as basic elements in designing hybrid heuristics for combinatorial MOPs. However, very little, if any, effort has been made to study how to combine these three elements together before. This paper has suggested a simple yet efficient multiobjective memtic algorithm, called MOMAD. It hybridizes all these three elements in one algorithmic framework. MOMAD provides a generic hybrid algorithmic framework to use problem specific knowledge and employ well developed single objective local search and heuristics, and Pareto local search methods for dealing with combinatorial multiobjective problems. It is a population based iterative method and thus an anytime algorithm. Extensive experiments have been conducted in this paper to study MOMAD and compare it with some other state-of-the-art algorithms on the multiobjective traveling salesman problem and the multiobjective knapsack problem. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms or performs similarly to the best so far heuristics on these two problems.</p><p>The future research avenues include the following.</p><p>1) The study of MOMAD on other hard or real-world multiobjective problems. Such a study will be useful and necessary for understanding MOMAD and establishing some working principles for designing hybrid multiobjective algorithms.</p><p>2) The study of the combination of MOMAD with the DM's preference information <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>) subject to x ∈</head><label>∈</label><figDesc>Manuscript received May 8, 2013; revised December 11, 2013; accepted December 17, 2013.

The mean C-metric values between MOMAD and the other algorithms on each instance are given in TableVII. The average running time used by each algorithm is given in TableVIII. We have the following observations. 1) In terms of both the hypervolume and C-metric values, MOMAD is much better than MOTGA and MEMOTS. For example, on the 500-3 instance, a solution set obtained by MOMAD can, on an average, dominate 79.8% of a solution set by MOTGA, and 1.0% vice versa; MOMEAD dominates MEMOTS by 79.3%, and 3.7% vice versa. On the same instance, as shown in Fig.6, MOMAD has produced much larger hypervolume values than MOTGA and MEMOTS, which confirms the advantage of MOMAD. 2) On the three biobjective instances, MOMAD performs slightly better than or about the same as 2PPLS with respect to both the hypervolume and C-metric values. MOMAD provides a mechanism to combine fine and coarse search techniques. With the help of perturbation, MOMAD may flip away from local optima and therefore it is possible to find better solutions than 2PPLS. 3) Compared with MOEA/D-ACO, MOMAD can provide much better results on the nine instances in terms of both hypervolume and C-metric. 4) The CPU running time consumed by MOMAD is at the same magnitude as that by the other algorithms on these instances.</figDesc></figure>
