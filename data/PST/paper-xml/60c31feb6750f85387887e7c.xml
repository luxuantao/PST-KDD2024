<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as state-ofthe-art collaborative filtering (CF) solution. A fundamental challenge of CF is to distill negative signals from the implicit feedback, but negative sampling in GNN-based CF has been largely unexplored. In this work, we propose to study negative sampling by leveraging both the user-item graph structure and GNNs' aggregation process. We present the MixGCF method-a general negative sampling plugin that can be directly used to train GNN-based recommender systems. In MixGCF, rather than sampling raw negatives from data, we design the hop mixing technique to synthesize hard negatives. Specifically, the idea of hop mixing is to generate the synthetic negative by aggregating embeddings from different layers of raw negatives' neighborhoods. The layer and neighborhood selection process are optimized by a theoretically-backed hard selection strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by using MixGCF, state-of-the-art GNN-based recommendation models can be consistently and significantly improved, e.g., 26% for NGCF and 22% for LightGCN in terms of NDCG@20.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Recommender systems have been widely used for avoiding information overload in applications as diverse as online shopping <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, social network <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, advertising <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and Web search <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Its goal is to provide users with personalized information feeding, that is, for each user, the problem of recommendation is to predict the items that she or he will consume.</p><p>Among the most promising techniques for this problem has been the usage of collaborative filtering (CF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, which models users' historical interactions with items to profile users and items for predicting future interactions. To date, the most prevalent CF solutions are to project users and items into the latent embedding space, such as matrix factorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> based techniques. To further improve the embedding quality, one prominent direction is to model user-item interactions as a graph and leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> to incorporate structural information into the embeddings. Notably, the GNNbased recommendation models, such as PinSage <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, NGCF <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, and LightGCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, have generated state-of-the-art performance with Web-scale applications.</p><p>The typical flow of (GNN-based) recommender systems is relatively straightforward. Given a user-item interaction graph, it begins with defining an aggregation function over the structure to propagate neighborhood information, usually followed by a pooling operation for outputting both user and item embeddings. Similar to conventional recommendation methods, its objective function is designed to prefer an observed user-item pair (as positive) to unobserved ones (as negative pairs). Take the widely-adopted BPR loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> for example, for each user and one of her positive items, we conduct negative sampling to pick one item as the negative from those she never interacts with.</p><p>Essentially, the negative samples play a decisive role in the performance of (GNN-based) recommendation models. Commonly, a uniform distribution is used for negative sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. To improve the quality of negative samples, studies have attempted to design new sampling distributions for prioritizing informative negatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>. In doing so, the model would be challenged and forced to distinguish their differences at a finer granularity. To improve negative sampling in GNNs, PinSage <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> samples the negatives based on their PageRank scores and MCNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> re-designs both positive and negative sampling distributions with their structural correlations in mind. However, these attempts in GNNs only focus on improving negative sampling in the discrete graph space, ignoring GNNs' unique neighborhood aggregation process in the embedding space.</p><p>Contributions. In this work, we propose to design negative sampling strategies for better training GNN-based recommender systems. We present a simple MixGCF framework for generating hard negative samples. Instead of directly sampling real negatives from the data, MixGCF takes inspirations from data augmentation and metric learning to synthesize negative samples by leveraging the underlying GNN-based recommender.</p><p>To make synthetic negatives hard for the recommendation models, MixGCF designs two strategies: positive mixing and hop mixing. In positive mixing, we introduce an interpolation mixing method to pollute the embeddings of raw negative samples by injecting information from positive ones into them. In hop mixing, we sample several raw negative samples, e.g., 𝑣 − 𝑖 , 𝑣 − 𝑗 , and 𝑣 − 𝑘 , in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and generate the embedding of the synthetic negative 𝑣 − by using their polluted embeddings aggregated from selected hops of their neighbors. For example, as indicated by the blue circles, hop 0, 1, and 2 are selected from 𝑣 − 𝑖 , 𝑣 − 𝑗 , and 𝑣 − 𝑘 , respectively. It is worth mentioning that the selection of which hop from whose neighborhood is guided by a designed hard selection strategy.</p><p>We perform extensive experiments on benchmark recommendation datasets. Experimental results show that by replacing their default negative sampler to MixGCF, the state-of-the-art GNN-based recommendation models can be consistently improved, such as average relative increase of 22% for LightGCN and 26% for NGCF in terms of NDCG@20. Furthermore, we compare MixGCF with various negative sampling techniques, the results of which demonstrate the empirical advantage of MixGCF over them.</p><p>In summary, our work makes the following contributions:</p><p>• Introduce the idea of synthesizing negative samples rather than directly sampling negatives from the data for improving GNNbased recommender systems.</p><p>• Present a general MixGCF framework with the hop mixing and positive mixing strategies that can be naturally plugged into GNN-based recommendation models. • Demonstrate the significant improvements that MixGCF brings to GNN recommenders, as well as its consistent outperformance over a diverse set of negative sampling techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PRELIMINARIES AND PROBLEM</head><p>In this section, we first review the overall process of graph neural network (GNN) based collaborative filtering (CF) for recommender systems. We then introduce the studied problem that concerns the training of the above process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.1Graph Neural Networks for Recommendation</head><p>Commonly, the input of recommendation systems includes a set of users U = {𝑢}, items V = {𝑣 }, and users' implicit feedback</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">O + = {(𝑢, 𝑣 + )|𝑢 ∈ U, 𝑣 + ∈ V},</formula><p>where each pair indicates an interaction between user 𝑢 and item 𝑣 + . The goal is to estimate the user preference towards items.</p><p>Recently, studies have shown that GNN-based CF models offer promising results for this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. The main idea is to measure user 𝑢's preference on item 𝑣 based on their multi-hop neighbors. Specifically, these techniques generate the latent representations of the target user and item, the inner product of which is used to quantify the preference, that is, ŷ(𝑢, 𝑣) = e * 𝑢 ⊤ e * 𝑣 . Next, we briefly introduce the process of GNN-based CF, including aggregation, pooling, and its optimization with negative sampling.</p><p>Aggregation. Each user and item are associated with an initial embedding e 𝑢 and e 𝑣 as its representation vector, respectively. In order to exploit the CF signal from neighbor nodes, GNN-based recommendation models apply different aggregation functions to propagate information over neighbors <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. Take Light-GCN for example, its aggregation process is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">e (𝑙+1) 𝑢 = 𝑖 ∈𝑁 𝑢 1 |𝑁 𝑢 ||𝑁 𝑖 | e (𝑙)</formula><p>𝑖 , e</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(𝑙+1) 𝑣 = 𝑗 ∈𝑁 𝑣 1 |𝑁 𝑣 ||𝑁 𝑗 | e (𝑙) 𝑗 .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where e</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(𝑙)</formula><p>𝑢 , e</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(𝑙)</formula><p>𝑣 are the embeddings of user 𝑢 and item 𝑣 at 𝑙-th layer of GNN, N 𝑢 denotes the set of items that interact with user 𝑢, and N 𝑣 denotes the set of users that interact with item 𝑣. By stacking multiple aggregation layers, each user/item can gather the information from its higher-order neighbors. For simplicity, we use e (𝑙) as the 𝑙-th layer embedding in the following sections.</p><p>Pooling. Different from GNNs for node classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, where representations in the final layer are used, the GNN-based CF models usually adopt the pooling operation to generate the final representations for users and items. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, this can help avoid over-smoothing and determine the importance of a node's subgraph information at different ranges.</p><p>Specifically, at the final layer 𝐿, the pooling function is applied to generate the final user/item representations e * 𝑢 /e * 𝑣 . For example, LightGCN uses sum-based pooling:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">e * 𝑢 = 𝐿 𝑙=0 𝜆 𝑙 e (𝑙) 𝑢 , e * 𝑣 = 𝐿 𝑙=0 𝜆 𝑙 e (𝑙) 𝑣 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>and NGCF uses concat-based pooling:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">e * 𝑢 = e (0) 𝑢 ||• • • ||e (𝐿)</formula><p>𝑢 , e * 𝑣 = e (0)</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">𝑣 ||• • • ||e (𝐿) 𝑣 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Optimization with Negative Sampling. The task of learning to rank is to provide a user with a ranked list of items by assuming that the items preferred by the user should rank higher than others. However, the ranked item list for each user oftentimes can only be inferred from the implicit feedback that only consists of the positive observations. One straightforward solution is to assume that users prefer the observed items over all unobserved ones. Due to the large size of unobserved items (usually in 𝑂(|V | 2 )), the learning objective is usually simplified by negative sampling as the BPR loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">max 𝑣 + ,𝑣 − ∼𝑓 S (𝑢) 𝑃 𝑢 (𝑣 + &gt; 𝑣 − |Θ)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where 𝑣 + and 𝑣 − denote the positive and negative items, respectively, 𝑃 𝑢 (𝑎 &gt; 𝑏) represents user 𝑢 prefers item 𝑎 over 𝑏, 𝑓 S (𝑢) is the distribution of negative sampling, and Θ is the parameter of the model. Most recommendation methods consider negative sample from a uniform distribution (𝑓 S (𝑢) as 𝑓 uniform (𝑢)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The Negative Sampling Problem</head><p>According to the loss function in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">4</ref>), the negative sampling strategy plays a critical role in the model training of recommendation. Intuitively, the negative samples close to positive ones, a.k.a. hard negative samples, can make the models better learn the boundary between positive and negative instances <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. To this end, several attempts have been made to sample hard negatives to improve the optimization of general recommender systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>. However, negative sampling for GNN-based recommenders has remained largely unexplored. Notably, early attempts-PinSage <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> and MCNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>-focus on improving the sampling distributions at the discrete structure level, seeking better hard negative (raw) nodes in the graph. In this work, we ask the question of whether we can synthesize harder negative samples in the continuous space, based on the GNN underlying the recommender.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">THE MIXGCF METHOD</head><p>MixGCF is a general algorithm for negative sampling in GNNbased recommendation. It can be directly plugged into existing GNN-based recommendation algorithms, such as LightGCN and NGCF.</p><p>Instead of sampling real items from the data as negative ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>, MixGCF proposes to synthesize informative (and fake) negative items based on the graph structure for training GNNbased CF recommendation models. Specifically, MixGCF introduces the positive mixing and hop mixing techniques to synthesize negative samples by mixing information from different local graphs.</p><p>The flow of MixGCF is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. In positive mixing, we develop an interpolation mixing method to inject information from positive samples to negative ones, making hard negative candidates. In hop mixing, we first leverage a hard negative selection strategy to extract unique information from each of the hard negatives generated above, and then use the pooling operation to combine the diverse information extracted for creating the fake but informative negative items.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Positive Mixing</head><p>Recall that in a 𝐿-layer GNN, for each item 𝑣, we can have 𝐿 + 1 embeddings for 𝑣, each of which e (𝑙) 𝑣 corresponds to the embedding that is aggregated with 𝑙 layers (0 ≤ 𝑙 ≤ 𝐿).</p><p>To fake the negative 𝑣 − 𝑖 with its embedding e 𝑣 − in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, we first follows the convention <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> to select 𝑀 negative items to form the candidate set M, with 𝑀 usually being much smaller than the number of items in the data. These 𝑀 negative items can form a candidate negative embedding set E = {e (𝑙)</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">𝑣 𝑚 } of size 𝑀 × (𝐿 + 1).</formula><p>A very recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> suggests that recommendation models usually operate on an input space that mainly comprises of easy negatives, therefore we propose to improve the quality of the embeddings E of candidate negatives. Inspired by 𝑚𝑖𝑥𝑢𝑝 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>, we introduce the idea of positive mixing to inject positive information e 𝑣 + into negative embeddings in E. 𝑚𝑖𝑥𝑢𝑝 is an interpolation based data augmentation method, which enforces the model to output linearly between the training data. Specifically, for each candidate negative embedding e (𝑙) 𝑣 𝑚 ∈ E, the positive mixing operation is formalized as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">e ′(𝑙) 𝑣 𝑚 = 𝛼 (𝑙) e (𝑙) 𝑣 + + (1 − 𝛼 (𝑙) )e (𝑙)</formula><p>𝑣 𝑚 , 𝛼 (𝑙) ∈ (0, 1),</p><p>where 𝛼 (𝑙) is the mixing coefficient that is uniformly sampled for each hop 𝑙. Note that the mixing coefficient of 𝑚𝑖𝑥𝑢𝑝 is sampled from a beta distribution Beta(𝛽, 𝛽), which has a heavy impact on the model's generalization ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. To decouple the impact, the mixing coefficient 𝛼 (𝑙) in our positive mixing is uniformly sampled from (0, 1) (cf. Section 4.3 for the empirical discussions on 𝛼 (𝑙) ).</p><p>Let E ′ be the enhanced embedding set for the candidate negatives M. Positive mixing enhances the negatives by (1) injecting positive information into negative samples, which can help enforce the optimization algorithm to exploit the decision boundary harder, and (2) introducing stochastic uncertainty into them with the random mixing coefficient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Hop Mixing</head><p>With the embeddings E ′ = {e ′ (𝑙)</p><p>𝑣 𝑚 } of candidate negative items enhanced by positive mixing, we present the hop mixing technique to generate the synthetic negative item 𝑣 − and its embedding e 𝑣 − . The main idea of hop mixing is to leverage the hierarchical (layerbased) aggregation process in GNNs.</p><p>Specifically, for each layer 𝑙 (0 ≤ 𝑙 ≤ 𝐿), we sample one candidate negative embedding e ′ (𝑙) ) , which contains all the 𝑙-th layer embeddings of the candidate negative items in M. Take 𝐿=2 for example, we can sample e ′ (0)</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">𝑣 𝑥 (1 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 𝑀) from E ′(𝑙</formula><p>𝑣 𝑎 , e ′ (1) 𝑣 𝑏 , and e ′ (2) 𝑣 𝑐 from E ′ . Note that 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 are not necessary to be distinct.</p><p>The idea of hop mixing is then to combine all the 𝐿+1 embeddings selected by layer to generate the representation e 𝑣 − of the (fake) negative 𝑣 − . Specifically, the representation is synthesized by fusing all candidate embeddings by the pooling operation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">e 𝑣 − = 𝑓 pool e ′(0) 𝑣 𝑥 , • • • , e ′(𝐿) 𝑣 𝑦 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where e ′ (𝑙) 𝑣 𝑥 denotes the 𝑙-th layer embedding of 𝑣 𝑥 that is sampled at layer 𝑙, and 𝑓 pool (•) applies the same pooling operation used in the current GNN-based recommender.</p><p>The essential question for hop mixing is how to effectively sample candidate embedding e ′ (𝑙)</p><p>𝑣 𝑥 (1 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 𝑀) from E ′(𝑙) at each layer 𝑙. Notably, a recent study on negative sampling for graph representation learning (MCNS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> theoretically shows that the expected risk of the optimal parameter e 𝑇 𝑢 e 𝑣 between the expected loss 𝐽 (𝜃 * ) and empirical loss 𝐽 (𝜃 𝑇 ) satisfies:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">E ||(𝜃 𝑇 − 𝜃 * ) 𝑢 || 2 = 1 𝑇 ( 1 𝑝 𝑑 (𝑣 |𝑢) − 1 + 1 𝐾𝑝 𝑛 (𝑣 |𝑢) −<label>1</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>𝐾</head><p>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> where 𝑝 𝑑 (𝑣 |𝑢), 𝑝 𝑛 (𝑣 |𝑢) denote the estimated positive distribution and negative distribution, respectively, 𝑇 is the number of node pairs, and 𝐾 is the number of negatives for each user recruiting in the loss. This derivation suggests that if 𝑝 𝑛 (𝑣 |𝑢) is proportional to 𝑝 𝑑 (𝑣 |𝑢), the expected risk is only dependent on the 𝑝 𝑑 (𝑣 |𝑢), and the interaction probability between a user-item pair with a high inner product score can be estimated accurately. Based on the above theory, the suggested way for negative sampling is to select the negative according to the estimated positive distribution. Here we apply the inner product score to approximate the positive distribution and pick the candidate sample with the highest score, which is also called the hard negative select strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>. Formally, the hard selection strategy at the 𝑙-th layer is implemented as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">e ′(𝑙) 𝑣 𝑥 = arg max e ′ (𝑙 ) 𝑣𝑚 ∈ E (𝑙 ) 𝑓 Q (𝑢, 𝑙) • e ′(𝑙) 𝑣 𝑚 , (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">)</formula><p>where • is the inner product operation, and 𝑓 Q (𝑢, 𝑙) is a query mapping that returns an embedding related to the target user 𝑢 for the 𝑙-th hop. The query in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">8</ref>) is dependent on the pooling module of the GNN used for recommendation. As discussed in Section 2, the mainstream pooling module in GNN-based recommendation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> can be categorized into sum-based and concat-based pooling operations. Therefore, there are two options for the inner product between the target user embedding e 𝑢 and the embedding of the synthesized negative e </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Optimization with MixGCF</head><p>Now, we can use the proposed MixGCF method as the negative sampling method 𝑓 S (•) in the loss function (Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">4</ref>)) to optimize the parameters of the GNN-based recommendation model. Straightforwardly, the BPR loss function can be updated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">L BPR = (𝑢,𝑣 + )∈ O + e 𝑣 − ∼𝑓 MixGCF (𝑢,𝑣 + ) ln 𝜎 (e 𝑢 • e 𝑣 − − e 𝑢 • e 𝑣 + ),<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where 𝜎(•) is the sigmoid function, O + is the set of the positive feedback, and e 𝑣 − ∼ 𝑓 MixGCF (𝑢, 𝑣 + ) represents that the instance (embedding) e 𝑣 − is synthesized by the proposed MixGCF method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Discussions on MixGCF</head><p>General Plugin. Observed from Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">9</ref>), the proposed negative sampling method-MixGCF-can be naturally plugged into the ranking loss. In addition, MixGCF is a simple and non-parametric method. Altogether, these make MixGCF a general technique for improving a set of GNN-based recommendation models.</p><p>Data Augmentation. Unlike the prior efforts which elaborate versatile strategies to sample an existing negative item, MixGCF instead proposes the paradigm of synthesizing negative items based on the hop-wise sampling. Such a method could be also understood from the perspective of data augmentation, since the synthesized instance is conformed to but different from the existing instances <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. This enables the recommender to be trained on the more sophisticated data, leading to an improved generalization.</p><p>Approximation of Multiple Negatives. As shown in metric learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, recruiting multiple negative instances in loss function for each update can speed up the convergence of the underlying model and offer better performances. Instead of directly sampling multiple negatives, MixGCF naturally provides a low-cost approximation of them by hop mixing, potentially making it benefit from the metric learning conclusion above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Time Complexity</head><p>The time cost of MixGCF mainly comes from two parts. For the hop mixing module, the computational complexity of the hop-grained negative selection scheme is 𝑂(𝑀𝐿𝑑), where 𝑀 is the size of the negative candidate set, 𝐿 is the number of GNN layers, and 𝑑 is the embedding dimension. For the positive mixing module, the complexity of the linear combination is 𝑂(𝑀𝐿𝑑), which is equivalent to the hop mixing module's. Therefore, the time complexity of MixGCF is 𝑂(𝑀𝐿𝑑).</p></div>

We follow the same settings described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref> to split the datasets into training, validation, and testing sets.</p><p>Evaluation Metrics. We choose the widely-used Recall@𝑁 and NDCG@𝑁 as the evaluation metrics (𝑁 = 20 by default). Unlike the previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref> that conduct the sampled metrics, we compute Recall@𝑁 and NDCG@𝑁 by the all-ranking protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. We report the average metrics of all users in each testing set.</p><p>Recommender. To verify the effectiveness of MixGCF, we perform experiments on three GNN-based recommenders as follows.</p><p>The detailed descriptions are in Section 2.1.</p><p>• LightGCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>: This is a state-of-the-art CF method. LightGCN claims that the design of NGCF is heavy and burdensome since each node in the user-item graph is only described by an ID. LightGCN omits the non-linear transformation and applies the sum-based pooling module to achieve better empirical performance.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, NGCF applies the message-passing scheme on the bipartite useritem graph to exploit the high-order neighbors' information. To be specific, each node obtains the transformed representations of its multi-hop neighbors by recursively aggregating the message propagated from the adjacent neighbors. • PinSage <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>: As an inductive variant of GNN, PinSage designs a random-walk based sampling method to sample neighbors for each node and proposes to sample hard negative based on PageRank score. We apply a sum-based pooling strategy to generate the embeddings of nodes.</p><p>Baselines. We compare the proposed method, MixGCF, with static (RNS), hard negative (DNS), GAN-based (IRGAN and AdvIR), and graph-based (MCNS) sampler, as follows:</p><p>• RNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>: Random negative sampling (RNS) strategy applies uniform distribution to sample negative items. It is independent of the recommender and is applied in various tasks.</p><p>• DNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>: Dynamic negative sampling (DNS) strategy is the stateof-the-art sampler <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, which adaptively selects the negative item scored highest by the recommender. Such the negative is viewed as the hard negative and can provide a large gradient to the parameters. • IRGAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>: IRGAN integrates the recommender into a generative adversarial net (GAN) where the generator performs as a sampler to pick the negative for confusing the recommender.</p><p>• AdvIR <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>: AdvIR is also an adversarial sampler that incorporates adversarial sampling with adversarial training by adding adversarial perturbation.</p></div>

The observations are as followed:</p><p>• LightGCN consistently outperforms NGCF and PinSage by a large margin on three datasets, verifying that the nonlinearity and weight matrix are useless for collaborative filtering. • MixGCF yields the best performance on all the datasets. These improvements are attributed to the following reasons: (1) Through hop mixing technique, MixGCF augments the negative samples, which improves the generalization of recommender; (2) The synthesized hard negative that incorporates the different semantics information from multiple instances offers a informative gradient to the recommender. • The relative improvements on NGCF and PinSage are more significant than on LightGCN. Some possible reasons are: (1) The burdensome design offers a larger parameter space, meaning that NGCF and PinSage may benefit more from an informative negative;</p><p>(2) As a state-of-the-art CF model, LightGCN is capable of discriminating between the positive and easy negative item. Thus, the impact of synthesized hard negative to LightGCN is not as significant as the other two recommendation models. • DNS performs as the strongest baseline in most cases, which is consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. It reveals that selecting the hardest negative provides a meaningful gradient to guide the model.   Table <ref type="table">6</ref>: Impact of the number of negative instances (𝐾).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Study of MixGCF</head><p>In this section, we first conduct an ablation study to investigate the effect of positive mixing. Towards the further analysis, we explore the influence of neighbor range, i.e., the number of aggregation modules. We then study how different size of candidate set and the distribution of the random coefficient in positive mixing affect the performance. In what follows, we extend the pairwise BPR loss to 𝐾-pair loss for analyzing the impact of the number of negative instances. For a fair comparison, we use the identical experimental settings as Section 4.2.</p><p>Impact of Presence of Positive Mixing. To verify the impact of positive mixing, we do an ablation study by disabling the positive mixing module (cf. Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">5</ref>)) of MixGCF, termed MixGCF w/o p-m . The experimental results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> and we further plot the training curves of LightGCN, NGCF and PinSage in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. The observations are as followed:</p><p>• Aligning with Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> in Section 4.2, removing the positive mixing module degrades the performance of recommenders in most cases, indicating the necessity of positive mixing. • Without positive mixing, MixGCF still outperforms DNS in most cases, manifesting that the hop-wise sampling is more effective than instance-wise sampling in GNN-based recommendation. • Comparing the training curves of MixGCF and MixGCF w/o p-m , it can be founded that the performance of MixGCF w/o p-m soars in the early phase but quickly reaches the peak and plumbs while MixGCF benefits from positive mixing and becomes more robust against the over-fitting.</p><p>Impact of Neighbor Range. To analyze the impact of the neighbor range, we vary 𝐿 in the range of {1, 2, 3} and summarize the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>. We observe that:</p><p>• Increasing the neighbor range can improve the performance of recommenders in most cases. It is reasonable since considering the larger range of neighbors, more negative items can be integrated into the synthesized negative. • It can be found that MixGCF-1 achieves comparable or even higher performance to the MixGCF-2 and MixGCF-3 on PinSage. The possible reason is that the heavy design makes PinSage suffer from the risk of over-smoothing.</p><p>Impact of Candidate Set. We also conduct an experiment to analyze the influence of the size of the candidate set 𝑀. We search 𝑀 in range of {8, 16, 32, 64} and sum up the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> where the best results is highlighted (starred). The observations are as followed:</p><p>• Increasing the candidate set size enhances the accuracy of recommenders in most cases. For example, NGCF obtains the best performance on three datasets with 𝑀 = 64. • Interestingly, the improvements on Amazon is not significant as the other datasets when 𝑀 is increased. We attribute it to the different scale and distribution of these datasets.</p><p>Impact of Distribution of Positive Mixing. Since the random coefficient 𝛼 (𝑙) is the core of positive mixing, we conduct a experiment to investigate the impact of its distribution on Light-GCN. We explore different choices according to the relevant researches <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>:</p><p>• Beta distribution. 𝑚𝑖𝑥𝑢𝑝 <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> samples a mixing coefficient from Beta distribution Beta(𝛽, 𝛽) to interpolates two samples. Following its experimental settings, we vary 𝛽 in range {0.2, 0.4}. • Gaussian distribution. Gaussian distribution Gaus(𝜇, 𝜎) is one of the most prevalent distributions in machine learning. Here we fix 𝜇 = 0.5, 𝜎 = 0.1. • Uniform distribution. MoCHi <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> serves for self-supervised learning approaches, and proposes creating a convex linear combination of negative feature and query feature <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for alleviating the false negative issue. It randomly samples a mixing coefficient from uniform distribution Uni(0, 𝑎). Following its setting and our positive mixing, we fix 𝑎 = 0.5, 1 to study.</p><p>The experimental results are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref>. We have the following observations:</p><p>• Our original setting in positive mixing, i.e., Uni(0, 1), yields the best performance in all the cases. Comparing with Uni(0, 0.5), the possible reason why Uni(0, 1) achieves a higher performance is that limiting the selecting range of random coefficient will reduce the search space of the model's parameters. • The beta distribution does not perform well on three datasets.</p><p>We attribute it to the requirement of a sophisticated selection of the hyper-parameter 𝛽, which is known as a limitation of 𝑚𝑖𝑥𝑢𝑝.</p><p>Based on the above discussions, we find that sampling 𝛼 (𝑙) from uniform distribution leads to a good performance. Thus, to avoid complicating MixGCF, we fix the sampling distribution as Uni(0, 1).</p><p>Impact of Number of Negatives. We further conduct an experiment to investigate the influence of the number of negative instances 𝐾. Most of the prior work on negative sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref> apply pairwise BPR loss to optimize the model. Inspired by the efforts on metric learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, we generalize the pairwise BPR loss to 𝐾-pair loss and study its effect on MixGCF. We vary 𝐾 in range of {1, 2, 4, 8}. Note that when 𝐾 = 1, the 𝐾-pair loss will degenerate into the BPR loss. The detailed description of 𝐾-pair loss is in Appendix A.2. We summarize the results in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>, and observe that increasing the 𝐾 enhances the performance of the recommender consistently in most cases, verifying the effectiveness of the combination of MixGCF and 𝐾-pair loss. Such a phenomenon is expected since that the model distinguishes multiple synthesized negatives at the same time can lead to a more discriminative representation of the data and faster convergence.</p></div>

To provide personalized information accurately, the recommendation system should estimate the preference of users towards myriad items.

To be specific, many recent works <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> consider the interactions between users and items as a bipartite graph, and utilize the graph neural network (GNN) to refine the representations of each node. For example, PinSage <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> designs a random-walk based sampling method to sample neighborhoods and the visit counts are taken as the importance coefficients during aggregation. GC-MC <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> models each node only with its adjacent neighbors by the aggregation module for the rating prediction task. NGCF <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> exploits the multi-hop community information by recursively propagating the message and combines the representations of different layers to obtain a better performance. LightGCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> argues the burdensome design of NGCF and simplifies the aggregation module by removing the nonlinear feature transformation.</p><p>To alleviate the cold-start issue and enhance the performance, some previous works take the side information, e.g., social network <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref> and knowledge graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>, into account. For instance, GraphRec <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> integrates the users into a social network and refines the representations of each node with a graph attention network. KGAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> integrates the items into a knowledge graph and considers the interaction between users and items as a relation.

In recent years, negative sampling has been studied in recommendation task for solving one-class problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. To be specific, most interactions between users and items are in the form of implicit feedback, which only consists of positive feedback. Existing negative sampling methods roughly fall into four groups.</p><p>Static Sampler <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> samples the negative item from a fixed distribution. Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> applies uniform distribution to sample negative, which is one of the most prevalent methods. In addition, the negative sampling distribution of some previous work on network embedding <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref> is proportional to the 3/4 power of the positive distribution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref> is an adversarial sampler based on generative adversarial network (GAN). For example, IRGAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> trains a generative adversarial network to play a min-max game with the recommender. The sampler performs as a generator and samples the negative to confuse the recommender. KBGAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> applies the framework to knowledge graph embedding task by training two translation-based models.

As a representative hard negative sampler, DNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> selects the negative scored highest by the recommender. The main difference between MixGCF and DNS is the sampling level. To be specific, DNS is an instance-wise sampling method, which aims to sample a representation for one certain item. MixGCF is developed to serve the GNN-based recommender and is a hop-wise sampling method which samples the representations of each hop among the negative. Besides, MixGCF applies the positive mixing to improve the quality of negative candidates (Section 3.1). <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> samples the negative based on the graph information. For example, MCNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> derives a theory to quantify the impact of the negative sampling distribution, and based on the theory, it approximates the positive distribution with self-contrast approximation. KGPolicy <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> incorporates knowledge graph into negative sampling and develop a reinforcement learning agent to sample high-quality negative items.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this work, we study the GNN-based recommendations with the goal of improving the quality of negative samples. We devise a simple and non-parametric method: MixGCF, which is a general technique for the GNN-based recommendation models. Instead of sampling existing negative items, MixGCF integrates multiple negatives to synthesize a hard negative by positive mixing and hop mixing. We conduct experiments on public datasets and the results suggest that MixGCF can empower state-of-the-art GNN-based recommenders to achieve significant performance improvements over their original versions.</p><p>Capturing (negative) signals from data implicitly plays a crucial role in various fundamental learning tasks, such as contrastive learning and self-supervised learning. One promising direction is to bridge the developments from different topics for deriving general insights and inspiring perspectives. In the future, we would like to explore and further the techniques proposed in MixGCF for graph and relational data pre-training, so as to learn strongly generalizable representations of data. </p></div>
