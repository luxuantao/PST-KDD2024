<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The prognostics and health management (PHM) of the mechanical equipment has received much attention, and the prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) is the core of the PHM <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. By predicting the RUL of the machine, it is possible to adjust the mechanical operation and propose a maintenance strategy in a targeted manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. There are three types of methods for predicting the RUL of mechanical equipment: model-based prognostics, data-driven prognostics, and hybrid approaches. Model-based prediction uses a physical understanding (physical model) of the system to predict the RUL, which can be divided into micro-level model <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and macro-level model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> based on modeling physics levels. Micro-level model, also known as damage propagation models, need to consider assumptions and simplifications in uncertainty management, which can impose significant limitations on the method. The macrolevel model is a simplified representation of the system. It defines the relationship between input variables, state variables, and system output. Data-driven prognostics typically use pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to detect the state of the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The datadriven method is suitable for applications in the complex system, as it does not require a comprehensive understanding of the system. Modeling strategies for data-driven prediction methods can be of two types: 1) modeling cumulative damage and then inferring the damage threshold, 2) learning the RUL directly from the data.</p><p>The classical data-driven prediction methods usually use a stochastic model to describe the degradation process of the system. Considering it is difficult to calculate the closedform solution due to the state-dependent model, Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> proposed a general expression of age and state-dependent models to describe the system degradation processes. Different operating conditions and health conditions lead to different degradation processes of the system, which makes the RUL prediction difficult. In order to solve this problem, a wiener-process-model (WPM)-based method <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for RUL prediction was proposed considering unit-to-unit variability. It is difficult to predict the RUL of mechanical equipment with complex system structure and harsh operating environment. Based on this, Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> combined the unscented Kalman filter with the particle filter to replace the standard particle filter, and used Markov chain Monte Carlo to improve the prediction accuracy. Qian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> proposed a RUL prediction method that combines enhanced phase space warping (PSW) with an improved Paris crack propagation model, in which PSW is enhanced by multidimensional autoregressive (AR) models to improve accuracy defect tracking and the Paris crack growth model modified by time segmentation algorithm for real-time RUL prediction.</p><p>In the past decade, due to the rise of deep learning (DL), data-driven prediction methods have focused more on the use of flexible models, such as various types of neural networks (NN). Yan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> combined with deep denoising algorithm autoencoder (DDA) and regression operation proposed a device electrocardiogram (DECG) concept for predicting the RUL of industrial equipment. Guo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> found that the predicting accuracy of bearing RUL is greatly influenced by health indicators, but existing signal extraction methods cannot meet the requirements. Therefore, 6 new related similar features and 8 classical time-frequency features are combined to form the original feature set, and the monotonicity and correlation metrics are used to select the most sensitive features. Finally, the selected sensitive features as input to the recurrent neural network (RNN). The echo state networks (ESNs) are also commonly used for mechanical RUL prediction. Rigamonti et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> resort to a ESNs to improve the performance of individual ESN and use the improved ESN for RUL prediction.</p><p>The main disadvantage of the data-driven method is that it has a wider confidence interval than other methods, and it requires a large amount of data for training. Moreover, it is difficult to get run-to-failure data, especially for a new systems, because running a system failure can be a lengthy and rather expensive process. So the public databases is usually used to verify the proposed model, such as battery dataset and turbofan engine degradation simulation dataset provided by the prognostics CoE at NASA Ames, FEMTO bearing dataset provided by FEMTO-ST institute.</p><p>As a reusable battery, lithium-ion batteries (LIB) have become a core component of the energy supply for most devices, so it is necessary to predict its RUL <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Ren et al. combined the autoencoder with deep neural network (DNN) to predict the RUL of LIB <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In order to solve the problem that the battery capacity cannot be measured in operation, Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> proposed a new method combining indirect health index (HI) and multi-Gaussian process regression (GPR) model. The most existing LIB battery RUL prediction model is developed using offline training data. However, the load current, temperature, and state of charge of the electric lithium-ion battery vary with the working conditions, which results in a well-trained prediction model is not suitable for practical applications. To address this problem, Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> proposed a RUL prediction model combine the Box-Cox transformation (BCT) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, which BCT transform the available capacity data and builds a linear model between the transformed capacities and cycles, and MC simulation generates RUL prediction uncertainty.</p><p>Bearings are also the core components of the mechanical equipment, and their RUL prediction is also necessary. There are many applications for validating models using the FEMTO bearing dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In order to overcome the problem of separation of feature extraction methods from RUL models, Ren et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> proposed a multi-scale dense gate multiplexing unit network (MDGRU) to predict RUL of bearing. Ren et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proposes a new method based on deep convolution neural network (DCNN) to predict RUL of bearing, and a new feature extraction method is presented to obtain the spectrum-principal-energy-vector. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> proposed a new model with stage correlation and Bayesian method for RUL prediction, which solves the problem that the two stages are mutually independent. There are many other methods to predict bearing RUL using various feature extraction methods and DL architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</p><p>Aircraft is one of the most necessary directions for PHM, and short-term faults in equipment can have a significant impact on operation. Khelif et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> used support vector regression to model the direct relationship between sensor values or HIs, and can estimate the RUL directly from the sensor values without estimating the degradation state or failure threshold. Ordóñez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> combined the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and SVM algorithms to predict turbofan engine RUL. There are also many researches on engine RUL prediction by establishing a degradation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Among all methods of engine RUL prediction, DNN-based research accounts for the majority. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> employs a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to evolve multiple DBNs simultaneously subject to accuracy and diversity as two conflicting objectives. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> proposed a new DCNN prediction model to predict turbofan engine RUL. Long short term memory (LSTM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref> is a kind of RNN, which can solve the problem of gradient disappearance and explosion in a long sequence training. Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> used the vanilla LSTM network to obtain good RUL prediction accuracy in the case of complicated operations, model degradation and strong noise. Ellefsen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> established a semisupervised model for RUL prediction to provide high RUL prediction accuracy even with reduced amounts of labeled training data. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> combined transfer learning and Bi-directional long short term memory (BLSTM) network for RUL prediction, in which the model can first be trained by different but related datasets, and then fine-tuned by target dataset.</p><p>This paper proposes a DAG network based on LSTM and CNN to improve the accuracy of the RUL prediction of the machine. Moreover, a sliding time window (TW) is used to extract data so that the input of the prediction model has the same short-term time series length. And the piece-wise RUL function is applied instead of the traditional RUL function. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the methodology of the proposed method is introduced. In Section 3, the validation dataset, the preparation of the data, and the model evaluation method are described. In Section 4, the validation results of the proposed model using the validation database is reported. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. METHODOLOGY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. FRAMEWORK OF PROPOSED DAG NETWORK</head><p>This paper proposed a DAG network combined CNN and LSTM networks for estimating the RUL of mechanical equipment. Although the combination of LSTM and CNN for RUL prediction has been reported in the literature, the method presented in this paper is different. Hinchi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> used a combination of CNN and LSTM networks, first applying CNN to extract signal features and input them into the LSTM network. However, when the CNN is used as the feature extractor, the extracted features have a great influence on the training of the LSTM network, and the CNN cannot be corrected according to the prediction error of the LSTM. Based on this, the proposed method in this paper places CNN and LSTM in parallel into the DAG network. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the DAG network contains two paths: LSTM path and CNN path. There is no correlation between the two paths, but the output of both paths affect the RUL prediction. The constructed DAG network is a holistic model that can correct each parameter in the network according to the predicted error. The model structure of the two paths can increase the stability and accuracy of prediction, and the compact network structure saves time and convenience in training. The collected data is simply processed and input to the DAG network to train the prediction network. The specific process as follows: 1) Data preparation and model development: The first step is to simply process the health-to-failure data as an input to the DAG network. There are n features signal in the Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, and the signal length is Ls cycles, i.e., machine life span. The data is extracted by sliding the time window (TW) with the length of t l cycles, and the sliding step size is one cycle. The size of the array that extracted each time by TW is t l ×n (length of TW × numbers of features), and the number of arrays is Ls-t l (life span-time window length). So now the input data size is {t l ×n}, the sampling size is Ls-t l , and the output is the RUL corresponding [Ls-t l , Ls-t l -1... 1]. Then, the input data is transposed and cut into m pieces (T 1 , T 2 … T m ) along the column direction to obtain the data size {n×(t l /m)}×m. The processed data is input into the two paths of the DAG network, and the obtained results will be summed and continue to propagate forward. 4) Sum the outputs of two paths and continue to propagate forward: The output vectors of the two paths will be summed by elements-wise, which requires the output of both paths to have the same dimension. The combined data will be entered into the LSTM 2 network with the cell nodes u 2 . The output of the last cell of the LSTM 2 network will be input to the fully connected layer. The output node of the fully connected layer is one, which is the estimated RUL. 5) Correction the DAG network based on training error between actual output and ideal output. 6) Repeat step 2-5 until the maximum training epochs is reached. 7) Finally, the trained network is used to predict the RUL of the machine.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. 2D-CONVOLUTIONAL LAYER</head><p>Inspired by the visual center of the cat, the idea of convolutional neural networks (CNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>  The convolution operation as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. A sliding convolutional filters moving along the vertically and horizontally to extracts data from 2D-input. The size of the filter should be the same as the size of the convolution kernel, filter size in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> is <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, and the sliding step size for traversing the input vertically and horizontally is <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. There are three types of convolution kernels, corresponding to three feature maps. One convolution operation as follows: the result matrix of the dot product of the convolution filter and the convolution kernel is summed, and then a bias term is added. With the translation of the convolution filter in the horizontal and vertical directions, the convolution operation is repeated to obtain a complete feature map.</p><p>The convolution operation and the activation operation can be calculated by ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. POOLING LAYER</head><p>The main purpose of the pooling layer is to compress the input by down sampling without affecting the input quality. On the one hand, the pooling operation can simplify the computational complexity of the network by compressing the input. On the other hand, feature compression is performed to extract the main features. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> shows the pooling layer operation, where the input matrix dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, pooling size is <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, and pooling sliding step size for traversing the input vertically and horizontally is <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref>. There are many types of pooling operations, such as average pooling, maximum pooling, and overlapping pooling.  The average pooling operation and the maximum pooling operation can be calculated by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">9</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</p><p>Ave_pooling( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">n ij ij d  yf<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Max_pooling( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">n ij ij d  yf (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>where 𝑑 𝑖𝑗 𝑛 is the output of pooling operation, n represents the n-th feature maps, i and j correspond to the number of steps of the pooling filter in the vertical and horizontal directions, yf ij is the pooling filter matrix, Ave_pooling(*) operation is average all the elements in *, and Max_pooling(*) operation is select the maximum elements in *.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. FLATTEN LAYER AND FULLY CONNECTED LAYER</head><p>The role of the flatten layer is to flatten several 2D or 3D data, and the output is a one-dimensional vector. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows the flatten operation, turning the data into one dimension in order to make it as an input to the fully connected layer.  The fully connected layer connects all the nodes between the adjacent layers, so that the features extracted from the front can be integrated. Due to its fully connected nature, the full connected layer usually has the largest amount of parameters. The calculation process of the fully connected layer can be expressed by the <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">fc fc ()   H W s b (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><p>where W fc is the weight matrix of the fully connected layer, b fc is the bias vector, s is the inputs, and H is the output matrix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. EXPERIMENTAL</head><p>In this section, the C-MAPSS simulated turbofan engine dataset is used to validate the proposed DAG prediction model. The main contents of this section include: description of the C-MAPSS database, sensors data selection, data normalization, definition of piece-wise RUL function, and model evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. C-MAPSS DATASET DESCRIPTION</head><p>The degradation data of the turbofan engine used in this paper is simulated by C-MAPSS developed by NASA <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p><p>A simplified diagram of the simulation engine is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, which the main components includes: fan, low pressure compressor (LPC), high pressure compressor (HPC), combustor, high pressure turbine (HPT), low pressure turbine (LPT), and nozzle. parameters that allow the user to enter specific values, such as Fuel flow, Fan flow modifier, and Fan pressure-ratio modifier, etc. The input to the C-MAPSS contains 14 factors that affect the degradation of the turbofan engine, and the output of the simulation model represents the health condition of the turbofan engine. A description of the 21 simulation outputs of C-MAPSS is shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The legend of column 5 'Trend' represents the degradation trend of the output, where ↑ indicates that the parameter is ascending with time, ↓ indicates that the parameter is descending with time, and ~ indicates that the parameter is irregular with time. In this paper, 14 outputs with regular trend <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> are selected as inputs to the DAG network. The CMAPSS dataset can be divided into four subdatasets according to different operating conditions and fault modes. A description of four sub-databases is given in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. Each sub-database contains training data, test data, and the actual RUL corresponding to the test data. The training data contains all the engine data from a certain health state to the fault, while the test data is a piece of data before the engine running fault. Moreover, the training and test data respectively contain a certain number of engines with different initial health states. Due to the different initial health states of engines, the running cycles of different engines in the same database are different. Taking the FD001 database as an example, the test set contains 100 engines, with a maximum running cycle of 303 and a minimum running cycle of 31. In order to test all the engine in the test set, the sliding window length is usually smaller than the minimum running cycles in the test set. The data size obtained by the sliding TW processing is 30×14, the training samples is 17631, and the test sample size is 100. </p><formula xml:id="formula_13">c c c c c ii x x x x   <label>(13)</label></formula><p>where 𝑥 𝑖 𝑐 is the i-th output of sensors c, 𝑥̅ 𝑐 is the average value of all outputs of sensor c, 𝜎 𝑐 is the standard deviation of all outputs of sensor c, 𝑥 min 𝑐 is the minimum value of sensor c output, 𝑥 max 𝑐 is the maximum value of sensor c output, and 𝑦 𝑖 𝑐 is the normalized data. The data normalization processing method selected in this paper is the z-score normalization. The RUL defines the time that the equipment can still operate. It is generally considered that the RUL decreases linearly with time. However, in practical application, the degradation of the equipment at the beginning of operation is not obvious. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>(a), the signals have not significant trend within the assumed health range of green. Based on this, this paper applies a piece-wise linear function <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> to represent the RUL, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7(b)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. MODEL EVALUATION</head><p>When using the trained model to predict the RUL of machine, there is a prediction error ( ℎ = RUL predict -RUL actual ) between the predicted RUL and the actual RUL. The model can be evaluated by an evaluation method using the prediction errors. Two commonly used evaluation methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> are described as follow: 1) RMSE: For the evaluation of the life prediction model, RMSE is a commonly used method with the same penalties for early and late predictions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">2 1 1 RMSE N j j h N    (14)</formula><p>where h j is the prediction error, N is the test sample size.</p><p>2) Score: The scoring function was first proposed at the international conference on prognostics and health management (PHM08) to be used to evaluate the data challenge model. Mathematical calculations can be achieved by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, which have different penalties for early and late predictions. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> compares the two evaluation methods. The similarity between the two methods is that the closer the prediction error is to 0, the smaller the output. The difference between the two methods is that RMSE has the same penalties for early and late predictions, while score is different. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. PREDICTED FINAL RUL OF EACH TEST ENGINE</head><p>The proposed DAG network is used to predict the RUL of the engine of C-MAPSS dataset. Taking the FD001 database as an example, the TW length is set to 30, and the data size obtained after data cutting is {14×3}×10. The LSTM 1 cell node is set to 21, containing 10 cells, and the output of each cell is saved and input to the next layer.</p><p>The size of the convolution kernel in path 2 is <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, the number of kernel is 3, and the sliding step size is <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. The pooling size is set to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, stride is <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. The cell node of LSTM 2 is set to 10, and the output mode is 'last mode', i.e., only the output of the last cell is saved. Finally, there is a fully connected layer with an output node of 1. When the model is back propagated, 'rmsprop' is used as the optimizer, the learning rate is set to 0.005, and the mini-batch is set to 100. The sliding TW lengths of different sub-datasets are different, as shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.  The DAG network was trained with four sub-databases in C-MAPSS and tested with all test engines. The test results of each test engine in the test set are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>. The 4 graphs correspond to 4 sub-databases, the horizontal axis is the number of engines, the vertical axis is the RUL, the blue solid line in the graph represents the predicted RUL, and the yellow dash-dotted line represents the actual RUL. The number of test engines in databases FD001 and FD003 is less than the remaining two sub-datasets. Moreover, it can be observed from the figure that the coincidence degree between the predicted RUL curve and the actual RUL curve in the graph (a) is the best, followed by graph (c). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref> shows the test engines error distribution histogram of 4 test datasets, including the RMSE of each test dataset. The horizontal axis represents the error between prediction RUL and actual RUL, and the vertical axis represents the number of engines corresponding to the error region. It can be seen from the figure that the error spans of FD001 and D003 are smaller, and the corresponding RMSE values are also lower. The prediction error distribution of FD001 and FD003 is concentrated between <ref type="bibr">[-20, 20]</ref>, and the other two datasets prediction error are concentrated between <ref type="bibr">[-40, 40]</ref>. According to Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, the databases FD002 and FD004 contain data of six working conditions, which is more complicated than the other two databases, and the prediction challenge is even greater. The reason why the prediction result of FD001 is slightly better than FD003 is that there are two fault modes in FD003.</p><p>This paper compares the proposed method with other research methods present in recent 4 years that also apply C-MAPSS dataset validation. The RMSE and score of the different methods test result were compared, as shown in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> and<ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. The second column of Table <ref type="table">3</ref> is the year in which the prediction method was proposed, and it can be found that the prediction results are gradually getting better as the new method is proposed. The RMSE values of the proposed method predicted results can be presented from Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, where the RMSE values of the 4 sub-datasets are the lowest of all methods. Similarly, the scores of the predicted results are shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, in which the proposed method has the lowest scores except for in the dataset FD003. It can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> that the lower the score and RMSE, the better the prediction ability of the prediction model. The score of proposed method under FD003 dataset is higher than several of the comparison methods because there has one large late prediction in the 100 test engines. As can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>(c) and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10(c</ref>), the RUL estimate of engine #16 is a late prediction, and the prediction error is within the range of 50-60, which is the reason for the larger score.  Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref> shows the effect of the TW length on the prediction results of the developed model. The figure shows the boxplot of each engine final RUL prediction error and the RMSE under different TW length. It can be seen from the figure that as the length of the TW increases, the engine prediction error is increasingly concentrated near zero and the RMSE also drops. It can be concluded that increasing the length of the time window can enhance the prediction accuracy of the model. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. PREDICTED FULL LIFE CYCLES OF EACH TEST ENGINE</head><p>The previous section presents the results of using the model to predict the final RUL of the each test engine. Next, this section presents a complete prediction of the degradation process for each test engine. Fig. <ref type="figure">12</ref> shows the predicted degradation process and the actual degradation process for the 4 randomly selected engines from all 100 test engines. In this paper, the sliding TW is used to process the data. The predicted RUL corresponds to the life of the last time series in the TW, so the abscissa of the prediction curve does not start from 0. And the length of the blank before the prediction curve is equal to the length of the TW. The value at the top of the graph is the RMSE of the predicted result of the engine.  Observe these three graph, it can found that the common point is that the remaining period of the test engine is large, and the time cycle span is also large. In contrast, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">14(a</ref>) and (b), when the predicted RUL span and the time cycle span are small, the prediction error increases. The longer the engine runs, the more pronounced the degradation of the engine. When the model is trained, the 'memory' of the model for the late stage of degradation is deeper than the early stage, so the predicted result is getting better and better with time cycles. Both Fig. <ref type="figure">13</ref>(a) and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">14(c</ref>) show that the prediction results in the later period of the time cycle are better than the early stage. The value at the top of the graph is the RMSE of the predicted result of the engine. Fig. <ref type="figure">13</ref>-15 presents the engines predicted degradation process for the other three sub-datasets. The RUL prediction results of Fig. <ref type="figure">12(c),</ref><ref type="figure">(d</ref>) and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">14(d</ref>) are very good, especially for the prediction of the RUL at the last cycle. Observe these three graph, it can found that the common point is that the remaining period of the test engine is large, and the time cycle span is also large. In contrast, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">14(a</ref>) and (b), when the predicted RUL span and the time cycle span are small, the prediction error increases. The longer the engine runs, the more pronounced the degradation of the engine. When the model is trained, the 'memory' of the model for the late stage of degradation is deeper than the early stage, so the predicted result is getting better and better with time cycles. Both Fig. <ref type="figure">13</ref>(a) and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">14(c</ref>) show that the prediction results in the later period of the time cycle are better than the early stage.</p><p>The actual RUL in Fig. <ref type="figure">12</ref>(b) and 13(c) is a straight line, but the predicted RUL curve is different. The reason for this may be that this paper replaces the original linear function with a piecewise linear RUL function, so that it is possible for the engine has a degradation trend but the corresponding RUL has not changed. Therefore, it can be inferred that the engine in Fig. <ref type="figure">12(b</ref>) is in an earlier fully healthy state, while the engine in Fig. <ref type="figure">13(c</ref>) is going to be degraded. The Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">15</ref>(b) can verify the previous inference that the predicted RUL is maintained at the early time cycle. And the predicted RUL has changed when there is a degradation trend but the actual RUL has not decreased.</p><p>Next, the prediction results of the three methods are compared, where method 1 is only LSTM without WT processing, method 2 is only CNN without data cutting, and method 3 is the proposed DAG network. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">16</ref> shows a boxplot of the RMSE of all test engine prediction results for the three methods. It can be seen from the figure that the RMSE distribution region of the proposed method is lower and relatively concentrated. Method 1 without TW processing has the largest RMSE distribution span, which indicates that the prediction of early time cycles is not good when the entire time sequence is used as input. The Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">17</ref> presents the distribution of all prediction engine score for the three methods. Compared to RMSE, the score distribution of each test engine is more dispersed. This is because the score for each test engine is the cumulative of the all cycle error of the engine, so the number of predicted cycles of the test engine will affect the score. Observing the results of all the 4 datasets, it is not difficult to find that the proposed DAG has the best prediction results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, a new DAG network structure combining LSTM and CNN was presented. The sliding TW is applied to process the raw data into a data table with the same length of time sequence. And the traditional linear RUL function is replaced by the improved piece-wise linear function according to the fault occurrence mechanism. The turbofan engine degradation simulation dataset provided by NASA was used to validate the developed prediction model. And the following conclusions can be drawn: 1) Compared with the RUL prediction methods reported in recent 4 years using the C-MAPSS dataset validation, the proposed method provides a better RUL prediction performance in terms of RMSE and score. 2) Increasing the length of the sliding TW can improve the prediction performance of the developed model.</p><p>3) The degradation of the turbine engine in the later period of operation is more obvious. So the model has a deeper 'memory' of the later stage of degradation during the training. As a result, when the whole life cycle of each engine is predicted, the prediction accuracy at the later stage of degradation is better than that at the early stage. 4) Compared with using CNN or LSTM methods alone, the RUL prediction performance of the two-path DAG network proposed in this paper is better.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>2 )FIGURE 1 .</head><label>21</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1.
