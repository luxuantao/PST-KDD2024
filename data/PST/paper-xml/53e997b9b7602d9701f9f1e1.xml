<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Traditionally, logic is concerned with argumentation. As a consequence, formal investigations of the semantics of natural language are usually focussed on the descriptive use of language, and the meaning of a sentence is identified with its informative content. Stalnaker <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[24]</ref> gave this informative notion a dynamic and conversational twist by taking the meaning of a sentence to be its potential to update the common ground, where the common ground is Financial support from the Netherlands Orginization for Scientific Research (NWO) is gratefully acknowledged. viewed as the conversational participants' shared information. Technically, the common ground is taken to be a set of possible worlds, and a sentence provides information by eliminating some of these possible worlds.</p><p>Of course, this picture is limited in several ways. First, it only applies to sentences that are used exclusively to provide information. Even in a typical informative dialogue, utterances may serve different purposes as well. Second, the given picture does not take into account that updating the common ground is a cooperative process. One speech participant cannot simply change the common ground all by herself. All she can do is propose a certain change. Other speech participants may react to such a proposal in several ways. These reactions play a crucial role in the dynamics of conversation.</p><p>In order to overcome these limitations, inquisitive semantics starts with a different picture. It views propositions as proposals to update the common ground. Crucially, these proposals do not necessarilly specify just one way of updating the common ground. They may suggest alternative ways of doing so. Formally, a proposition consists of one or more possibilities. Each possibility is a set of possible worlds and embodies a possible way to update the common ground. If a proposition consists of two or more possibilities, it is inquisitive: it invites the other participants to provide information such that at least one of the proposed updates may be established. Inquisitive propositions raise an issue. They give direction to a dialogue. Thus, inquisitive semantics directly reflects that a primary use of language lies in the exchange of information in a cooperative dynamic process of raising and resolving issues.</p><p>Groenendijk <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[10]</ref> and Mascarenhas <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[19]</ref> first defined an inquisitive semantics for the language of propositional logic, focussing on the philosophical and linguistic motivation for the framework, and delineating some of its basic logical properties. The associated logic was axiomatized by Mascarenhas <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[19]</ref>, while a sound and complete sequent calculus was established independently by Sano <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[23]</ref>. Several linguistic applications of the framework are discussed by Balogh <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we consider a generalized version of the semantics proposed by Groenendijk <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[10]</ref> and Mascarenhas <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[19]</ref>. This generalized semantics was first considered in lecture notes by Groenendijk <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[8]</ref>. Initially, it was thought to give the same results as the original semantics. Upon closer examination, however, Mascarenhas, Groenendijk, and Ciardelli observed that the two systems are different, and Ciardelli <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> first argued that these differences speak in favor of the generalized semantics. Groenendijk and Roelofsen <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[11]</ref> adopted the generalized semantics, and developed a formal pragmatic theory based on it.</p><p>The aim of the present paper is threefold. First, we will investigate and present some of the key features of the generalized semantics in a systematic way. Second, we will analyse the logic that the semantics gives rise to. In particular, we will explore the connection with intuitionistic logic and several wellknown intermediate logics, which, among other things, will lead to a sound and complete axiomatization of inquisitive logic. Finally, we will argue that the generalized semantics is better-behaved than the original version of inquisitive semantics. In fact, we will define an entire hierarchy of parameterized versions of inquisitive semantics, and argue that only the generalized version, which can be seen as the limit case of the hierarchy, really behaves satisfactorily.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the generalized version of inquisitive semantics and presents some key features of the system. Section 3 investigates the associated logic, leading up to a sound and complete axiomatization. Section 4 shows that the schematic fragment of inquisitive logic (the logic itself is not closed under uniform substitution) coincides with the well-known Medvedev logic of finite problems. This is particularly interesting as it yields a sort of finitary pseudo-axiomatization of Medvedev logic (which is known not to be finitely axiomatizable). Section 6 presents a translation of inquisitive logic into intuitionistic logic, showing that the former can be identified with the disjunctive-negative fragment of the latter. Section 7 defines and axiomatizes an infinite hierarchy of inquisitive logics, one of which is associated with the original semantics, and Section 8 argues that the generalized semantics has certain advantages over all the other elements of the hierarchy. Finally, Section 9 suggests a new intuitive interpretation of the notion of support-a notion that will play a key role in the definition of inquisitive semantics. This intuitive interpretation is intended to illuminate some of the technical results obtained in earlier sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Generalized Inquisitive Semantics</head><p>We assume a language L P , whose expressions are built up from ⊥ and a (finite or countably infinite) set of proposition letters P, using binary connectives ∧, ∨ and →. We will also make use of three abbreviations: ¬ϕ for ϕ → ⊥, !ϕ for ¬¬ϕ , and ?ϕ for ϕ ∨ ¬ϕ. The first is standard, the second and the third will become clear shortly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Indices, States, and Support</head><p>The basic ingredients for the semantics are indices and states. Definition 2.1 (Indices) A P-index is a subset of P. The set of all indices, ℘ (P), will be denoted by I P . We will simply write I and talk of indices in case P is clear from the context. Definition 2.2 (States) A P-state is a set of P-indices. The set of all states, ℘℘ (P), will be denoted by S P . Again, reference to P will be dropped whenever possible.</p><p>The meaning of a sentence will be defined in terms of the notion of support (just as, in a classical setting, the meaning of a sentence is usually defined in terms of truth). Support is a relation between states and formulas. We write s |= ϕ for 's supports ϕ'.  The following construction will often be useful when dealing with cases where the set of propositional letters is infinite. Definition 2.7 Let P ⊆ P be two sets of propositional letters. Then for any P -state s, the restriction of s to P is defined as s P := {w ∩ P | w ∈ s}.</p><p>The following fact, which can be established by a straightforward induction on the complexity of ϕ, says that whether or not a state s supports a formula ϕ only depends on the 'component' of s that is concerned with the letters in ϕ. In terms of support, we define the possibilities for a sentence ϕ and the meaning of sentences in inquisitive semantics. We will follow the common practice of referring to the meaning of a sentence ϕ as the proposition expressed by ϕ. We also define the truth-set of ϕ, which embodies the classical meaning of ϕ. Definition 2.9 (Truth sets, possibilities, propositions) Let ϕ be a formula. Notice that |ϕ| is a state, while [ϕ] is a set of states. The classical meaning of ϕ is the set of all indices that make ϕ true. In inquisitive semantics, meaning is defined in terms of support rather than directly in terms of truth. It may be expected, then, that the proposition expressed by ϕ would be defined as the set of all states supporting ϕ. Rather, though, it is defined as the set of all maximal states supporting ϕ, that is, the set of all possibilities for ϕ. This is motivated by the fact that propositions are viewed as proposals, consisting of one or more alternative possibilities. If one state is included in another, we do not regard these two states as alternatives. This is why we are particularly interested in maximal states supporting a formula. Technically, however, the proposition expressed by ϕ still fully determines which states support ϕ and which states do not: the next result establishes that a state supports ϕ iff it is included in a possibility for ϕ. Proposition 2.10 (Support and possibilities) For any state s and any formula ϕ: s |= ϕ ⇐⇒ s is contained in a possibility for ϕ Proof If s ⊆ t and t is a possibility for ϕ, then by persistence s |= ϕ. For the converse, first consider the case in which the set P of propositional letters is finite. Then there are only finitely many states, and therefore if s supports ϕ, then obviously s must be contained in a maximal state supporting ϕ, i.e. in a possibility.</p><p>If P is infinite, given a P-state s |= ϕ, consider its restriction s P ϕ to the (finite!) set P ϕ of propositional letters occurring in ϕ. By Proposition 2.8, s P ϕ |= ϕ, and thus s P ϕ ⊆ t for some P ϕ -state t which is a possibility for ϕ. Now, consider t + := {w ∈ I P | w ∩ P ϕ ∈ t}. For any w ∈ s we have w ∩ P ϕ ∈ (s P ϕ ) ⊆ t, so w ∈ t + by definition of t + ; this proves that s ⊆ t + . Moreover, we claim that t + is a possibility for ϕ.</p><p>First, since t + P ϕ = t and t |= ϕ, it follows from Proposition 2.8 that t + |= ϕ. Now, consider a state u ⊇ t + with u |= ϕ: then u P ϕ ⊇ t + P ϕ = t and moreover, again by Proposition 2.8, u P ϕ |= ϕ; but then, by the maximality of t it must be that u P ϕ = t. Now, for any w ∈ u, w ∩ P ϕ ∈ u P ϕ = t, so w ∈ t + by definition of t + : hence, u = t + . This proves that t + is indeed a possibility for ϕ.</p><p>Example 2.11 (Disjunction) Inquisitive semantics crucially differs from classical semantics in its treatment of disjunction. This is illustrated by Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref> and<ref type="figure">b</ref>. These figures assume that P = {p, q}; index 11 makes both p and q true, index 10 makes p true and q false, etcetera. Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref> depicts the truth set-that is, the classical meaning-of p ∨ q: the set of all indices that make either p or q, or both, true. Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref> depicts the proposition associated with p ∨ q in inquisitive semantics. It consists of two possibilities. One possibility is made up of all indices that make p true, and the other of all indices that make q true. So in the inquisitive setting, p ∨ q proposes two alternative ways of enhancing the common ground, and invites a response that is directed at choosing between these two alternatives.</p><p>As an immediate consequence of Proposition 2.6, the possibilities for a (doubly) negated formula can be characterized as follows.</p><p>Proposition 2.12 (Negation)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1. [¬ϕ] = {|¬ϕ|} 2. [!ϕ] = {|ϕ|}</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Inquisitiveness and Informativeness</head><p>Recall that propositions are viewed as proposals to change the common ground of a conversation. If [ϕ] contains more than one possibility, then we say that ϕ is Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> The truth-set of p ∨ q, and the proposition it expresses inquisitive. If the proposal expressed by ϕ is not rejected, then the indices that are not included in any of the possibilities for ϕ will be eliminated. If there are such indices-that is, if the possibilities for ϕ do not cover the entire spacethen we say that ϕ is informative. ϕ is a question iff it is not informative; -ϕ is an assertion iff it is not inquisitive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 2.15 (Contradictions and tautologies)</head><p>ϕ is a contradiction iff it is only supported by the inconsistent state, i.e. iff</p><p>[ϕ] = {∅} -ϕ is a tautology iff it is supported by all states, i.e. iff [ϕ] = {I} It is easy to see that a formula is a contradiction iff it is a classical contradiction. This does not hold for tautologies. Classically, a formula is tautological iff it is not informative. In the present framework, a formula is tautological iff it is neither informative nor inquisitive. Classical tautologies may well be inquisitive.</p><p>Example 2.16 (Questions) Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> depicts the propositions expressed by the polar question ? p, the conditional question p → ?q, and the conjoined question ? p ∧ ?q. Recall that ? p abbreviates p ∨ ¬p. So ? p is an example of a classical tautology that is inquisitive: it invites a choice between two alternatives, p and ¬ p. As such, it reflects the essential function of polar questions in natural language. For instance, Is it raining? invites a choice between two alternative possibilities, the possibility that it is raining and the possibility that it is not raining. Example 2.17 (Disjunction, continued) It is clear from Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref> that p ∨ q is both inquisitive and informative: [ p ∨ q] consists of two possibilities, which, together, do not cover the set of all indices. This means that p ∨ q is neither a question nor an assertion.</p><p>The following propositions give some sufficient syntactic conditions for a formula to be a question or an assertion, respectively. The straightforward proofs have been omitted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposition 2.18</head><p>For any two formulas ϕ, ψ:</p><p>1. ?ϕ and ?ψ are questions; 2. if ϕ and ψ are questions, then ϕ ∧ ψ is a question; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">19</ref> For any propositional letter p and formulas ϕ, ψ:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">3. if ϕ or ψ is a question, then ϕ ∨ ψ is a question; 4. if ψ is a question, then ϕ → ψ is a question. Proposition 2.</formula><p>1. p is an assertion; 2. ⊥ is an assertion; 3. if ϕ and ψ are assertions, then ϕ ∧ ψ is an assertion; 4. if ψ is an assertion, then ϕ → ψ is an assertion.</p><p>Note that items 2 and 4 of Proposition 2.19 imply that any negation is an assertion, which we already knew from Remark 2.12. Of course, !ϕ is also always an assertion.</p><p>Using Proposition 2.19 inductively we obtain the following corollary showing that disjunction is the only source of inquisitiveness in our propositional language.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> Corollary 2.20 Any disjunction-free formula is an assertion.</p><p>In inquisitive semantics, the informative content of a formula ϕ is captured by the union [ϕ] of all the possibilities for ϕ. For ϕ proposes to eliminate all indices that are not in <ref type="bibr">[ϕ]</ref>. In a classical setting, the informative content of ϕ is captured by |ϕ|. Hence, the following result can be read as stating that inquisitive semantics agrees with classical semantics as far as informative content is concerned. Conversely, any w ∈ [ϕ] belongs to a possibility for ϕ, so by persistence and the classical behaviour of singletons we must have that w ∈ |ϕ|.</p><p>We end this subsection with a definition of equivalence between two formulas, several characterizations of questions and assertions, and a remark about the behaviour of the operators ? and !. Note that an interrogative ?ϕ = ϕ ∨ ¬ϕ is always a classical tautology, and therefore, by the equivalence (1 ⇔ 2), always a question. Furthermore, the equivalence (1 ⇔ 4) guarantees that ?ϕ ≡ ??ϕ, which means that ? is idempotent. Proposition 2.24 (Characterization of assertions) For any formula ϕ, the following are equivalent:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">1. ϕ is an assertion 2. if s j |= ϕ for all j ∈ J, then j∈J s j |= ϕ 3. |ϕ| |= ϕ 4. ϕ ≡ !ϕ 5. [ϕ] = {|ϕ|} Proof (1 ⇒ 2)</formula><p>Suppose ϕ is an assertion and let t be the unique possibility for ϕ. If s j |= ϕ for all j ∈ J, then by Proposition 2.10 each s j must be a subset of t, whence also j∈J s j ⊆ t. Thus, by persistence, j∈J s j |= ϕ.</p><p>(2 ⇒ 3) By Proposition 2. Note that (1 ⇔ 5) states that a formula is an assertion if and only if its meaning consists of its classical meaning. In this sense, assertions behave classically. Also note that (1 ⇔ 4), together with the fact that !ϕ is always an assertion, implies that !ϕ ≡ !!ϕ. That is, ! is idempotent.</p><p>The operators ! and ? work in a sense like projections on the 'planes' of assertions and questions, respectively. Moreover, the following proposition shows that the inquisitive meaning of a formula ϕ is completely determined by its 'purely informative component' !ϕ and its 'purely inquisitive component' ?ϕ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposition 2.25 (Division in theme and rheme)</head><p>For any formula ϕ, ϕ ≡ !ϕ ∧ ?ϕ.</p><p>Proof We must show that for any state s, s |= ϕ iff s |= !ϕ ∧ ?ϕ. Suppose s |= !ϕ ∧ ?ϕ. Then, since s |= ?ϕ, s must support one of ϕ and ¬ϕ; but since s |= ¬¬ϕ, s cannot support ¬ϕ. Thus, we have that s |= ϕ. The converse is immediate by the definitions of ! and ? and Proposition 2.6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Support, Inquisitiveness, and Informativeness</head><p>The basic notion in the semantics, as we have set it up here, is the notion of support. In terms of support, we defined possibilities and propositions, and in terms of possibilities we defined the notions of inquisitiveness and informativeness. We have tried to make clear how possibilities, propositions, inquisitiveness, and informativeness should be thought of intuitively, but we have not said much as to how the notion of support itself should be interpreted.</p><p>It is important to emphasize that support should not be thought of as specifying conditions under which an agent with information state s can truthfully utter a sentence ϕ (this is a common interpretation of the notion of support in dynamic semantics, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[12]</ref>). Rather, in the present setting support should be thought of as specifying conditions under which a sentence ϕ is insignif icant or redundant in a state s, in the sense that, given the information available in s, ϕ is neither informative nor inquisitive. This intuition can be made precise by defining notions of inquisitiveness and informativeness relative to a state. Definition 2.26 (Relative semantic notions) Let ϕ be a formula, and s a state. Then:</p><p>-a possibility for ϕ in s is a maximal substate of s supporting ϕ; -ϕ is inquisitive in s iff there are at least two possibilities for ϕ in s; -ϕ is informative in s iff there is at least one index in s that is not included in any possibility for ϕ in s.</p><p>These notions allow us to formally establish the connection between support on the one hand, and inquisitiveness and informativeness on the other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposition 2.27 (Support, inquisitiveness, and informativeness) A state s supports a formula ϕ if f ϕ is neither inquisitive in s nor informative in s.</head><p>Proof Suppose that s |= ϕ. Then there is only one possibility for ϕ in s, namely s itself. So ϕ is not informative and not inquisitive in s. Conversely, if ϕ is not inquisitive in s, then there is only one possibility t for ϕ in s. If, moreover, ϕ is not informative in s, then t must be identical to s. By definition, t |= ϕ. So s |= ϕ as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Inquisitive Logic</head><p>We are now ready to start investigating the logic that inquisitive semantics gives rise to. We begin by specifying the pertinent notions of entailment and validity. Definition 3.1 (Entailment and validity) A set of formulas entails a formula ϕ in inquisitive semantics, |= InqL ϕ, if and only if any state that supports all formulas in also supports ϕ. A formula ϕ is valid in inquisitive semantics, |= InqL ϕ, if and only if ϕ is supported by all states.</p><p>If no confusion arises, we will simply write |= instead of |= InqL . We will also write</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ψ 1 , . . . , ψ n |= ϕ instead of {ψ 1 , . . . , ψ n } |= ϕ. Note that, as expected, ϕ ≡ ψ iff ϕ |= ψ and ψ |= ϕ.</formula><p>The intuitive interpretation of support in terms of insignificance or redundancy carries over to entailment: one can think of ϕ |= ψ as saying that, whenever we are in a state where ϕ is redundant-i.e., neither informative nor inquisitive-ψ is as well. Or, in more dynamic terms, whenever we are in a state where the information provided by ϕ has been accommodated and the issue raised by ϕ has been resolved, ψ does not provide any new information and does not raise any new issue.</p><p>The following proposition states that if ψ is an assertion, inquisitive entailment boils down to classical entailment.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Proposition 3.2 If ψ is an assertion, ϕ |= ψ if f |ϕ| ⊆ |ψ|.</formula><p>Proof Follows from Proposition 2.24 and the definition of entailment.</p><p>We have already seen that the ! operator turns any formula into an assertion. We are now ready to give a more precise characterization: for any formula ϕ, !ϕ is the most informative assertion entailed by ϕ. Most naturally, since a question does not provide any information, it cannot entail informative formulas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposition 3.4 If ϕ is a question and ϕ |= ψ, then ψ must be a question as well.</head><p>Proof If ϕ is a question, it must be supported by every singleton state. If moreover ϕ |= ψ, then ψ must also be supported by every singleton state. But then, since singletons behave like indices, ψ must be a classical tautology, that is, a question. Definition 3.5 (Logic) Inquisitive logic, InqL, is the set of formulas that are valid in inquisitive semantics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposition 3.6 A formula ϕ is in InqL if and only if I |= ϕ.</head><p>Proof The left-to-right direction is trivial. The right-to-left direction follows immediately from the fact that support is persistent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposition 3.7 A formula is in InqL if and only if it is both a classical tautology and an assertion.</head><p>Proof If ϕ ∈ InqL, it is supported by all states. In particular, it is supported by I, which means that it is an assertion, and it is supported by all singleton states, which means, by Proposition 2.5, that it is a classical tautology. Conversely, if ϕ is an assertion, there is only one possibility for ϕ. If, moreover, ϕ is a classical tautology, this possibility must be I. But then, by persistence, ϕ must be supported by all states.</p><p>Thus, InqL coincides with classical logic as far as assertions are concerned: in particular, it agrees with classical logic on the whole disjunction-free fragment of the language. Remark 3.8 Although InqL is closed under the modus ponens rule, it is not closed under uniform substitution. For instance, ¬¬ p → p ∈ InqL for all proposition letters, but ¬¬( p ∨ q) → ( p ∨ q) ∈ InqL. We will return to this feature of the logic below, especially in Sections 4 and 9.</p></div>

By the definition of the formulas γ k , it is clear that for k ≤ k we have From this it follows that (L, R) is a connected graph and thus clearly a tree with root ∅. Since L is a disjoint union of infinitely many non-empty sets, it must be infinite. On the other hand, by definition of R, all the successors of a state s ∈ L k are P k+1 -states, and there are only finitely many of those as P k+1 is finite. Therefore, the tree (L, R) is finitely branching. By König's lemma, a tree that is infinite and finitely branching must have an infinite branch. This means that there must be a sequence t k | k ∈ ω of states in L such that for any k, t k+1 P k = t k . This naturally defines a P-state that is the "limit" of the sequence. Precisely, this state is: But this contradicts the fact that |= ϕ. So for some k we must have γ k |= ϕ. Remark 3.12 (Decidability) InqL is clearly decidable: to determine whether a formula ϕ is in InqL, by Propositions 2.8 and 3.6 we only have to test whether I { p 1 ,..., p n } supports ϕ, where p 1 , . . . , p n are the propositional letters in ϕ.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corollary 3.15 Any formula is equivalent to a disjunction of negations.</head><p>In particular, any formula is equivalent to a disjunction of assertions. This perfectly matches our intuitive understanding that meanings in inquisitive semantics are sets of alternatives, which are pairwise incomparable classical meanings ('incomparable' with respect to inclusion). Classical meanings are expressed by assertions (and thus always expressible by negations) while disjunction is the source of alternativehood, in the sense that a disjunction applied to two incomparable classical meanings yields the proposition consisting of those two classical meanings as alternatives.</p><p>Additionally, note that since any negation behaves classically in inquisitive semantics, in the scope of a negation we can always safely substitute classically equivalent subformulas. Since the set of connectives {¬, ∨} is complete in classical logic, given a formula ϕ ≡ ¬χ 1 ∨ • • • ∨ ¬χ n we can always substitute each χ k by a classically equivalent formula χ k using only disjunction and negation without altering the meaning of the formula, thus getting ϕ ≡ ¬χ 1 ∨ • • • ∨ ¬χ n .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Inquisitive Semantics and Intuitionistic Kripke Semantics</head><p>We now turn to the connection between inquisitive logic and intuitionistic logic. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> This connection is suggested by the existence of a striking analogy between inquisitive and intuitionistic semantics. Both can be conceived of in terms of information and information growth. In inquisitive semantics, a formula is evaluated with respect to a state. Such a state can be thought of as an information state. Whether a certain state s supports a formula ϕ may depend not only on the information available in s, but also on the information that may become available. Formally, support is partly defined in terms of subsets of s. These subsets can be seen as possible future information states.</p><p>Similarly, in intuitionistic semantics, a formula is evaluated with respect to a point in a Kripke model, which can also be thought of as an information state. Each point comes equipped with a set of future points, called successors. Whether a point u in a model M satisfies a formula ϕ may depend not only on the information available at u, but also on the information that may become available. Formally, satisfaction at u is partly defined in terms of points in M that are accessible from u.</p><p>This informal analogy can be made precise: in fact, inquisitive semantics amounts to intuitionistic semantics on a suitable Kripke model. Observe that M I is a Kripke model for intuitionistic logic. For, the relation ⊇ is clearly a partial order. Moreover, suppose s ⊇ t and s ∈ V I ( p): this means that s |= p, and so by persistence t |= p, which amounts to t ∈ V I ( p). So the valuation V I is persistent. The next lemma shows that the two semantics coincide on every non-empty state. Proposition 3.19 (Support coincides with Kripke satisfaction on M I ) For every formula ϕ and every non-empty state s:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">s |= ϕ ⇐⇒ M I , s ϕ</formula><p>Proof Straightforward, by induction on ϕ. The inductive step for implication uses the fact that an implication cannot be falsified by the empty state, as the latter supports all formulas, so that restricting the semantics to non-empty states does not make a difference. This simple observation already shows that the logic InqL contains intuitionistic propositional logic IPL. For suppose that ϕ / ∈ InqL. Then there must be a non-empty state s such that s |= ϕ. But then we also have that M I , s ϕ, which means that ϕ / ∈ IPL. On the other hand, InqL is contained in classical propositional logic CPL, because any formula that is not a classical tautology is falsified by a singleton state in inquisitive semantics. So we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">IPL ⊆ InqL ⊆ CPL</formula><p>Moreover, both inclusions are strict: for instance, p ∨ ¬p is in CPL but not in InqL, while ¬¬ p → p is in InqL but not in IPL.</p><p>Our next task is to investigate exactly where InqL sits between IPL and CPL. Ultimately, our result will be that there is a whole range of intermediate logics whose 'negative variant' coincides with InqL. In order to get to this result, let us first recall some basic features of intermediate logics, and define precisely what we mean by the negative variant of a logic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Intermediate Logics and Negative Variants</head><p>Recall that an intermediate logic is defined as a consistent set of formulae that contains IPL and is closed under the rules of modus ponens and uniform substitution, where consistent simply means 'not containing ⊥' [2, p. 109].</p><p>Intermediate logics ordered by inclusion form a complete lattice whose meet operation amounts to intersection and whose join operation, also called sum, is defined as follows: if i , i ∈ I is a family of intermediate logics, then i∈I i is the logic axiomatized by i∈I i , that is, the closure of i∈I i under modus ponens and uniform substitution. The sum of two intermediate logic and is denoted by + .</p><p>In our investigation, we will meet several logics, beginning with InqL itself, that are not closed under uniform substitution. We shall refer to such logics as weak intermediate logics. Weak intermediate logics ordered by inclusion form a complete lattice as well, where again meet is intersection and the join (or sum) of a family is the weak logic axiomatized by the union, i.e. the closure of the union under modus ponens.</p><p>If L is a weak intermediate logic, we write ϕ ≡ L ψ just in case ϕ ↔ ψ ∈ L.</p><p>Definition 3.21 Let K be a class of Kripke models (resp., frames). If is a set of formulae and ϕ is a formula, we write |= K ϕ just in case any point in any model in K (resp., any point in any model based on any frame in K), that satisfies all formulas in , also satisfies ϕ. We denote by Log(K) the set of formulae that are valid on each model (frame) in K, that is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Log(K) = {ϕ | |= K ϕ}. It is straightforward to check that if K is a class of Kripke frames, Log(K) is an intermediate logic, while if K is a class of Kripke models, Log(K) is a weak intermediate logic.</formula><p>Notation For any formula ϕ, we denote by ϕ n the formula obtained from ϕ by replacing any occurrence of a propositional letter with its negation.

This shows ⊆ n .</p><p>Moreover, if ϕ and ϕ → ψ belong to n , then both ϕ n and (ϕ → ψ) n = ϕ n → ψ n are in which is closed under modus ponens; therefore, ψ n ∈ , which means that ψ ∈ n . This shows that n is closed under modus ponens.</p><p>Finally, if ϕ ∈ n then ϕ n ∈ ⊆ CPL. Then, since CPL is substitutionclosed, ϕ nn ∈ CPL and therefore also ϕ ∈ CPL, as the double negation law holds in CPL. This shows that n ⊆ CPL and therefore that n is indeed a weak intermediate logic.</p><p>The following observation will turn out useful below. Remark 3.24 If a logic has the disjunction property, then so does n .</p><p>Proof If ϕ ∨ ψ ∈ n , then ϕ n ∨ ψ n ∈ ; thus, by the disjunction property, at least one of ϕ n and ψ n is in , which means that at least one of ϕ and ψ is in n .

A valuation V is called negative in case for any point w in F and for any proposition letter p:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">(F, V), w p ⇐⇒ (F, V), w ¬¬ p</formula><p>We will call a model negative in case its valuation is negative.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Disjunction Property + Disjunctive Negative Translation = InqL</head><p>We are now ready to connect some of the notions introduced in previous subsections. The following theorem characterizes InqL as the unique weak intermediate logic that has the disjunction property and preserves logical equivalence under disjunctive negation translation (as defined in Section 3.2). Proof Let L be a weak intermediate logic for which any formula ϕ is equivalent to dnt(ϕ). Suppose ϕ ∈ InqL. Then dnt(ϕ) ∈ InqL. Write dnt(ϕ) = ¬ν 1 ∨ • • • ∨ ¬ν k : since InqL has the disjunction property, we must have ¬ν i ∈ InqL for some 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Now, we know that IPL coincides with CPL as far as negations are concerned [2, p. 47] and it follows from this that every two weak intermediate logics coincide as far as negations are concerned. So if ¬ν i ∈ InqL, then also ¬ν i ∈ L. Hence, dnt(ϕ) ∈ L, and since ϕ ≡ L dnt(ϕ), also ϕ ∈ L. This shows that InqL ⊆ L.</p><p>Now suppose that L also has the disjunction property. Consider a formula ϕ ∈ L: since ϕ ≡ L dnt(ϕ) we have dnt(ϕ) ∈ L. But L has the disjunction property and therefore, using the same notation as above, ¬ν i ∈ L for some i. Then again because all weak intermediate logics agree on negations, ¬ν i ∈ InqL, whence dnt(ϕ) ∈ InqL and also ϕ ∈ InqL. This proves that L ⊆ InqL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Axiomatizing Inquisitive Logic</head><p>Given that InqL is the only weak intermediate logic with the disjunction property that preserves logical equivalence under dnt, it is natural to ask next what exactly is required, in terms of axioms, in order to preserve logical equivalence under dnt. Answering this question will directly lead to an axiomatization of InqL.</p><p>In order to identify the relevant axioms, let us go back to the proof of Proposition 3.14, which stated that ϕ ≡ InqL dnt(ϕ) for any ϕ. The proof is by induction on ϕ. The atomic case amounts to the validity of the atomic double negation axioms. The inductive step for disjunction is trivial, while the one for conjunction follows from the fact that IPL ⊆ InqL, which means that intuitionistic equivalences (like instances of the distributive laws) hold in the inquisitive setting.</p><p>Finally, for the inductive step for implication we need-in addition to some intuitionistically valid equivalences-the following equivalence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">¬χ → 1≤ i ≤k ¬ψ i ≡ InqL 1≤ i ≤k (¬χ → ¬ψ i )</formula><p>for all formulas χ, ψ 1 , . . . , ψ k .

Any system containing those axioms and equipped with the modus ponens rule will be able to prove the equivalence between a formula ϕ and its translation dnt(ϕ). This suffices to prove Proposition 3.33, where ND is the intermediate logic axiomatized by the axioms ND k , k ∈ ω.</p><p>Proposition 3.33 For any logic ⊇ ND and any formula ϕ, ϕ ≡ n dnt(ϕ).</p><p>This proposition immediately yields a whole range of intermediate logics whose negative variant coincides with inquisitive logic.

Hence by Theorem 3.32 we have n = InqL.</p><p>The logic ND has been studied by Maksimova <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[16]</ref>. Among other things, she shows (1) that ND has the disjunction property, and (2) that the maximal intermediate logic with the disjunction property containing ND is ML, an intermediate logic introduced by Medvedev <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[20]</ref>, also known as 'the logic of finite problems'.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 4.1 (Schematic fragment of InqL)</head><p>We denote by Sch(InqL) the set of formulae that are schematically valid in InqL, i.e., those formulae ϕ such that ϕ * ∈ InqL for any substitution instance ϕ * of ϕ.</p><p>Notice that Sch(InqL) is the greatest intermediate logic included in InqL. Definition 4.2 (Medvedev frames) A Medvedev frame consists of all the nonempty subsets of some finite set X, ordered by the superset relation.

The class of Medvedev frames will be denoted by Med.</p><p>Notice that the frame F I underlying the Kripke model for inquisitive semantics is (℘℘ (P) -{∅}, ⊇). So F I is a Medvedev frame whenever the set of proposition letters P is finite. The following theorem establishes the main result of this section, namely that the schematic fragment of InqL coincides with Medvedev logic. There is, however, one subtlety that should be remarked: whereas we assumed so far that the set of atomic proposition letters P may be finite or countably infinite, it is at this stage important to assume that P is in fact countably infinite.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem 4.4 Sch(InqL) = ML.</head><p>In order to prove this theorem, we need the following lemma. This lemma employs the notion of a p-morphism, which we assume to be familiar (see, for instance, <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, p. 30).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 4.5 For any negative Medvedev model M, there exists a p-morphism η from M to the Kripke model for inquisitive logic M I .</head><p>Proof Let M = (W, R, V) be a negative Medvedev model. For any endpoint e of M, denote by i e the valuation i e = {p ∈ P | e ∈ V( p)} consisting of those letters true at e. For any point w in M, let E w denote the set of endpoints accessible from w in M. Define the candidate p-morphism η as follows:</p><p>For any w ∈ W, η(w) = {i e | e ∈ E w }. First, note that any point in M can see at least one endpoint. This means that for any w ∈ W, we have E w = ∅, and therefore η(w) = ∅. This insures that η(w) ∈ W I , so that the map η : W → W I is well-defined. It remains to check that η is a p-morphism. Fix any w ∈ W:</p><p>-Proposition Letters. Recall that M is based on a frame that consists of all the non-empty subsets of some finite set X, ordered by the superset relation. In particular, all the endpoints in M are singleton subsets of X, and for any set of endpoints E, there is a point, namely E, whose terminal successors are exactly the ones in E.</p><p>Thus, for v we can take E * . Then, E v = E * , and η(v) = t.</p><p>Proof of Theorem 4.4 Suppose ϕ ∈ Sch(InqL): then there is a substitution instance ϕ * of ϕ such that ϕ * ∈ InqL. But then it follows from Proposition 2.8 that ϕ * can be falsified in a point of the model M I for inquisitive semantics relative to the finite set of propositional letters P ϕ * ; and since this model is a Medvedev model, ϕ * ∈ ML. But then, as ML is closed under uniform substitution, also ϕ ∈ ML. This shows that ML ⊆ Sch(InqL).</p><p>For the converse inclusion, suppose ϕ( p 1 , . . . , p n ) ∈ ML. This means that there is a model M = (F, V), where F is a Medvedev frame, and a point w in this model, such that M, w ϕ. Now, the idea is to use Lemma 4.5 to transfer this counterexample to the Kripke model M I for inquisitive semantics. In order to do so, however, we need our starting model to be a negative Medvedev model. Our model is indeed a Medvedev model, but there is no reason why the valuation V should be negative. Therefore, what we want to do is replace V by a negative valuation V, and then simulate the behaviour of the propositional letters p 1 , . . . , p n with complex formulae ψ 1 , . . . , ψ n .</p><p>In order to do this, associate any point u in M with a propositional letter q u and define a new valuation V as follows: for any point v and any proposition letter q u , take v ∈ V(q u ) if and only if v ⊆ u. For proposition letters q which are not of the shape q u for some u, take V(q) = ∅. Then define M = (F, V).</p><p>Notice that the valuation V is indeed negative. For, take any letter q u and suppose that a certain point v is not in V(q u ): then v ⊆ u, so we can take an element x ∈ vu. Since {x} ⊆ u, {x} ∈ V(q u ), and therefore, since singletons are endpoints and thus behave classically, we have M, {x} ¬q u . Finally, since {x} ⊆ v, {x} is a successor of v, and therefore M, v ¬¬q u . So indeed M is a negative Medvedev model, and Lemma 4.5 applies, yielding a p-morphism η : M → M I .</p><p>We now turn to the second task, namely, find a complex formula ψ i that simulates in M the behaviour of the atom p i in M. For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, define ψ i := v∈V( p i ) q v . We are going to show that for any point u:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">M, u p i ⇐⇒ M, u ψ i If M, u p i , i.e. if u ∈ V( p i ), then since M, u q u we immediately have that M, u v∈V( p i ) q v . That is, M, u ψ i . Conversely, if M, u ψ i , then there is a point v ∈ V( p i ) such that u ∈ V(q v ),</formula><p>which in turn, by definition of V, means that u ⊆ v. But then, by persistence, u ∈ V( p i ), that is, M, u p i . This proves the above equivalence. Now, it follows immediately that for any point u:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">M, u ϕ( p 1 , . . . , p n ) ⇐⇒ M, u ϕ(ψ 1 , . . . , ψ n )</formula><p>In particular, M, w ϕ(ψ 1 , . . . , ψ n ). Thus, using the p-morphism η : M → M I provided by Lemma 4.5 we finally get that M I , η(w) ϕ(ψ 1 , . . . , ψ n ). Therefore, ϕ(ψ 1 , . . . , ψ n ) ∈ InqL and thus ϕ( p 1 , . . . , p n ) ∈ Sch(InqL).</p><p>Observe that the given proof in fact establishes something stronger than the equality Sch(InqL) = ML. It shows that in order to falsify a formula ϕ ∈ Sch(InqL) we do not have to look at arbitrary substitution instances of ϕ; it suffices to take into consideration substitutions of atomic proposition letters with arbitrarily large disjunctions of atoms.

In Medvedev <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[21]</ref>, the logic was characterized in terms of Kripke models as the logic of the class Med. The quest for an axiomatization of ML did not produce significant results until Maksimova et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[17]</ref> proved that ML is not finitely axiomatizable and indeed not axiomatizable with a finite number of propositional letters. The question of whether ML admits a recursive axiomatization (equivalently, of whether ML is decidable) is a long-standing open problem.</p><p>This makes the results we just established particularly interesting. For, in the first place we have seen that ML = Sch(InqL) = Sch(KP n ) = Sch(ND n ), which means that the systems KP n and ND n give pseudo-axiomatizations of ML: they derive 'slightly' more formulas than those in ML, but if we restrict our attention to the schematic validities, then we have precisely Medvedev's logic.</p><p>In the second place, Corollary 4.6 provides a connection between Medvedev's logic and other intermediate logics, among which the wellunderstood Kreisel-Putnam logic, that might pave the way for new attempts to solve the decidability problem for ML.</p><p>For instance-since both InqL and KP are decidable-if it were possible to find a finite bound b for the maximum number k of disjuncts that we need to use in order to falsify a non-schematically valid formula ϕ (possibly depending on the number of propositional letters in ϕ) then ML would be decidable. For, to determine whether ϕ ∈ ML it would then suffice to check whether the formula ϕ( 1≤ i ≤k ¬ p i 1 , . . . , 1≤ i ≤k ¬ p i n ) is in KP for all k ≤ b , and this procedure can be performed in a finite amount of time.</p><p>It is possible to show (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[4]</ref>) that for formulas containing a single proposition letter p, such a bound exists and equals 2. As a consequence, the one-letter fragment of ML is decidable. This result is not quite new, since Medvedev <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[21]</ref> showed that the one-letter fragment of ML coincides with the well-known Scott logic, and this logic is known to be decidable-this follows, for instance, from Theorem 11.58 in [2, p. 410]-but the argument presented here is new and could perhaps be generalized.</p></div>

For the completeness direction, suppose that |= InqL ϕ.

Then by Theorem 5.1, θ 1 ∧ • • • ∧ θ k → ϕ ∈ n , whence clearly n ϕ.</formula><p>6 InqL as the Disjunctive-Negative Fragment of IPL As we already observed, the meanings of inquisitive semantics are sets of alternatives, where each alternative is a classical meaning. This essential feature of the semantics is mirrored on the syntactic, logical level by the fact that any formula ϕ is equivalent to a disjunction of negations dnt(ϕ).</p><p>The completeness result in Section 3 was based on the insight that preservation of logical equivalence under dnt is an essential feature of the logic InqL. But there is even more to say about dnt: in this section we will show that it constitutes a translation of InqL into IPL, in the following sense (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[5]</ref>, Chapter 10): Definition 6.1 (Translations between logics) Let L, L be two logics arising from two entailment relations |= L and |= L . We say that a mapping t from formulas in the language of L to formulas in the language of L is a translation from L to L in case for any set of formulas and any formula ϕ we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">|= L ϕ ⇐⇒ t[ ] |= L t(ϕ) where t[ ] = {t(θ ) | θ ∈ }.</formula><p>Moreover, we will show that the disjunctive-negative fragment of InqL coincides with the one of IPL, and that InqL is in fact isomorphic to the disjunctive-negative fragment of IPL through the translation dnt (just as CPL is isomorphic to the negative fragment of IPL through the translation mapping ϕ to ¬¬ϕ).</p><p>Let us call a formula disjunctive-negative in case it is a disjunction of negations. The following proposition says that inquisitive entailment and intuitionistic entailment agree as far as disjunctive-negative formulas are concerned. Proposition 6.2 If ϕ is a disjunctive-negative formula and a set of disjunctivenegative formulas, then:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">|= InqL ϕ ⇐⇒ |= IPL ϕ.</formula><p>Proof Consider an arbitrary set of disjunctive-negative formulas and a disjunctive-negative formula ϕ = ¬ξ 1 ∨ • • • ∨ ¬ξ k .

In turn, a conjunction of negations is equivalent to a negation in intuitionistic logic. So we can find formulas χ 1 , . . . , χ m such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">θ 1 ∧ • • • ∧ θ n ≡ IPL ¬χ 1 ∨ • • • ∨ ¬χ m .

Writing out ϕ, this amounts to ¬χ i → ¬ξ 1 ∨ • • • ∨ ¬ξ k ∈ InqL.</formula><p>But since InqL contains the ND k axioms, it follows that 1≤ j≤k (¬χ i → ¬ξ j ) ∈ InqL, and therefore, as InqL has the disjunction property, for some 1 ≤ j ≤ k we must have that ¬χ i → ¬ξ j ∈ InqL ⊆ CPL. Now, ¬χ i → ¬ξ j ≡ IPL ¬¬(¬χ i → ¬ξ j ), and since CPL and IPL agree about negations [2, p. 47], also ¬χ i → ¬ξ j ∈ IPL, whence a fortiori ¬χ i → ϕ ∈ IPL. Since this can be concluded for each i, we have 1≤i≤m (¬χ i → ϕ) ∈ IPL, and therefore also the equivalent formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">θ 1 ∧ • • • ∧ θ n → ϕ must be in IPL. But then obviously |= IPL ϕ.</formula><p>The converse implication is trivial, as InqL extends IPL.</p><p>As a particular case of this proposition, let us remark that for any disjunctive-negative formula ϕ we have ϕ ∈ InqL ⇐⇒ ϕ ∈ IPL. Observe that if the map t is a translation from a logic L to another logic L , then t naturally lifts to an embedding t : L/ ≡ L → L/ ≡ L of the Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra of L into the Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra of L , given by t([ψ] ≡ L ) := [t(ψ)] ≡ L . <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref>Since we have seen that dnt is a translation from InqL to IPL, the map dnt defined by dnt([ψ] ≡ InqL ) = [dnt(ψ)] ≡ IPL is an embedding of the Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra of InqL into the one of IPL. For the singleton set of propositional letters, this embedding is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3</ref>. Now, for any ψ, dnt(ψ) is a disjunctive-negative formula. Conversely, consider a disjunctive-negative formula ψ. Since ψ ≡ InqL dnt(ψ) but both ψ and dnt(ψ) are disjunctive-negative, it follows from Proposition 6.2 that This shows that the image of the embedding dnt is precisely the set of equivalence classes of disjunctive-negative formulas. In other words, just like CPL is isomorphic to the negative fragment of IPL, for InqL we have the following result. Proposition 6. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">4</ref> InqL is isomorphic to the disjunctive-negative fragment of IPL.</p><p>As a corollary of the well-known fact that CPL is isomorphic to the negative fragment of IPL we know that, for any n, there are exactly 2 n+1 intuitionistically non-equivalent negative formulas in L { p 1 ,..., p n } , just as many as there are classically non-equivalent formulas in L { p 1 ,..., p n } .</p><p>Analogously, our result that InqL is isomorphic to the disjunctive-negative fragment of IPL comes with the corollary that there are exactly as many intuitionistically non-equivalent disjunctive-negative formulas in L { p 1 ,..., p n } as there are inquisitively non-equivalent formulas in L { p 1 ,..., p n } .</p><p>The number of inquisitively non-equivalent formulas in L { p 1 ,..., p n } is given by the number of distinct inquisitive meanings built up from indices in I { p 1 ,..., p n } . Such inquisitive meanings are nothing but antichains of the powerset algebra ℘ (I { p 1 ,..., p n } ). This algebra is isomorphic to ℘ (2 n ), since I { p 1 ,..., p n } = ℘ ({ p 1 , . . . , p n }) contains 2 n elements. Therefore, letting D(n) denote the number of antichains of the powerset algebra ℘ (n), we have the following fact. Corollary 6.5 For any n, there are exactly D (2 n ) intuitionistically nonequivalent disjunctive-negative formulas in L { p 1 ,..., p n } .</p><p>The numbers D(n) are known as Dedekind numbers, and although no simple formula is known for their calculation, their values for small n have been computed and are available online, see for instance: www.research.att. com/∼njas/sequences/A014466.</p><p>The number of inquisitive meanings in one propositional letter is 5, as displayed by the above picture; with two letters we have 167 meanings, and with three the number leaps to 56130437228687557907787.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">The Inquisitive Hierarchy</head><p>Inquisitive semantics was first developed by Groenendijk <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[10]</ref> and Mascarenhas <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[19]</ref>. The original formulation of the semantics was different from the one considered here: formulas were evaluated w.r.t. ordered pairs of indices rather than w.r.t. arbitrary sets of indices. We will refer to this original system as the pair semantics, and to the system considered in the present paper as the generalized semantics. The pair semantics has its roots in the tradition of Groenendijk's logic of interrogation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">25]</ref>. In particular, one of the key ideas that it inherits from this tradition is that a formula disconnects two indices in the common ground in case it expresses an interest in the difference between them.</p><p>Going through the clauses of the pair semantics it is immediately clear that for any indices v, w and any formula ϕ, v, w |= ϕ amounts precisely to our {v, w} |= ϕ (that is, the order of the pair v, w is irrelevant). In this sense the pair semantics can be seen as a fragment of the generalized semantics, namely the fragment dealing only with states of size at most two. This restriction on the cardinality of states gives rise to a logic InqL 2 , much stronger than InqL, which has been studied and axiomatized by Mascarenhas <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[19]</ref>.</p><p>In general, we may consider the operation of restricting our semantics by allowing only states of cardinality at most n. As we shall see, doing so gives rise to a hierarchy of strictly shrinking logics whose limit is InqL. The only state of cardinality zero is ∅, which supports any formula, so InqL 0 is the inconsistent logic. Moreover, since singleton states behave like indices, InqL 1 is classical logic. And, clearly, InqL 2 is the logic arising from the pair semantics. The following fact is a trivial consequence of the definition of the hierarchy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remark 7.4 InqL = k∈ω InqL k</head><p>We will now define, for each k ∈ ω, a formula δ k that characterizes the class of intuitionistic Kripke frames of depth at most k. That is, for each k ∈ ω, δ k is valid on an intuitionistic Kripke frame F if and only if the depth of F is at most k.</p><p>We will then show, first, that for any k ∈ ω, δ k is in InqL k but not in InqL k+1 (which means that the inquisitive hierarchy is a sequence of strictly shrinking logics), and second, that for any k ∈ ω, adding all substitution instances of δ k to an axiomatization of InqL yields an axiomatization of InqL k . Proof First let us remark that for any finite non-empty state s, the depth of the subframe (F I ) s generated by the point s in the frame F I of the Kripke model for inquisitive logic is equal to |s|. This can be checked by an easy induction. Now, first consider any state s with |s| ≤ k: we have to check that s |= δ k . We may assume s = ∅, as our claim is trivial for the empty state. Now as the depth of the frame (F I ) s is |s| ≤ k, the formula δ k is valid on (F I ) s , whence in particular ((F I ) s , V I ), s δ k , where V I is the valuation of M I . But then, since Kripke satisfaction is invariant under taking generated submodels we have M I , s δ k , which by Proposition 3.19 amounts to s |= δ k . This shows that δ k is supported by any state of size at most k. Hence, δ k ∈ InqL k .</p><p>Second, we have to show that s |= δ k for some state s with |s| = k + 1. We shall proceed by induction on k. For k = 0, simply take s 0 = {w} where w is the index making all proposition letters true. Now, inductively, we can assume that we have a state s k such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">|s k | = k + 1, |s k | |= δ k ,</formula><p>and moreover all indices in s k make p j true for all j ≥ k + 1. Now simply let s k+1 := s k ∪ {w} where w is the index making a letter p j true iff j ≥ k + 2. It is immediate to check that s k+1 |= δ k+1 , and since |s k+1 | = k + 2 and all indices in s k+1 make p j true for all j ≥ k + 2, the inductive step is complete.</p><p>This proves that the inquisitive hierarchy is indeed a hierarchy of strictly shrinking logics: for any k ∈ ω, InqL k InqL k+1 . We now turn to the axiomatization of the logics in the hierarchy. This theorem states that InqL k is soundly and completely axiomatized by a derivation system having modus ponens as its only derivation rule, and the following axioms:</p><p>1.</p><p>, or axioms for in schematic form; 2.</p><p>k , or δ k as an axiom scheme; 3. ¬¬ p → p for all p ∈ P.</p><p>For instance, if we choose = ND, then the theorem says that we can take our derivation system to have, as axioms, all substitution instances of the ND k axioms, all substitution instances of δ k , and the atomic double negation axioms.</p><p>Proof For the soundness direction, since the set InqL k is closed under modus ponens and contains and the atomic double negation axioms, it suffices to check that any substitution instance δ k * of δ k is in InqL k . Consider a state s with 0 &lt; |s| ≤ k (the case |s| = 0 is trivial): then the generated subframe (F I ) s of s in the frame F I has depth at most k, so δ k is valid on (F I ) s , and since the logic of a frame is closed under uniform substitution, δ k * is valid on (F I ) s as well. In particular we have ((F I ) s , V I ), s δ k * , which by invariance of Kripkesatisfaction under generated submodels yields M I , s δ k * and thus s |= δ k * . For completeness, suppose ϕ ∈ ( + k ) n , that is, assume that k n ϕ. By the strong completeness of n (Theorem 5.5) there must be a state s such that s |= k but s |= ϕ. Now in order to conclude that ϕ ∈ InqL k it suffices to show that s |= k implies |s| ≤ k. This is the content of the following lemma.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 7.9 For any k</head><formula xml:id="formula_32">∈ ω, if |s| &gt; k then there is a substitution instance δ k * of the formula δ k such that s |= δ k * .</formula><p>Proof We will proceed by induction on k. The case for k = 0 is trivial: δ 0 = ⊥ is not supported by any non-empty state. Now, assume our claim holds for a number k and consider a state s with |s| &gt; k + 1. We may assume that s is finite: if not, just replace it by a finite substate s ⊆ s with |s | &gt; k + 1: then by persistence, once we find an instance of δ k which is not supported by s , this cannot be supported by s either.</p><p>Fix an index w ∈ s: exploiting the fact that w must differ from any other w ∈ s on some letter and that s contains only finitely many indices, we can easily find a formula γ such that w |= γ but w |= γ for any w = w in s. and we are done: we have shown that for any state s with |s| &gt; k + 1 there is a substitution instance of δ k+1 which is not supported by s.</p><p>Note that, proceeding in exactly the same way, we could in fact have shown that, for any such that ND ⊆ ⊆ ML, ( + k ) n provides a strongly complete axiomatization of InqL k , in the sense that it captures the notion of entailment |= InqL k that results from restricting inquisitive semantics to states of size at most k.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">A Plea for the Generalized Semantics</head><p>We have seen that in the pair semantics, formulas are evaluated with respect to ordered pairs of indices. The possibilities for a formula ϕ are then defined as maximal states such that any pair of indices in that state supports ϕ. This notion of possibilities subtly differs from the one that the generalized semantics gives rise to. Thus, the pair semantics and the generalized semantics yield a different notion of meaning. In this section, we compare these two notions of meaning and argue that the differences speak in favour of the generalized semantics.</p><p>In order to make such a judgment, we must first of all determine a suitable criterion for comparison. In order to do so, we return to one of the main sources of inspiration behind inquisitive semantics, the 'Gricean picture of disjunction' [6, p. 68]:</p><p>A standard (if not the standard) employment of 'or' is in the specification of possibilities (one of which is supposed by the speaker to be realized, although he does not know which one), each of which is relevant in the same way to a given topic. 'A or B' is characteristically employed to give a partial answer to some [wh]-question, to which each disjunct, if assertible, would give a fuller, more specific, more satisfactory answer. This picture has played an important role in the development of inquisitive semantics (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[9]</ref>), and indeed, a disjunction p ∨ q is assigned a meaning consisting of two alternative possibilities, | p| and |q|. Now, the Gricean picture of disjunction is of course not intended to apply only to disjunctions with two disjuncts. It applies just as well to disjunctions with three or more disjuncts. For instance, the idea is that a triple disjunction p ∨ q ∨ r is used to specify three possibilities, | p|, |q| and |r|. One criterion, then, for comparing different implementations of inquisitive semantics, is that the Gricean picture of disjunction should be captured for disjunctions of arbitrary length.</p><p>This is indeed what the generalized semantics does, unlike any other element of the inquisitive hierarchy. Let us consider the pair semantics in particular. This semantics assigns to p ∨ q ∨ r the three possibilities | p|, |q| and |r|, but also an additional possibility t = {111, 110, 101, 011} (since every pair of indices in t supports p ∨ q ∨ r).</p><p>More generally, a disjunction p 1 ∨ . . . ∨ p n+1 will be problematic for any element of the inquisitive hierarchy that looks only at states of size at most n. The Gricean picture is only captured in full generality if states of arbitrary size are taken into account. Now let us consider another criterion, which concerns the intuition that the possibilities for a sentence ϕ correspond to the alternative ways in which ϕ may be resolved. Again, upon close examination, it turns out that this intuition is captured by the generalized semantics, but not by any other element of the inquisitive hierarchy.</p><p>In Section 2.4 we saw that a state s supports a formula ϕ precisely in case the issue raised by ϕ is settled in s. Thus, possibilities in the generalized semantics are maximal states in which the issue raised by a formula is settled in a particular way; in this sense, the possibilities that we get in the generalized semantics embody the possible ways of resolving the issue raised by the formula.</p><p>It is easy to see that the pair semantics can only disagree with the generalized semantics about the meaning of a formula ϕ in case one of the possibilities that the pair semantics assigns to ϕ, call it t, does in fact not support ϕ. In this case, according to Proposition 2.27, ϕ must be informative or inquisitive in t; but it cannot be informative, since both semantics yield the same, classical treatment of information, so it must be inquisitive: for instance, p ∨ q ∨ r is inquisitive in the state {111, 110, 101, 011}, which is a possibility for it according to the pair semantics.</p><p>This means that the issue raised by ϕ is still open in t: t does not correspond to a possible way of resolving ϕ. Thus, the pair semantics does not yield the intended notion of possibilities, and the same point can easily be made for any other element of the inquisitive hierarchy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Support as 'Knowing How'</head><p>The motivation for inquisitive semantics lies in certain conceptual ideas about information exchange through conversation. The link between these ideas and the formal semantics is usually established at the level of propositions. However, propositions were defined indirectly here, through the notion of support. In this final section we suggest an intuitive interpretation of this basic notion of support, which allows for a new perspective on the semantics and the associated logic, and in particular on some of the observations made in previous sections.</p><p>We have already seen that states in inquisitive semantics can be conceived of as information states. Traditionally, an information state s is taken to support a formula ϕ iff it is known in s that ϕ is true. This is not how support should be thought of in the present setting. However, there is a closely related interpretation that is appropriate: 's |= ϕ' can be read as stating the conditions under which it is known in s how ϕ is realized.</p><p>Under this perspective, the basic clause in the definition of support states that atoms can only be realized in one way: the fact that they name must obtain. This special character of atoms explains the fact that inquisitive logic is not closed under uniform substitution: atoms are not placeholders denoting arbitrary meanings, but really represent 'atomic' meanings lacking any inquisitive complexity. They are simply names for facts, states of affairs that may or may not obtain in the world. This guarantees that each of the alternatives proposed by a formula is in fact expressible and can be selected by the dialogue participants through some utterance. This desirable feature of the system would be lost if atoms were allowed to be inquisitive.</p><p>Returning to the definition of support, the recursive clauses can be read as follows: one never knows 'how ⊥' unless one's information state is inconsistent; knowing 'how ϕ ∨ ψ' requires knowing 'how ϕ' or 'how ψ'; and knowing 'how ϕ ∧ ψ' requires knowing 'how ϕ' and 'how ψ'. Finally, the support-clause for implication becomes particularly perspicuous under this interpretation. A state s supports ϕ → ψ iff every substate of s that supports ϕ also supports ψ. That is, we know how ϕ → ψ is realized iff in every future information state where we know how ϕ is realized, we also know how ψ is realized. Thus, knowing 'how ϕ → ψ' requires knowing not only that ψ is realized whenever ϕ is, but also how the way in which ψ may be realized depends on the way in which ϕ is realized. In other words, what is required is a method for turning knowledge as to how ϕ is realized into knowledge as to how ψ is realized.</p><p>These observations naturally suggest a formal, inductive definition of the 'ways in which a formula can be realized'. There is only one subtlety that we have to take care of: in order to avoid multiple copies of the same realization, we fix any normal form for formulas in classical logic such that the normal form of each formula is disjunction-free. Denote the normal form of a formula ϕ by ϕ nf . We may assume that ⊥ nf = ⊥ and that p nf = p for proposition letters. We can then define realizations as follows. We shall refer to the elements of R(ϕ) as the realizations of ϕ. It is immediate to check inductively that realizations are always disjunction-free, and therefore, by Corollary 2.20, they are assertions. The following proposition-whose straightforward inductive proof is omitted-shows that possibilities mirror the alternative ways in which a formula may be realized (where 'alternative' means 'mutually incomparable with respect to entailment'). Proposition 9.2 For any formula ϕ, the possibilities for ϕ coincide with the maximal elements of { |ρ| | ρ ∈ R(ϕ) } .</p><p>In terms of realizations, the intuitive interpretation of support suggested above can be made more precise: a formula ϕ is supported precisely when a realization of ϕ is known. In the light of this interpretation, the conversational effect of an utterance can be rephrased as follows. An utterance of ϕ provides the information that ϕ is realized and it raises the issue how ϕ is realized.</p><p>The reader familiar with intuitionistic logic will have noticed that the recursive clauses in the definition of realizations are exactly analogous to those defining proofs in the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation of intuitionistic logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">14]</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> This parallelism allows us to understand the formal connection between inquisitive and intuitionistic logic that has been established in the present paper at a more conceptual level.</p><p>The differences between the two systems can be understood at a more conceptual level as well. They arise from the fact that inquisitive semantics is ultimately based on truth, whereas intuitionism is concerned with proofs. This means that in inquisitive semantics, atomic sentences can be realized in only one way: the fact that they denote must obtain. This is what determines the validity of the double negation axiom for atoms in inquisitive semantics. In intuitionistic logic, on the other hand, atoms may admit of several proofs, and therefore do not satisfy the double negation axiom.</p><p>A second, subtler repercussion of the fact that inquisitive semantics is ultimately based on truth is that information states are not taken to be primitive entities, but are construed as sets of indices, and obtaining more information amounts to excluding indices. This means that the Kripke model for inquisitive semantics has a powerset structure: every point in the model is associated with a set of indices s, and has access to all points associated with subsets of s. This is why inquisitive logic encompasses Medvedev logic, which is the logic of finite powerset structures, and in particular, why it validates the Kreisel-Putnam axiom. Thus, the two axiomatic differences between inquisitive and intuitionistic logic are both symptoms of the same fundamental conceptual difference between the two frameworks.</p></div>

In particular, {w} |= ϕ or {w} |= ¬ϕ for any formula ϕ.It follows from Definition 2.3 that the support-conditions for ¬ϕ and !ϕ are as follows. Support for negation)</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem 5.5 (Strong completeness) For any intermediate logic , the following two conditions are equivalent:</head><p>1. ND ⊆ ⊆ ML 2. For any set of formulas and any formula ϕ:</p><p>Proof First let be an intermediate logic that satisfies condition 2. Then, in particular, InqL = n , and therefore, by Theorem 5.1, ND ⊆ ⊆ ML. Now let us assume that is an intermediate logic that satisfies condition 1, and show that n is sound and complete with respect to |= InqL . The soundness Postscript After the final version of this paper had been submitted and accepted for publication, we were made aware that some of the results presented in Section 3 and 4 of the present paper are closely related to those established by Miglioli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[22]</ref>. Most strikingly, Miglioli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[22]</ref> show that ML coincides with the schematic fragment of a logic that they call F cl . This logic is defined semantically, in a way that is not directly related to inquisitive semantics, but Miglioli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[22]</ref> show that it can also be characterized axiomatically as ND n . This means, given the fact that ND n = InqL (our Corollary 3.35), that F cl coincides with InqL. Thus, our Theorem 4.4, which says that Sch(InqL) = ML, could have been derived immediately from Corollary 3.35 using the insights of Miglioli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[22]</ref>. This would have obviated the independent proof that we gave of this theorem on page 23.</p><p>There is also a close connection between the discussion following Corollary 4.6 of the present paper, and Section 5 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[22]</ref>. In particular, Miglioli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[22]</ref> also conclude that the one-letter fragment of ML is decidable, and that the link between ML and ND n may shed new light on the decidability problem for ML more generally.</p><p>Finally, Proposition 3.33 of the present paper, which establishes a normal form result for logics including ND, essentially coincides with Corollary 3 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[22]</ref>.</p><p>We are grateful to Mauro Ferrari, Camillo Fiorentini, and Mario Ornaghi for pointing out these connections to us, and we hope to explore them in more depth in future work.</p></div>
