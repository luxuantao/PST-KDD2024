<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Fluid-structure interaction describing wave propagation in arteries driven by the pulsatile blood flow is a complex problem. Whenever possible, simplified models are called for. One-dimensional models are typically used in arterial sections that can be approximated by the cylindrical geometry allowing axially symmetric flows. Although a good first approximation to the underlying problem, the one-dimensional model suffers from several drawbacks: the model is not closed (an ad hoc velocity profile needs to be prescribed to obtain a closed system) and the model equations are quasi-linear hyperbolic (oversimplifying the viscous fluid dissipation), typically producing shock wave solutions not observed in healthy humans. In this manuscript we derived a simple, closed reduced model that accounts for the viscous fluid dissipation to the leading order. The resulting fluid-structure interaction system is of hyperbolic-parabolic type. Arterial walls were modeled by a novel, linearly viscoelastic cylindrical Koiter shell model and the flow of blood by the incompressible, viscous Navier-Stokes equations. Kelvin-Voigt-type viscoelasticity was used to capture the hysteresis behavior observed in the measurements of the arterial stress-strain response. Using the a priori estimates obtained from an energy inequality, together with the asymptotic analysis and ideas from homogenization theory for porous media flows, we derived an effective model which is an 2 -approximation to the three-dimensional axially symmetric problem, where is the aspect ratio of the cylindrical arterial section. Our model shows two interesting features of the underlying problem: bending rigidity, often times neglected in the arterial wall models, plays a nonnegligible role in the 2 -approximation of the original problem, and the viscous fluid dissipation imparts long-term viscoelastic memory effects on the motion of the arterial walls. This does not, to the leading order, influence the hysteresis behavior of arterial walls. The resulting model, although two-dimensional, is in the form that allows the use of one-dimensional finite element method techniques producing fast numerical solutions. We devised a version of the Douglas-Rachford time-splitting algorithm to solve the underlying hyperbolic-parabolic problem. The results of the numerical simulations were compared with the experimental flow measurements performed at the Texas Heart Institute, and with the data corresponding to the hysteresis of the human femoral artery and the canine abdominal aorta. Excellent agreement was observed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction.</head><p>The study of flow of a viscous incompressible fluid through a compliant tube is of interest to many applications. A major application is blood flow through human arteries. Understanding wave propagation in arterial walls, local hemodynamics, and temporal wall shear stress gradient is important in understanding the mechanisms leading to various complications in the cardiovascular function. Many clinical treatments can be studied in detail only if a reliable model describing the response of arterial walls to the pulsatile blood flow is considered.</p><p>It has been well accepted that in medium-to-large arteries blood can be modeled as a viscous, incompressible Newtonian fluid. Although blood is a suspension of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in plasma, its non-Newtonian nature due to the particular rheology is relevant in small arteries (arterioles) and capillaries where the diameter of the arteries becomes comparable to the size of the cells. In medium-tolarge arteries, such as the coronary arteries (medium) and the abdominal aorta (large), the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible viscous fluid are considered to be a good model for blood flow.</p><p>Devising an accurate model for the mechanical behavior of arterial walls is more complicated. Arterial walls are anisotropic and heterogeneous, composed of layers with different biomechanical characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44]</ref>. A variety of different models has been suggested in the literature to model the mechanical behavior of arteries <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51]</ref>. They range from the detailed description of each of the layers to the average description of the total mechanical response of the vessel wall assuming homogeneous, linearly elastic behavior.</p><p>To study the coupling between the motion of the vessel wall and pulsatile blood flow, a detailed description of the vessel wall biomechanical properties may lead to a mathematical and numerical problem whose complexity is beyond today's computational capabilities. The nonlinearity of the underlying fluid-structure interaction is so severe that even simplified description of the vessel wall mechanics assuming homogeneous, linearly elastic behavior leads to the complicated numerical algorithms with challenging stability and convergence properties. To devise a mathematical model that will lead to a problem which is amenable to numerical methods producing computational solutions in a reasonable time-frame, various simplifications need to be introduced. They can be based on the simplifying model assumptions capturing only the most important physics of the problem and/or on the simplifications utilizing special problem features such as, for example, special geometry, symmetry, and periodicity.</p><p>A common set of simplifying assumptions that captures only the most important physics in the description of the mechanical properties of arterial walls includes homogeneity of the material with "small" displacements and "small" deformation gradients leading to the hypothesis of linear elasticity. A common set of special problem features that leads to simplifying models includes "small" vessel wall thickness allowing a reduction from three-dimensional models to two-dimensional shell models, and cylindrical geometry of a section of an artery where no branching is present allowing the use of cylindrical shell models. Neglecting bending rigidity of arteries, studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>, reduces the shell model to a membrane model. Further simplifications include axial symmetry of the loading exerted by the blood flow to the vessel walls in the approximately straight cylindrical sections, leading to axially symmetric models with a potential of further reduction to one-dimensional models. One-dimensional models, although a good first approximation to the underlying problem, suffer from several drawbacks: they are not closed (an ad hoc velocity profile needs to be prescribed to Downloaded 09/19/12 to 128.104.1.219. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php obtain a closed system), and the model equations are quasi-linear hyperbolic, typically producing shock wave solutions, not observed in healthy humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In particular, the wall shear stress calculated using one-dimensional models is a consequence of the form of the prescribed velocity profile. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional models of the fluid-structure interaction between the incompressible viscous fluid flow and the motion of a linearly elastic cylindrical membrane are rather complex. Often times additional ad hoc terms of viscoelastic nature are added to the vessel wall model to provide stability and convergence of the underlying numerical algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44]</ref>, or to provide enough regularity in the proof of the existence of a solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49]</ref>, thereby showing wellposedness of the underlying problem. To this day there is no analytical result proving well-posedness of the fluid-structure interaction problem without assuming that the structure model includes the higher-order derivative terms capturing some kind of viscoelastic behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49]</ref>, or with the terms describing bending (flexion) rigidity in elastic shells or plates <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15]</ref>. In fact, current literature on well-posedness of the fluid-structure interaction between a viscous incompressible Newtonian fluid and a viscoelastic structure includes many additional simplifying assumptions such as the smallness of the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>, periodic boundary conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49]</ref>, or flow in a closed cavity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16]</ref>, not appropriate for the blood-flow application. Thus, the well-posedness of the fluid-structure interaction problem describing blood flow in compliant (elastic or viscoelastic) arteries remains an open problem. However, even in those simplifying problems when the data is infinitesimally small the higher-order regularizing terms in the structure model play a crucial role in providing the stabilizing mechanism. Thus, ignoring the terms that account for bending rigidity of the vessel walls and/or viscous dissipation might mean oversimplifying the physics, giving rise to a problem which might not have a solution.</p><p>Keeping this in mind we turn to the theory of elastic/viscoelastic shells to model the mechanical properties of arterial walls. Thus, we will be assuming that the vessel walls are homogeneous, that the thickness of the wall is small in comparison to the vessel radius, and that the state of stress is approximately plane, allowing us to consider shell theory. See section 2. The equations of shell theory have been derived by many authors; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> and the references therein. Due to variations in approach and rigor the variety of equations occurring in the literature is overwhelming. Among all the equations of shell theory the Koiter shell equations appear to be the simplest consistent first approximation in the general theory of thin elastic shells <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31]</ref>. In addition, they have been mathematically justified using asymptotic methods to be consistent with three-dimensional elasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13]</ref>. Ciarlet and Lods showed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> that the Koiter shell model has the same asymptotic behavior as the three-dimensional membrane model, the bending model, and the generalized membrane model in the respective regimes in which each of them holds. Motivated by these remarkable properties of the Koiter shell model, in this manuscript we derived the Koiter shell equations for the cylindrical geometry and extended the linearly elastic Koiter model to include the viscous effects observed in the measurements of the mechanical properties of vessel walls <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. We utilized the Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic model, which has been shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref> to approximate well the experimentally measured viscoelastic properties of the canine aorta and of the human femoral and carotid arteries. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> a version of the Kelvin-Voigt model was used to model the vessel walls as a linearly viscoelastic membrane. In the Kelvin-Voigt model the total stress is linearly proportional to the strain and the time-derivative of strain. More Downloaded 09/19/12 to 128.104.1.219. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php precisely, for a three-dimensional isotropic and homogeneous body, the Kelvin-Voigt model relates the total stress tensor, whose components we denote by t kl , to the infinitesimal strains e kl and the time-derivative of the strains ∂ t e kl through the following relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">t kl = (λ e + λ v ∂ t )I e δ kl + 2(μ e + μ v ∂ t )e kl , k,l = 1, 2, 3, (1.1)</formula><p>where λ e and μ e are the Lamé constants of elasticity, λ v and μ v are their corresponding viscoelastic counterparts, δ kl is the Kronecker delta, and I e := 3 i=1 e ii . In section 8 we show that the fluid-structure interaction algorithm based on the viscoelastic Koiter shell equations coupled with the Navier-Stokes equations for a viscous incompressible fluid captures the experimentally measured viscoelastic properties of arterial walls in the human femoral artery and in the canine aorta. This is, in a nutshell, the main result of this manuscript; using the a priori estimates based on an energy inequality, coupled with the asymptotic analysis and homogenization theory, we derived an effective, closed fluid-structure interaction model and a fast numerical solver whose solutions capture the viscoelastic properties of major arteries. We show that our effective model approximates the original three-dimensional axially symmetric problem to the 2 -accuracy, where is the aspect ratio of the cylindrical domain (vessel). Our reduced, effective model reveals several interesting features of the coupled fluid-structure interaction problem:</p><p>(1) Our model explicitly shows how the leading-order viscous fluid dissipation imparts long-term viscoelastic memory effects on the motion of the vessel wall. This is studied in section 5; see <ref type="bibr">(5.11)</ref>. We show that this does not influence, to the leading order, the viscoelastic hysteresis loop observed in the stress-strain (or the pressurediameter) measurements of the arterial viscoelastic properties.</p><p>(2) Our model shows that bending rigidity of vessel walls plays a nonnegligible role in the asymptotic behavior of the underlying fluid-structure interaction problem. See the equation for p 0 in (4.17). We found that for the parameters describing blood flow through medium-to-large arteries the leading-order terms in the coupling of the stresses at the vessel wall include not only the membrane terms but also a correction accounting for the bending rigidity of the wall, often times neglected in the description of the mechanical properties of vessel walls.</p><p>We developed a fast numerical solver based on the one-dimensional finite element approach and compared the computational solution with the experimental measurements. First, the reduced elastic model was tested experimentally using a mock circulatory flow loop with latex tubing, assembled at the Research Laboratory at the Texas Heart Institute. Then the viscoelastic model was compared to the hysteresis measurements of the viscoelastic properties of the human femoral artery and the canine aorta. In both cases, excellent agreement between the experiment and the numerical solution was obtained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The viscoelastic cylindrical Koiter shell model.</head><p>In this section we focus on the derivation of the viscoelastic cylindrical Koiter shell model. We begin with the linearly elastic Koiter shell model as it was derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref> and specialize it to the cylindrical shell geometry.

The linearly elastic Koiter shell model. Consider a clamped cylindrical shell with the reference radius of the middle surface equal to r = R, with the shell thickness h and the cylinder length L, z ∈ (0, L). The basic assumptions under which the Koiter shell model holds are <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref> that</p><p>• the shell is thin (h/R 1); • the strains are small everywhere, although large deflections are admitted, and the strain energy per unit volume of the undeformed body is represented by the quadratic function of the strain components for an isotropic solid (Hooke's law); • the state of stress is approximately plane. The weak formulation, describing the variation of the strain energy density function, depends on the change of metric and the change of curvature tensors of the surface. The change of metric tensor captures the stretching of the surface and the change of curvature tensor captures the bending effects. The weak formulation of the Koiter shell describes variation of the energy that is due to stretching and bending of the shell.</p><p>Denote by ξ(z) = (ξ z (z), ξ r (z)) the displacement of the middle surface at z (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.1), where ξ z (z) and ξ r (z) denote the longitudinal and the radial component of the displacement, respectively. Here the axial symmetry of the problem has already been taken into account assuming that the displacement in the θ-direction is zero, and that nothing in the problem depends on θ. The change of metric and the change of curvature tensors for a cylindrical shell are given, respectively, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">γ(ξ) = ξ z 0 0 Rξ r , (ξ) = -ξ r 0 0 ξ r .</formula><p>Here denotes the derivative with respect to the longitudinal variable z.

As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>, we would find a two-dimensional reduced free-boundary problem approximating the initial problem to the 2 -accuracy. This problem involves a hydrostatic approximation of the pressure, and it is usually written as an analogue of the shallow water system. Elimination of the radial component of the velocity leads to a nonlocal degenerate term. The resulting equations are too complex to be used in the calculation of the solution, and simplifications involving an ad hoc axial velocity profile are typically considered in the literature. Typically considered v z -profiles are in the form of a product of an unknown function of z and t and a generalized Poiseuille profile in r (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>). The resulting variant of the shallow water equations is then closed, but the closure hypothesis could introduce an error of order 1.</p><p>In order to find a closure that results from the problem itself and gives rise to an 2approximation of the full three-dimensional axially symmetric problem, we are going to use homogenization theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Homogenization theory is used to find effective equations for nonhomogeneous flows. For porous media problems homogenization theory can be applied when (a) the pore size (characteristic size of the fluid region free of another phase) is smaller than the characteristic length of the macroscopic problem (here, vessel diameter) or (b) the pore includes a large number of molecules to be considered as continuum <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</p><p>At a first glance using this approach in our setting is pointless. A simple averaging of the equations for the fluid phase over the cross-section of the vessel should provide a good approximation. Unfortunately, as remarked above, this approach leads to a problem that is not closed and might ultimately give rise to the errors of order 1. On the other hand, we know how to obtain closed models related to nonlinear filtration laws in rigid periodic porous media by homogenization <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37]</ref>. In rigid periodic porous media the expansions are of lower order of precision, but the resulting models are closed. It was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37]</ref> that in this case it is possible to link the homogenized equations with the nonlinear algebraic relations between the pressure gradient and the velocity (Forchheimer's filtration law), found in experiments. In a similar way, Robertson and Sequeira <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref> obtained a closed model for blood flow in rigid wall tubes by replacing the averaged momentum equation with a variant of Forchheimer's law, and no closure assumption was needed to derive a closed system.</p><p>In our case we are concerned with viscoelastic walls. How do we link the flow of blood through viscoelastic arteries with the filtration through porous media? Due to the uniform bound on the maximal value of the radial displacement, obtained in section 3.2, our artery can be placed into a rectangle with the length of order 1 and of small width . By repeating periodically this geometry in the radial direction, we get a network of parallel, long, and narrow tubes, with no cross-flow from one horizontal tube to another. This is one of the simplest porous media which one can imagine. It is not a rigid but a deformable porous medium, just as are the domains in Biot's theories of deformable porous media. All results that are valid for deformable porous media are also valid in our situation. Motivated by the results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>, where closed effective porous medium equations were obtained using homogenization techniques, we set up a problem that mimics a similar scenario.</p><p>Introduce y = 1 z and assume periodicity in y of the domain and of the velocity and the pressure. Furthermore, recalling that we have a narrow long tube with r = 1 R r = 1 r L , assume periodicity in the radial direction thereby forming a network of a large number of strictly separated, parallel tubes. Follow the approach first presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> a closed, reduced model was derived in the case when the vessel walls were approximated by a linearly elastic membrane equations. In the present manuscript, the introduction of a linearly viscoelastic Koiter shell model introduces minor differences in the derivation of the reduced model. Thus, we present only the main steps in the derivation and omit the details which can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Following standard approach in homogenization theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, we look for the unknown functions that explicitly depend on the "slow variables" r and z as well as on the "fast variables" r/ and z/ =: y. In our problem the slow and fast variables are related through z = Lz := L y = Ry, r = Rr. Thus, we look for the functions ṽ = ṽ( t, r, r/ , z, z/ ), η = η( t, r, r/ , z, z/ ), and p = p( t, r, r/ , z, z/ ) (4.4) that are 1-periodic in y = z/ and r/ and satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations (3.1)-(3.3).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Viscoelasticity of the fluid-structure interaction.</head><p>We emphasize in this section that the viscoelastic behavior of the coupled fluid-structure interaction problem comes from two distinct effects. One is the viscoelasticity of the structure itself, and the other is the viscoelasticity due to the interaction between the structure (not necessarily viscoelastic) with a viscous fluid. To explicitly capture the leading-order effects that the viscous fluid imparts on the motion of the structure we proceed as follows. First, we simplify the free-boundary problem (4.17) by expanding the underlying problem (4.17), (4.26), with respect to the radial displacement. The free-boundary problem will be approximated by two fixed boundary problems of similar form. Each of the two fixed boundary problems consists of solving a system of two equations (see (5.1), (5.3)) that are of hyperbolic-parabolic type. In each of the two problems, we can "explicitly solve" the parabolic equation for the velocity, plug the velocity into the resulting equation for the structure, and obtain a single equation describing the motion of the structure. The resulting equation incorporates the viscous fluid effects in terms of a convolution integral. If we will assume, for the moment, that the structure is purely elastic, the resulting equation describes the dynamics of an elastic structure under a viscous fluid load; see <ref type="bibr">(5.11)</ref>. It corresponds to a model of a viscoelastic string with viscous long-term memory effects. Thus, the fluid viscosity influences the dynamics of an elastic structure through a long-term memory effect.</p><p>We begin by expanding the free-boundary problem (4.17) and the -correction (4.26) with respect to the radial displacement whose magnitude is measured, in nondimensional variables, by Ξ/R.

Both systems are solved simultaneously using a time-iteration procedure. First, the parabolic equation is solved for v 0,0 z at the time step t i+1 by explicitly evaluating the right-hand side at the time-step t i . Then the wave equation is solved for η 0,0 with the evaluation of the right-hand side at the time-step t i+1 . Using these results for v 0,0 z and η 0,0 , computed at t i+1 , a correction at t i+1 is calculated by repeating the process with the updated values of the right-hand sides. This method is a version of the Douglas-Rachford time-splitting algorithm which is known to be of first-order accuracy.</p><p>Calculating approximation 1, 0 is straightforward once the approximations 0, 0 and 0, 1 are obtained.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Experimental validation.</head><p>A mock circulatory loop was used to validate our simplified, effective mathematical flow model (5.1)-(5.6). The circulatory loop was assembled at the Research Laboratory at the Texas Heart Institute. Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.1 shows the experimental setup and a sketch of the main components of the mock circulatory loop. The main components of the flow loop include the left ventricular assist device (LVAD Heart Mate, Thoratex Corp., Woburn, MA), which is a pulsatile flow pump used in patients with failing hearts to aid the function of the left ventricle, the inlet and outlet LVAD valves, two compliance chambers (wash bottles; 250 ml in volume), a reservoir (Nalgene canister), and pressure transducers (TruEave, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) placed at the inlet and outlet of the test segment. Latex tubing (Kent Elastomer Products Inc.) was used to simulate compliant vessels. See Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.1. The straight latex tube segment was attached to the hard plastic connectors placed at the inlet and at the outlet of the segment, keeping the inlet and outlet displacement together with its derivative equal to zero, i.e., η = ∂η/∂z = 0 at z = 0, L, as well as the inlet and outlet velocity approximately such that v r = 0. One of the goals of this experiment was to recreate the pressure waves and fluid velocity at the middle section of the straight test segment similar to those typical Downloaded 09/19/12 to 128.104.1.219. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php for the human abdominal aorta. To achieve this goal a clamp located downstream from the test segment was added to mimic downstream resistance by the capillary bed. Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.2(left) shows the measured (filtered) pressure data at the inlet and at the outlet of the test segment. This compares well with the typical inlet and outlet pressure data of the human abdominal aorta, shown in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.2(right). Ultrasonic imaging and Doppler methods were used to measure the axial velocity of the flow. Nondairy coffee creamer was dispersed in water to enable reflection for ultrasound measurements. A high-frequency (20 MHz) single crystal probe was inserted through a catheter at several locations of the tube. This method has been validated in vivo by measuring the velocity and wall motion in mice to a precision of 0.1 um; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref>.   To determine Young's modulus of the tube wall we measured the tube diameter d at the reference pressure of 84 mmHg (d = 2.22 cm) and at the maximal systolic pressure of 148 mmHg (d = 2.38 cm), utilizing the linear pressure-displacement relationship described by the equations of p 0 in (4.17) with C V = 0 and the data for the tube wall thickness provided by the manufacturer of the latex tube, Kent Elastomer Products Inc. The value of E = 1.0587 × 10 6 Pa was obtained. Using the numerical solver described in section 6 system of equations (5.1)-(5.6) was solved. The results were compared with the experimental measurements. At the top of Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.3(left) is a comparison between the numerically calculated displacement and the experimentally measured maximal displacement of 0.0008 m. Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.3(right) shows a comparison between the numerically calculated (solid line) and experimentally measured (asterisks) axial velocity. Excellent agreement was obtained indicating that this model captures well the fluid-structure interaction between a linearly elastic structure such as a latex tube, and the flow of a viscous incompressible fluid such as water, in the flow regime corresponding to the abdominal aorta.</p></div>

Unfortunately, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> does not include the pressure data at the inlet and outlet of the canine aorta. Thus, it was impossible to recreate the simulation that would correspond exactly to the scenario studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, using the data available to us, in particular the viscous modulus C V , we were able to approximate the scenario studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and capture the main viscoelastic properties of canine aorta. The results are shown in bottom figures show the hysteresis behavior in the stress-strain relationship. The upper "half" of the hysteresis corresponds to the loading and the lower "half" to the unloading portion of the cardiac cycle. The hysteresis curves and the time-lag between the pressure and scaled diameter show similar qualitative behavior.</p><p>An even better approximation of the hysteresis behavior in the dynamics of major arteries was obtained for the data corresponding to a healthy human femoral artery. One reason for this is that the inlet and outlet pressure data that were used in all of our numerical simulations correspond to the human data. We compared our numerical simulations to the measurements data presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In which is of the same order of magnitude as the viscous modulus corresponding to the dogs aortas. Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>.2 shows a comparison between our numerical simulations and measurements. There, a pressure-diameter relationship is plotted, showing hysteresis behavior. The graph in Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>.2(left) corresponds to the measurements of the human femoral artery reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and the graph in Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>.2(right) shows the pressure-diameter relationship in the simulations obtained using the reduced model (5.1), <ref type="bibr">(5.6)</ref>. Again, similar viscoelastic behavior is detected.    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.">Conclusions.</head><p>In this manuscript we derived a simple, effective closed model that describes blood flow through viscoelastic arteries in cylindrical geometry assuming axially symmetric flows. Using homogenization theory and asymptotic analysis, this fluid-structure interaction problem was reduced to a free-boundary problem of hyperbolic-parabolic type in two space dimensions. Although the model is twodimensional, its simple form allows the use of one-dimensional solvers giving rise to a numerical algorithm of one-dimensional complexity. In contrast with the "classical" one-dimensional models where an ad hoc assumption on the axial velocity profile needs to be used to close the model, the system we obtained in this manuscript is closed, producing the axial as well as radial velocity as a solution of the problem. We showed that the reduced model approximates the original three-dimensional axially symmetric model to the 2 -accuracy, where is the aspect ratio of the tube approximating straight arterial sections. The main novelty in this manuscript is the derivation of a viscoelastic cylindrical Koiter shell model to describe the behavior of arterial walls. Viscoelasticity of Kelvin-Voigt type was utilized to derive the model which appoximates well the hysteresis behavior observed in the vessel wall measurements. We showed that in this fluid-structure interaction model bending rigidity of arterial walls plays a nonnegligible role in the leading-order approximation of the problem. This effect, together with the viscosity of vessel walls, explicitly derived in this manuscript, provides the regularizing mechanisms for the stability of the solutions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 . 1 .</head><label>21</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.1.
