Each terminal observes a different component of a discrete memoryless multiple source. The helper aids the users by transmitting information to them over a noiseless public channel subject to a rate constraint. Furthermore, one of the users is allowed to transmit to the other user over a public channel under a similar rate constraint. We study the maximum rate of CR which can be thus generated, including under additional secrecy conditions when it must be concealed from a wiretapper. Lower bounds for the corresponding capacities are provided, and single-letter capacity formulas are obtained for several special cases of interest.</p><p>Index Terms-Capacity, common randomness, correlated sources, multiuser information theory, private key, secret key, wiretapper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>W E study the problem of determining the maximum amount of common randomness (CR) which can be generated by separate terminals under specified conditions and which may or may not involve secrecy requirements. The CR problem has been previously studied, after an early result due to Gács and Körner <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, by Maurer <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Ahlswede and Csiszár <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, Bennett et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, Ahlswede and Balakirsky <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Csiszár <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and Venkatesan and Anantharam <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The generation of CR can be based on randomness represented by the outcomes of correlated sources available at the terminals (source-type models), or on randomness introduced by channel noise (channel-type models), or on both. In this paper, we shall focus on source-type models where the only means of information transmission are offered by noiseless public channels.</p><p>The main feature of this paper consists of a study of the generation of CR by user terminals with the aid of another party called the "helper," although new results for models not involving a helper are also obtained as special cases. The introduction of the helper is motivated by the role played by a "third party" (e.g., a centralized or trusted server in a key establish-ment protocol), which facilitates the generation of CR by user terminals by furnishing them additional correlated information. Also, the notion of a helper has potential significance for practical schemes for the generation of CR by three or more user terminals, wherein the different users can take turns serving as helper in successive rounds of CR generation. As another feature, we examine models for the generation of secret or nonsecret CR with rate constraints imposed on permissible transmissions, depicting bandwidth limitations associated with the use of shared public channels. This approach has been used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> for CR generation without secrecy. Our models tacitly assume that all public transmissions are impervious to any deliberate attempts at inserting corruption. In a cryptographic situation, this assumption implies, in effect, that the public transmissions are authenticated, or that an (adversarial) wiretapper is passive, i.e., unable to tamper with such transmissions. (For unauthenticated public transmissions, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.) Much of the notation and terminology are from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. All logarithms and exponentiations are with respect to the base .</p><p>We consider first a discrete memoryless multiple source (DMMS) with three components, with alphabets and corresponding generic random variables (rv's) We adopt the practice in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> of representing a terminal and its associated alphabet by the same symbol. Terminals and observe the DMMS outputs , , and , respectively, of block lengths Terminals and represent the two users who wish to generate CR, secret or not secret, while terminal plays the role of the helper. Terminal can help the user terminals and in their tasks by sending them information over a noiseless public channel of capacity , i.e., can noiselessly transmit any function of to both and over a public channel subject to the rate constraint <ref type="bibr">(1.1)</ref> where denotes the cardinality of the range of Furthermore, terminal is allowed to send information to terminal over a noiseless public channel of capacity , i.e., can noiselessly transmit any function of and to over a public channel subject to the rate constraint <ref type="bibr">(1.2)</ref> No other resources are available to the three terminals. In particular, randomization is not permitted, i.e., and are deterministic mappings. (However, randomization can be incorporated into our model by the simple device of augmenting the source 0018-9448/00$10.00 © 2000 IEEE rv's and by independent additional randomness.) We remark that this model generalizes the situation considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> consisting of two terminals with two-way noiseless communication, the latter being recovered when A pair of rv's represents -CR for the terminals and if and are functions of the data available at and respectively, i.e., <ref type="bibr">(1.3)</ref> and take values in the same finite set , and</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(1.4)</formula><p>The rate of this CR is defined as For small this differs only negligibly from by Fano's inequality, since (1.3) implies that the cardinality of the set does not exceed for some not depending on (Note that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> where the users were permitted to randomize, an analogous bound on the size of was an assumption.) The largest achievable CR rate is called CR-capacity, and is denoted by</p><p>We shall also consider a model involving a DMMS with four components with generic rv's</p><p>The users and wish to generate CR-with terminal playing the role of helper-with the requirement that it be concealed from a wiretapper who observes the public transmissions of and and, in addition, the -valued outputs as side information. This model generalizes the "source-type model with wiretapper" of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. A pair of rv's representing -CR for the users and constitutes an -wiretap secret key if it additionally satisfies the following secrecy condition:</p><p>(1.6) Note that a wiretap secret key (WSK) is not necessarily concealed from the helper which, thus, constitutes a "trusted third-party" in this situation.</p><p>Two special cases of wiretap secrecy as above will be examined separately. The first obtains when the users and wish to generate a WSK which is concealed from the helper too. Accordingly, we define an -private key as an -wiretap secret key with in (1.6) replaced by , whence the secrecy condition (1.6) now takes the more stringent form <ref type="bibr">(1.7)</ref> recalling that This models the situation in which the users wish to maintain secrecy even from the centralized server.</p><p>A second special case of wiretap secrecy occurs when the users and wish to generate a secret key which is effectively concealed from an eavesdropper with access to the public transmissions of and , but not to any side information. Accordingly, we define an -secret key with (1.6) replaced by <ref type="bibr">(1.8)</ref> Note that a secret key is not necessarily concealed from the helper which now constitutes, once again, a "trusted thirdparty." As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, we could require in all cases above that the CR be nearly uniformly distributed, in the sense that its distribution be close to the uniform distribution in variation distance. In fact, we shall also consider the notion of CR (secret or not secret) in a stronger sense, namely, by requiring We shall say that is a strongly achievable CR, WSK, PK, or SK rate, if in Definitions 1.1 and 1.2, is required to satisfy (1.9), and (1.4), (1.6)-(1.8) are replaced by the (stronger) conditions (1.10), and (1.11)-(1.13), respectively (with some depending on ). The desirability of secrecy constraints in the strong sense has been pointed out by Maurer <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. All our achievability results will be proved as strong achievability results. The fact that the stronger constraints do not reduce secrecy capacity has been demonstrated for certain models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>An early result on CR, due to Gács and Körner <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, states-in our terminology-that , where is a maximal common function (c.f.) of and A c.f. of and is any rv which equals both a function of and a function of ; a c.f. of and is maximal if every other c.f. of and is a function of We shall need the following sharpened version of this result.</p><p>Lemma 1.1:: Given a DMMS with generic rv's whose maximal c.f. is , for arbitrarily small there exists not depending on , such that <ref type="bibr">(1.14)</ref> can hold only when equals a function of with probability exceeding</p><p>Proof: The proof is an easy consequence of the results of Witsenhausen <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and is given in Appendix F.</p><p>While this paper is devoted to the generation of CR at the two terminals and when a third terminal serves as a helper, it is also of interest to consider the amount of CR (secret or not secret) which can be generated by all three terminals.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SUMMARY OF RESULTS</head><p>Our main results are stated as Theorems 2.1-2.6 below. Although not specifically mentioned in the corresponding statements, all our achievability results hold, in fact, with strong achievability. The following Theorem 2.2 is a special case of Theorem 2.5 below. However, we prefer to state it separately here because it is easier to understand, and because under certain conditions it represents a conclusive result, i.e., affords a converse. In order to interpret the bounds in (2.1) and (2.7), we note that (in (2.1)) and (in (2.7)), respectively, represent the CR and SK rates which the users and can generate using the transmission of helper alone, while (in (2.1)) and (in (2.7)) represent the additional CR and SK rates which are enabled by the transmission of user (when using a specific scheme depending on the choice of and cf. the proof of Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 in Section III). A tradeoff between these two parts of CR and SK rates makes it conceivable that their sum attains its maximum when the first part does not (see Case 2 after Theorem 2.3 below).</p><p>It is not obvious a priori that the maxima in (2.1) and (2.7) are actually attained. This is true, however, by virtue of the fact proved in Appendix B that in (2.1) and (2.7), the rv's can be assumed, without restricting generality, to take values in sets , of cardinalities As in other results of similar form, these range constraints are also of conceptual importance, as they render the maxima in question computable, at least in principle (cf. [6, Sec. III-3]). The maxima in (2.1) and (2.7), as functions of will be discussed and related to the function <ref type="bibr">(2.9)</ref> in Appendix E; the maximum in (2.9) is with respect to rv's satisfying the rate conditions (2.8), (2.4), and the Markov conditions (2.5), (2.6). Here, the maximum is with respect to rv's satisfying the rate condition which is equivalent to <ref type="bibr">(2.11)</ref> and the Markov condition (2.12)</p><p>On the other hand, the lower bound in (2.1), with gives that the maximum being subject to (2.11) and (2.12); thus the lower bound in (2.1) is tight in this case with , yielding</p><p>Remark: Note that is a permissible choice in (2.1), and hence whenever .

This gives the lower bound <ref type="bibr">(2.16)</ref> where the maximum is with respect to rv's satisfying the conditions (2.11), (2.12).</p><p>In order to obtain upper bounds, consider the modified situations in which terminal can observe in addition to (resp., terminal can observe in addition to ; formally this entails replacing by (resp., by As these modifications lead to Markov settings and do not decrease SK-capacity, it follows from Theorem 2.3 that both (2.17) and (2.21) below constitute upper bounds for :</p><p>(2.17) Recall from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> that in the absence of a "helper," the largest SK-rate achievable by a public transmission from terminal to terminal is equal to</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">subject</formula><p>The result in (2.26) shows that if either of the Markov conditions or holds, the "helper" Terminal cannot serve to achieve a larger SK-rate, but in all other cases it can.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PROOFS</head><p>The proofs of Theorems 2.1-2.6 rely on techniques from multiuser information theory (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>), and are extensions of the proofs in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. All our achievability proofs are based on Lemmas A. We begin by introducing some notation, and refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for standard terminology.</p><p>Types and joint types of -length sequences will be represented, for convenience, by dummy rv's whose probability mass functions (pmf's) or joint pmf's coincide with the types or joint types under consideration. If the typicality constant in the hypotheses of (3.5)-(3.7) is replaced by for some constant , the equations for the cardinalities and probabilities in (3.5)-(3.7) remain valid (since has the same significance as ). For all the proofs in this section, we observe that the claimed bounds depend continuously on the permissible transmission rates. This is proved in Lemma E.1 of Appendix E. In particular, in our bounds involving maxima under rate conditions and Markov conditions, the former can be imposed as strict inequalities if the maxima are replaced by suprema. (with the usual abuse of notation that our actual intent is to denote the smallest integers not less than the quantities on the right sides).</p><p>The idea behind the proof is as follows. First, -typical sequences , , are selected at random. Then, with probability close to , to each typical we can assign a jointly typical with in such a way that if terminal transmits the index of assigned to , then terminals and can each reconstruct its index (with small probability of error) by the joint typicality of with and , respectively. Next, for each sequences which are jointly typical with are selected at random. Then, for and as above, there exists a jointly typical with such that if terminal transmits the index to terminal , the latter can reconstruct by the joint typicality of with We shall show that the entropy of the random quadruple (as a function of is close to Hence, this quadruple will represent CR of rate close to and the pair will represent secret CR of rate close to achievable with transmission rates and As the latter are less than and if are sufficiently small, this suffices to prove that (cf.(2.9)), and also Theorem 2.2. The full assertion of Theorem 2.1 will be proved by showing that a suitable function of can be added to to obtain a quintuple which achieves the CR rate claimed in (2.1).</p><p>We now provide the formal proof.</p><p>Step , conditioned on the event ), the same result also holds for the unconditional joint pmf on account of (3.27) and the corollary of Lemma A.4. Of course, the fact that the variation distance of the joint pmf of and from the product of the marginal pmf's, is exponentially small implies that is exponentially small as claimed (cf. e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">Lemma 1]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof of Theorem 2.3:</head><p>Part a): We first claim that the assertions concerning will follow if we show that is bounded above by <ref type="bibr">(3.37)</ref> where the rv's satisfy the rate conditions (2.3), (2.4), and the Markov conditions (2.5), (2.6), and ; note that the condition (2.2) on is not imposed here. Indeed, we can assume that , since the complementary case has already been addressed (cf. Case 1 in Section II).

We remark that this Markov hypothesis on is needed at this point only, and will not be used in the remainder of the proof. In particular, we shall not replace by or according to the prevailing Markov assumption, since doing so would not lead to any significant simplification.</p><p>In order to establish that satisfy the rate condition (3.38), observe first that  The asserted tightness of the lower bound for in (2.7) is now evident from (3.70).</p></div>

In short, the approach entails that terminal will transmit enabling both terminals and to reconstruct with exponentially small probability of error; then, terminal will transmit enabling terminal to reconstruct Next, a function is sought which remains secret in the strong sense from an eavesdropper who observes and additionally, in that is exponentially small, and this is almost uniformly distributed on a set with close to This function will be obtained using Lemma A.4, as was done in a simpler situation toward the end of the proof of Theorem 2.2. As might be expected, however, in the case a simpler strategy is required, with terminal not transmitting at all, and then a suitable suffices with exponentially small. In preparation for the proof, the following additions are needed to the basic construction used in the proof of Theorems 2.1 and 2.2.</p><p>In Step 1, we apply Lemma A.2 also with playing the role of , whereby we obtain in a manner similar to <ref type="bibr">(3.13)</ref>  For the application of Lemma A.4, it will be convenient to use the pmf on quintuples defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">(3.87)</formula><p>Then, in the final result, we get rid of the conditioning by the corollary of Lemma A.4, using the fact that is exponentially close to , just as in the proof of Theorem 2.2.</p><p>A necessary condition for is where can be arbitrarily small if are sufficiently small (and ).

In order to bound below the term on the right-hand side of (3.92), we invoke Lemma A.1, recalling that the sequences and were obtained by random selection (from and , respectively). Fix any joint type class which contains for some possible quintuple with the given Then, by Lemma A.1 a), among the randomly selected 's with a fixed there are many such that except for doubly exponentially small probability. (Note that in case i), the present satisfies the hypothesis of the lemma, provided that is sufficiently small.) Further, by fixing any such and applying Lemma A.1 b), we obtain that among the randomly selected 's with a given there are many such that except for doubly exponentially small probability. (Again, the present satisfies the hypothesis of the lemma, provided that is sufficiently small.) Thus we arrive at the lower bound <ref type="bibr">(3.93)</ref> Substitution of this lower bound into (3.92) shows that (except for an event whose probability is exponentially small), the conditional probabilities are bounded above by with arbitrarily close to the desired expression.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. DISCUSSION</head><p>We have derived (strongly) achievable common randomness (CR) and wiretap secret key (WSK) rates, and in particular, private key (PK) and secret key (SK) rates, for source-type models involving two user terminals abetted by a helper, subject to transmission rate constraints, as a continuation of previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Our results on achievable CR and SK rates are tight when the generic rv's of the given discrete memoryless multiple source satisfy the Markov conditions or , thus determining the CR-and SK-capacities in these situations. In particular, our CR-and SK-capacity results are tight if , when our model reduces to that without a helper but with two-way communication permitted between the users and For the latter, the CR-capacity has been determined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, while the SK-capacity result is new. Else, the issue of tightness, in general, remains unresolved. Nevertheless, single-letter characterizations of CR-, SK-, WSK-, and PK-capacities have been obtained in many special cases of interest when one of the bounds on the transmission rates is (no communication) or (no rate constraint). These special cases also yield new results for previously studied models.</p><p>This paper offers new evidence of the strong achievability of secrecy capacity (i.e., WSK-, PK-, and SK-capacities), observed previously in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Another-and perhaps surprising-observation is that randomization does not enhance secrecy capacity, at least in those instances in which the latter could be determined. Indeed, in all these cases, achievability has been established without recourse to randomization (unlike in previous works), and allowing randomization does not alter our converse results. Note that the CR-capacity, can be enhanced by randomization, although only in a trival fashion (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>): if either rate constraint is inoperative, i.e., or could be decreased without reducing , the available excess rate can be utilized to generate additional CR through the transmission of random bits.</p><p>Turning next to the issue of the extent of allowed public communication between the user terminals, it is worth noting that our SK-capacity without rate constraints, viz.</p><p>(cf. (2.26)), does not increase even if communication in all directions in any number of rounds is permitted; this follows from a similar result for SK-capacity without helper (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>). Another secrecy capacity with helper which is not improved by unlimited communication is the PK-capacity without rate constraints in the special case when the eavesdropper lacks side information, viz.</p><p>(cf.
