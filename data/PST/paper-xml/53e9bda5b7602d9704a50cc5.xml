<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Identification of Driver State for Lane-Keeping Tasks Tom Pilutti, Member, IEEE, and A. Galip Ulsoy, Member, IEEE Abstract-Identification of driver state is a desirable element of many proposed vehicle active safety systems (e.g., collision detection and avoidance, automated highway, and road departure warning systems). In this paper, driver state assessment is considered in the context of a road departure warning and intervention system. A system identification approach, using vehicle lateral position as the input and steering wheel position as the output, is used to develop a model and to update its parameters during driving. Preliminary driving simulator results indicate that changes in the bandwidth and/or parameters of such a model may be useful indicators of driver fatigue. The approach is then applied to data from 12 2-h highway driving runs conducted in a full-vehicle driving simulator. The identified model parameters (; !n, and dc gain) do not exhibit the trends expected as lane keeping performance deteriorates, despite having acceptably white residuals. As an alternative, model residuals are compared in a process monitoring approach using a model fit to an early portion of the 2-h driver run. Model residuals show the expected trends and have potential in serving as the basis for a driver state monitor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. MOTIVATION</head><p>I DENTIFICATION of driver state is motivated by the in- creased interest in vehicle active safety systems that seek to lessen the probability of a crash. An example of such a proposed active safety system is road departure warning where an driver support system acts as a copilot to monitor lane-keeping performance, and warn the driver when a road departure is predicted <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>If driver actions can be monitored, it would be possible to "personalize" the warning to adapt to different driving styles. In addition, it would also be possible to track changing driver parameters during a long drive. This would enable a driver assistance system to provide warning as a function of changing driver state (e.g., drowsiness or fatigue).</p><p>Therefore, a method is sought to detect changes in driving patterns so that an assessment of driver alertness/performance can be made. This assessment could then be used as one of the inputs to a road departure warning system <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The hypothesis is that system identification techniques can be used to form a set of driver parameters that can be correlated with various levels of lane keeping performance. Variations in these key parameters will then permit driver state to be monitored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. BACKGROUND</head><p>Approaching the task of driver state assessment from the perspective of driver modeling, the literature is rich with Manuscript received April 29, 1998; revised April 16, 1999. T. Pilutti is with the Ford Research Laboratory, Dearborn, MI 48121 USA (e-mail: tpilutti@ford.com).</p><p>A. G. Ulsoy is with the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA (e-mail: ulsoy@umich.edu).</p><p>Publisher Item Identifier S 1083-4427(99)05338-2.  examples. One of the first driver models originated from the aerospace industry as a representation of pilot behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the driver model contains feedback loops for lateral position , and heading angle , from vehicle model . These act through a compensatory term for lane position control; a feedforward term to anticipate changes in the upcoming path, i.e., preview information; and a final term representing precognitive control where the driver executes a command that is essentially autonomous. An example of all these in action would be to consider a lane change as the result of a highway lane being closed in the path ahead. The anticipatory term initiates a lane change, the precognitive portion executes the lane change, and the compensatory term acts to eliminate positioning error at the end of the maneuver.</p><p>Another set of driver models, so-called preview models, use the lateral position of the vehicle at some specified distance or distances ahead of the vehicle as the feedback term. The previewed reference (the upcoming road shape) is compared with the previewed vehicle position to form the error upon which steering commands are generated. Two such constructions are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and<ref type="figure">3</ref>. The Hess model <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> implements submodels of driver delay , and neuromuscular effects in addition to a compensatory controller . Parameters of the model are tuned to achieve the desired driver response. In Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, an optimal preview model <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> internalizes a vehicle model as part of the driver response to the upcoming road path. Driver delay and preview time are selected, and optimal control techniques are used to generate control gains.</p><p>An optimal control model proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> is a combination of some of the features of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The model provides a Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. MacAdam optimal driver model. basis for predicting the effects of attention degradation on manual tracking performance from an increase in noise in operator response. Additionally, there are examples of statistics-based driver models <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> that seek to capture anomalies in driver behavior such as fatigue. And finally, there are neural network approaches to driver modeling for vehicle control <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> where driver model steering angle output is mapped from visionbased road views.</p><p>Driver models found in the literature (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref><ref type="figure">3</ref>) are primarily used for vehicle dynamics studies of maneuvers such as lane changes, emergency maneuvers and general lane tracking. In these roles, the function of the driver model is to approximate the real driver's road-tracking performance so that vehicle dynamics models can be evaluated in a repeatable simulation environment. They are "control" models, and as such, they assume the "driver" goal is to follow a preset road profile. An example of driver model lane tracking behavior is seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>(a). Here an implementation of the optimal driver model <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, seeking to minimize the error between the future road trajectory and the predicted vehicle trajectory, controls the vehicle model to a standard deviation of approximately 0.001 m with steering wheel motions in the 1 Hz region. In the driver model implementation, driver delay of 0.2 s and driver preview of 1.0 s were used.</p><p>Data from a driving simulator with a similar road surface, but now with a real person at the steering wheel, is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>(b). The lane tracking performance is quite different. The lateral position standard deviation is 0.25 m with significant steering wheel motions only under 0.25 Hz, as shown in the spectral density plots between model driving and human driving. Some real driving maneuvers can require up to 2 Hz, but typical highway lane-keeping presents a much lower demand.</p><p>In addition, one can observe a "complacency zone" in the steer angle data in the driving simulator data [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4(b)</ref>] which is not evident in the optimal driver [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4(a)</ref>]. The steering position remains constant while lane deviation (and heading angle) errors build. Upon crossing some unidentified threshold, the driver makes a correction. The complacency zone is a function of disturbance level, and will also depend on other factors such as traffic density and road curvature. Complacency zone behavior is similar to a dead-zone, but differs in that the steering output is held constant at a nonzero position, whereas a dead-zone would have zero or close to zero, i.e., centered steering wheel, position in the dead-zone region.</p><p>The implications are that driver models for vehicle handling simulations do not replicate driving behavior seen in highwaytype lane-keeping tasks. There may be simpler structures that can capture changing driver behavior, and be better suited to support driver state assessment. Consequently, our approach is to utilize system identification techniques to develop a model suitable for driver state assessment based upon input-output data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS</head><p>The proposed system uses a system identification approach to track driver state assessment model parameters. The proposed input to the driver model is the lateral deviation of the vehicle relative to the road edge, . Driver steering angle, , is the model output. This section contains a description of the data set used, and an analysis to examine the persistent excitation capability of the input (lateral position). A brief discussion of identification in a closed loop system is also presented. Model structure selection based on a preliminary data set is then conducted. Finally, the usefulness of the model parameters is discussed in section describing parameter utility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Excitation</head><p>A system identification approach requires the existence of persistent and sufficiently rich excitation. Since identification needs to occur during typical highway-type driving, it is not feasible to perturb the system to induce "interesting" driver behavior such as sidewind disturbances, or wait for high demand driving tasks such as winding curves. Rather, it is assumed that normal driver tasks will provide sufficient excitation for identification. This assumption requires further investigation since it has been shown that highway-type driving presents low driver steering demand. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> shows the effect of adding road surface noise to the driving simulator vehicle dynamics model. It shows improved steering power spectra in the 0.5 Hz range compared to the steering spectra when the road surface is perfectly smooth. The advantage of adding disturbances through the road surface is that the surface is a realistic representation of vibration induced in the vehicle. The vibration is then propagated through the vehicle dynamics model. The disadvantage is that road inputs require a simulator vehicle dynamics model with sufficient degrees of freedom (DoF) to allow tire displacement inputs. With the capabilities of such a model and use of road disturbances, it is possible to more closely generate highwaytype steering profiles.</p><p>The simulator runs in the remainder of this section use the asphalt road surface shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6(b)</ref>. Four 1-min driving simulator data sets are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>. These runs were obtained from the simulation tool described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> which uses a 14 DoF vehicle model with road disturbances. Two data sets are intended to represent high and low attention levels. The other two runs are positioned as intermediary levels of behavioral operation. The four runs are from a single subject.</p><p>While the steering position spectrum has been enriched by the addition of road surface disturbances, we must keep in mind that it is lateral position which will be used as the input in the identification process. The examination of excitation requirements now proceeds with the lateral position signals in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> to verify that the vehicle disturbances provide sufficient excitation.</p><p>In the ideal case, sufficient excitation is guaranteed if the input is white noise. White noise is persistently exciting of all   orders, where order refers to, e.g., the number of parameters to be estimated in a linear model. The lateral position signals are not white noise, so the task is to determine the number of model parameters the lateral position inputs will support. The determination can be performed by examining the covariance matrix of the lateral position signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. If the input signal covariance matrix,</p><p>, where is the model order, is positive definite, then the input signal is said to be persistently exciting of order . The test is valid for stationary signals, so a reverse arrangements test <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> was performed on the lateral position data, and all lateral position inputs passed the stationarity hypothesis with . Use of the persistence test in this fashion requires a priori knowledge of the model order (see Section III-C). Model structure has not been selected, however, it is known that a simple model (e.g., second order) is sought for parameter simplicity. Using this information, is chosen. For the four input signals, all eigenvalues for , where , are positive. Although this result does not guarantee that the excitation will result in the identification of useful models, it does confirm that lateral position provides an adequate input for identification to proceed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Existence of Feedback</head><p>Since the identification process is to be performed while the driver is operating the vehicle, it is necessary to comment on identification in closed loop.</p><p>The proposed driver/vehicle system is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> as an expansion of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>. The driver state model, is the model we wish to identify, and is the vehicle model acting to form the feedback term, . Here, we see that the true input for is the lateral position error, , and the output is the driver steering angle, . The inclusion of the noise term, serves to provide the excitation by adding a steering position noise term that approximates disturbances that are input to the vehicle. The previous section established the ability of to support the identification process.  Closed loop identification also places restrictions on model structure. Prediction error model structures generally perform well in closed loop <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Care must be taken, however, with models that do not impose a causal structure, namely correlation and spectral models. In direct identification uses, the spectral model will identify the inverse transfer function of the feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. This situation does not exist for the driver/vehicle feedback system (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>) in that the driver is not a perfect inverse of the vehicle. Use of the prediction error models is justified with the assumption that the vehicle does not act as a regulator with scalar gain, , (i.e.,</p><p>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Model Structure Selection</head><p>Recalling the need to identify and then track changing driver model parameters, the selection of model structure is one that must balance complexity and simplicity. If the driver status model has a large number of parameters it will become difficult to interpret how the parameters are changing, let alone attach a metric of physical meaning to the parameters. A simple model, on the other hand, may not completely describe driver steering patterns. However, if it can be shown that the simple model can adequately capture the changing driver model dynamics, comparisons with terms such as damping ratio and natural frequency may then be made.</p><p>Section III-A performed excitation checks on the input data, but did not provide an indication on what type of model structure to use the with the input. Since it is desirable to use a linear structure, a coherence test is used to determine the existence of a linear relationship between input and output signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The coherence function is <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where and are the respective input and output auto spectral densities, and is the cross spectral density at each frequency, . In the attempt to avoid confusion between input and output subscript symbols, we use and instead of the traditional and to denote signal input and output. For all , the coherence function lies within . The coherence function tends toward unity as the relationship between input and output approaches that of a linear system. If the function is close to zero, either one or more of the following conditions may be present: random or biased noise contaminates the measurements, another input other than affects the output, or the relationship between and is nonlinear.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref> shows for the Attention-high and Attentionlow driver data sets in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>. Both coherence functions are quite good (near 1) for frequencies up to approximately 1 Hz. This confirms that a linear, but not necessarily causal (Section  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III-B), relationship exists between the vehicle lateral position</head><p>and the driver steering wheel input. Coherence degrades above 1 Hz, particularly for Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>(b), however, strong coherence is not really expected since both and do not have much power at frequencies above 1 Hz.</p><p>With favorable coherence results, the initial model structure is chosen to be an ARX model. There are other choices in the family of black-box models (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> for a summary), however all but ARX require iterative solution techniques. Since the desired final implementation is on-line, the preferred model structure choice here is ARX. The ARX model input-output description is <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> where is the driver model steering position output and is the delayed driver model input (in this case lateral vehicle position, ).</p><p>With the ARX model as chosen the candidate structure, it is necessary to determine a sufficient number of and terms along with the delay term, . The general approach is one in which many combinations of and are tried. The set with the "best" fit which keeps potential pole/zero cancellation pairs to a minimum is chosen. This tradeoff has been widely studied, and one result is an approach that compares model prediction error with varying numbers of parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref> shows the result of the Akaike final predictionerror (FPE) comparison for the ARX model on the Attention-med2 data set from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>. The number of and terms are allowed to vary from one to five, using the delay, . FPE criterion performance in the plot shows that provides the best results, having better performance than without unnecessarily increasing model order. Other delays were also tried, and had the lowest FPE.</p><p>The FPE results allow us to finally specify the candidate model. The candidate driver status model (2), in -transform transfer function notation , takes the form (neglecting the noise term) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> Expressed in least-squares notation of , where is the -vector of measurements (regressors), and is the vector of estimated parameters (regressed variables) of length , the candidate structure has the form (4)</p><p>The well-known least-squares solution, , is now applied to the driver simulator data set. The model parameters are used in the next section to verify our model selection, and then to examine their potential use in detecting a change in driver status.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Residuals Analysis</head><p>The approach to model validation for the ARX parameter estimates involves an analysis of residuals to determine correlation statistics between the prediction errors and the lateral position input. This analysis helps determine if the model selection is adequate to represent the data. If the prediction errors are strongly correlated with the input, the model structure is suspect, and alternatives may need to be chosen.</p><p>The residuals, for the least squares model based on the estimate of the model parameters, , are given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> Note that the residuals are also given by rewriting (4) to have the form , where and . The residuals are then . A suitable model structure will have residuals that can be characterized (or approximated) as zero mean white noise, and be independent of past inputs. Residuals whiteness can be tested by examining the residuals auto-correlation function subject to statistical confidence intervals. In a similar way, the relationship between the residuals and the inputs can be tested by examining the cross-correlation function.</p><p>The auto-correlation of the residuals is estimated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> for . is then normalized to form  The statistical confidence intervals (shown by dashed lines) are based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> where it is shown that if is sufficiently large, the distribution of is Gaussian such that for . For Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref> and the following plots in this section, the confidence intervals are where . The value, 2.58, is the solution to the inverse normal cumulative distribution function at probability . Aside from is within a 99% confidence interval, showing support to the claim that the residuals are white. As a comparison, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref> shows the residuals spectrum for driver model data taken at 10 Hz. For both cases, the spectrum is fairly constant across the frequency range.</p><p>In a similar manner, the relationship between the residuals and the inputs can be tested by examining the cross correlation function. The correlation between the residuals and inputs is estimated by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">13</ref> shows the normalized residuals cross-correlation, for the two driver data sets and the respective estimated driver model parameters. Here, delay is shown to 20 samples. The confidence intervals (shown by dashed lines) used are the same as for . For positive , the residuals are uncorrelated for each data set, and lend confidence to the ability of the model structure to represent driver behavior in the data. Evidence of feedback behavior exists, as manifested by cross-correlation values being greater than the confidence interval for some negative intervals in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">13</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Parameter Utility</head><p>Residuals analysis addresses model validation from the model prediction error perspective, and is an important part of the modeling process. This section investigates the utility of the estimated parameters in the framework of detecting changes in driver state.</p><p>The choice of the candidate ARX model (3) has been motivated in the effort to extract parameters with which we can establish a physical interpretation. Use of the second order ARX structure makes it possible to transform the discrete version of the driver model to its continuous version. Well understood second order concepts such as natural frequency and damping ratio can then be used as a performance metric to help interpret whether or not the models parameters contain information that can be used in the evaluation of driver state.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> presents the four driver state ARX model parameter sets, and the corresponding models expressed in the continuous domain. The discrete to continuous transformation was performed by using <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> Of particular interest are the damping ratio, , and the natural frequency, . The damping ratio changes from for Attention-high to for Attention-low. Similarly, natural frequency changes from 3.654 to 1.527 rad/s and from the two other simulator runs fall between Attention-high and Attention-low.</p><p>Additionally, the standard deviation of lateral position, , shows increases similar to those found during long duration driving simulator runs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> where fatigue becomes a factor. It is possible that changes in damping ratio and natural frequency can be related to fatigue. The marked change in physical system parameters is encouraging, but one must also take a look at the model fit statistics to determine a level of confidence in just how different they are. These statistics are represented as estimates of the parameter standard deviations, and are shown just under the parameters in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> enclosed in curly brackets.</p><p>At issue here is the uncertainty around each of the model fit parameters. For example, if the standard deviation of the parameters is such that an assumed normally distributed parameter spread overlaps the parameter from one model to another model, it will be difficult to make a confident statement on whether the model parameters changed due to a change in driver state, or if the change is the result of modeling uncertainty.</p><p>The approach taken to investigate parameter uncertainty is to use the standard deviation statistics to create a distribution of parameters, and then evaluate the overlapping effect of the parameter distributions. The distributions are formed using a Monte-Carlo approach where the model parameters are allowed to vary normally over the parameter space as specified by the parameter standard deviation given the ARX-generated parameter as the mean value. For example, the distribution for Attention-high parameters is formed using 5.131 and 4.978 as the mean values with 0.769 and 0.761 as the respective standard deviations. Determination of the parameter uncertainties is discussed in Appendix E.</p><p>Before this comparison can be done it is necessary to prune away parameter variations formed by the random Monte-Carlo approach which result in either unstable or nonminimum phase systems. While the ARX method does not produce unstable or nonminimum phase systems, no such constraints are imposed on the Monte-Carlo approach. Pruning is accomplished in the discrete domain through the use of a discrete version of the Jury test <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>The results of this approach are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14</ref> where the discrete systems (using only stable, minimum phase systems) have been transformed into the continuous domain. The resulting natural frequency and damping ratio histogram plots show the parameter distribution. The separation of the parameters from the two runs shows that there is a distinguishable difference between the models of the two runs. The distributions can be approximated as normal as shown by normal probability density functions superimposed on the histograms. The distributions, on the other hand, fail normality tests. One possible explanation is that may be more sensitive to the discrete to continuous transformation. Although a visual observation results in two distinguishable parameter clusters, the results can be strengthened by performing a statistical analysis of the two distributions.</p><p>A discriminant analysis approach was taken to compare two groups of known and different distribution (i.e., and are known and</p><p>). While a test such as analysis of variance (ANOVA) is capable of statistically determining if the means of two sample tests are significantly different, ANOVA does not directly consider the effect of overlapping distributions. The effect of the overlap is precisely what we are after in being able to distinguish a single sample as either belonging to the Attention-low or Attention-high groups. A description of how the discriminant analysis technique is applied is given in Appendix A.</p><p>Discriminant analysis techniques are used to determine feasible thresholds and, more importantly, the levels of probabilities which provide a quantitative measure of group classification. For the natural frequency data in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14</ref>, it is possible to be at least 90% sure that a sample will be correctly classified as belonging to the Attention-low model set. The classification threshold is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14</ref> with a vertical dashed line.</p><p>The discriminant analysis test provides support to the claim that the driver state model parameters reflect a statistically significant change in driver state. Modeling uncertainty remains, but we have seen that in the data presented the parameter uncertainties do not lead to unacceptable parameter variation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>In Section III, an input-output system identification approach (using an ARX model) was proposed to monitor driver model parameter changes for use in vehicle active safety systems. Preliminary results from a desktop driving simulator showed the proposed approach to be promising. The motivation for this section is to perform experiments of sufficient duration on a high fidelity driving simulator in order to test the ability of detecting changes in driver model parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Method</head><p>The goal of the experiment is to provide a sufficient set of driver data which will enable the second order driver model hypothesis to be validated (or invalidated). The key factor in the experimental design is to obtain a data set that will provide contrasting samples of driving behavior. Inexperience, alcohol, drugs, emotional condition, and drowsiness all can be a factor in driving behavior, as can the type of road being driven and the traffic conditions. In order to reduce the wide range of interactions that could be expected from these factors, it was decided to focus on fatigue effects on driving behavior, and to further limit the study to highway-type driving scenarios with minimal traffic interactions.</p><p>1) Subjects: Twelve volunteer subjects (nine male, three female) were used in the study. All were employees of the Ford Motor Company at the time of the study. A subject prescreening was performed in the form of a 10-min test drive in the driving simulator. The pre-drive served the purpose of determining if the candidate subjects felt reasonably comfortable in the driving simulator environment. Three candidates described feelings of queasiness (i.e., simulator sickness symptoms), and were released from participation in the study. The prescreening also allowed driving habits to be observed, and the opportunity to learn about the candidates' sleeping habits and other relevant information.</p><p>The driving subjects ages ranged from 27 to 40 years. This age range was chosen primarily in the effort to limit test sample size. The chosen range eliminates younger, typically inexperienced drivers, and likewise limits exposure to old drivers. These two extremes would have the tendency to add unwanted variance to the relatively small driver sample size in this study. 2) Driving Simulator: The study was conducted in the Ford Driving Simulator (FDS) at Ford Research Labs, Dearborn, MI. The simulator is a fixed-base device which provides realtime, interactive feedback to the driver through a combination of visual, auditory, and tactile cues, 160 field-of-view visual scene, a steering torque controller, and high-fidelity vehicle dynamics models. Data acquisition systems have been developed to capture a broad spectrum of driver performance metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The visual scene is generated by an Evans &amp; Sutherland ESIG 2000 graphics computer, and is presented on a 160 wrap-around front projection screen. The simulator throughput delay, the total computation and communication delay over and above those of the vehicle dynamics, is 59 ms. The vehicle used for the test was a full body 1995 Mercury Mystique. A sample image of the driving scene is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">15</ref>.</p><p>The roadway image presented to the drivers was that of a four-lane highway having two lanes in each direction. The highway section represented was taken from a stretch of Interstate 94 between Jackson, MI, and Marshall, MI, and includes terrain and cultural features. The lane width was 3.9 m (12.75 ft). Road roughness profiles as described in Section III-A were used as disturbance inputs to the vehicle model. The road geometry and terrain were taken from U. S. Geological Survey 7.5-min topographic maps. The stretch from Jackson to Marshall, approximately 25 mi, was mapped into the FDS graphical database, and selected sections were concatenated to form a highway database suitable for long subject drives.</p><p>3) Experimental Design: The test duration was 2 h and began at or near 1:30 in the afternoon. The time period was chosen to begin just before the diurnal (circadian) dip in alertness level which occurs between 2:00 and 5:00 p.m. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. A deeper diurnal dip occurs between 3:30 and 6:00 a.m., however, the afternoon period is usually considered sufficient for use as a "lever" to elicit contrasting samples of driving behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>The test protocol specified that the rendered highway scene be that of dusk conditions which provided adequate lighting to see the highway vanishing point, but at the same time reduced visual distractions in the scene.</p><p>Vehicle data from the simulator was sampled at 20 Hz. Steering angle spectra for highway lane-keeping is in the 1 Hz range, so 10 Hz would have been sufficient. However, vehicle body accelerations were also recorded, and since these signals are in the 4 Hz to 10 Hz range, sampling was done at 20 Hz. Vehicle data recorded were: steering wheel angular position as measured by a 0.1 digital encoder, (deg); relative lateral position of vehicle center of mass with respect to the lane center, (m); longitudinal vehicle speed, (m/s); relative heading angle between vehicle body fixed coordinate system and instantaneous tangent to road edge, (deg); vehicle yaw rate, (rad/s); distance traveled along road path, (m; instantaneous road curvature, (1/m). 4) Procedure: Prior to arriving at the simulator on the scheduled drive day, driver subjects were asked to sleep 1 h less the night preceding the test. On the drive day, drivers were also instructed to eat a normal lunch, but to refrain from coffee other than a cup first thing in the morning.</p><p>Subjects were asked to accelerate to, and maintain vehicle speed between 60 and 70 mi/h, stay in the right lane, and in general, "Please just drive as you would do normally." Drivers were allowed to play the radio, but were asked not to listen to talk-radio which has the tendency to elicit emotional listener responses.</p><p>Video contact by means of two cameras mounted in the vehicle interior, and audio contact by means of a two-way microphone/speaker system enabled the test providers to monitor the subjects's status during the drive. Driving subjects were advised to speak up during the test if discomfort was felt, but otherwise no communication with the driver was to occur.</p><p>After completion of the 2-h drive, the subject was debriefed. A standard driver simulator questionnaire pertaining to simulator sickness was filled out by the driver. The subjects were also asked to give a subjective rating of how they felt for the four 30-min periods. After the work day, subjects either were given a ride home, or had a ride home arranged.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Performance Comparisons</head><p>This section contains comparisons of lane-keeping performance for the 12 subject drivers. Comparisons of the mean vehicle lateral position, standard deviation of lateral position, and selected driver subjective performance assessments. In addition, a comparison is made using an algorithm developed to estimate the average percentage of eye closure (PERCLOS), which has been proposed as a driver fatigue metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>A comparison of this type is not often found in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The main reason is the difficulty in gathering high quality data. One of two issues typically plague data gathering:</p><p>1) data is gathered on a real vehicle and is subject to sensor limitations, e.g., lane edge detection; 2) data is gathered on driving simulator and is met with simulator fidelity issues, e.g., creating a compelling environment for extended duration tests. The data set from this experiment enables valuable comparisons to be made using different performance measures. Lane-keeping lane position measurements exhibit significant nonstationarities over the course of the 2-h drive. For example, a driver may tend to drift right of the lane center for several minutes, and then at other times be left of the lane center. The procedure taken to deal with nonstationarity is to break the test data into 1 min intervals (600 samples at 10 Hz), and then compute the statistics. More specifically, the statistics are computed using a 600 sample, nonoverlapping rectangular window passed over the data.</p><p>1) Mean Lateral Position: Histogram plots of the 12 drivers are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">16</ref> where subject plots are labeled S1-S12. The 1 m range on the ordinate ( -axis) is such that 1 m half the vehicle width places the tires on the lane edge. The distributions indicate that drivers chose to center themselves in the vicinity of the true lane center, with approximately half tending to center to the right of the true lane center. The centering bias may be the result of the tendency to drive to the outside of a lane (a learned behavior motivated by wanting to keep away from vehicles in the adjacent lane), or it may be a driving simulator perception bias of vehicle lateral position. Further insight may be gained by examining lateral position for continuous left lane driving.</p><p>The overall distribution shapes have normal tendencies (e.g., S4 and S12). A test of variance equality was performed, and the result was that the variance of the mean position data does not significantly change over the course of the driver data sets. A test of the mean (ANOVA) was also performed, and while mean of the mean position data had significant changes, the results do not appear useful as a metric of driver status. For a description of both tests see Appendix B.</p><p>2) Standard Deviation of Lateral Position: The standard deviation of lateral position is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">17</ref>  As was done for the mean lateral position, a test of variance equality was performed, and the result was that the variance of the lateral position standard deviation data does significantly change for seven of the twelve drivers. A test of the mean (ANOVA) was also performed. The result was that there were also significant changes in the mean of the lateral position standard deviation data. The changes correspond well with other driver status measures (PERCLOS in the next section), and suggest the standard deviation of lateral position may hold valuable driver status information. For further interpretation of both tests see Appendix B.</p><p>All drivers exhibit similar initial lane-keeping performance by maintaining 1 position errors in the 0.2 m range. As the test continued, however, lateral position errors were observed to increase. These changes are better displayed in a time history plot of how standard deviation of lateral position evolves. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">18</ref> shows how lane-keeping performance degrades over time for subjects S2 and S3. Other drivers "plateau" in lane-keeping error as evidenced with subjects S4 and S9. One driver, S5, experienced improved performance halfway through the test after an increase in position error early in the test.</p><p>PERCLOS: The PERCLOS performance metric was used for validation purposes, and as a comparison with driver state detection algorithms (fatigue) found in the literature. PERCLOS establishes a statistical relationship between eye percent closure, and vehicle measurements such as steering wheel position and lateral position. Percent eye closure has been shown to correlate well with brainwave activity (EEG), therefore, use of the PERCLOS algorithm is a partial substitute for painstaking EEG data gathering. The algorithm was implemented as is published in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. A summary of the PERCLOS approach, and details can be found in Appendix C.   The trends in estimated PERCLOS are very similar to that of the standard deviation of lateral position evident in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">18</ref>. This is not an unexpected result since the PERCLOS algorithm has significant lane position weighting.</p><p>Recalling that the PERCLOS values are estimates based on the same sets of collected data as the standard deviation plots, it can be argued that validation of driver monitoring results will be uncertain, given the lack of independent (physiological) measures. However, given that PERCLOS has been validated to separate measures (see Appendix C) to approximately 80% confidence levels, it is reasonable to use PERCLOS as a validation metric.</p><p>4) Driver Comments: Driver subjective observations of their performance provided general indications of how they felt during the drive. The test was designed to be boring, and to elicit performance degradation. All drivers concurred the test was indeed boring. Driver S5 indicated feeling especially tired during the first half, but then felt less so for the last half of the test. This description is born out by trends in both lateral position standard deviation and PERCLOS for S5. In general, drivers' subjective ratings agreed with the data performance comparisons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Results</head><p>In this section, the identification algorithm proposed in Section III is applied to the 2-h driving simulator data sets. The results focus primarily on a particular subject driver, S3, whose PERCLOS and lateral position standard deviation metrics suggest a clear degradation in lane-keeping performance over the duration of the test. Other subject driver results are included as needed for comparison.</p><p>1) Model Parameters: The proposed approach determines the driver model parameters from a second order ARX model structure with one zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> where the input is lateral position and the output is steering angle.</p><p>The 2 h of data are divided into 1-min intervals, and a leastsquares fit of the parameters is performed on each individual interval. The discrete-time parameters are then transformed to continuous-time using . The damping ratio and natural frequency are computed for the continuoustime parameters in both under and over-damped conditions. The model identification results for driver S3 are shown in the and zero plots from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">20</ref>. The most apparent feature of the plots is that no clear visual trend in the parameters, either upward or downward, is present over the 2-h run. The PERCLOS estimate and lateral position standard deviation (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">18</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">19</ref>) contain trends which can be associated with decreased lane-keeping performance, however, the series of model parameters in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">20</ref> do not contain similar trends. While local changes in model parameters may have some significance, the fact that overall performance degradation is not apparent in the model fit parameters (in the form of trends) leaves one to investigate the reason the proposed approach did not capture the trends, and to search for another metric which manifests the trend information. The next four sections investigate possible causes:</p><p>• model structure inadequacy;</p><p>• nonlinear effects;</p><p>• poor model parameter fits;</p><p>• trends masked by variations in parameters.</p><p>2) Model Structure: The existence of the large amount of data generated by the 2-h drive taken by each of the 12 drivers provided an opportunity to reexamine the spectral input-output relationship for lateral position and steering angle. This analysis was not feasible with the small amounts of data from the first study presented in Section III.</p><p>The estimated transfer function, , formed by computing the power spectra ratio, , is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">21</ref> for driver S3. The estimates for each 30 min are coherent to approximately 7 rad/s. The estimates are made by averaging 2-min intervals within each 30-min segment.</p><p>Overall driver estimates also show that the driver has lead behavior, and that from the magnitude plot, the lead is approximately 40 dB/dec. That is, the driver has approximately inverted the vehicle plant. This is not unexpected, as the driver "looks ahead" with the goal of smooth steering commands. The model structure used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> results in a frequency response that approximates this observed behavior only up to approximately 2 rad/s.</p><p>Therefore, although the model structure selection criteria (the AIC criterion was used) showed acceptable results, the ability to average large portions of driving data shows that the selected model structure is of limited use and may not be the most appropriate. Identification using higher order models would be an alternative, but then persistence of excitation becomes an issue due to the low excitation level of the lateral position input.</p><p>The identification process must be performed on highwaytype data. It was shown, using simulated data, in Section III to be persistently exciting of order four. If the model order is increased to six or seven, the persistence of excitation requirement might not be met in the strict sense. The leastsquares approach could still be applied, however, parameter variance could be expected to increase, thereby reducing confidence in detecting parameter trends. This issue will require further investigation with actual highway data.</p><p>An additional factor to be considered in the discussion on model structure is the effect of driver noise in the identification process and in spectral analysis. The spectral analysis of residuals would not be conclusive if dominating driver noise is present in the transfer function in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>. Given that the test subjects had the solitary goal of keeping the vehicle in the right hand lane, and that driver distractions were kept to a minimum, it is concluded that driver noise does not play a dominating role in the driver response. The consideration of driver noise in the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> could be included in future attempts to model driver response.</p><p>3) Nonlinear Effects: The next possible cause to be investigated is nonlinear driver behavior. The driver exhibits the ability to stabilize the lane-keeping control loop with ease, i.e., highway driving is more times boring than not, yet steering wheel position time histories and the respective lateral position time histories belie the apparent simplicity.</p><p>The nonlinear behavior considered is the occurrence of periods when the steering wheel velocity, , is zero even though lateral position is changing. At first impression, the behavior can be considered as having deadband characteristics. This is reasonable since a driver generally keeps the vehicle between the lane edges, and is not making steering corrections at every time instant. The steering patterns differ from deadband behavior, however, in that instead of the steering position being zero in the zone of lateral position acceptance, the steering position is often held at nonzero positions. The zone of lateral position acceptance, or complacency zone, may contain information on how the driver is performing the lanekeeping task. If the complacency zone increases or decreases over the driving span, as evidenced by longer or shorter periods where , it may be possible to correlate the change in complacency zone with lane-keeping performance.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">22</ref> shows the complacency zone average times for driver S3. The averages are approximately 1 s, and fluctuate between 0.6 and 1.2 s. An overall trend of either decreasing or increasing complacency zones is not apparent. Local complacency zone variations may be indicative of driver performance, but is not explored further. The complacency result does not exclude the possibility that nonlinear effects caused the proposed approach to not capture trends, however, complacency zones do not appear to have an observable influence on long term lane-keeping trends.</p><p>4) Model Fits: A third possible reason the proposed approach did not capture the trends is that the model fits are poor. Model goodness of fit can be evaluated using various metrics, and is evaluated based on an analysis of the residuals and an analysis of parameter variation.</p><p>The use of the second-order model structure did perform as well as can be expected for a second order model fit in the presence of relatively low excitation levels. The one step ahead model residuals were sufficiently white, and gave indications that the model fits were indeed acceptable. A sample of the residuals is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">23</ref>. The next step in the evaluation of model fit is to examine parameter variation.</p><p>5) Parameter Variation: Parameter variation, as was shown in Section III-E, can be evaluated using an approach that estimates the level of confidence in the parameters based on the model fit statistics. If the standard deviation of the parameters estimates is such that an assumed normally distributed parameter spread, for example, in the parameter in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, overlaps </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TABLE II DRIVER S3 MODEL PARAMETER VARIATION</head><p>the parameter spread from one model to another model, the parameter variation can be lost in the modeling uncertainty.</p><p>In the case of driver S3, although the long term trends are not evident, the model parameters do vary in the local sense. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref> shows the and parameter range of the estimated parameters , and from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">20</ref>. The respective standard deviations are . The standard deviation of the uncertainty of these parameters is shown as . The uncertainty levels for each parameter are computed from a nominal driver model based on the S3 data. An explanation of the formation of the nominal model is given in Appendix E.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref> shows that the standard deviation of the natural frequency parameter,</p><p>, is approximately twice the standard deviation of the parameter . This factor can be regarded as an effective parameter SNR. The ratio for is four, and the ratio for is 1/7. The poor ratio for is the result of large variance in the parameters. These parameter uncertainties give confidence that the model fits are sufficient to capture second order behavior, but that the estimated zero location cannot confidently be used.</p><p>The parameter variation finding can be interpreted as one that provides evidence that the local changes in and may be significant. These short duration changes are similar to the demonstrated "micro-sleep" effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> where short periods of reduced alertness occur over the course of a drive. 6) Alternative Approach: Up to this point, we have examined the possibility that nonlinear effects in the form of the complacency zone have caused the model approach to not capture trends, but were unable to show a relationship. We have determined that although the parameter uncertainties are not as small as one would prefer, they are within reasonable limits, and the residuals were found to be acceptably white.</p><p>A good indication of the trends was found by examination of the residuals generated by a model ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) formed based on a short interval at the beginning of the driving data set. The interval used spans minutes two to ten. Instead of forming a new set of model parameters for each successive interval, the remainder of the data set was then passed through the driver model (filter). The resulting residuals (based on a 1-s prediction) for driver S3 are shown plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">24</ref>. The residuals are normed using , where is the number of samples in the interval and is the residual. The residuals plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">24</ref> display the long term trend seen in the lateral position standard deviation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">18</ref>), and PERCLOS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">19</ref>). These trends were not indicated in the model fit parameters in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">20</ref>. Local variations in the residual metric are also apparent, and are similar to the lateral position standard deviation. This assessment of similarity is qualitative at best, so the residual metric plots for the other 11 drivers is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">25</ref>. Compare these to the results for standard deviation of lateral position in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">18</ref> and to PERCLOS in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">19</ref>. The magnitude of steering variation is different from driver to driver, however, the trend similarity is present.</p><p>The approach that can be taken to make an assessment of driver status would be to form a diagnostic driver model from an initial set of data (e.g., from early in the drive) and then compare residuals from subsequent time intervals during the drive. The residuals could be used in a number of ways. One approach is to form residual thresholds and then classify behavior as the residuals are observed to change as is done in manufacturing processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Another approach is to form a series of diagnostic driver models and run each model in parallel <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Behavior would then be classified to the model which most closely matched the data (i.e., smallest residuals).</p><p>V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS A system identification approach to driver state assessment has been proposed and evaluated using simulated driver data. The approach uses an ARX model to represent the relationship between vehicle lateral position and the driver steering wheel angular position. The model are then estimated for segments of the driving task. The results are encouraging in that a good model fit is obtained, and changes in driver behavior are distinguishable in terms of changes in the model, notably the damping ratio and natural frequency. In this section, the approach is applied to data from 12 2-h highway driving runs conducted in a full-vehicle driving simulator.</p><p>This section provides a sufficient set of driver data to evaluate the proposed approach's usefulness in capturing slowly deteriorating driver performance. The identified model parameters, , and , do not exhibit the trends expected as lane-keeping performance deteriorates; despite having acceptably white residuals. It is possible that the selected model structure may not be the most appropriate given spectral estimates of the transfer function. Nonlinear effects, in the form of a complacency zone, have been characterized, but have been shown to not be directly linked to lane-keeping degradation.</p><p>As an alternative, model residuals have been compared in a process monitoring approach using a model fit to an initial portion of the 2-h driver run. Model residuals generated in this fashion show the expected trends and have potential in serving as the basis for a driver state monitor. As a part of future work, further investigation of driver status should include a more instantaneous validation metric (possibly physiological) as compared to the 6-min averages used by the PERCLOS metric. A metric with a smaller time interval would be useful in attempting to evaluate local parameter variations. Estimating driver performance is a difficult problem, and it is hoped that this work will be of use for further research in the field.</p></div>

The pattern of hypothesis rejection for the standard deviation of lateral position, on the other hand, show patterns very similar to those of drivers using the PERCLOS metric.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX C PERCLOS</head><p>The PERCLOS (PERcent CLOSed) algorithm is the result of work conducted at Virginia Polytechnic University which has established a statistical procedure to link independent measures such as steering wheel position, lateral acceleration and lane position to dependent measures such as brainwave activity (EEG), eye closure, and visual drowsiness scores as rated by trained observers. The goal is to provide a means to detect driver fatigue level using "measurable" vehicle parameters.</p><p>The algorithm is based on a two-stage series of inference whereby percent eye closure was first found to be strongly correlated with more direct indications of physiological fatigue (drowsiness) determined by EEG and EOG measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Percent eye closure, as measured by visually scoring video tape frames, was then correlated with a combination of vehicle parameters using multiple regression analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>In the testing performed on PERCLOS algorithms at Virginia Polytechnic University, 79% overall accuracy between the PERCLOS algorithm output and the actual fatigue observation (actual PERCLOS, EEG, EOG, etc.) was achieved. The accuracy was scored by using three levels of fatigue thresholds as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">IV</ref>. PERCLOS values are defined as the percentage of time that the eye is closed 80% or more. At this point, the PERCLOS magnitudes are uncertain, and there is an effort underway to validate the PERCLOS given the uncertainty in the and parameters. However, the expected systems do not directly provide the parameter utility we are seeking. The parameter utility is formed by determining the expected values of and DC , and then computing the respective standard deviations, . The can then be used to represent the parameter uncertainty level.

Qualitative trends are indicative of changes in the driver fatigue estimate.The trends in estimated PERCLOS are very similar to that of the standard deviation of lateral position evident in Fig.18. This is not an unexpected result since the PERCLOS algorithm has significant lane position weighting.Recalling that the PERCLOS values are estimates based on the same sets of collected data as the standard deviation plots, it can be argued that validation of driver monitoring results will be uncertain, given the lack of independent (physiological) measures. However, given that PERCLOS has been validated to separate measures (see Appendix C) to approximately 80% confidence levels, it is reasonable to use PERCLOS as a validation metric.4) Driver Comments: Driver subjective observations of their performance provided general indications of how they felt during the drive.

For example, if , formed from a thresholded derivative of steering position, is zero for four time steps, the complacency zone bin for 0.4 s is incremented by 1. The 1-min interval is tested for complacency zones of 0.1 to 8.0 s in 0.1 s increments. The procedure is repeated for the remaining 1-min intervals in the With the distribution of complacency zones formed for each of the 1-min intervals, the centroid of the distribution is calculated. An example of the finding the centroid is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">27</ref>. The centroid, essentially an area moment, determines the complacency zone (in seconds) which balances the distribution for that interval. The centroid for Fig. <ref type="figure">27</ref> is located at 0.9 s. A trend in the variation of the centroid would be an indication that the complacency zone could be a metric of driver performance.</p></div>
