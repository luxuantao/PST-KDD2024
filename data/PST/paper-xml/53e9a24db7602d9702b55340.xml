<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Scientists increasingly use ensemble data sets to explore relationships present in dynamic systems. Ensemble data sets combine spatio-temporal simulation results generated using multiple numerical models, sampled input conditions and perturbed parameters.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Ensemble data sets are an increasingly common tool to help scientists simulate complex systems, mitigate uncertainty, and investigate sensitivity to parameters and initial conditions. These data sets are large, multidimensional, multivariate and multivalued over both space and time. Due to their complexity and size, ensembles provide challenges in data management, analysis, and visualization.</p><p>In this article we present Ensemble-Vis, a general framework to support the visual analysis of ensemble data with a focus on the discovery and evaluation of simulation outcomes, a screenshot of which can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Our approach combines a variety of statistical visualization techniques to allow scientists to quickly identify areas of interest, ask quantitative questions about the ensemble behavior, and explore the uncertainty associated with the data. By linking scientific and information visualization techniques, Ensemble-Vis provides a cohesive view of the data that permits analysis at multiple scales from high-level abstraction to the direct display of data values. Ensemble-Vis is developed as a component-based framework allowing it to be easily adapted to new applications and domains. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Motivation</head><p>The goal of an ensemble data set is to predict and quantify the range of outcomes that follow from a collection of simulation runs. These outcomes have both quantitative aspects, such as the probability of freezing rain in a given area over a given time, and qualitative aspects, such as the shape of a severe weather system. While ensemble data sets have enormous power to express and measure such conditions, the appropriate methods for visualization and analysis are highly dependent on the application area.</p><p>We focus on two driving applications: short-term weather forecasting and climate modeling. Meteorologists use short-term forecast data to predict local weather outlooks rather than relying on singular, deterministic models <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. These data sets give insight into the range of possible predictions and allow meteorologists to provide weather forecasts along with the probability of particular outcomes. We use data from NOAA's Short-Range Ensemble Forecast (SREF), obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Protection's Environmental Modeling Center and Short-Range Ensemble Forecasting Project (http://wwwt.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/SREF/SREF.html). In contrast to meteorologists' goal of predicting the local weather over a span of hours, days, or weeks, climate scientists are interested in global changes in climate over hundreds of years <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This data is often used to understand phenomena such as the impact of human activity on global climate or trends in natural disasters. Because these results are used for decision making and public policy formation, the reliability and credibility of the predicted data is of paramount importance. The data used for our study was obtained from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's experiment on the Climate of the 20th century, available from the Earth System Grid data holdings (https://esg.llnl.gov:8443/index.jsp).</p><p>One important common element among most applications using ensembles is the goal stated above: to predict and quantify the range of outcomes. In this work, we provide a data analysis framework that allows domain scientists to explore and interrogate an ensemble both visually and numerically in order to reason about those outcomes. While our approach is informed by some of the specific needs of meteorology and climatology and in particular the applications described above, the structure and algorithms presented in the Ensemble-Vis framework are general enough to be applied to analysis problems using ensemble data across a wide variety of fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Ensemble Data Sets</head><p>We define an ensemble data set as a collection of multiple time-varying data sets (called ensemble members) that are generated by computational simulations of one or more state variables across space. The variation among the ensemble members arises from the use of different input conditions, simulation models, and parameters to those simulations.</p><p>Ensembles are:</p><p>• Multidimensional in space (2, 2.5 or 3 dimensions) and time; • Multivariate, often comprising tens to hundreds of variables; and • Multivalued in collecting several values for each variable at each point. Ensemble data sets are chiefly useful as a tool to quantify and mitigate uncertainty and error in simulation results. These errors can arise through faulty estimations or measurements of the initial conditions, from the finite resolution and precision of the numerical model, and from the nature of a numerical simulation as an approximate model of an incompletely understood real-world phenomenon.</p><p>The main challenges in using ensembles stem from the size and complexity of the data. For example, each of the four daily runs of the SREF ensemble contains 21 members comprising four models and eleven sets of input conditions. Each member contains 624 state variables at each of 24,000 grid points and includes 30 time steps. A single day's output thus contains 84 members, each of which is a complex data set that poses visualization challenges in its own right. When information from all members is displayed together, as in the plume chart in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the result is visual chaos that conveys only a general notion of the behavior of the predicted variable. Although the overall envelope defined by the minima and maxima can be discerned, the most likely outcome, the average across members, or even the course of any one member is difficult to extract. These challenges are exacerbated in more complex data sets such as climate simulations that incorporate 24 different models instead of four.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RELATED WORK</head><p>Because of the complexity of the data we are working with, this research must draw from numerous fields within scientific and information visualization. Important topics include multidimensional, multivariate and multivalued data visualization, uncertainty visualization, statistical data display, and user interactivity.</p><p>Current state-of-the-art techniques for displaying weather and climate datasets include software systems such as Vis5D <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and SimEnvVis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. These systems include 2D geographical maps with data overlaid via color maps, contours, and glyphs, as well as more sophisticated visualization techniques such as isosurfacing, volume rendering, and flow visualization. Vis5D focuses on displaying the 5 dimensional results of earth system simulations (3D space, time, and multiple physical variables) by combining the visualizations of multiple variables into a single image, and presenting a spreadsheet of these visualizations to show the various members of the simulation ensemble. SimEnvVis specializes in providing a library of comparative techniques to investigate and analyze multidimensional and multivariate climate-related simulation data. The system includes methods to compare and track features from a single simulation run, clustering to compare simulation and measured data, and information visualization approaches such as parallel coordinates to compare multirun experiment results.</p><p>The main distinction between these previous efforts and the approach presented here is our stress on understanding the uncertainty available from the data by providing visual-ization tools that emphasize the probabilistic characteristics of ensemble data. Overviews initially drive the analysis of ensemble data and highlight changes in uncertainty. Ensemble-Vis provides a suite of statistical visualization tools to allow the analyst to understand where variations in the data arise, explore the relationships between ensemble members and directly present unaltered data values.</p><p>Previous work in visualizing complex data types similar to ensembles is extensive and can be investigated in a number of surveys and general techniques. Visualization of multivalued, multivariate data sets is a difficult task in that different techniques for dealing with the complexity of the data take effect through various stages of the visualization pipeline and are highly application specific. Knowing when to take advantage of these techniques through a categorization of methods is of great importance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Multivariate correlation in the spatial domain is an often used approach for reducing the complexity of the task of data understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, as is reducing the data to a hierarchical form which is conducive to 2D plots <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Likewise, the visualization of multidimensional data is challenging and often involves dimension reduction and user interaction through focusing and linking. A taxonomy of such techniques is very useful in determining an appropriate approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>The most relevant work using ensemble type data views the data in terms of probability distribution functions (PDFs) describing the multiple samples at each location and each point in time <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Three approaches to visualizing this type of data are proposed; a parametric approach which summarizes the PDFs using statistical summaries and visualizes them using color mapping and bar glyphs, a shape descriptor, which strives to show the peaks of the underlying distribution on 2D orthogonal slices, and an approach that defines operators for the comparison, combination, and interpolation of multivalued data using proven visualization techniques such as pseudocoloring, contour lines, isosurfaces, streamlines and pathlines. While our approach also uses a variety of statistical measures to describe the underlying PDF, Ensemble-Vis additionally provides statistical views from a number of summarization standpoints in a single framework allowing the user to direct the data analysis, rather than automatically defining features of interest.</p><p>A major challenge for ensembles is in the wealth of information available. Depending on the application and the needs of the user, a single representation does not suffice. For example, a meteorologist may be interested in regional changes in temperature, as well as local variations at a specific weather station. The solution to this problem is to provide the user with multiple, linked views of the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Such approaches let the user interactively select regions of interest, and reflect those selections in all related windows. The selection process can be through techniques such as brushing <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, or querying <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. One interesting technique uses smooth brushing to select data subsets and then visualize the statistical characteristics of that subset <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Many of these methods use graphical data analysis techniques in the individ-ual windows, such as scatterplots, histograms, and boxplots to show statistical properties and uncertainty of the underlying PDFs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The resulting collection of views provides for complex investigation of the data by allowing the user to drive the data analysis.</p><p>Much of our work is motivated by the growing need for uncertainty information in visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Understanding the error or confidence level associated with the data is an important aspect in data analysis and is too often left out of visualizations. There is a steadily growing body of work pertaining to the incorporation of this information into visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, using uncertainty not only derived from data, but also present throughout the entire visualization pipeline. Specific techniques of interest to this work include using volume rendering to show the uncertainty predicted by an ensemble of Monte-Carlo forecasts of ocean salinity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>; using flow visualization techniques to show the mean and standard deviation of wind and ocean currents <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>; uncertainty contours to show variations in models predicting ocean dynamic topography <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>; and expressing the quality of variables in multivariate tabulated data using information visualization techniques such as parallel coordinates and star glyphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. ENSEMBLE-VIS</head><p>In this section we discuss Ensemble-Vis, a framework for the visualization and analysis of ensemble data that emphasizes the probabilistic nature of the data. We highlight changes in uncertainty across the ensemble members and provide mechanisms for the investigation of areas deemed interesting by the analyst. Multiple windows are used which share selection, camera information and contents when appropriate. Each window presents the data condensed in space, time, or the multiple values at each point in order to highlight some aspect of the data behavior. Combining these windows into a single framework provides a unified platform for exploring the high complexity present in ensemble data sets. Our framework is presented in two prototypical systems, the SREF Weather Explorer, and the ViSUS Climate Data application, which are discussed in Section IV.  A typical ensemble analysis session follows the structure shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The user begins by connecting to a data source and the choosing one or more variables to display. The selected variable is used to populate a spatial-domain summary view showing a statistical and spatial overview of data from one time step as well as a time navigation summary view showing a summary of the data over time. From here the user can proceed in two directions. The trend analysis path reveals answers to questions of the form "What conditions will arise over time in a certain region of interest?" The condition query path addresses questions of the form "Where are the following conditions likely to arise and how probable are they?"</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Work flow</head><p>Since any investigation of average behavior is vulnerable to the influence of outliers, we incorporate methods to view ensemble members directly and include or exclude their effects from the various views. This is useful not only in understanding how each model influences the ensemble, but can also be used to eliminate members which are characteristically biased or unreliably predict specific regions across the spatial domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Data Sources</head><p>Ensemble data sets are usually too large for in-core processing on a single desktop computer. Each run of the SREF ensemble contains 36GB of data from each run; 106GB from each day. The climate data runs numerous models using fairly short time steps (15 minutes to 6 hours), over hundreds of years, resulting in hundreds of terabytes of data. However, unlike the simulations that generate the ensembles, we do not need fast access to all the data at all times. An analyst's investigation of the ensemble typically reduces the data by summarizing one or more of the spatial, temporal or probabilistic dimensions. These sorts of summaries are well suited to out-of-core methods. The ViSUS system traverses the ensemble using a streaming architecture. The SREF Weather Explorer stores the ensemble in a relational database and translates numeric queries into SQL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Ensemble Overviews</head><p>Immediately after connecting to a data source and selecting a variable of interest, the scientist is presented with a set of overview displays of the ensemble. A high-resolution spatial display shows mean, standard deviation, and local minima and maxima for a given time step. An arrangement of lowerresolution multiples into a filmstrip shows the same information over several time steps at once. The user can scroll through the filmstrip and transfer any time step to the highresolution display.</p><p>1) Spatial-Domain Summary Views: The purpose of the spatial-domain summary view is to present a picture of the mean ensemble behavior at one point in time. Simple summary statistics such as mean and standard deviation work well as an approximate description of the range of values at each point. Since this is an overview, the approximation is sufficient: we need not convey precise scalar values for both mean and standard deviation. An approximate sense of the value of the mean plus an indication of high or low standard deviation is all that is required.</p><p>The spatial summary view also provides an indication of the uncertainty present across the spatial domain. Standard deviation, which characterizes the variation present in the data, is a measure typically used to describe the uncertainty of a data set. In these summary views uncertainty is expressed either through color, height, or contours depending on the needs  of the user. From this presentation, the analyst can quickly identify regions where the ensemble members converge or diverge indicating the quality of the mean value as an indicator of the predicted value.</p><p>By default, we display the variable mean through color mapping and the standard deviation using overlaid contours (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, left). Although the rainbow color map is generally a poor choice for scientific visualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, it is familiar for variables such as temperature and relative humidity through its widespread use in print, television and online weather forecasts. For other variables such as surface albedo or probability of precipitation we allow the user to use a different sequential color map, examples of which can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. Still other scalar variables such as height and pressure are most easily interpreted using contour maps instead of colors. For these, the analyst can reverse the variable display so that the mean is shown as evenly spaced contours and the standard deviation is assigned to the color channel, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, right.</p><p>We can also display standard deviation using a height field instead of contours. This is particularly effective when displaying 2D data projected onto the globe, as is common in climate simulations and shown on the left side of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref>, Although the mean and standard deviation cannot capture nuances of the underlying distribution, they are nonetheless appropriate here for two reasons. First, many observed quantities and phenomena in meteorology are well modeled by a normal distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Second, many ensembles do not have enough members to support more sophisticated, precise characterizations.</p><p>2) Time Navigation Summary Views: In addition to the spatial summary view, which shows a high-resolution overview of a single time step, Ensemble-Vis also provides time navigation summary views which give an understanding of the data evolving through time.</p><p>The filmstrip view, sacrifices visible detail in order to allow quick traversal and inspection across time steps. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, the current variable is shown across all time steps using small multiples of the summary view. All of the frames in the filmstrip view share a single camera to allow the analyst to zoom in on a region of interest and observe its behavior over time. The user can scroll through the time steps and select the hour of interest. Double-clicking a frame transfers it to the higher-resolution summary, query contour views, and trend chart views. This view allows the user to quickly select specific forecast hours, for example surface temperature 24 hours after initialization, or to quickly scroll through time and look for interesting events.</p><p>Animation is also used as a means to display time information. In this case, the change of data with time is reflected in the summary view. This view emphasizes the evolution of the data and is best demonstrated through the climate data in which the animated globe gives a clear sense for the velocity of large-scale phenomena and global trends.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Trend Charts</head><p>The spatial and temporal summary displays discussed above summarize the distribution of values at each point into two numbers in order to preserve spatial information. In situations where the analyst specifies a region of interest -for example, when forecasting the weather for a particular region -we can instead aggregate over space and display detailed information about the distribution of values at each time step. This not only provides better detail at specific spatial locations, but also gives information about the behavior of the members making up the ensemble. Ensemble-Vis provides two such views.  1) Quartile Charts: A quartile trend chart (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>) displays the minimum, maximum, 25th, 75th percentiles and median of a particular variable in a selected region over time. We compute these values over all the data for all ensemble members at each point in time. Order statistics give the analyst a view of the range of the possible outcomes as well as a notion of where the central 50% of the data values fall. This can be useful in quickly identifying minimal and maximal bounds at each forecast hour, as well as highlighting the range in which the majority of the members fall. As with the choice of mean and standard deviation in the summary view, this is most appropriate for unimodal distributions and can become less informative when the data distribution is more complex.</p><p>2) Plume Charts: A plume chart (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>) shows the behavior of each ensemble member over time. Instead of aggregating all ensemble members into a single bucket (as is the case with quartile charts) we compute the mean of each ensemble member's values over the region of interest separately. Data series in the plume chart are colored so that all series that correspond to a single simulation model will have similar colors. The mean across all ensemble members is shown in black.</p><p>The plume chart is the most direct access to the data offered by our approach. Although it averages over the selected region, the analyst can obtain a view of raw values by selecting a region containing only a single data point. Since it displays data directly the plume chart also helps distinguish outliers and non-normal distributions. If the distribution is approximately normal, the mean represents the most likely outcome and should fall near the center of the members. If the distribution is non-normal, the mean is a poor estimation of the outcome, and the members will have high variation away from the mean line. Analysts can also track individual models of interest, or can discount heavily biased models. In addition, multimodal distributions can be detected since multiple strong clusters of members are readily apparent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Condition Queries</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>. The condition query view shows the probability that a given set of conditions will occur as a set of nested contours. Contour values are the fraction of the ensemble that predicts that the condition will be satisfied. In this figure we see a query for heatstroke danger (defined as relative humidity above 50% and temperatures above 95 • Fahrenheit) and the resulting visualization.</p><p>The summary views and trend charts described above are exploratory views that illustrate behavior and possible outcomes over a region of interest. Another approach to ensemble data is for the analyst to specify a set of circumstances and ask for information about where they may occur. Such query-driven techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> constrain the visualization to the subset of data deemed interesting by the analyst and discards the rest. We refer to these sets of circumstances as conditions.</p><p>Once an analyst specifies a condition, as shown in the inset of Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>, the application translates it into a form understood by the data repository and retrieves a list of points where one or more ensemble members satisfies the condition. This list of points is transformed into an image where the scalar value at each point indicates the number of ensemble members (or, alternately, the percentage of the ensemble members) that meet the condition criteria. That image can in turn be displayed directly or (more usefully) drawn as a series of contours on a summary display.</p><p>In our example implementation using the SREF weather ensemble, conditions are translated into SQL and use the GROUP BY and COUNT constructs to aggregate individual data points into the image that represents the query contour. Although we used a very simple dialog to specify a condition, there exist a wide variety of query languages and mechanisms for visual query specification. Our component-based approach makes it straightforward to integrate any of these so long as an appropriate translation to the data source's native language exists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Multivariate Layer Views</head><p>Although most ensemble analyses are performed using a single variable at a time, there are instances where an analyst wishes to compare multiple variables (especially multiple horizontal slices of a single 3D variable) across space at a single time step. This arises often when dealing with variables such as cloud structure that exhibit complex behavior across different altitudes. We display such slices using multiple 2D views in the same window. The data are displayed using a common color map in a single window. The analyst specifies the number of slices to be displayed and can also include a spatial summary (mean and standard deviation) along with the slice images. This type of display is assistive in comparing, for example, distinct time steps in the simulation, or the changes in a variable across the spatial domain. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref>, right, shows the minimum and maximum values for surface temperature for January 12, 1900, as well as the standard deviation for that data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Spaghetti Plots</head><p>A spaghetti plot <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, so named because of its resemblance to a pile of spaghetti noodles, is a tool frequently used in meteorology to examine variations across the members of an ensemble over space. An analyst first chooses a time step, a variable and a contour value for that variable. The spaghetti plot then consists of the isocontour for the chosen value for each different member of the ensemble. When the ensemble is in agreement, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>, left, the contours will fall into a coherent bundle. When minor variation exists, a few outliers may diverge from the bundle (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>, right). As the level of disagreement increases the contours become disordered and tangled and the spaghetti plot comes to resemble its namesake.</p><p>As with the plume charts, we assign colors to the contours in a spaghetti plot so that contours that arise from the same simulation model will have similar colors. We also allow the user to enable and disable different ensemble members in order to inspect and compare the behavior of different models or the effects of different perturbations of initial conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H. Coordination Between Views</head><p>The various views in Ensemble-Vis coordinate their displayed variables, time steps, camera parameters and selections to the greatest degree that is appropriate. Lightweight operations such as changes to the camera, selection, image/contour assignment and contour level (for the spaghetti plot) take effect immediately. More expensive operations such as changing the current variable, executing a condition query or generating trend charts from a selection require that we retrieve new data from storage. Since these operations take several seconds to complete we defer execution until the user specifically requests them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS</head><p>We have implemented the algorithms described in Section III in two prototype systems for weather and climate simulation analysis. This demonstrates the flexibility of our component-based approach. In this section we describe briefly the purpose and system architecture of each prototype. Working memory is not a major concern for either system: including OS overhead, our prototypes ran in under 300MB of RAM.</p><p>The SREF Weather Explorer application permits ensemble analysis of a single instance of the NOAA Short-Term Reference Ensemble Forecast (SREF) data set. Since the SREF simulates weather conditions only in a region surrounding North America it lends itself to 2D display. This prototype incorporates 2D summary views, a filmstrip view, an ensemble consensus view using condition queries, spaghetti plots and trend charts, a screenshot of which can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The visualization algorithms in SREF Weather Explorer are implemented as filters in VTK <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, a well-known opensource toolkit for scientific visualization. The user interface components were implemented as Qt widgets <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. We plan to release these components as open source late in 2009.</p><p>We used standard relational databases as the storage engine for the SREF ensemble data. This allowed our application to offload the task of storage management and thus run identically on machines ranging from a five-year-old dual-processor Linux workstation to a Mac Pro with two 4-core processors and 16GB of local memory. By using VTK's modules for database connectivity we were able to switch between different database instances with no additional effort. These included one full 36GB run of the SREF ensemble stored on a 56node Netezza parallel database appliance as well as a 5.5GB subset of the ensemble stored in a MySQL instance running on a single-processor laptop. From the user's perspective, the only difference was the hostname entered during application startup. Climate scientists use a variety of special data formats and have domain specific requirements not common in general scientific visualization tools. The Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) has developed a suite of Climate Data Analysis Tools (CDAT), specifically tailored for this community, and available at http://www2pcmdi.llnl.gov/cdat. ViSUS, our prototype, integrates into the CDAT infrastructure by providing a lightweight and portable advanced visualization library based on an out of core streaming data model. ViSUS is developed to address the specific needs of climate researchers, and as such has specialized features such as projecting the data onto a model of the Earth, masking out land and ocean, and enhancing the visualizations with geospatial information such as satellite images and geographic boundaries. The algorithms contained in ViSUS are implemented in C++, OpenGL and Python, and the system uses FLTK for user interaction. A screenshot of the ViSUS system can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this article we have presented an approach to ensemble visualization using a federation of statistical representations that, when used in combination, provide an adaptable tool for the discovery and evaluation of simulation outcomes. The complexity of the ensemble data is mitigated by the flexible organization offered by our approach and the coordination between views allows data analysts to focus on the formulation and evaluation of hypothesis in ensemble data. The strengths of our approach include little or no preprocessing cost, low memory overhead through reliance on queryable out-of-core storage and easy extension and adaptability to new domains and new techniques. We have demonstrated Ensemble-Vis in two different software prototypes that allow the analysis of large data sets with hardware requirements easily met by present-day laptops.</p><p>We see three principal directions for future research. First, our methods are specialized for 2-and 2.5-dimensional data. An approach to 3D data sets must address the classic problems of clutter and occlusion. We might be able to exploit the observed tendency of the amount of ensemble variation to change relatively slowly in space and time. Second, we need better methods for the display of mean and standard deviation. Here we will exploit the use of standard deviation as an approximate indicator of ensemble disagreement instead of a precise scalar variable. Finally, we will expand our methods to gracefully handle non-normal, multimodal and higher dimensional probability distributions. This will require runtime characterization of the shape of a distribution, perhaps including automatic model fitting and trend charts that show histograms as well as summary statistics and ensemble members.</p><p>The rapid increase in computational capacity over the past decade has rendered ensemble data sets a viable tool for mitigating uncertainty and exploring parameter and input sensitivity. Visualization and data analysis tools are needed to help domain scientists understand not only the general outcome of the data, but also the underlying distribution of members contributing to that outcome. We believe that Ensemble-Vis constitutes early progress toward the many new challenges posed by these large, complex and rich data sets.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
