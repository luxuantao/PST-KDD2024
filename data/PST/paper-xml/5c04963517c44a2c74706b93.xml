<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, different optimization algorithm are used for solving the real engineering problems. These methods have been inspired by the natural facts. Unlike classical algorithms, these algorithms are useful in solving optimization problems that are non-differentiable and non-continues. The principles applied in most of the meta-heuristic algorithms have been obtained by studying the behavior of the creatures in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> For example: artificial bee colony optimization (ABC) algorithm is based on colony behavior of the bees <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm that simulates the actual behavior of ants <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) emulates the behavior of humpback whales in hunting <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the cuckoo search optimization algorithm was inspired by the parasitic life of some cuckoo bird species in nesting and laying to solve optimization problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is one of the swarm intelligence methods that its principles follow social behavior of animals such as fish and bird <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Having two features of exploration and exploitation and the balance between these two features in a meta-heuristic algorithm will empower the algorithm to find the global optimum. In the exploration stage, the algorithm attempts to search the space for finding the new response. In fact, in this phase, the chance of the determining the global optimum is increased. But, in the exploitation phase, the algorithm searches neighborhood of the highest quality solution that obtained so far and chooses the best solution. The optimization algorithm with the best efficiency has two features as follows: in the inception of the process of finding the optimal solution, has the exploration ability and in the final stages of the optimization process, has the exploitation ability.</p><p>The principles of the PSO optimization algorithm are based on population, motion and intelligence of individuals. In fact, this algorithm creates new solutions for optimization problems using the concept of the swarm intelligence. The number of adjustable parameters in this algorithm is low and as a result, implementation of this algorithm is very simple. These features have attracted researchers in recent years in various scientific fields and engineering issues, such as function optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, aircraft wing design <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, rotating machinery fault detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> , signal de-noising <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, controller design <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and nonlinear system identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, etc. However, various studies show that in addition to the advantages of the PSO algorithm, there are two main difficulties in this algorithm: 1) trapping in the local minimum instead of finding newer solutions and improving them and 2) early convergence. To overcome these problems, various types of particle swarm optimization algorithm have been developed. Shi and Eberhart <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> found that by changing the value of the inertia weight in the particle velocity equation, the global search ability for the PSO algorithm is increased and high quality solutions are generated. In the proposed method in this paper, the value of the inertia weight linearly decreases from 0.9 to 0.4 during the optimization process. Ratnaweera et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> introduced a new method based on the concept "self-organizing hierarchical particle swarm optimizer with time varying acceleration coefficients (HPSO-TVAC). In the HPSO-TAVC method, the new velocity of each particle is calculated without considering the previous velocity vector term. Then, if the new calculated velocity is equal to zero, in this case, the velocity of the particle is generated with a time varying reinitialization velocity strategy. In other words, in their proposed method, the velocity of each particle is estimated based on the "social" part and the "cognitive" part of that particle. Ziyu and Dingxue <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> introduced time varying acceleration coefficients with exponential behavior (TACPSO) for providing the balance between two capabilities in the PSO algorithm: producing the new solutions and converging to global solution. Their work results indicate the relative success of the TACPSO algorithm in finding the global optima of the problems. Bao and Mao <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> suggested asymmetrical time-varying coefficients for improving the global search ability of the PSO algorithm and avoidance of the early convergence. It has been observed that this approach is superior to those methods that emphasize the use of symmetrical time-varying coefficients. Mirjalili et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> proposed a new developed method of the PSO algorithm called autonomous groups particles swarm optimization (AGPSO). The main purpose of this method is to increase the diversity of solutions in the search space using the concept of autonomous groups inspired by the diversity of individuals in the natural colonies. To achieve this goal in the AGPSO method, three different types of the PSO algorithm called AGPSO1, AGPSO2 and AGPSO3 are developed. For each of these algorithms, four different strategies have been proposed to describe the dynamic behavior of the learning coefficients. In each of these strategies, the acceleration coefficients have incremental and decreasing behavior, and these behaviors are described using polynomial, exponential, and logarithmic functions. The results of this strategy show that the AGPSO method is superior than other optimization methods in terms of the overall search capability and the avoidance of premature convergence particularly for problems with high dimension. Ciu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> designed three different nonlinear settings to further investigate the potential advantages among two parameters; cognitive and social learning factors. Simulation results demonstrate that their proposed method performed in an effective manner especially for multimodel functions. Mahmoodabadi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> combined the PSO algorithm with new convergence and divergence operator (CDPSO) for producing a new particle, increasing the convergence of particles and avoiding of trapping in the local minima. They proved that this algorithm has very well performance in solving the complex optimization problems. Mortazavi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> introduced a new method that called integrated particle swarm optimization (iPSO). The iPSO method applies an improved Fly back technique and the concept of the weighted particle for enhancing the standard PSO method.</p><p>In many studies to improve the optimization results, researchers have used the ability of the PSO in local search and the ability of various algorithms in global search and have presented different hybrid methods. For instance, PSO-ant colony optimization (ACO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, hybrid PSO and GA <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, PSO gravitational search algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, hybrid PSO and dragonfly algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, PSO-multi crossover operator of GA and bee colony mechanism (HEPSO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>To increase the diversity of the solutions obtained by PSO and solve the problem of early convergence and stuck in the local minimum, in some past researches, the authors combined the PSO algorithm with Levy flight. Levy flight uses the Levy distribution instead of uniform Gaussian distribution as a mechanism to generate the step sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Levy flight, with small steps, enables the optimization algorithm to search around the current solutions. In addition, large jumps, which are occasionally produced by Levy flight, help to prevent the optimization algorithm from getting stuck in the local minimum. Recently, researchers have used Levy flight distribution to develop their algorithms, such as: Cuckoo search (CS) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, dragonfly algorithm (DA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, Levy flight based grey wolf optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, Levy ant colony optimization algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm with Levy flight <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, and etc.</p><p>Given that Levy flight strengthens the global search ability of original PSO algorithm. Levy flight can be used to increase the exploration capability of the PSO algorithm. Hence, in recent years, methods have been proposed based on the combination of PSO and Levy flight such as RPSOLF <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, LFPSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, and PSOLF <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>In this study, the PSOSCALF algorithm is proposed for solving the disadvantages of the original PSO algorithm. This algorithm is based on combination of the PSO with the position updating equations of the SCA optimization method <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and Levy flight. The SCA optimization algorithm is one of the population based algorithms that recently has been proposed for solving the optimization problems. In this algorithm, each new solution is computed using the characteristics of sine and cosine functions and the absolute value of the distance between the current solution and the best member of the population that obtained so far. Oscillating behavior and varying the value of these trigonometric functions enable this algorithm for producing the exploration and exploitation capabilities. Therefore, the combination of Levy distribution and the SCA mechanism allows the design space to be searched further to find optimal solution. In the proposed PSOSCALF method, similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, an index or limit value is considered for each particle. This index shows the number of iterations regarded the position of the particle which is not improved. If the position of the particle does not improve at the end of each iteration, this limit increases by 1 for the particle. If the calculated limit value exceeds a predetermined value, the new position of the particle is obtained by the new combination of SCA and Levy flight. Otherwise, the position of the particle will be updated by the PSO. The results show that the combination of SCA relationships and Levy flight with PSO effectively overcomes the proposed PSOSCALF method has been evaluated using the test functions with high dimensions and real constrained engineering problems. Also, the comparison with other PSO variants and other optimization methods has been done. The results show that in most cases, the proposed method has a much better performance.</p><p>The next sections of this article are as follows: In Section 2, fundamentals of the PSO optimization algorithm is described. In the third and fourth sections, the SCA optimization algorithm and the Levy flight are presented. The description of the details of the proposed PSOSCALF algorithm is given in Section 5. In Sections 6 and 7, the ability of the proposed algorithm to optimize the benchmark functions is investigated and compared with the PSO family algorithms and other algorithms. The ability of the PSOSCALF method to solve the engineering problems in Section 8 has been evaluated. Finally, this paper is concluded in Section 9.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Particle Swarm O ptimization</head><p>The fundamental principles of the particle swarm optimization algorithm have been derived from studying the social life of the fishes and birds that live in groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In this technique, each particle is a solution to the desired optimization problem and moves using its the velocity and position vectors in the design space to find a new solution. In this study, the vectors and indicate the velocity and position of each particle in the search space for a d-dimensional problem, respectively.</p><p>In the early stages of implementing this algorithm, firstly, the position and velocity vectors of all particles are generated randomly. Then, each particle moves in the design space using the best position experienced by that particle (</p><p>) and the best solution obtained by all particles ( ). The updating equations of the velocity and position for each particle are as follows: <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(1 )<label>(2 )</label></formula><p>Where and are velocity and position vectors of particle i at iterations t +1 respectively. and are personal learning factor and social learning factor respectively. and are random number in the interval [0,1].</p><p>As seen in Eq. 1, the motion of each particle in the design space is affected by three terms: the previous velocity vector, the second part of the velocity vector that component and directs the particle towards the best solution experienced by the particle itself in the search space, and particle towards the best solution obtained by all particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>Shi and Eberhat <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> added the inertia weight parameter to the velocity updating equation in the PSO algorithm for investigating the effect of the previous velocity on the movement of a particle. Large values of the inertial weight lead to a global search and small value of this factor makes local search <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Therefore, by changing the value of w, the search ability is dynamically adjustable. In this paper, the adaptive coefficient of the inertia weight proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> is used:</p><p>(3) w i and w f are the initial and final values of the weight factor respectively. t max is the maximum number of repetition, t is the current iteration number and k is a constant number that indicates the decreasing intensity of the weight factor.</p><p>During the optimization process, if c 1 and c 2 treat as the incremental and decreasing monotonic functions respectively, then, it leads to exploration capability at the beginning and exploitation capability in the final stages. In this paper, the following equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> in which c 1 linearly decreases and c 2 increases linearly have been used: (4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> Where c 1min and c 2min are the minimum values of personal and social learning factors respectively, and c 1max and c 2max are the maximum values of personal and social learning factors respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Sine Cosine A lgorithm (SC A)</head><p>In 2016, Mirjalili proposed a new population-based optimization algorithm called the Sine-Cosine algorithm (SCA) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> to solve the optimization problems. SCA produces several random solutions, and then approaches them to the optimal solution by means of equations that include sine and cosine functions. Of course, in these relationships, in addition to the features of these functions, the distance between the best member of the population and each of the solutions affects their movement. The SCA technique, which will be further described in its relationship, is capable of creating a balance between exploitation and exploration by employing far fewer operators than other algorithms. This approach applies the following relationships to update the solutions for both exploration and exploitation phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>:</p><p>(6) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> In above equations, and are the positions of current solution in the iterations t and t +1 respectively. Parameters and are random numbers and is the position of the best member of the population or destination point in the iteration t and | | is absolute value. By combining these two equations, position of the solution updates as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(8a) (8b)</formula><p>Where is a random value and operates as the switching factor between equations 8a and 8b. The parameters and are the four effective parameters in the SCA algorithm for determining the position of the new solution. The parameter specifies the next position of the solution that can be located in space between the current solution and the destination point ( , exploitation) or outside it ( , exploration). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, the following equation is proposed for the calculation of : <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> Where t and t max are the current iteration and the maximum iteration respectively, and a is constant number. In this article similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, a = 2 is considered.</p><p>The parameter , which is a random number in the interval [0, solution can be towards or outwards the destination point.</p><p>[0, 2] assigns a random weight to the destination point to determine the effect of this point on the distance definition <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>The periodic behavior of the sine and cosine trigonometric functions allows a solution to be generated around the other. This feature ensures the exploitation capability. On the other hand, if a new solution is generated outside of the space between the current solution and the best solution that obtained so far, then global search capability is generated during optimization. In the SAC algorithm, this ability is available by varying the value of sine and cosine functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">L evy flight</head><p>Recently, researchers have utilized Levy flight in different optimization techniques for producing the random step size in the design region <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Levy flight is one of the random processes with non-Gaussian distribution. This distribution is often in terms as where in this formula, parameter is an index in the interval (0, 2]. From a mathematical point of view, a simple form of mathematical formula for Levy flight distribution can be written as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>: <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> In this distribution, and s are transmission parameter and samples, respectively. Parameter is a parameter that controls scale of Levy flight distribution. Generally, the definition of Levy flight distribution in the Fourier transform form is expressed as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>: <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> Where is a scale parameter. The analytical form of this integral is can be calculated for a few exceptional cases of . The method of calculating the step length s is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> in detail. In the following, it will be discussed briefly. The step length s can be determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>:</p><p>Where u and v parameters in the above equation have Gaussian distribution and are obtained as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(13)<label>(14)</label></formula><p>Then, step size is calculated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> Here, stepsize is the step size in the search space, and the factor s is dependent on the dimension of the desired problem. Otherwise, Levy flight may have highly aggressive behavior and leads to generate new solutions outside of the design space <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. As will be explained in the next section, stepsize value will be added to the updating equations of the SCA algorithm for finding the position of the new particle. In other words, the Levy flight distribution is effective mathematical operator for producing the varied solutions in the design space and increasing the exploration capability of the PSO algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">T he Proposed PSOSC A L F A lgorithm</head><p>Although the PSO algorithm has the excellences of the high speed computation, the small number of parameters and the simplicity in implementation; it has two major deficiency as premature convergence and falling into the local minima. In recent studies such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, researchers introduced various versions of the PSO algorithm by merging the velocity and position updating equations in the PSO with Levy flight. As, the use of Levy flight leads to a more effective search in the search space with large jumps, various solutions are produced.</p><p>As described in Section 3, sine and cosine trigonometric functions and the parameters used in the SCA algorithm have features that provide exploration and exploitation capabilities for this algorithm. Here, In order to produce more varied solutions throughout the design space and increase the exploration capability of the SCA algorithm, Levy flight distribution is added to the SCA equations as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(16)<label>(17)</label></formula><p>In above equations, expression is added to the SCA relationships, and is calculated in the same way as the PSOLF method <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>: <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> Dimension of vector is equal to dimension of the desired optimization problem. stepsize is calculated by Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. is global optimum obtained so far and is element wise multiplication.</p><p>In this article, the new hybrid equations proposed in equations 16 and 17 are added to the PSO algorithm until all of particles to be able to better search the design space for detecting the global optima. In the new proposed algorithm, an index named "limit value" is assigned to each particle, similar to LFPSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. This index for each particle is equal to the number of iterations that the position of this particle is not improved. In other words, if the position of this particle does not get better at the end of each repetition in the design space, limit value for this particle is increased by one unit. Eventually, if the calculated limit value exceeds a predetermined value, a new position for this particle will be created by the combination of SCA and Levy flight.</p><p>The pseudo code related with the PSOSCALF algorithm is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. According to this figure, npop is population size, MaxIt is maximum iteration, X min and X max are the lower bound and upper bound in search space and dim is the dimension of the problems. These parameters are set at the beginning of the proposed algorithm. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the position and velocity of particles are initially generated randomly. Then, by calculating the value of the objective function, is determined for each particle and for the entire population. In each iteration, the value of the parameters c 1 , c 2 and w are calculated utilizing Eqs. (3) to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Before updating the vector of the velocity of each particle, the limit value of that particle is checked. If it is smaller than the predetermined value, the velocity and position of the particle are updated by Eqs. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and (2) in the simple PSO. Otherwise, the next position of that particle is determined by Eqs. ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, which are a combination of the SCA algorithm and Levy flight. In this case, a random value is assigned to that particle. If rand () &lt;0.5, the particle position is computed by Eq. ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>), and if rand ()&gt; 0.5, the position of the particle is calculated by Eq. ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>). The new obtained position should be in the range (X min , X max ). If it exceeds this range, it will be taken by the following operators to the range (X min , X max ): <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> X= min(X, X max ) X = max(X, X min ) -Initialize the parameters (npop, MaxIt, X min , X max, dim ) -trial (keeps the limit value for each particles) = 0 -Initialize the particles with random positions (X i ) and random velocity (V i ) within initialization range in the problem space -Evaluate the fitness -Set X i to be X pBest -Set the particle with best fitness to be X gBest for t = 1:MaxIt Calculation of c 1 (t), c 2 (t) and w(t) for i = 1:npop if trial(i)&lt;limit Update the velocity V i of particle using Eq.

In the next step, objective function is determined for all new particles. Then, objective value of each new particle is compared with its personal best experience (</p><p>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Result and Discussion</head><p>Using benchmark functions with different features is a common method for evaluating optimization algorithms with stochastic nature. By using these functions, it can be ensured that the results of an algorithm are not accidental. So far, researchers have used several benchmark functions with different characteristics to evaluate their algorithms. In this section, we first introduce the test functions used in this work and then, to evaluate the PSOSCALF algorithm, the results of this algorithm are compared with the results of the various versions of the PSO algorithm (Section 6.3) and the other algorithms (Section 6.4).</p></div>

Finally, according to the mathematical formula of the fixed-dimension multimodal functions given in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, there are two points about these functions: first, the number of the design variables of these function cannot be changed, and second, the search space for these functions is different with multimodal functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Comparison of PSOSC A L F and PSO Families</head><p>Here, to evaluate the PSOSCALF algorithm, the results of this approach are compared with various versions of the PSO algorithm. For this purpose, the examination functions presented in Tables 2-4 are used. The PSO family algorithms that their results are reported in this study, are: PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, HPSO-TAVC <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, TACPSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, MPSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, AGPSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, HEPSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, RPSOLF <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and LFPSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Since meta-heuristic algorithms have stochastic nature, their results might be unreliable for just one run. Therefore, for the comparison of all algorithms with each other, the results for 30 independent runs are presented in Appendix A for benchmark functions introduced. In each run, the initial population is randomly assigned.</p><p>To compare these algorithms with each other in finding the optimum solution of a specific benchmark function, the results from different runs are reported as statistical characteristics, mean, standard deviation and algorithm rank in Tables A.1-A.3. The ranking of these algorithms is based on their competency in statistical results, namely, the mean and standard deviation which are presented in Tables A.1 to A.3. In these tables, the best mean and best standard deviation and the algorithm rank for each benchmark function are shown in bold.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.1.">Investigation of E xploitation and E xploration C apabilities</head><p>In this article, by examining the results of minimizing the unimodal functions, the ability of various algorithms to exploit the solutions in the search space has been evaluated. The results for these functions are presented in Of course, the proposed method in the F10 also ranked second. Therefore, the preference of the proposed method in this paper is clearly recognizable. The RPSOLF method has the first rank in F9, F10, and F11, and in both cases F9 and F11 are similar to those proposed in this paper. Nevertheless, RPSOLF ranked 8 in F8 and 7 in F12 and 9 in F13, ranked fourth among all methods. The standard deviation values for all functions imply that the PSOSCALF method is stable for various runs.</p><p>Results for functions (F14-F23) are presented in Table A.3. As can be seen, the HPSO-TAVC method is not first rank in any of the functions. The proposed PSOSCALF method is first rank for the five functions F16, F18, F21, F22 and F23, and is third rank for F14 and F17 and is fifth rank for F19 and F20. On the other hand, in the cases where the PSOSCALF method is not ranked 1, the results of most methods are very close. All of these points indicate the superiority of the proposed algorithm to the other methods discussed in this paper. The second and third ranks belong to the HEPSO and MPSO algorithms, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.2.">A nalysis of Convergence Behavior</head><p>If at the beginning of the optimization process, the particles explore whole the design area for producing the various solutions and then gradually converge to near the best solution, this behavior will guarantee the ability of the algorithm to find the global optimization. To investigate the behavior of the PSOSCALF technique in all optimization stages, the fluctuations of the first dimension in the first particle are provided in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. These curves are obtained for functions F1, F3, F7, F10, F13 and F18. As it is seen, at the beginning of all the curves, there are severe fluctuations and then these fluctuations are reduced. The fact is that this particle initially explores the design space and then converges around the best solution.</p><p>F ig 3 Trajectory of the first dimension in the first particle when solving the benchmark functions</p><p>On the other hand, it is obvious that by studying the behavior of the first particle and observing its recovery, it cannot be concluded that the positions of all particles in all stages of optimization are improving. Therefore, in order to investigate the behavior of all the particles during the optimization process, the average fitness of all solutions is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">4</ref>. Results are obtained for F1, F3, F7, F10, F13 and F18 functions. As can be seen, for all functions exception of F18, in the exploration phase, the high fluctuations are occurred and then gradually are decreased, and finally, in the exploitation phase, the value of the average fitness has very few changes. But this is not true for F18. Maybe at first glance, by observing the fluctuations of the F18 function in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">4</ref>, it is concluded that the PSOSCALF methods is inefficient in determining the global optima of this function. But according to the results of the function F18 in Table <ref type="table">A</ref>.3, it is clearly seen that the PSOSCALF algorithm is able to determine the global optima for this function. To justify these two observations, we can point to the presence of particles that try to move in the search space during the optimization process to find the global optimum. In Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, the convergence results are plotted for unimodal functions. As shown in this figure, RPSOLF method procures global optimum 0 for three functions F1, F3 and F4 and attains near optimal solution for F2. On the other hand, other methods improve the solutions for these functions continuously and PSOSCALF method provides better results. Convergence curve for F6 shows that all methods do not improve solution and stuck in local optimum.</p><p>Given the curves for functions F5 and F7, the convergence behavior of the methods used in this paper is similar to together, with the difference that the PSOSCALF method improves solutions to a less value. The curves for the F5, F6 and F7 functions indicate the exploitation capability for the proposed method in the final stages of optimization.</p><p>In Figs. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, the convergence behavior of different methods for functions F8 to F23 is presented. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> show that the RPSOLF method converges and acquires the global optimum of 0 for F8, F9 and F11 at 11300, 43600 and 48950 FEs respectively. Also, the proposed PSOSCALF method reaches optimum solution 0 for F9 and F11 at 2350 and 5750 FEs respectively. Convergence curves in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> show that all of the methods get stuck in local minima for F10, F12 and F13 functions. Given the convergence behavior of function F10, it can be seen that the PSOSCALF algorithm achieves better result than other methods at 63550 FEs. By investigating F12 function, it is observed that the PSOSCALF and LFPSO methods improve solution in finding the optimal solution of this function and converge to near optimal solution at 97600 and 182400 FEs respectively.</p><p>By preliminary review of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, it can be seen that the convergence behavior of the methods used in this paper for fixed-dimension multimodal functions is very similar to each other. By a closer investigation of the convergence curves, it can be seen that the PSOSCALF method obtains global optimum for F14 to F23 at 14100, 59400, 12050, 19800, 15650, 8650, 26500, 36500, 36300, 33200 and 39000 FEs respectively. The LFPSO method acquires optimum results for F14 and F16 to F23 at 6400, 27150, 25400, 305500, 22550, 37100, 71700 and 36150 FEs respectively. On the other hand, this method does not carry out well for function F15 and gets stuck in local minimum. According to above results, the proposed method has better convergence rate than the LFPSO method in seven functions among all functions F14-F23. Another point that can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> is that the MPSO and PSO methods are able to obtain optimum value for only four functions F16 to F19. These methods get stuck in local minimum for rest of examination functions.</p><p>Above analysis and Figs. <ref type="figure">5</ref><ref type="figure">6</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>show that the methods PSOSCALF, RPSOLF, LFPSO, MPSO and PSO are able to achieve global optimum at thirteen, nine, seven, six and four functions respectively. It is seen from the investigation of the convergence behavior of the benchmark functions that in cases where the proposed method is able to determine the optimal solution, this method has a good convergence rate and achieves optimal results quickly. Finally, the results and above explanations prove that the new hybrid algorithm presented in this article is able to determine the global minima or near optimal solution in most benchmark functions and has superiority over different methods.</p></div>

Some of these algorithms have been developed by researchers recently.</p><p>The methods used here are: GA, WOA <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, DA <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, SCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, ALO <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, FA <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, MFO <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> and MVO <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. The results for the functions presented in Tables 2-4 are calculated. The parameters of the PSOSCALF algorithm are the same as the parameters in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. For all algorithms, the maximum iteration is MaxIt = 500, the population size is npop = 50. The above algorithms are composed of operators that produce random solutions in the design space. Therefore, in this paper, in order to have accurate interpretation of the performance of these algorithms, these methods to be run 30 times for optimizing each benchmark function and the results are reported in Appendix B in Tables B.1 B.3 as stochastic terms: mean, standard deviation and algorithm rank. Finally, the best solution of the benchmark functions is specified in bold.</p><p>According to Table <ref type="table">B</ref>.1, the WOA algorithm has the best results for both F1 and F2 and the proposed PSOSCALF algorithm is ranked second for these two functions. But, the results of the optimization of F3 to F7 functions indicate the superiority of the PSOSCALF algorithm compared to other methods. Therefore, by investigating the results presented in Table <ref type="table">B</ref>.1 and observing the final rank of these algorithms, it is concluded that the PSOSCALF method is more efficacious than other methods in finding the global optima of unimodal functions.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">B</ref>.2 presents results for multimodal functions. As it can be seen, the proposed method is comparable to WOA for finding the global optimum of F9 and F11 functions. Also, the PSOSCALF method finds the best solution for the rest of the multimodal functions except F10. In Table <ref type="table">B</ref>.3, the results are presented for fixed-dimension multimodal functions. As seen in this table, the PSOSCALF method performs better than other algorithms in achieving the minimum of five functions F15, F16, F21, F22 and F23. For example, the optimal values obtained by other methods for F21, F22 and F23 functions are far from the actual optimal of these functions.</p><p>According to the results of Tables B.1-B.3, it can be observed from the final rank of all algorithms that the proposed PSOSCALF method is an extremely effective and efficient algorithm for optimizing multimodal and unimodal functions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6.5.</head><p>The statistical parameters such as mean and standard deviation are appropriate for general investigation of the ability of the optimization algorithms. In this section, in order to determine that the obtained results in previous sections are not stochastic, different nonparametric statistical tests such as Wilcoxon's test can be used. In here, Wilcoxon's rank sum test is selected for determining whether there is a statistical significance difference between the results of the PSOSCALF technique and other optimization algorithms. This non parametric test is implemented for the results of 30 independent runs at significance level C.1 and C.2 in terms of P-value, h-value and z-value of PSOSCALF with other PSO variants and other algorithms are presented in Tables C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> and C.2, respectively. The term of N/A means that both algorithms are successful in determining optimal point of a specific function in all the runs and statistical Wilcoxon test is not applicable. By investigating the results in Tables C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> and C.2, The following observations can be found:</p><p>-The MFO method and all of the PSO family algorithms except HEPSO are successful in finding the optimal point of function F17 in all the runs and the statistical test is not enforceable.</p><p>-The values of P-value in Tables C.1 and C rmance is better compared with other PSO variants algorithms and other algorithms for unimodal functions F1-F7 and multimodal functions F8-F13 (except F9). In other words, these test values indicate that there is a significance difference between the PSOSC . -From the obtained results in Tables C.1 and C.2, it can be seen that for some fixed dimension multimodal functions, performance of the proposed method is not significant better compared to other PSO family algorithms such as PSO, HPSO-TVAC, TACPSO, MPSO, AGPSO, HEPSO and LFPSO. The same results can be seen for GA, DA and MFO algorithms. -For all the benchmark functions F1-F23, the results of the PSOSCALF algorithm are significantly better than SCA, ALO, FA and MVO algorithms in all the runs. From the above, it can be concluded that the results of proposed method tend to be significantly better than the considered algorithms in here for most benchmark functions.</p></div>

The result of optimizing this function is to find the design parameters that are: face weight (b), module of teeth (m), number of teeth on pinion (z), the length of shaft 1 between bearings (l 1 ), the length of shaft 2 between bearings (l 2 ). This problem has a nonlinear objective function and nine non-linear inequalities and equalities that are formulated as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>: Consider The results of this optimization problem by using the PSOSCALF technique and different optimization methods are reported in Table <ref type="table">9</ref>. The superiority of the obtained design with PSOSCALF technique in comparison with other optimization methods is seen clearly in this table. On the other hand, the solutions obtained by TAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> and SBS <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> methods violated the constraints and are infeasible. Therefore, CS method is ranked second. 7.6. T russ Design Problem with T hree-Bar One of the famous problems in the design of engineering structures, especially in civil engineering, is the three -bar truss design problem. The objective function is to minimize the truss weight so that it does not violate the tension, deformation and buckling constraints. In other words, this fitness function is equivalent to determine the optimal values for crosssections of A 1 and A 2 , taking into account the constraints. Parameters related to this problem are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">13</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7.8.Inverse Shape Design in Fluid Flow Problems</head><p>As the last classical test case, in this subsection, the PSOSCALF method is applied for inverse shape design of a typical cylinder and a symmetric airfoil in external flow problems. The shape design problem process is performed in the context of incompressible, in viscid (ideal) flow in terms of secondary variables, i.e. stream function. In this state, the governing equation is expressed as: <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> A general schematic of the problem and the auxiliary boundary conditions are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">15a</ref>.

A schematic of employed computational quadrilateral structured grids is depicted in </p><p>Here, the method is applied by a so-called reproduction procedure in which the target geometry is already known. In other words, as the first problem, the governing equation in a physical domain containing cylinder is solved. The tangential velocity around the surface of the cylinder is saved as target function. In the next step, the target function is introduced to the PSOSCALF method to find to corresponding geometry. Results are provided in Fig. <ref type="figure">16a</ref>. As it can be seen, the employed PSOSCALF method has captured the target geometry i.e. a cylinder with radius equal to 1.5 (r=1.5) in excellent agreement. Note that, due to symmetrical geometry, the shape reproduction procedure is carried out for half of the body by 31 radius as 31 design variables which could vary between , i=1,2,..,31.</p><p>As the second problem, the PSOSCALF method is applied for NACA0012 airfoil inverse shape design. Similar to the previous test case, tangential velocity distribution along the surface of the NACA0012 airfoil is introduced to the PSOSCALF method. In this case, instead of radius, the thickness of the different parts of the airfoil is considered as design variables. Results of the inverse design is reported in Fig. <ref type="figure">16b</ref>. NACA0012 airfoil with chord length equal to 5 (C=5) and thickness equal to 0.5 (th =0.5) is considered as target geometry.</p><p>It is evident that the PSOSCALF method performance in capturing the target geometry in this case is greatly acceptable. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusion</head><p>In this study, in order to solve the famous weakness points of PSO algorithm of early convergence and being trapped in the local minimum, the PSO algorithm was combined with the position updating equations of the SCA algorithm and the Levy flight, and a new approach called PSOSCALF was created. Then, the PSOSCALF performance was compared with the other PSO variants and the famous algorithms proposed in recent years. For this purpose, 23 benchmark functions and 8 nonlinear constrained problems were used. In this study, unimodal and multimodal test functions were used. The evaluation of the results of the optimization of the benchmark functions showed that the PSOSCALF method has an appropriate convergence rate and is more successful in most of the functions in finding the global optima than other algorithms. In fact, by utilizing the benefits of the SCA method and Levy flight, two features are created in the new approach in this article:</p><p>1) The formation of equilibrium between the two phases of exploration and exploitation, which leads to improve the convergence behavior of the PSO optimization algorithm. 2) Increasing the global search capability and the probability of finding the global optima.</p><p>On the other hand, the results of the design engineering problems showed that the PSOSCALF algorithm has a high performance in the unknown search space. In fact, these results prove the capability of the PSOSCALF approach in optimizing the real constrained problems and discrete problems with different characteristics.</p><p>Appendix A.
