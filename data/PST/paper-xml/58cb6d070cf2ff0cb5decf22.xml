<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification has become a popular research topic in recent years, and effective feature extraction is an important step before the classification task. Traditionally, spectral feature extraction techniques are applied to the HSI data cube directly. This paper presents a novel algorithm for HSI feature extraction by exploiting the curvelettransformed domain via a relatively new spectral feature processing technique-singular spectrum analysis (SSA). Although the wavelet transform has been widely applied for HSI data analysis, the curvelet transform is employed in this paper since it is able to separate image geometric details and background noise effectively. Using the support vector machine classifier, experimental results have shown that features extracted by SSA on curvelet coefficients have better performance in terms of classification accuracy over features extracted on wavelet coefficients. Since the proposed approach mainly relies on SSA for feature extraction on the spectral dimension, it actually belongs to the spectral feature extraction category. Therefore, the proposed method has also been compared with some state-of-the-art spectral feature extraction techniques to show its efficacy. In addition, it has been proven that the proposed method is able to remove the undesirable artifacts introduced during the data acquisition process. By adding an extra spatial postprocessing step to the classified map achieved using the proposed approach, we have shown that the classification performance is comparable with several recent spectral-spatial classification methods.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>H YPERSPECTRAL imaging (HSI) sensors, which capture hundreds of continuous bands in a broad spectral range covering visible, near-infrared, and beyond, play an important role in many research areas, including applications in food quality control and analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, pharmaceuticals <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, computerbased forensics and security <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, as well as planet surface investigation such as Mars <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In addition to these applications, one of the most active areas of HSI is remote sensing, where researchers develop diverse algorithms based on it, e.g., target detection for military surveillance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, data compression for faster transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and surface and data classification for land-cover analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. However, due to the characteristics of HSI, data redundancy is inevitable. Furthermore, for remote sensing HSI, noise could be involved during the process of data acquisition and transmission. Therefore, effective feature extraction and denoising of HSI data is necessary for remote sensing applications, particularly for supervised classification problems as discussed in this paper.</p><p>Feature extraction could be considered as a linear or nonlinear data transformation. Several unsupervised and supervised feature extraction methods have been proposed by researchers, including the most widely used principal component analysis (PCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, along with other approaches such as independent component analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, minimum noise fraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and singular value decomposition (SVD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The aforementioned approaches not only extract features but also could reduce the dimensionality of HSI data. Other alternatives exist for supervised feature extraction without reducing data dimensionality, such as spectral curve fitting of hyperspectral image bands <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Additionally, an impressive technique, which is called singular spectrum analysis (SSA), has recently demonstrated its ability in effective feature extraction for HSI data. SSA is a great improvement in terms of potential classification accuracy compared with another popular technique, namely, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Rather than reducing the dimensionality, SSA 'smooths' the spectral profile of HSI data so that effective features can be extracted and classification accuracy can be improved accordingly.</p><p>It is assumed that directly applying denoising techniques on the original image could probably remove fine features and noise at the same time, which is undesirable for following applications. To avoid this problem, the multiscale wavelettransform-based approaches are widely used for image denoising, where the transform decomposes the image into a set of wavelet coefficients at different decomposition levels, and noise in the low-energy channels of the transformed domain can be removed. A famous algorithm called soft thresholding in the wavelet domain was proposed by Donoho in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. By removing small coefficients under a certain threshold and shrinking large coefficients, most unwanted noise can be easily discarded. For HSI data, Othman and Qian proposed a hybrid spatial-spectral derivative-domain wavelet shrinkage approach based on soft thresholding <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. This algorithm works in the spectral derivative domain, in which the noise level is elevated and signal regularity is dissimilar in the spatial and spectral domains of HSI data. Recently, Chen and Qian combined feature extraction and denoising, leading to a more effective denoising method for HSI data using PCA and wavelet shrinkage <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In this approach, first, PCA transform is performed on the HSI data, and then, a 2-D bivariate wavelet thresholding method is used to remove noise for low-energy PCA channels.</p><p>In this paper, we are also aiming at combining ideas of feature extraction and denoising together for improving classification accuracy of remote sensing hyperspectral images. This work is inspired by that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> where the curvelet transform is applied to HSI data, and the representation of noise-free signals in the curvelet domain is predicted using multiple linear regression (MLR), which is a regression that has been previously used for noise analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Although the wavelet transform has been widely applied for image denoising, many studies have concluded that the wavelet transform cannot provide a good representation of anisotropic singularity, such as curves or edges in the image <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. For this reason, soft-thresholding directional curvelet coefficients that match image edges could achieve better noise reduction effect than the coefficients obtained in the wavelet domain. It has been proven that the curvelet transform could represent piecewise-linear contours on multiple scales through a few significant coefficients, leading to a better separation between geometric details and background noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Therefore, the curvelet transform is a good candidate for image denoising and enhancement. After the curvelet transform, the coefficients of two adjacent bands still maintain the correlation similarity of the original HSI data <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, which means spectral processing techniques could then be applied in the curvelet domain. Feature extraction by MLR in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> is achieved by estimating the noise-free band by using all pixels in adjacent bands at the same time, while more accurate spectral feature extraction is proposed to be achieved by applying the aforementioned SSA to each pixel. The denoising performance in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> is then assessed by adding noise to the original HSI data and comparing the mean square errors and the mean structural similarity between the original data and denoised data, where the classification performance on the denoised image is unknown. We therefore adopt the curvelet transform instead of the wavelet transform in our approach and combine SSA to extract effective spectral features in the curvelet domain to improve classification accuracy for remote sensing hyperspectral images. This paper is organized as follows: The theory of the curvelet transform and SSA is introduced in Section II. The proposed denoising and feature extraction approach applied on HSI data is given in Section III. Section IV introduces the experimental setup, including data sets, the classifier, and tuning of optimal parameters. Results and analysis are presented in Section V. Conclusions are drawn in Section VI.</p></div>

BACKGROUND PRINCIPLES</head><p>In this section, the theory of the curvelet transform and SSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, which will be used in the following sections, is reviewed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Curvelet Transform</head><p>Similar to the wavelet transform, the curvelet transform could also provide multiscale analysis on images. It was first proposed by Candes and Donoho in 1999, and their version is also called the first-generation curvelet transform <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. However, this transform is rather complicated and needs at least four steps to complete, including subband decomposition, smooth partitioning, renormalization, and ridgelet analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. A few years later, a simpler and faster version of the curvelet transform was developed, which is the second-generation transform called the fast discrete curvelet transform (FDCT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Two forms of FDCT with the same computational complexity were proposed by Candes et al., based on the unequally spaced fast Fourier transforms (USFFTs) and the wrapping of specially selected Fourier samples, respectively. The curvelet transform used here is the one based on USFFT.</p><p>Let us assume there is a pair of smooth, nonnegative, and real-valued windows called the radial window W (r) and the angular window V (t), such that W is supported on r ∈ (1/2, 2) and that V is supported on t ∈ [-1, 1]. These windows will always satisfy the admissibility conditions, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∞ j=-∞ W 2 (2 j r) = 1, r ∈ 3 4 , 3 2 (1) ∞ l=-∞ V 2 (t -l) = 1, t ∈ -1/2, 1 2 . (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>For each scale j, the frequency window U j is defined in the Fourier domain by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">U j (r, θ) = 2 -3j/4 W (2 -j r)V 2 [j/2] θ 2π<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where [j/2] is the integer part of j/2. Consequently, the support of U j is defined by the support of W and V , which will be a polar wedge. A mother curvelet waveform ϕ j (x) is defined related to U j (ω) (U j (r, θ) will be abbreviated as U j (ω)), where the Fourier transform of ϕ j is equal to U j . Thus, all curvelets of scale 2 -j can be acquired by rotations and translations of ϕ j , where the equispaced sequence of rotation angles is</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">θ l = 2π • 2 -[j/2] • l, with l = 0, 1, . . . such that 0 ≤ θ l &lt; 2π, and the sequence of translation parameters k = (k 1 , k 2 ) ∈ Z 2 .</formula><p>Then, we can have the curvelets at scale 2 -j , orientation θ l , and position x</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(j,l) k = R -1 θ l (k 1 • 2 -j , k 2 • 2 -j/2</formula><p>), defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ϕ j,l,k (x) = ϕ j R θ l x -x (j,l) k (4)</formula><p>where R θ is the rotation by θ radians, and R -1 θ is its inverse, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">R θ = cos θ sin θ -sin θ cos θ .

(<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><p>Our discussion of the digital curvelet transforms will always be in the frequency domain. Therefore, the curvelet coefficient could be reexpressed in the frequency domain using Plancherel's theorem, i.e., <ref type="figure">c(j,</ref><ref type="figure">l,</ref><ref type="figure">k</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_10">) := 1 (2π) 2 f (ω) φj,l,k (ω)dω = 1 (2π) 2 f (ω)U j (R θ l ω) e i x (j,l) k ,ω dω.<label>(7)</label></formula><p>In practice, instead of using the polar window defined in (3), it is more common to use Cartesian equivalents. The Cartesian frequency window is shown as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">U j (ω) := ψ j (ω 1 )V j (ω)<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where we define ψ(ω 1 ) = φ(ω 1 /2) 2φ(ω 1 ) 2 as a bandpass profile in ψ j (ω 1 )= ψ(2 -j ω 1 ) and V j (ω)= V (2 [j/2] ω 2 /ω 1 ) with V still obeying <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. By introducing the set of equispaced slopes tan θ l := l • 2 -[j /2] with l = -2 [j/2] , . . . , 2 [j/2] -1, for each θ l ∈ [-π/4, π/4), the Cartesian window can be rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">U j,l (ω) := ψ j (ω 1 )V j (S θ l ω) (9)</formula><p>where S θ is the shear matrix defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">S θ := 1 0 -tan θ 1 . (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>Similarly, curvelets should be redefined in Cartesian form as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">ϕ j,l,k (x) = 2 3j 4 ϕ j S T θ l x -S -T θ l b (11) with b := (k 1 • 2 -j , k 2 • 2 -j/2</formula><p>), where superscript T represents the transpose of the matrix.

SSA shares the same theoretical foundations as PCA. Both of them are able to decompose the original time series into a linear combination of a new orthogonal basis, which includes eigenvectors generated from the diagonalization of the data correlation matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The main capability of SSA is that it can decompose the original series into some interpretable components, such as the trend, oscillations, and unstructured noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The SSA algorithm consists of two stages including decomposition and reconstruction, and it is briefly explained as follows.</p><p>1) Decomposition: Assume that X is a nonzero 1-D series vector with length N , i.e., X = (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x N ). Given a window size L(1 &lt; L &lt; N), the original series X is mapped to K lagged vectors, X i = (x i , x i+1 , . . . , x i+L-1 ) T for i = 1, 2, . . . , K, where K = N -L + 1. The window size should be properly chosen depending on the application. Then, the trajectory matrix is formed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">T = X 1 X 2 • • • X K = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ x 1 x 2 • • • x K x 2 x 3 • • • x K+1 . . . . . . . . . . . . x L x L+1 • • • x N ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ . (<label>17</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_27">)</formula><p>It should be noted that the matrix T in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">17</ref>) is a Hankel matrix of size L × K, which means that its entries along the antidiagonals are equal.</p><p>The next step is to compute the SVD of trajectory matrix T. First, the eigenvalues of TT T are calculated and sorted in descending order, i.e., λ 1 ≥ λ 2 ≥ • • • ≥ λ L ≥ 0. Let the corresponding eigenvectors be (U 1 , U 2 , . . . , U L ), and the resulting trajectory matrix after SVD is shown as</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">T = T 1 + T 2 + • • • + T d (<label>18</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_29">)</formula><p>where d is the rank of T, <ref type="figure">,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>) is called the elementary matrix with rank 1, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">T i = √ λ i U i V T i (i = 1, 2, . . .</formula><formula xml:id="formula_31">V i = T T U i /</formula><p>√ λ i are often referred to as the principal components of matrix T. Generally, the contribution of the elementary matrix T i to the trajectory matrix T is determined by the ratio of each eigenvalue and the sum of all eigenvalues, as shown in the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">η i = λ i d i=1 λ i . (<label>19</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_33">)</formula><p>2) Reconstruction: The first step of reconstruction is grouping, where the set of indexes {1, 2, . . . , d} is divided into m disjoint subsets {I 1 , I 2 , . . . , I m }. Each I j (j = 1, 2, . . . , m) contains one or several elementary matrices T i , which are summed up within each group. Then, the resultant trajectory matrices can be computed for each group, and consequently, ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_28">18</ref>) is expanded as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">T = SVD T 1 + T 2 + • • • + T d = Grouping T I 1 + T I 2 + • • • + T I m . (<label>20</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_35">)</formula><p>The last step is diagonal averaging, which transforms each grouped matrix T I j into a new series with length N . This process is also known as Hankelization of the matrix T I j . Assume that Y 1 = (y 1 , y 2 , . . . , y N ) is the transformed 1-D series of T I 1 , then the elements in Y 1 can be calculated using <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> by averaging the corresponding diagonals of T I 1 , i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">y k = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ 1 k k j=1 y * j,k-j+1 , 1 ≤ k &lt; L * 1 L * L * j=1 y * j,k-j+1 , L * ≤ k ≤ K * 1 N -k+1 N -K * +1 j=k-K * +1 y * j,k-j+1 , K * &lt; k ≤ N (<label>21</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_37">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">L * = min(L, K), K * = max(L, K), y * j,k-j+1 refers to the elements in T I 1 , y * j,k-j+1 = y j,k-j+1 if L &lt; K, and y * j,k-j+1 = y k-j+1,j if L ≥ K.</formula><p>Then, the initial series X = (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x N ) is decomposed into m series, as shown in the following equation: Therefore, the original series vector could be reconstructed by only using the first or the first few groups generated from its eigenvalues, and the rest could be discarded as noise. For example, if the window size L is set as ten, reconstruction using the first three to five components should usually be enough to achieve a good denoising performance. However, there is no general rule for the grouping. Like the window size L, one can choose the eigenvalue grouping (EVG) value depending on the application. If all decomposed components are involved in the EVG, the reconstructed series will be the same as the original series.</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">X = Y 1 + Y 2 + • • • + Y m .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PROPOSED APPROACH: APPLYING SSA IN THE CURVELET DOMAIN</head><p>As briefly mentioned in Section I, the proposed denoising and feature extraction approach will be applied on hyperspectral images, and the flowchart is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for reference. Hyperspectral sensors have a relatively high spectral resolution and can generate hundreds of observation channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. The obtained 3-D HSI data cube can be regarded as a stack of 2-D images of the same scene corresponding to different wavelengths <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and the correlation between each two adjacent bands is fairly high. The first step of the proposed method is to perform the curvelet transform on each band of the hyperspectral image, and a few image stacks are generated after the transform as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. By applying the curvelet transform on each band, the band correlation property can be preserved so that SSA is able to exploit the spectral signature. The next step is to apply SSA in the spectral dimension for each detail image stack for feature extraction and denoising. After that, the denoised detail images at each band are gathered according to their original location, followed by the inverse curvelet transform to get the denoised hyperspectral image.</p><p>In this paper, a hyperspectral image is denoted as I(p, q) = (I 1 (p, q), I 2 (p, q), . . . , I B (p, q)) ∈ B , where p ∈ [1, P ], q ∈ [1, Q], P × Q is the spatial dimension of the hyperspectral image, and B is the number of bands.</p><p>represents the set of real numbers with the pixel intensity I b (p, q) at all sensor channels with b ∈ [1, B]. The 2-D curvelet transform via USFFT employed in this paper is completed using the toolbox CurveLab (version 2.1.2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Similar to the wavelet transform, the curvelet transform can also decompose the image into a coarse image and several detail images. Just like most image processing algorithms, the curvelet transform requires the processed image to be a square whose dimension is a power of 2. If the size of the original image is not a power of 2, pixels with a value of zero are padded to the next larger power of 2.</p><p>Given the zero-padded HSI data set, </p><formula xml:id="formula_41">I_pad(m, n) = (I_pad 1 (m, n), I_pad 2 (m, n), . . . , I_pad B (m, n)) where m, n ∈ [1, N],</formula><p>where CT stands for the discrete curvelet transform operation explained in Section II. The decomposition results of the transform can be regarded as a superposition in the following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">c D b = C b,J + J-1 j=1 W b,j<label>(24)</label></formula><p>where C b,J is the coarse version of the original band image with low-frequency contents, and W b,j stands for the detail band image at scale 2 -j containing high-frequency contents. With an N × N image, the default number of decomposition scales is J = log 2 (N ) -3 as set in the CurveLab toolbox. Take a band image with the size of 128 × 128 for instance, the number of decomposition scales J will be four. According to the settings in the toolbox, there are eight orientations of the curvelet in the second and third scales, starting from the top-left wedge and increasing in a clockwise fashion, but for the coarsest and finest scales, there is only one direction. Thus, ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_43">24</ref>) is rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">c D b = C b,J,1 + W b,1,1 + J-1 j=2 8 l=1 W b,j,l<label>(25)</label></formula><p>where W b,1,1 represents the finest scale with one orientation. The schematic of four decomposition scales corresponding to a 128×128 image is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. Then, after applying the curvelet transform to all bands, there will be a coarse image stack and 17 detail image stacks. As suggested by the commonly adopted wavelet denoising rule, noise is removed by thresholding only the wavelet coefficients of the detail subbands, while keeping the lowfrequency coefficients unchanged <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Therefore, in our approach, the coarse image stack stays unaltered as well. For each detail image stack, SSA is applied to the spectral dimension for smoothing the spectral profile, followed by the inverse curvelet transform to get the denoised HSI data cube. Given a detail image stack at scale 2 -j and orientation l, which is denoted as W b,j,l (x, y)</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">(b ∈ [1, B], x ∈ [1, X], y ∈ [1, Y ]) containing X × Y coefficients</formula><p>in each band, the spectral series vector for one pixel can be constructed as W j,l (x, y) = (W 1,j,l (x, y), W 2,j,l (x, y), . . . , W B,j,l (x, y)). Then, the smoothing process on the spectral dimension by SSA could be achieved, as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">Y j,l (x, y) = SSA L,EVG (W j,l (x, y)) (<label>26</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_47">)</formula><p>in which SSA is the operation of the SSA listed in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_28">18</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_39">22</ref>), L, EVG are SSA parameters, and Y j,l (x, y) = (Y 1,j,l (x, y), Y 2,j,l (x, y), . . . , Y B,j,l (x, y)) is the smoothed spectral feature in the curvelet domain. After collecting all smoothed spectra for each detail stack, the inverse discrete curvelet transform is performed on the smoothed curvelet coefficients band by band using the same toolbox CurveLab, and the denoised HSI data cube is achieved, shown as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">I_d b = ICT ⎛ ⎝ C b,J,1 + Y b,1,1 + J-1 j=2 8 l=1 Y b,j,l ⎞ ⎠<label>(27)</label></formula><p>where ICT stands for the inverse curvelet transform operation. The last step is to crop the denoised HSI cube to its original size. The pseudocode of the proposed curvelet and SSA approach is summarized in Algorithm 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithm 1</head><p>The Curvelet and SSA algorithm In this section, the experimental data sets will be introduced as well as the choice of the classification model and parameters.</p><p>Three publicly available and widely used HSI remote sensing data sets are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in this paper, including the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer natural scenes Indian Pines <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> and Salinas Valley <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> as well as the Reflective Optics System Imaging Spectrometer urban scene Pavia University <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p><p>The Indian Pines data set was collected in the Indian Pines test site in Northwest Indiana, USA on June 12, 1992. The scene consists of two-thirds agriculture, and one-third forest, or other natural perennial vegetation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Acquired in bandinterleaved format, it has 145 × 145 pixels with a spatial resolution of 18 m and 220 continuous spectral channels ranging from 400 to 2500 nm covering the complete visible-nearinfrared-shortwave-infrared spectrum. The nominal spectral resolution is 10 nm, and the radiometric resolution is 16 bits <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Due to atmospheric water absorption, bands 104-108, 150-163, and 220 do not contain useful information and are consequently removed to prevent from decreasing the classification accuracy, resulting in a reduced data set with 200 spectral bands. There are 16 classes in the original ground truth map. However, some classes have insufficient samples for training the classification model. As suggested by other researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, 7 of 16 classes are discarded for more consistent results, leaving nine classes considered in experiments. One band image and the reduced ground truth map of Indian Pines are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>.</p><p>The second data set was collected over Salinas Valley, CA at low altitude on October 9, 1998, resulting in a high spatial  The Pavia University data set was collected during a flight campaign over the Pavia district in north Italy, with a spatial resolution of 1.3 m per pixel <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. There are originally 115 bands with a spectral coverage ranging from 430 to 860 nm. However, 12 channels have been removed due to noise, leaving 103 bands with 610 × 340 pixels per band. Nine classes of interest are provided in the ground truth map, including urban, soil, and vegetation features, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>. The spatial area of all data sets is not a square; hence, before applying the curvelet transform, Indian Pines, Salinas Valley, and Pavia University are zero-padded to the size of 256 × 256 × 200, 512 × 512 × 204, and 1024 × 1024 × 103, respectively. Then, when the denoising and feature extraction process is finished, reconstructed images are cropped to their original sizes for the following performance evaluation.</p><p>In the context of supervised classification, a variety of methods have been developed for HSI data classification problems, including the famous artificial neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, multinomial logistic regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, as well as the widely used support vector machine (SVM) that shows its outstanding performance in many papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. The properties of SVM make it an effective tool for HSI data classification problems, which are influenced by the Hughes phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. The Hughes phenomenon is also known as the "curse of dimensionality," where the high number of spectral bands and low number of labeled training sample result in a decrease in the generalization capability of the classifier <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. In this paper, a publicly available SVM library called LIBSVM <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> is adopted, and the Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel is chosen as it has been shown to outperform other kernel functions for HSI data, such as linear and polynomial kernel functions, in terms of classification accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. The optimal values of regularization parameter C and width parameter γ in the Gaussian RBF kernel are achieved using tenfold cross validation on training samples, where values of both parameters are tested within the exponentially increasing sequence {2 -10 , 2 -9 , . . . , 2 10 }.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS</head><p>In this section, the classification results based on SVM for three hyperspectral data sets are revealed. The classification performance is evaluated by the overall accuracy (OA) and the average accuracy (AA), where OA refers to the percentage of all pixels that are correctly labeled, and AA stands for the average percentage of correctly labeled pixels for each class. Since the proposed methodology is inspired by the feature extraction approach based on SSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and the denoising approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, which uses MLR applied in the curvelet domain, the proposed methodology is compared with the feature extraction approach and the denoising approach in Section V-A. Moreover, the curvelet transform is similar to the wavelet transform as a multiscale geometric analysis. Therefore, SSA and MLR are also applied in the wavelet domain for comparison in this section. For the wavelet-transform-based approaches, the hyperspectral data are also zero-padded, and the number of decomposition scales is set the same as the curvelet transform, where the Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau (CDF) 9/7 wavelet is adopted. For convenience, the proposed approach is denoted as CT-SSA, and other inspirational approaches are named SSA, CT-MLR (MLR applied in the curvelet domain), WT-MLR (MLR applied in the wavelet domain), and WT-SSA (SSA applied in the wavelet domain). The computational cost required for these methods is also discussed in this part.</p><p>Then, the CT-SSA method as well as its extended version CT-SSA-PCA are further compared with some state-of-the-art spectral feature extraction techniques in Section V-B, including PCA, LDA, NMF, and ensemble EMD (EEMD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, to show the efficacy of the proposed methodology.</p><p>The proposed approach only takes into account the spectral information of the HSI data, while ignoring the important spatial information. For this reason, in Section V-C, a simple yet powerful postprocessing technique is applied to the classified ground truth map, and it is compared with several recent spectral-spatial classification methods listed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Comparison With Inspirational Approaches</head><p>The SSA-based feature extraction approach mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> has two parameters: window size L and grouping parameter EVG. It is noticed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> that good results can be achieved with only the first component used for EVG, as long as a proper window size L is chosen. Another parameter in the proposed approach is the decomposition level in the curvelet transform. As previously mentioned, the default number of decomposition levels in the CurveLab toolbox is J = log 2 (N ) -3, and it is advised that the number of decomposition levels should not be higher than the default setting. Therefore, different values have been tested to look for optimal parameters. First, the default number of decomposition levels is used in the curvelet transform, and the window size L is tested from 2 to 5 as plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>. Similarly, experiments have been carried out ten times, and the average OA as well as the standard deviation are shown in the plots. By trial and error, the optimal value for L is set as 5 for both Indian Pines and Salinas Valley. For Pavia University, L is set as 4. The same settings of SSA are used for CT-SSA and WT-SSA as well. With the chosen optimal values for window size L, the number of decomposition levels is tested from 2 to the default setting. Results plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> indicate that the default setting of decomposition levels should always be used in the curvelet transform.</p><p>For the Indian Pines data set, in each class out of the nine classes, 10% of pixels are randomly extracted into the training set with the rest allocated in the testing set. As Salinas Valley is a high-resolution HSI data set, spectra with this scene are more separable than those with Indian Pines. Therefore, a lower percentage of samples in each class (5%) is used for training the classification model of SVM to give a more interpretable result. A recent publication proposed to use a fixed number (200) from each class in the Pavia University data set as training samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, which account for 4% of the whole labeled pixels. Therefore, 4% of pixels are also randomly chosen from Pavia University for training SVM in the following experiment. Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>have shown the classification maps as well as OA levels for three data sets. Compared with those inspirational methods, the CT-SSA approach always presents better denoising and feature extraction performance in terms of the highest classification accuracy.</p><p>Additionally, the capability of the proposed CT-SSA method in removing noise is compared. One noisy band is taken from each data set, and the same band after being processed by   CT-SSA is visually compared in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref>. It can be observed that the CT-SSA method works for both high-noise (see Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>) and low-noise (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref>) cases, where the noise in the corrupted band is effectively suppressed, and local details of the original image can be kept simultaneously.</p><p>To avoid errors and to get a more consistent result, ten repeated experiments are carried out based on randomly chosen training and testing samples, and average classification accuracy values are calculated, with numerical results shown in Tables I-III for three experimental data sets. It can be noticed that compared with the original image, OA using the CT-SSA method is increased with a percentage of 10.02%, 4.44%, and 0.89%, respectively, for three data sets, achieving an impressive improvement over other methods. For both Indian Pines and Salinas Valley, in most cases, the proposed method presents the highest classification accuracy; particularly in class 15 of Salinas Valley, the accuracy is improved by over 20% compared with the raw image. Although it was found that the classification of hyperspectral urban data is a challenging problem without combining the spatial and spectral information together <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, both AA and OA are slightly improved for Pavia University using the proposed spectral processing method CT-SSA. In comparison with CT-MLR, WT-MLR yields slightly worse results in both AA and OA. Similar situations occur for WT-SSA and CT-SSA, where the latter presents slightly higher AA and OA than the former. It proves that the curvelet transform does have advantages over the wavelet transform for extracting geometric details in some ways, but the performance of the curvelet transform is largely dependent on the data set. Despite the fact that CT-SSA is inspired by CT-MLR, SSA is applied to the detail curvelet coefficients for each pixel, whereas MLR is applied to each detail image stack all at once. This, along with the embedding process and SVD decomposition in SSA, is the main reason why CT-SSA overperforms MLR in potentially maximizing the opportunity in reducing redundancy and noise within the hyperspectral image data for improved accuracy of classification.</p><p>For an N × N block, the computational complexity for the curvelet transform is given as O(N 2 log N ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, whereas the computation of the wavelet transform requires O(3/2(m H + m L )(1 -1/4 J )N 2 ) flops for a block with the same size, where J is the decomposition level, and m H , m L are the lengths of the filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. With the CDF 9/7 filter used in the experiments, the lengths of the filter are both 9, i.e., m H = m L = 9. Therefore, when J is higher than 2, the computational complexity for the wavelet transform can be approximated as O(27N 2 ), which is much higher than that of the curvelet transform. Moreover, it should be noted that the processing time for MLR and SSA is largely dependent on the number of detail coefficient stacks and the number of total pixels in those stacks. However, it is not a problem for SSA, as fast implementation of SSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> has been proposed without degrading the feature extraction performance. For the Indian Pines data set, the computing time of the proposed CT-SSA method (using the original SSA implementation) is about 5 min on a personal computer with an Intel Core i5-2400 CPU at 3.10 GHz using MATLAB 2014a (Mathworks). Hence, it is reasonable to believe that with the fully optimized CurveLab toolbox and the fast implementation of SSA, the time cost of the proposed method should be much lower.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Comparison With Other State-of-the-Art Spectral Processing Techniques</head><p>Although the curvelet transform is applied in the spatial domain of the hyperspectral images, the dominating part of the proposed denoising and feature extraction method, i.e., SSA, is applied in the spectral domain. As a matter of fact, the proposed CT-SSA approach actually belongs to the 1-D spectral processing technique for hyperspectral images. Therefore, a few state-of-the-art 1-D spectral feature extraction and dimensionality reduction techniques, including PCA, LDA, and NMF, are compared with the proposed approach for further performance assessments. LDA is a standard supervised dimensionality reduction technique for pattern recognition, where the highest degree of class separability is obtained by maximizing the Raleigh quotient, i.e., the ratio of the between-class scatter matrix to the within-class scatter matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Different from PCA, which could only extract holistic features from the original HSI data, NMF is a parts-based learning algorithm, decomposing a nonnegative matrix into two nonnegative matrices that are more intuitive and interpretable. One of the decomposed matrices is formed with a set of basis vectors, which can be utilized to project the original data onto the lower dimensional subspace <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The NMF algorithm is realized by the NMF MATLAB toolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Additionally, as an upgraded version of EMD, EEMD is also included for comparison as it overcomes the drawback of EMD, and therefore, it outperforms EMD <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Being the fundamental part of the Hilbert-Huang transform, EMD is a nonlinear and nonstationary signal decomposition method that decomposes the signal into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. Each IMF represents a zero-mean frequency-amplitude modulation component that is often related to a specific physical process so that EMD is not biased with any predetermined basis. Although EMD has shown its efficacy in time-series decomposition (e.g., speech recognition), results reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> indicated that spectral feature extraction using EMD could potentially reduce the following classification accuracy. Consequently, a more robust and data-driven technique, i.e., EEMD, was proposed to alleviate the addressed problem. It is achieved by sifting an ensemble of white noise-added signal, and similarly, it generates a series of IMFs, where the sum of them represents the processed signal. In this paper, the fast EEMD MATLAB toolbox is adopted <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. The performance of PCA on the proposed approach for further feature extraction is also included for comparison.</p><p>The number of resulting features using PCA on both original data and CT-SSA processed data is tested within 5-50 in a step of 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, whereas the dimensions of extracted features are tested from 2 to 10 for both LDA and NMF. Best results with the highest classification accuracy are chosen for comparison. With regard to EEMD, it is suggested that the input white noise level ε 0 should be in the range of 0.1-0.4 and the number of ensemble N E should be the order of 100 <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. Therefore, we keep these parameters the same as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, where ε 0 = 0.2, N E = 200, and the number of IMFs is 7. Experiments are also repeated ten times, and comparison results are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">IV</ref>.</p><p>It can be seen that those dimensionality reduction techniques only give comparable results compared with the original data set, although they could speed up the classification process. As given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, with a 10% training rate of Indian Pines, the highest classification OA achieved by EMD is 75.49%. Although EEMD has made an improvement of over 8% on this data set, it is not as good as the proposed CT-SSA approach. For Indian Pines and Salinas Valley, adding an extra PCA step leads to further improvement in classification accuracy while reducing the classification time with less number of features. Although the extra step of PCA has limited performance on the Pavia University data set, the proposed CT-SSA method still outperforms other spectral feature extraction techniques. </p></div>

Comparison With Recent Spectral-Spatial Classification Methods</head><p>For the majority of supervised classifiers, such as neural networks, decision trees, and SVM, the spectral-feature-based classification chain is adopted. However, they are not able to incorporate spatial dependence relations presented in the original scene into the classification process <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Several recent publications have demonstrated that the integration of spectral and spatial information could be beneficial to hyperspectral image classification problems, where some spectral-spatial classification methods, including the extended morphological profile (EMP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, the logistic regression and multilevel logistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, the edge-preserving filter (EPF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, image fusion and recursive filter (IFRF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, and intrinsic image decomposition (IID) <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, have been proved to be superior to the spectralfeature-based classification method. Therefore, a postprocessing step is added to the proposed CT-SSA approach to increase the spatial consistency in the classification result, where a T × T spatial window is applied around each central pixel in the classification map, and the final classified label is decided in favor of the class that appears most in the window. The window shape could be designed to conform to different scenes; however, to make it simple, here, the square window is used.</p><p>As can be noticed in ground truth maps in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>, Indian Pines has a smaller spatial area for some classes compared with Salinas Valley and Pavia University. Therefore, the spatial postprocessing (SPP) window T is chosen as 5 for Indian Pines, 9 for Salinas Valley, and 9 for Pavia University, respectively. Results using EMP, LMLL, EPF, IFRF, and IID are cited directly from <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Since only nine classes in Indian Pines are involved in our experiments, we have eliminated the other seven classes from their results and recalculated AA and OA accordingly. For Salinas Valley in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, 2% of pixels in each class have been used for training. Therefore, we have reperformed the experiment under the same training rate with other parameters unchanged. Numerical results are shown in Tables V-VII, where the proposed approach with spatial postprocessing (CT-SSA-SPP) gives comparable accuracy values with other   Using SVM on three publicly available data sets, i.e., Indian Pines, Salinas Valley, and Pavia University for performance assessment, the proposed CT-SSA method significantly improves OA by as much as 10% compared with the result of the original Indian Pines data set. In addition, noise could be effectively removed by checking the band image visually. Compared with the inspirational approaches and some state-of-the-art spectral feature extraction techniques, the proposed method always stands out with the highest classification accuracy values. Furthermore, it is noticed that with the spatial postprocessing step, another 4% improvement in accuracy could be added to the final result of Indian Pines, whereas for Salinas Valley and Pavia University, classification results can even be improved to nearly 100%. It is worth noting that by adding the simple spatial postprocessing step, the performance of the proposed denoising and feature extraction method is either comparable with in terms of accuracy or even higher than some recent spectral-spatial classification methods. The choice of the spatial postprocessing techniques will be a topic of our future work. Although, in this paper, the use of SSA is proposed for spectral processing in the curvelet domain, other filtering techniques could also give a relatively good result, where 2-D filtering in the spatial domain in combination with SSA will be further investigated as well.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

With the introduced spatial postprocessing and under the same or even less training ratios, the OA values for the three data sets have been dramatically improved to 98.40, 99.39, and 99.19 from the new CCT-SSA-SPP approach.
