Each branch in a phylogenetic tree corresponds to a bipartition or split of the set of taxa labelling its leaves.

The complexity of this network is bounded as a function of the threshold proportion.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A central task in evolutionary biology is the construction of phylogenetic trees and, accordingly, many methods have been developed for performing this task. Quite often these methods produce a collection of trees rather than a point estimate of an optimal tree, since such a tree with no measure of reliability may not be particularly helpful. Examples of methods producing collections of trees include Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and bootstrapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Heuristic or exact searches <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> can also produce collections of trees if the optimal solution is not unique.</p><p>Large collections of trees can be difficult to interpret and draw conclusions from. Thus, when faced with such a collection, it is common practice to construct a consensus tree, i.e., a tree that attempts to reconcile the information contained within all of the trees. Many ways have been devised for constructing consensus trees (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for a comprehensive, recent overview). However, they all suffer from a common limitation: By summarizing all of the given trees by a single output tree, information about conflicting hypotheses is necessarily lost in the final representation.</p><p>Motivated by this problem we have developed a new approach to visualizing collections of trees that naturally generalizes consensus trees. This approach is based on the construction of phylogenetic networks, networks that are regularly used by biologists to visualize and analyze complex phylogenetic data sets. In particular, we will focus on the use of median networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> to visualize collections of trees as we now describe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head><p>First we summarize some necessary concepts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Background</head><p>Suppose that X is a finite set of taxa. A split A|B of X is a bipartition of X, i.e., a partition of X into two non-empty sets or parts A and B with A ∪ B = X and A ∩ B = ∅. We call a collection of splits a split system for short. A phylogenetic tree (on X) is a tree with leaves labelled by X. Each edge of a phylogenetic tree naturally gives rise to a split, since its removal results in two trees, each one being labelled by the elements in one part of a split. We say that a phylogenetic tree displays a split if there is an edge in the tree that gives rise to the split. A split system is called compatible if there is a phylogenetic tree that displays every split in the system. If this is the case then there is a unique such tree for which the edges are in one-to-one correspondence with the splits in the given system (see e.g., <ref type="bibr">[21, pg 44]</ref>). We say that a split system is incompatible if it does not contain any subset of cardinality two that is compatible. Note that a split system which is not compatible, need not be incompatible.</p><p>It is possible to represent split systems on X by various networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In particular, a canonical median network <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> can be associated to any split system on X. These networks were originally designed for the analysis of mitochondrial data <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and have also been used to analyze chloroplast data <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In a median network, certain vertices are labelled by the elements of X and, in a way similar to phylogenetic trees, splits are represented by classes of parallel edges. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates a simple median network on 5 taxa. The median network associated with a split system has several attractive properties. For example, it is a tree if and only if the split system is compatible (in which case it is the unique tree corresponding to the split system), and it is a hypercube if and only if the split system is incompatible <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In fact, for a general split system a median network lies somewhere between the extremes of being a tree and a hypercube since each incompatible subsystem of splits with cardinality k corresponds to a k-cube in the network. Moreover, the median network associated with a split system is straight-forward to generate using an algorithm first introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, which has been implemented in the freely available program Spectronet <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The two horizontal parallel edges correspond to the split AB|CDE, and the two vertical parallel edges correspond to the split BC|ADE.</p><p>Since for visual purposes the complexity of the median network associated with a split system is directly related to the degree of incompatibility of the split system (since high dimensional hypercubes are rather difficult to visualize), it is useful to quantify this incompatibility as follows. For k a positive integer, we say that a split system is k-compatible if it contains no incompatible subsystem of k + 1 splits. The concept of k-compatibility was introduced and studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Clearly a k-compatible split system is compatible if and only if k = 1, in which case its associated median network is a tree, but, as k increases, the associated median network can become progressively more complex. Note that if X has cardinality n, then a (1-)compatible split system on X contains at most 2n -3 splits, a 2-compatible split system on the same set contains at most 4n-10 splits and, for general k, it will contain at most n(1 + k log 2 (n)) splits, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Hence for low values of n and k the number of splits in a k-compatible split system on X will not be excessively large, again making the associated median network easier to visualize.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Consensus Networks</head><p>Given a collection of phylogenetic trees, two common methods for computing a consensus tree are the strict consensus method, which outputs the tree displaying only those splits that are displayed by all of the input trees, and the majorityrule consensus method, which outputs the tree displaying only those splits that are displayed in more than half of the input trees. These two methods can be viewed as being members of a one-parameter family of consensus methods in which a split system S x is generated that contains precisely those splits that are displayed by more than proportion x of the trees (for strict consensus x = 1, and for majority-rule x = 1 2 ). If x is greater than 1 2 , then the consensus method results in a split system that is compatible which can thus be displayed by a tree. However, if x is less than 1  2 this is no longer necessarily the case, although the split system S x does have the following attractive property. Theorem 1. Given N phylogenetic trees and some 0 &lt; x ≤ 1, let S x denote the split system containing those splits that are displayed in N x or more of these trees. Then S x is 1</p><p>x -compatible.</p><p>Proof: Suppose that S x contains 1</p><p>x + 1 incompatible splits. Then, since each of these splits is displayed by at least N x of the trees, it follows by the Pigeonhole Principle that one of the trees must display at least two of the incompatible splits. But this is impossible.</p><p>For obvious reasons, we will call the median network associated with S x a consensus network. In order to visualize the contribution that each split makes to the collection of trees in question, we usually weight the edges in this network corresponding to a given split according to the frequency with which it occurs in the trees. This last result indicates a way in which to control the visual complexity of the consensus network associated with S x . For instance, if we only accept splits that appear in more than 1  4 of the input trees, then S 1 4 will be 4-compatible, so that the associated median network is guaranteed to contain cubes only of dimension 3 or less. Note that in the case where x = 0, i.e. the split system S contains all splits from all N trees, S is N -compatible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Greedy Consensus Networks</head><p>We now turn to the practical matter of how to select a split system to be represented by a consensus network. One possibility is to simply select the parameter x described in the previous section by trial and error, and this seems to work reasonably well in practice. A more attractive approach might be to try and select, for fixed k, a maximal k-compatible subset of splits in the split system consisting of all splits displayed by a given collection of trees. However, this is computationally hard even in case k = 1 (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>). Even so there are various heuristic approaches possible extending those used to construct consensus trees. We now describe one of these methods.</p><p>Consensus trees can be constructed using a greedy approach, which can be easily extended to construct networks. We begin by recalling the strategy for constructing a greedy consensus tree (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>). Given a collection of trees, list all splits displayed by at least one of the trees in order of frequency, so that those splits displayed by the largest number of trees come first (with ties broken arbitrarily). A compatible split system is then built up by starting at the beginning of the list and adding in splits one at a time that are compatible with all of the splits in the current split system, ignoring splits that are incompatible with any of the splits in the current system. The tree displaying the resulting compatible split system is the greedy consensus tree.</p><p>We construct a k-greedy consensus network for a fixed positive integer k in a similar manner, including splits in order of frequency provided they do not lead to a subset of k + 1 incompatible splits. As with greedy consensus trees, this approach will also suffer from the fact that if two distinct splits occur with equal frequency, they will be chosen in arbitrary order which can lead to different results (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for more details). In practice we found it useful to stop trying to add further splits after the first split inducing a subset of k+1 incompatible splits was obtained; this prevented the main features of the network being obscured by many edges of relatively small weight (results not shown).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Implementation</head><p>Code has been developed to read a list of trees in Newick format (bracket notation) and produce the corresponding weighted split system in nexus format. (Python script available from b.r.holland@massey.ac.nz). This nexus file can then be read by the program Spectronet <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> which displays the associated consensus network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head><p>We present two representative examples to illustrate the method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">MCMC Analysis</head><p>Our first example comes from a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> of 37 mammal mitochondrial genomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. We used the software Mr-Bayes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> under a general time-reversible model with gamma distributed rates across sites to generate a chain of 1,000,000 trees; of these every hundredth tree was recorded. We discarded the first half of these trees to provide for a burn in period, leaving 5000 trees in our collection.</p><p>Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-2d</ref> show the consensus networks corresponding to the split systems S x for x = 1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.1. In an MCMC analysis the proportion of times an edge appears in a tree in the chain is interpreted as its posterior probability of being in the true tree, hence the length of the edges in the network are proportional to their posterior probability. Note that all the external edges have posterior probability 1, as they necessarily appear in all of the trees in the collection.</p><p>The marsupials (opossum, possum, wallaroo, bandicoot) and the platypus form an outgroup to the placental mammals. We can see in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-2d</ref> that while the more recent divergences are well resolved, the order of the deeper divergences and the position of the root of the placentals is unresolved. Using the complete data set, the outgroup breaks the rodents into two groups, this is thought to be a long branch attraction artefact, and indeed, when the outgroup taxa are removed the rodents form a single group <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Although the strict consensus tree (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>) and majority-rule consensus tree (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>) give b) Majority-rule consensus tree for 37 mammal mitochondrial sequences (x = 0.5). c) Consensus network for 37 mammal mitochondrial sequences (x = 0.25). This is the smallest value of x for which the associated consensus network contains no 3-cubes. d) Consensus network for 37 mammal mitochondrial sequences (x = 0.10). The smallest value of x for which the consensus network contains no 4-cubes is 0.028. However, this network has many tiny edges that detract from the main features. some idea of the regions of the phylogeny that are uncertain, these regions are displayed either as polytomies, or as edges with weak support, rather than the more informative display of alternative hypotheses in the consensus networks (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>). For instance, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref> there are two possible hypotheses regarding the location of the odd-toed ungulates (horse, white rhino). They could either form a sister group with the carnivores (dog, cat, harbour seal) or with the even-toed ungulates (finwhale, hippo, cow, pig). The relative lengths of edges in the 2-cube indicate that the latter hypothesis is more likely according to this analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Equally Parsimonious Trees</head><p>The second example is a data set consisting of 80 trees. This collection of trees resulted from a heuristic search for the most parsimonious tree for a set of 53 sequences of human mitochondrial DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The phylogenetic software package PAUP* <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> was used to search for the maximum parsimony tree, (using the default options Swap=TBR, AddSeq=Simple). All splits appearing in the 80 equally parsimonious trees are shown (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), this corresponds to x = 0, making it unnecessary to compute a greedy network. As we see, rather than sifting through the 80 trees to try and identify similarities and differences, the relevant information is summarized in a single figure. This data set is typical of intra-species data in that it has many equally likely trees, since taxa are often only separated by a few mutational steps, with a high proportion of the mutations being reversals and parallel changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. As these reversals and parallel changes can lead to conflicting hypotheses about the phylogeny, consensus trees for intra-species data are prone to have many polytomies. This is well illustrated by the majority-rule consensus tree for this data set (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). There are a large number of resolved trees consistent with the majority-rule tree, only 80 of these are the actual input trees. A greedy consensus tree would provide much greater resolution of the polytomies but would still be unable to display the 3x2 = 6 trees encapsulated by the 3-cube and 2-cube in the network. The consensus network approach also complements a recent multidimensional scaling method for analyzing collections of trees, TreeViz <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. This method works by computing a distance between the trees in question (such as the Robinson-Fould's distance), and then using multidimensional scaling to represent the trees as a set of points in a plane (an approach that was also explored in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>). Using this plot, it is possible to interactively select subcollections of trees and compute consensus trees for these collections.</p><p>We show a screenshot of a TreeViz analysis of the 80 equally parsimonious trees (Figure <ref type="figure">5a</ref>); the multi-dimensional scaling is shown on the left and the consensus tree for 16 selected trees in shown in a panel on the right. In Figure <ref type="figure">5b</ref> we compare an excerpt from the consensus of the 16 highlighted trees with the corresponding part of the consensus network. Again, where the consensus tree shows a polytomy the network displays the competing hypotheses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>We have presented a method for generating consensus networks that allows the display of conflicting information within a collection of phylogenetic trees. These networks can be thought of as an extension of strict and majority-rule consensus trees. As with consensus trees, consensus networks can be used as a tool in conjunction with established phylogenetic techniques such as MCMC and bootstrapping. The weights of the edges in consensus networks are open to different interpretations depending on the way in which the input collection of trees is generated. For instance, given a set of trees generated by a MCMC the weights of the splits correspond to posterior probabilities, given bootstrap trees the weights correspond to the confidence level.</p><p>One of the main advantages of consensus networks over consensus trees is that they allow conflicting hypotheses within the input collection of trees to be displayed simultaneously in a single diagram. This can be important since a lot of computational effort is usually put into generating large collections of trees, making it somewhat wasteful to only keep a small proportion of this information in the final display. Moreover, it is the conflicts between the trees that are often of interest to biologists and by visual inspection consensus networks allow these to be quickly identified.</p><p>Even so, consensus networks still suffer from limitations shared by consensus methods in general. With consensus networks (as with consensus trees) some information may still be lost in order to facilitate display of the network, especially if the data contains many incompatibilities. However, if the data is highly incompatible then it might be questionable in what way a phylogenetic analysis is appropriate.</p><p>Another consideration with the consensus networks that we have proposed is that they can still become quite complex, even when restricted to 3-compatible split systems. In practice we found that networks without a distracting level of complexity could be constructed by halting the greedy consensus method program SplitsTree <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. However, we shall explore this possibility elsewhere when we will also look at other avenues for future work including the adaptation of different consensus tree methods to give networks (e.g., matrix representation with parsimony).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
