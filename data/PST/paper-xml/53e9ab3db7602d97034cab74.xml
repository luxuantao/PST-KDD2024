<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Sensor networks are used to gather distributed information from a given location or region. These networks consist of tiny devices which are equipped with a power source, a microprocessor, a wireless interface, some memory, and one or more sensors. The sensors are used for collecting physical parameters such as light intensity, sound, or temperature. Because of the limited radio communication range, sensor nodes communicate (e.g., gather data) by wireless multi-hop routing via intermediate nodes.</p><p>In order to develop algorithms for sensor networks and in order to give mathematical proofs of their correctness and performance, appropriate models are needed. Finding good models however is a challenging task. On the one hand, a model should be as simple as possible such that the analysis of a given algorithm remains tractable. On the other hand, however, a model must not be too simplistic in the sense that it neglects important properties of the network. A great algorithm in theory may be inefficient or even incorrect in practice if the analysis is based on idealistic assumptions. For example, an algorithm which ignores interference may fail in practice since communication happens over a shared medium.</p><p>Many models for sensor network have their origin in classic areas of theoretical computer science and applied * Research supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation. mathematics. Since the topology of a sensor network can be regarded as a graph, the distributed algorithms community uses models from graph theory, representing nodes by vertices and wireless links by edges. Another crucial ingredient of sensor network models is geometry. Geometry comes into play as the distribution of nodes in space, and the propagation range of wireless links, usually adhere to geometric constraints.</p><p>Of course, a good model depends on the question studied. A media access study might need a detailed model capturing several low-level aspects. For instance, it has to be taken into account that a message might not be received correctly due to a near-by concurrent transmission. Hence, it is crucial that the model appropriately incorporates interference aspects. However, for a transport layer study, a much simpler model which assumes random transmission errors might be sufficient. This paper discusses various models for sensor networks and strives at putting them into perspective. The selection of models presented is of course far from being complete and also highly subjective. In particular, our focus is on models of higher levels of abstraction; a large body of interesting work about the physical layer (e.g., cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>) is not considered.</p><p>We hope that the paper can provide insights into how sensor network models are related, and that it can give advice as to when and why which model should be preferred.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, models are studied for the network's connectivity. Section 3 then enhances these models by adding interference aspects: Since the communication medium is shared, sensor nodes might not be able to communicate although they are within each other's transmission range. Finally, Section 4 compares the different kinds of sensor network algorithms in use today, and discusses several modeling choices which influence the design and performance of an algorithm. The paper is concluded in Section 5. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Connectivity</head><p>A first and foremost modeling question concerns the connectivity of sensor nodes: Given a set of nodes distributed in space, we need to specify which nodes can receive a transmission of a node. Throughout this paper, if a node u is within a node v's transmission range, we say that u is adjacent to v, or equivalently, that u is a neighbor of v. In the absence of interference (cf. Section 3), this relation is typically symmetric (or undirected), i.e., if a node u can hear a node v, also v can hear u.</p><p>The classic connectivity model is the so-called unit disk graph (UDG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> Nodes having omnidirectional radio antennas are assumed to be deployed in a planar, unobstructed environment. Two nodes are adjacent if and only if they are within each other's transmission range (which is normalized to 1). </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">u, v ∈ V , it holds that {u, v} ∈ E ⇔ |u, v| ≤ 1. Figure 1 depicts an example of a UDG.</formula><p>The UDG model is quite idealistic: in reality, radios are not omnidirectional, and even small obstacles such as plants could change connectivity. For these reasons, some researchers have proposed to study the other extreme and model the sensor network as a general graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model 2.2 (General Graph (GG))</head><p>The connectivity graph is a general undirected graph G.</p><p>While a UDG is too optimistic, the GG is often too pessimistic, as the connectivity of most networks is not arbitrary but obeys certain geometric constraints. Still, in some application scenarios it might be accurate to operate either on the UDG or on the GG. Indeed, there are algorithms developed for the UDG which also perform well in more general models. Moreover, some algorithms designed for the GG are currently also the most efficient for UDGs (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>).</p><p>The research community has inevitably searched for connectivity models between the two extremes UDG and GG. For example, the quasi unit disk graph model (QUDG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16]</ref> is a generalization of the UDG which takes imperfections into account as they may arise from nonomnidirectional antennas or small obstacles. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref>Model 2.3 (Quasi Unit Disk Graph (QUDG)) The nodes are in arbitrary positions in R 2 . All pairs of nodes with Euclidean distance at most ρ for some given ρ ∈ (0, 1] are adjacent. Pairs with a distance larger than 1 are never in each other's transmission range. Finally, pairs with a distance between ρ and 1 may or may not be neighboring. An example is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">does not specify precisely what happens if the distance is between ρ and 1.</head><p>There are several options. For example, one could imagine an adversary choosing for each node pair whether they are in each other's transmission range or not. Alternatively, there may be a certain success probability of being adjacent: the corresponding probability distribution could depend on the time and/or distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. For example, the QUDG could be used to study Rayleigh fading, that is, the radio signal intensity could vary according to a Rayleigh distributed random variable. Also a probabilistic on/off model is reasonable, where in each round, a link's state changes from good to bad and vice versa with a given probability.</p><p>Measurement studies suggest that in an unobstructed environment, and with many nodes available, 1/ρ can be modeled as a small constant <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Interestingly, many algorithms can be transferred from the UDG to the QUDG at an additional cost of 1/ρ 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. While for ρ ≈ .5 this factor is bearable, the algorithms are two orders of magnitude worse if ρ ≈ .1.</p><p>While the QUDG can be attractive to model nodes deployed in fields with few obstacles, it does not make sense for inner-city or in-building networks where obstructions cannot be ignored: Since a node may be able to communicate with another node which is dozens of meters away, but not with a third node being just around the corner, ρ would be close to 0.</p><p>However, even in such heterogeneous environments, the connectivity graph is still far from being a general graph. Although nodes which are close but on different sides of a wall may not be able to communicate, a node is typically highly connected to the nodes which are in the same room, and thus many neighbors of a node are adjacent. In other words, even in regions with many obstacles, the total number of neighbors of a node which are not adjacent is likely to be small. This observation motivates the following model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Model 2.6 (Bounded Independence Graph (BIG)) Let Υ r (u) denote the set of independent nodes which are at most r hops away from node u (i.e., nodes of u's r-neighborhood) in the connectivity graph G. Thereby, a set of nodes is called independent if all nodes in the set are pairwise not adjacent. Graph G has bounded independence if and only if for all nodes u ∈ G, |Υ r (u)| = O(poly(r)) (typically |Υ r (u)| ∈ O(r c ) for a small constant c ≥ 2). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref>We believe that the BIG model reflects reality quite well and is appropriate in many situations. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows a sample scenario with a wall; in contrast to UDG and QUDG, the BIG model captures this situation well.</p><p>Since the number of independent neighbors in a disk of radius r of a UDG is at most O(r 2 ), we have the following fact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Facts 2.7</head><p>The UDG model is a special case of the BIG model. Similarly, if ρ is constant, also a QUDG is a BIG.</p><p>Observe that many models described in this section can be generalized. For instance, the UDG and QUDG models can be studied in three dimensions rather than in the plane. Options 2.8 (Generalized (Q)UDG) One extension of the UDG and QUDG models is to consider nodes in R 3 . Moreover, distances between nodes could be modeled using the Manhattan norm (L 1 norm) or the maximum norm (L ∞ norm) rather than assuming Euclidean distances (L 2 norm).</p><p>For instance in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, the UDG definition has been extended to doubling metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref>Model 2.9 (Unit Ball Graph (UBG)) A doubling metric space is defined as follows: For a node u, let the ball B u (r) denote the set of all nodes at a distance at most r from u. It holds, for all nodes u and all r ≥ 0, that the ball B u (r) can be covered by a constant number of balls of radius r/2, i.e., B u (r) ⊆ i=1...c B ui (r/2), where u i are arbitrary nodes and c is a (usually small) constant. In the UBG model, nodes are assumed to form a doubling metric space. Two nodes u and v with d(u, v) ≤ 1 are adjacent, all other nodes are not. Facts 2.10 Nodes in a 2-dimensional Euclidean plane (i.e., the metric space is given by the Euclidean distances), form a doubling metric. A general graph however does not. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> shows an example for the Euclidean plane. To see why a general graph may not form a doubling metric, consider a graph where all nodes have distance 1 to all other nodes.</p><p>Observe that it is possible to model a UDG with a UBG by using the Euclidean distances of the UDG and connecting those node pairs which have distance at most 1.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(r) = B u1 (r/2) ∪ B u2 (r/2) ∪ B u3 (r/2).</formula><p>However, as shown below, even the QUDG can be modeled by a UBG. Fact 2.12 An undirected QUDG with constant ρ is a UBG.</p><p>Proof. We transform the distances between all pairs of nodes (u, v) in the QUDG as follows. Let d Q (u, v) denote the distance from node u to node v in the QUDG, and let d B (u, v) be the transformed distance in the UBG. Moreover, let &gt; 0 be an arbitrary small number.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">d B (u, v) :=                    d Q (u, v)/ρ if d Q (u, v) ≤ ρ 1 if ρ &lt; d Q (u, v) ≤ 1 and v is adjacent to u 1 + if ρ &lt; d Q (u, v) ≤ 1 and v is not adjacent to u d Q (u, v) if d Q (u, v) &gt; 1</formula><p>Observe that by this transformation, pairs of nodes which are adjacent in the QUDG are assigned distances of at most 1 and are therefore also adjacent in the UBG. Similarly, nodes which are not adjacent in the QUDG have a distance larger than 1 are therefore not neighboring in the UBG either. Also observe that the transformation increases the distance between two nodes by less than a constant factor of µ := (1 + )/ρ, but it never decreases any distances. It remains to show that after the transformation, the nodes indeed form a doubling metric space.</p><p>In order to form a metric space, the distances between the nodes are to fulfill the following properties: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>nonnegativity, (2) identity of indiscernibles, (3) symmetry and (4) triangle inequality. The non-negativity and the identity of indiscernibles criteria are met trivially. The symmetry criterion however might not hold, as the adjacency relation can be directed in a QUDG. Therefore, in the follow-ing, we consider undirected QUDGs only. Hence, since our distance transformation maintains symmetry, Property (3) holds as well. It remains to discuss the triangle inequality.</head><p>Consider two arbitrary nodes u and v. Since in the QUDG, all distances are Euclidean, it holds that</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">∀w : d Q (u, v) ≤ d Q (u, w) + d Q (w, v) (1)</formula><p>Let us now look at the following three cases in turn: (i)</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">d Q (u, v) ≤ ρ, (ii) ρ &lt; d Q (u, v) ≤ 1, and (iii) 1 &lt; d Q (u, v).</formula><p>In Case (i), no node w with distance larger than ρ from any of the two nodes u and v can challenge the triangle inequality. For all other nodes w, however, it holds that</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">d B (u, v) = d Q (u, v)/ρ ≤ (d Q (u, w)+d Q (w, v))/ρ = d B (u, w) + d B (w, v).</formula><p>Here, the equalities hold by the definition of the transformation function and the inequality is due to Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>). Next, we tackle Case (ii). Again, only nodes w with d Q (u, w) ≤ ρ and d Q (w, v) ≤ ρ can challenge the inequality. However, we know that d Q (u, v) &gt; ρ, and hence, Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">yields d B (u, w) + d B (w, v) = d Q (u, w)/ρ + d Q (w, v)/ρ &gt; 1.</formula><p>Finally, the triangle inequality also holds in Case (iii), because the distance between u and v in the UBG is the same as in the QUDG, and our transformation never decreases any distances. We conclude the proof by showing that the metric space has a constant doubling dimension. Recall that all distances are only stretched by a constant factor between 1 and µ in our transformation. Therefore, for all nodes u and arbitrary radii r, B QU DG u (r/µ) ⊆ B U BG u (r). Thus, at most a constant factor of O(log µ) times more balls are needed for the UBG than for the QUDG (the Euclidean plane) in the worst case, and the claim follows.</p><p>The UBG itself has a polynomially bounded independence and is therefore a BIG. Fact 2.13 A UBG is a BIG. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> Proof. Fix a node u. We have to prove that the total number of independent nodes in B u (r) grows polynomially in r. Observe that-due to the triangle inequality-in B u (1/2) there is at most one independent node. Thus, by the definition of a doubling metric, there are at most c independent nodes in B u (1), at most c 2 in B u (2), c 3 in B u (4), etc. Generally, there are at most c log r+1 independent nodes in B u (r). Since c log r ∈ O(r c ), the claim follows.</p><p>To conclude this section, we present two additional modeling aspects with which connectivity models can be extended. The first aspect concerns the nodes' antennas.</p><p>Option 2.14 (Antennas) Besides omnidirectional antennas, there is a wide range of more sophisticated antenna models. For example, a node can have a directional radio antenna with more gain in certain directions.</p><p>Finally, as mentioned in the discussion of the QUDG, links are not always reliable: links may be up and down, e.g., according to a probabilistic process. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Interference</head><p>In wireless networks, the communication medium is shared, and transmissions are exposed to interference. Concretely, a node u may not be able to correctly receive a message of an adjacent node v because there is a concurrent transmission going on nearby. While for higher layer protocols it may be accurate enough to model interference by having random transmission failures, interference must be a first-class citizen for lower layer protocols.</p><p>In some sense, an interference model explains how concurrent transmissions block each other. Interference is a difficult phenomenon, with many hard-to-capture characteristics. A signal might for example interfere with itself due to multipath propagation (e.g., a direct path canceling with a longer path reflecting on an object). Capturing these effects is beyond the scope of this overview paper, and probably beyond the scope of algorithmic research in general, for some years to come.</p><p>Instead models that capture reality from a worst-case perspective have been proposed. The mother of all interference models is the so-called physical or SINR model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref>, which is widely accepted and applied by "lower layer researchers" such as information theorists. In this model, the successful reception of a message depends on the received signal strength, the ambient noise level, and the interference caused by simultaneously transmitting nodes.</p><p>Model 3.1 (Signal-to-Interference Plus Noise (SINR)) Let P r be the signal power received by a node v r and let I r denote the amount of interference generated by other nodes. Finally, let N be the ambient noise power level. Then, a node v r receives a transmission if and only if P r N +I r ≥ β. Thereby, β is a small constant (depending on the hardware) and denotes the minimum signal to interference ratio that is required for a message to be successfully received. The value of the received signal power P r is a decreasing function of the distance d(v s , v r ) between transmitter v s and receiver v r . More specifically, the received signal power is modeled as decaying with distance d(v s , v r ) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">1 d(v s ,v r ) α .</formula><p>The so-called path-loss exponent α is a constant between 2 and 6 and depends on external conditions of the medium, as well as on the exact sender-receiver distance. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> Let P i be the transmission </p><formula xml:id="formula_8">power level of node v i . A message transmitted from a node v s ∈ V is successfully received by a node v r if Ps d(v s ,v r ) α N + v i ∈V \{v s } P i d(vi,vr) α ≥ β.</formula><p>Note that sometimes a variation of this SINR model is used in literature. It has an additional requirement: for a successful reception, the received signal power must exceed a minimal threshold θ, i.e., P r ≥ θ. In many situations, such a threshold can also be incorporated implicitly by the ambient noise power level N .</p><p>Apart from the interference term, and if all nodes send with the same transmission power level, the connectivity model of SINR is exactly the UDG, with path-loss exponent α and minimum ratio β such that the maximum distance of receiving a signal is 1. Hence, the SINR model can be extended similarly to the UDG model.</p><p>Observe that the SINR model does not specify the signal power P s used by a sender v s to transmit data to the receiver v r . Three models are common: Option 3.2 (Power Control) CONST: All nodes use the same constant transmission power. DIST: The power level depends on the distance d between sender and receiver. Concretely, the transmission power is given by c • d α for some α ≥ 2 and some constant c &gt; 0. GEN: A general (or arbitrary) power level is assumed at the sender, which may change over time. Although the SINR model incorporates many important physical properties, it has not received an appropriate amount of attention from the algorithms community <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</p><p>the electromagnetic wave: a direct one and a ground reflected signal path; to describe this situation, α = 4 is used. This can be partially explained by the fact that the SINR model is complicated. For instance, a lot of far-away transmissions sum up, and may interfere with a close-by senderreceiver pair. In practice, these far-away transmissions however often only contribute to the ambient noise, and need not be counted individually. Twiddling the knobs of the model a bit more, we might not sum up all interfering transmissions, but simply look a the worst-or in case of a CONST model: closest-disturbance: a node receives a transmission if and only if the closest simultaneously transmitting node is far enough.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Option 3.3 (Interfering Transmissions) SUM: All interfering transmissions are taken into account. ONE: Only the worst (or closest) interfering transmission matters. NULL: Pure connectivity models which do not consider interference aspects (cf. Section 2).</head><p>ONE models are quite popular because of their simplicity. The UDI-an interference-aware version of the UDGis a prominent example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model 3.4 (UDG with Distance Interference (UDI)) Nodes are situated arbitrarily in the plane. Two nodes can communicate directly if and only if their Euclidean distance is at most 1, and if the receiver is not disturbed by a third node with Euclidean distance less or equal a constant R ≥ 1.</head><p>Observe that-because of the constant transmission power-the power control type of UDI is CONST. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref> shows an example.</p><p>Many researchers approximate the constant R of the UDI model in such a way that interference can be reduced to a parameter of the UDG. For instance, some MAC protocols (e.g., coloring algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>) have been proposed to reduce interference by ensuring a certain hop distance between two senders. Concretely, it is assumed that only the k-neighborhood of a receiver u can interfere with u.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model 3.5 (UDG with Hop Interference (UHI)) Nodes are located at arbitrary positions in R 2 . Two nodes are adjacent if and only if their Euclidean distance is at most 1. Two nodes can communicate directly if and only if they are adjacent, and if there is no concurrent sender in the k-hop neighborhood of the receiver (in the UDG).</head><p>Clearly, this is a stark simplification since in a UDG a (k + 1)-neighbor can be close to the receiver, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7</ref>.</p><p>Observe that while the UHI model-for every ksometimes overlooks interference terms which the UDI would take into account, the contrary does not hold. Fact 3.6 By choosing R = k, and since a hop has at most length 1, the UDI model does not overlook any interference terms which UHI would have taken into account. The contrary does not hold, cf. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7</ref>.</p><p>Like UDI and UHI, also the protocol model (PM) is of type ONE (Option 3.3). However, the senders in the PM model adapt their transmission power according to DIST (Option 3.2), i.e., depending on the distance between sender and receiver. Model 3.7 is a variation of the model introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Model 3.7 (Protocol Model (PM)) Let u 1 , u 2 , ..., u k be the set of nodes transmitting simultaneously to receivers v 1 , v 2 , ..., v k respectively. The transmission of u i is successfully received by v i if for all j = i, it holds that d(u j , v i ) &gt; λ • d(u j , v j ), where λ ≥ 1 is a given constant. That is, v i must not fall into a "guard zone" around any sender u j which is a factor (1 + λ) larger than u j 's transmission range. Many interference models distinguish between senders and receivers assuming that interference arises at senders and occurs at receivers. However, often receivers acknowledge messages and are therefore also senders. If the original messages are short (e.g., control messages), then the sender/receiver distinction may not make sense. By this observation, some models (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>) simply consider the interference of undirected links. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">8</ref> depicts an example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Option 3.8 (Direction) DIR: This class of interference models distinguishes between senders and receivers (interference disks around senders). UNDIR: Interference originates from undirected links (interference "pretzels" around links).</head><p>As in the case of connectivity models, the SINR, the UDI, and the UHI models can be extended with directional antennas and link failures, and hence Options 2.14 and 2.15 also apply here. Moreover, also the idea of quasi unit disk graphs (cf. Model 2.3) could be adopted. For example, the UDI can be "quasified" as follows: if two nodes are closer than a given threshold R 1 , concurrent transmissions will always interfere; if the distance is larger than a second threshold R 2 , there will be no interference. Finally, if the distance is between R 1 and R 2 , transmissions may or may not interfere.</p><p>However, these models are often too complicated to be handled algorithmically. It is sometimes simpler to study general weighted graphs instead.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model 3.9 (General Weighted Graph (GWG)) Two graphs are given: a weighted connectivity graph G and a weighted interference graph H. For simplicity, it is often assumed that G = H. A receiver v successfully receives a message from a sender u, if and only if the received signal strength (the weight of the link between u and v in G) divided by the total interference (the sum or the max of the weights of the links of concurrently transmitting nodes with a receiver v in H) is above the threshold given by the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio.</head><p>The general weighted graph model is quite pessimistic, as it allows for non-natural network topologies. Insteadsimilarly to the BIG connectivity model-we need a weighted graph model that captures the geometric constraints without making too many simplifying assumptions. Again, one approach is to assume that the nodes form a doubling metric (cf. UBG model of Section 2). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>9). Interference can be incorporated in various ways. For example, the amount of interference at a receiver u could depend on u's distance (in the doubling metric space) to the closest concurrently transmitting node (ONE model), or on the number of concurrent senders (SUM model).</head><p>Finally note that in this section, we have only studied binary interference models, that is, either a message can be received or not. In practice, also the transfer rate at which messages can be transmitted can depend on interference: the larger the signal-to-noise ratio, the larger also the available bandwidth. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref> However, since these issues are beyond the scope of this paper, we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for more details.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">9</ref> summarizes the connectivity and the interference models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Algorithms</head><p>Algorithms for sensor networks come in different flavors. In this section, we first describe a selection of algorithm models which we feel are relevant for sensor networks. We then discuss modeling aspects which may influence an algorithm's performance; for example, what kind of identifiers nodes have, or how the nodes are distributed in space. Besides the classic evaluation criteria for algorithms-namely, time complexity and space complexity-algorithms for sensor networks pose additional optimization problems; for example, the number of messages which are sent should be small; or, in order to maximize the lifetime of the network, the nodes' energy consumption must be minimized. These issues are also considered in this section.</p><p>The first kind of algorithms we present here is similar to the classic (graph) algorithms appearing in the area of theoretical computer science or applied mathematics. These algorithms can operate directly on the entire network or graph, and have complete information about the state of the system. For example, a system designer planning a fixed sensor network can apply a global algorithm to determine the optimal positions of the nodes in a given observation area.</p><p>Model 4.1 (Global Algorithms) A global algorithm can operate directly on the entire network.</p><p>However, most algorithms for sensor networks proposed in literature are meant to be executed by the sensor nodes during the system's operation. For example, when a node receives a message, it performs some computation, anddepending on the computation's results-sends a new message to one of its neighbors. A node a priori only knows its own state. In order to learn more about the other nodes in the network, it has to communicate with its neighbors. By collaboration of the nodes, global operations such as (multihop) routing between two nodes can be achieved. Since the activity is distributed among the nodes, these algorithms are called distributed algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. Model 4.2 (Distributed Algorithms) In a distributed algorithm, every sensor node runs its own algorithm. A priori, a node has only information about its own state. In order to learn more about the rest of the network, nodes repeatedly exchange messages with adjacent nodes.</p><p>Distributed algorithms raise many interesting questions. For example: What can be computed in a distributed fashion, and what not? How efficient is a distributed algorithm compared to a corresponding global algorithm? Be-sides an algorithm's correctness, execution time to perform the task (time complexity) and memory requirements at the nodes (space complexity), a new criterion becomes important, namely message complexity: Since distributed algorithms rely on message passing, and since sending and receiving messages is an expensive operation (e.g., queueing delay, congestion, energy consumption, etc.), a distributed algorithm should minimize the total number of messages sent.</p><p>The notion of message complexity motivates the introduction of localized algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Model 4.3 (Localized Algorithms) A localized algorithm is a special case of a distributed algorithm. At the beginning, a node has only information about its own state. In order to learn more about the rest of the network, messages have to be exchanged. In a k-localized algorithm, for some constant k, each node is allowed to communicate at most k times with its neighbors. However, a node can decide to retard its right to communicate; for example, a node can wait to send messages until all its neighbors having larger identifiers have reached a certain state of their execution.</p><p>In spite of the more restricted communication model, localized algorithms can be slow. A node u might have to wait for a neighbor v to transmit all its messages, while node v in turn has to wait for its neighbor w, etc. Thus, as a matter of fact there can be a linear chain of causality, with only one node being active at any time. This yields a worst-case execution time of Θ(n), where n is the number of nodes.</p><p>Researchers have proposed to study yet another kind of distributed algorithms which overcome the performance problems of localized algorithms and always terminate after a constant number of communication rounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. Model 4.4 (Local Algorithms) Again, at the beginning, each node only knows its own state. In a k-local algorithm, for some constant k, each node can communicate at most k times with its neighbors. However, in contrast to k-localized algorithms, nodes cannot delay their decisions. In particular, all nodes process k synchronized phases, and a node's operations in phase i may only depend on the information received during phases</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">1 to i -1.</formula><p>Observe that in a k-local algorithm, nodes can only gather information about nodes in their k-neighborhood. The constant time complexity makes Model 4.4 particularly suited in scenarios where the environment changes frequently. However, due to the synchronous phases, local algorithms may make greater demands on the MAC layer than localized algorithms.</p><p>Having defined the most common types of algorithms, we now look at some algorithmic aspects in more detail. As mentioned, the message complexity-the total number of messages sent by an algorithm-is a main evaluation criterion of distributed algorithms. As the number of messages typically depends on the amount of information which can be stored in a message, a model must specify the messages' sizes. A most popular model limits the message size to O(log n) bits, where n is the total number of nodes in the system. Hence, a message can store only a constant number of node identifiers (e.g., the source and destination address of a routing packet). Moreover, it is often assumed that if a node u sends a message to a neighbor v, all other neighbors of u will also receive the message (broadcast model). However, sometimes-for example for lower bound proofs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>-also models are considered where the message size is unbounded, and where nodes can communicate with their neighbors individually (message-passing model).</p><p>Algorithmic models also differ in their assumptions about how nodes can access the wireless medium. The concrete MAC however can influence the number of retransmissions and hence an algorithm's performance. Moreover, sometimes an algorithm must be able to coordinate the medium access itself. Option 4.5 (Medium Access) Some researchers assume an ideal medium access mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> where interference is impossible, and where messages will always be broadcast instantaneously to all neighbors (cf. models of Section 2). In addition, adversarial models are used where an adversary schedules transmissions. Of course, this model only makes sense if the adversary is restricted appropriately, that is, if there are fairness guarantees. For example, the adversary might have to schedule each node at least once every Θ(n) rounds. Moreover, one could imagine an adversary which delivers a message only to a subset of a node's neighbors, because the other neighbors experience collisions. Finally, completely unstructured radio networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> can be considered where the algorithm designer has to implement her own medium access scheme from scratch. These models can further be classified in whether collisions can be detected by a receiver or not.</p><p>A main objective of sensor networks is to collect physical data distributed over a given region. To achieve this, typically one or more nodes observe different sub-areas. Knowledge of the nodes' distribution however can be important for an algorithm designer. In a scenario where the nodes are dropped from an airplane, one might expect that the nodes are roughly randomly distributed when they reach ground.</p><p>Model 4.6 (Random Node Distribution) The simplestand quite common-way to model sensor networks is to assume a UDG in combination with a uniform node distribution in the 2-dimensional Euclidean plane. However, motivated by percolation theory, also Poisson models have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>: Thereby, the positions of the nodes are distributed in R 2 according to a homogeneous Poisson point process of constant density λ per unit area.</p><p>While these random models may be fine to prove the performance of an algorithm, for correctness and robustness issues, a more pessimistic model should be preferred, e.g., a worst-case distribution. Of course, there are again many models which lie between the two extremes. For example, random distributions with a density parameter varying over space could be considered: One can imagine that there are several nodes per square meter in areas which are "interesting" to observe, whereas in other "routing only" areas nodes are hundreds of meters apart. Finally, in the context of node distribution, one has to mention also models which do not allow nodes to be arbitrarily close or even assume the same position; there is such an assumption in the Ω(1) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> or in so-called civilized graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Related to the distribution of nodes in space is also the issue of the distribution of node identifiers. As many algorithms are based on node IDs, their performance can depend on how IDs are distributed among the nodes (and thus also in space).</p><p>Options 4.8 (Node Identifiers) We propose that nodes have unique identifiers. 7 Similarly to the node distribution in space, the most common models for ID distributions are random distributions and worst case distributions. Sometimes, it also matters from which range the identifiers are chosen. Again, many variations are possible. For example, each of the n nodes can have a unique 128-bit identifier (range 0, ..., 2 128 -1). Or, in a more restrictive case, the nodes may have consecutive numbers (e.g., range 1, ..., n).</p><p>Alternatively,-or additionally!-node IDs can contain location information, for example if the nodes are equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS) or a Galileo device. Location information can boost the performance of certain operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>: for example, a routing algorithm can exploit geographic information to forward the message to a neighbor which lies in the direction of the message's destination (greedy routing). Option 4.9 (Location Information) Sensor nodes can have access to various forms of (absolute or relative) geographic information about other nodes. For example, a node u might sense its distance to another node v, or in which direction (angle of arrival) u lies, or even know v's exact position.</p><p>Distributed algorithms for sensor networks are usually evaluated according to their time complexity, their space complexity and their message complexity. However, in order to be successful in a real sensor network, an algorithm has to pursue additional objectives. For example, if sensor nodes are deployed in large numbers, recharging their batteries seems out of question, in particular in adversarial territory. A node's energy supply must suffice for the whole operational phase. Therefore, the conservation of energy is of utmost importance. Basically, there are two approaches to capture the energy consumption of a node. Historically,-since during the transmission of data much energy is consumed-a model has been studied which only takes the transmission energy into account <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Model 4.10 (Transmission Energy) The energy consumed by a node is calculated by the sum over all its transmissions. Thereby, the energy needed to transmit one message is of the form c • d α , where d is the distance between sender and receiver, α is the path-loss exponent (usually α &gt; 2), and c is a constant.</p><p>Although transmitting data is a costly operation, sensor nodes with short-range radios available today spend as 7 Some researchers also study scenarios where there are no node IDs. However, observe that IDs could be generated during deployment, for example by a random number generator. Moreover, as already RFID tags have IDs, we believe it is reasonable to assume that sensor nodes obtain a unique ID already during the production process. Finally, note that certain tasks cannot be solved by any distributed algorithm if there are no identifiers, as there is no way to break symmetries among the nodes. much energy receiving or waiting for data. Therefore, techniques have been developed which allow nodes to change to a parsimonious sleep mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. During the time periods a node is sleeping, it cannot receive any data. The idea is that if all nodes can somehow be synchronized to wake up at the same moment of time to exchange data (e.g., every minute), much energy is saved. This motivates the following model. If there are no external disturbances, a node is assumed to live as long as it has some energy left. The lifetime of the entire network is modeled in different ways.</p><p>Option 4.12 (Network Lifetime) In applications which depend on every single node, the lifetime of a network can be defined as the time until the first node runs out of battery power <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Alternatively, a network might be able to tolerate certain node failures; for example, the network might live as long as all live nodes are still connected to each other.</p><p>Finally, note that several variations discussed in the section about interference also apply for energy models. For example, a node might be able to save energy by using a smaller transmission radius if the receiver is close-by. Last but not least, interference itself causes a waste of energy as retransmissions are required, and may hence be incorporated into a given energy model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>This paper has presented and compared a subjective selection of algorithmic models. We want to emphasize that there is no optimal model, and that an engineer has to choose the model which reflects her needs best. For example, a large warehouse has different physical characteristics and signal propagation paths than an office building; or GPS might not work indoors and hence algorithms based on coordinates are not be feasible; etc. We hope this paper helps to compare the different options. Generally, we believe that for efficiency considerations, a slightly idealistic model can be fine. However, when it comes to issues such as correctness of an algorithm, it seems that a more pessimistic or conservative model should be preferred. In other words, a robust algorithm is also correct in a more general model than for which it has been studied or proven efficient, i.e., in a model which is located closer to the "root" in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">9</ref> (according to the transitive "→" relation).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
