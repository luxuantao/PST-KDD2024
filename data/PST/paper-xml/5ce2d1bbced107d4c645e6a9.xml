<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In e-learning recommender systems, interpersonal information between learners is very scarce, which makes it difficult to apply collaborative filtering (CF) techniques. In this study, we propose a hybrid filtering (HF) recommendation approach (SI-IFL) combining learner influence model (LIM), self-organization based (SOB) recommendation strategy and sequential pattern mining (SPM) together for recommending learning objects (LOs) to learners. The method works as follows: (1) LIM is applied to acquire the interpersonal information by computing the influence that a learner exerts on others. LIM consists of learner similarity, knowledge credibility, and learner aggregation. LIM is independent of ratings. (2) a SOB recommendation strategy is applied to recommend the optimal learner cliques for active learners by simulating the influence propagation among learners. Influence propagation means that a learner can move toward active learners, and such behaviors can stimulate the moving behaviors of his neighbors. This SOB recommendation approach achieves a stable structure based on distributed and bottom-up behaviors of individuals. (3) SPM is applied to decide the final learning objects (LOs) and navigational paths based on the recommended learner cliques. The experimental results demonstrate that SI-IFL can provide personalized and diversified recommendations, and it shows promising efficiency and adaptability in e-learning scenarios.</p></div>
