<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The audio-video based emotion recognition aims to classify a given video into basic emotions. In this paper, we describe our approaches in EmotiW 2019, which mainly explores emotion features and feature fusion strategies for audio and visual modality. For emotion features, we explore audio feature with both speech-spectrogram and Log Mel-spectrogram and evaluate several facial features with different CNN models and different emotion pretrained strategies. For fusion strategies, we explore intra-modal and cross-modal fusion methods, such as designing attention mechanisms to highlights important emotion feature, exploring feature concatenation and factorized bilinear pooling (FBP) for cross-modal feature fusion.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Emotion recognition(ER) has attracted increasing attention in academia and industry due to its wide range of applications such as human-computer interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, clinical diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and cognitive science <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Although great progress in the face and video analysis has been made <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, audio-video emotion recognition in the wild remains a challenging problem due to the expression suffers from the large pose, illumination variance, occlusion, motion blur, etc.</p><p>Audio-Video emotion recognition can be summarized as a simple pipeline shown in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, which includes four parts, namely Video preprocessing, Feature Extraction, Feature Fusion, and Classifier. Specifically, video preprocessing refers to extract the spectrogram of the audio, the faces or landmarks of video. Feature extraction and feature fusion respectively extracts emotion features from the audio or visual signal and fuses emotion features into compact feature vectors, which are subsequently fed into a classifier for prediction.</p><p>Reviewing the methods of Audio-Video emotion recognition, we find that some methods emphasize feature extraction and other methods emphasize feature fusion. Yao et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> construct Holonet as discriminative feature extraction, which combines residual structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and CReLU <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> to increase network depth and maintain efficiency. The EmotiW2017 winner team <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> gets robust feature extraction with Supervised Scoring Ensemble (SSE) which adds supervision to intermediate layers and shallow layers. Since SSE only uses high-level representations, Fan et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> further improve SSE by utilizing middle feature maps to provide more discriminative features. These methods mainly use average pooling to obtain video-level representation from frame-level.</p><p>Many feature fusion strategies have been used in previous EmotiW challenges. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> extract CNN-based frame features and use LSTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> or BLSTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> to fuse them. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>    maximum of the frame feature vectors. However, these methods ignore the importance of frames. Besides, all previous methods mainly apply score averaging or feature concatenation for audio-video fusion, which ignores the correlation between the features from different modalities.</p><p>In this paper, we exploit three types of intra-modal fusion methods, namely self-attention, relation-attention, and transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. They are used to learn weights for frame features to highlight important frames. For cross-modal fusion, we explore feature concatenation and factorized bilinear pooling (FBP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Besides, we evaluate different emotion features, including convolutional neural networks (CNN) for audio information with both speech-spectrogram and Log Mel-spectrogram and several facial features with different CNN models and different emotion pretrained strategies. Finally, we obtain 62.48% and rank second in the challenge.</p><p>Our contributions and finds can be summarized as follows.</p><p>• We experimentally show that better face recognition CNN models and choosing suitable emotion datasets to further pretrain the face CNN models is important. • We design three kinds of attention mechanisms for visual and audio feature fusion. • We apply a Factorized Bilinear Pooling (FBP) for crossmodal feature fusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">THE PROPOSED METHOD</head><p>We develop our ER system based on the pipeline of Video preprocessing-Feature Extraction-Feature Fusion-Classifier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Video preprocessing</head><p>Face detection and alignment. We apply face detection and alignment by Dlib toolbox <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . We extend the face bounding box with a ratio of 30% and then resize the cropped faces to scale of 224 × 224. We do not apply face detection and alignment Audio processing and Spectrogram calculation. For each audio, the speech spectrogram and log Mel-spectrogram extraction process is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> respectively.</p><p>For speech spectrogram, we use the Hamming window with 40 msec window size and 10 msec shift. Finally, the 200dimensional low-frequency part of the spectrogram is used as the input to the audio modality. As for log Mel-spectrogram, we calculate its deltas and delta-deltas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feature Extraction</head><p>Visual Features. We apply three CNN backbones to extract facial emotion features, namely VGGFace, ResNet18, and IR50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The dimensions are 4096, 512, and 512, respectively.</p><p>Audio Feature. We extract the feature maps of the audio from the last Pooling layer of AlexNet. The size of a 3-dimensional feature map is 𝐻 ×𝑊 ×𝐶, where the 𝐻 (𝑊 ) is the height(width) of the feature map, and 𝐶 is the number of the channel of the feature map. The feature maps are then split into n vectors(𝑛 = 𝐻 × 𝑊 ). Each vector is C-dimensional.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intra-modal Feature Fusion</head><p>We apply the attention-based strategies for intra-modal feature fusion. It converts a variable number of emotion features(from audio or visual modality) into a fixed-dimension feature. We explore three attention methods, namely Selfattention, Relation-attention, and Transformer-attention. Formally, we denote a number of emotion features as {𝑓 1 , • • • , 𝑓 𝑛 }.</p><p>Self-attention. We apply 1-dimensional Fully-Connected(FC) layer W 0 d×1 and a sigmoid function 𝜎 for each emotion feature, the weight of the 𝑖-th feature 𝑓 𝑇 𝑖 is defined by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝛼 𝑖 = 𝜎 (𝑓 𝑇 𝑖 • W 0 d×1 )<label>(1</label></formula><p>) With these self-attention weights, we aggregate all the emotion features into a global representation 𝑓 𝑠 as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑓 𝑠 = 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝛼 𝑖 𝑓 𝑖 𝑛 𝑗=1 𝛼 𝑗 .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Relation-attention. </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝛽 𝑖 = 𝜎 ( [𝑓 𝑖 : 𝑓 𝑠 ] 𝑇 • W 1 d×1 ),<label>(3</label></formula><p>) With Self-attention and Relation-attention weights, all the emotion features was convert into a new feature as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝑓 𝑟 = 𝑛 𝑖=0 𝛼 𝑖 𝛽 𝑖 [𝑓 𝑖 : 𝑓 𝑠 ] 𝑛 𝑗=0 𝛼 𝑗 𝛽 𝑗 .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Transformer-attention. Inspired by the works in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, we formulate the attention weight as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">𝑓 ′ 𝑖 = W 2 m×d • 𝑓 𝑖 + 𝑏<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">𝛾 𝑖 = 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (u t 𝑚×1 • 𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ(𝑓 ′ 𝑖 ))<label>(6)</label></formula><p>To reduce the dimension of the feature 𝑓 𝑖 , we use a 𝑤 × 𝑑dimensional FC layer W 2 m×d in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Then the weight of the 𝑖-th feautre 𝑓 𝑖 is processed by a 1-dimensional FC layer u t , 𝑒𝑥𝑝 () and 𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ() function in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</p><p>With these transformer-attention weights, we aggregate all the emotion features into a single feature 𝑓 𝑡 as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">𝑓 𝑡 = 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝛾 𝑖 𝑓 𝑖 𝑛 𝑗=1 𝛾 𝑗 .<label>(7)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-modal Feature Fusion</head><p>We apply Factorized Bilinear Pooling(FBP) for cross-modal feature fusion. Given two features in different modalities,i.e. the audio feature vector 𝒂 ∈ R 𝑚 for a spectrogram and visual feature 𝒗 ∈ R 𝑛 for frame sequence, the simplest cross-modal bilinear model is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">𝑧 𝑖 = 𝒂 𝑇 𝑾 𝑖 𝒗<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where 𝑾 ∈ R 𝑚×𝑛 is a projection matrix, 𝒛 𝒊 ∈ R is the output of the bilinear model. we use the Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">9</ref>) to obtain the output feature 𝒛 = [𝑧 1 , • • • , 𝑧 𝑜 ]. The formula derivation from formula Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">8</ref>) to Eq <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">( 9)</ref> was discribed in the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The implementation of Eq( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">9</ref>) is illustrated in Fig2, where Ũ𝑇 𝒂 and Ṽ𝑇 𝒗 are implemented by feeding feature 𝒂 and 𝒗 to FC layers, respectively, and the function SumPooling(𝒙, 𝑘) applies sum pooling with non-overlapped windows to 𝒙. Besides, Dropout is adopted to prevent over-fitting. The 𝑙2normalization (𝒛 ← 𝒛/∥𝒛∥) is used to normalize the energy of 𝒛 to avoid the dramatical variation of the output magnitude, due to the introduced element-wise multiplication.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">𝒛 = [𝑧 1 , • • • , 𝑧 𝑜 ] = SumPooling( Ũ𝑇 𝒂 • Ṽ𝑇 𝒗, 𝑘)<label>(9)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">EXPERIMENTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dataset</head><p>In this work we use four emotion datasets to train our models, i.e. AffectNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, RAF-DB <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, FER+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, AFEW <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</p><p>The human-annotated part of AffectNet dataset contains 287,651 training images and 4,000 test images, which are annotated with both emotion labels and arousal valence values. Only emotion labels are used in this task.</p><p>The RAF-DB dataset consists of 15,339 images labeled with 7-class basic emotion and 3,954 labeled with 12-class compound emotion. Only images labeled with basic emotion are used in this study.</p><p>The FER+ dataset contains 28,709 training, 3,589 validation and 3,589 test images. We combine its training data with validation data for the training split and evaluate the model performance on the test data.</p><p>The AFEW contains 773 train, 383 val and 653 test samples, which are collected from movies and TV serials with spontaneous expressions, various poses, and illuminations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploration of Emotion Features</head><p>We explore emotion features in two perspectives, namely CNN backbones and pretraining emotion datasets.</p><p>For the choice of the CNN model, we compare IR50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, ResNet18 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and VGGFace <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> in the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref>, where the former two models are pretrained on MS-Celeb-1M dataset and the last one on VGGFace dataset. We find that the large CNN, IR50, is superior to the other two models.</p><p>We use the well-trained IR50 model to extract features and only train softmax classifier using these features. The IR50 models pre-trained on FER+, RAF-DB, and AffectNet achieve 50.13%, 51.436%, and 53.78%, respectively. Therefore, we choose the IR50 model pretrain on AffectNet as our visual features in the following fusion experiments. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploration of Fusion Strategies</head><p>We explore three intra-modal attention strategies with the FBP cross-modal fusion. We use speech spectrogram for audio CNN, which obtains 38% on AFEW validation set individally. In the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref>, we find the FBP improves performance for all the intra-modal fusion methods. Transformer attention for intra-modal fusion is the best for FBP. We also use log Mel-spectrogram for audio CNN, which obtains a little better performance, but the final results are very similar after intra-and cross-modal fusion. Besides, the concatenation of audio and visual vectors gets 58% accuracy in AFEW validation set with transformer attention. This is 3% lower than FBP which shows the effectiveness of FBP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feature Enhancement</head><p>In the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>, the Basic Features means that we only extract one feature vector for each frame. Besides, We apply 5 kinds of feature enhancement strategies as presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>. Specifically, for feature 𝐹 -𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛, we first obtain 18 transformation frames by using three rotations, three scales, and flipping for a frame. After that, we compute the features of these 18 transformation frames and average these 18 features as the feature 𝐹 -𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛. For the feature 𝐹 -𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑆𝑡𝑑, we compute the average feature and feature standard deviation of these 18 features. We then concatenate the average feature and the standard deviation as 𝐹 -𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑆𝑡𝑑. For the feature 𝐹 -𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚𝐹 𝐹𝑇 , we first compute the Fast Fourier transform(FFT) of the Basic Feature, and then normalize the feature and concatenate the real and imaginary parts as 𝐹 -𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚𝐹 𝐹𝑇 . For the feature 𝐹 -𝐴𝑅-𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛, 𝐴 means that the features are extracted by the models pre-trained on Affectnet, and 𝑅 by the models pre-trained on RAF-DB. we concatenate these two mean features of two different pretrained models as 𝐹 -𝐴𝑅-𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref> shows that the five feature enhancement methods further improve the performance of FBP where the feature F-MeanStd achieves the best result on the validation set. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results On EmotiW2019</head><p>In the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref>. The first three submitted models are trained on the training and validation set of AFEW, and the last two models are trained on the training set of AFEW. We find that it is difficult to choose models and fuse models if combining the validation set with the training set. We adopt class weight in all submissions, which means that we reweight the predicted scores by the square root of the sample numbers([0.15, 0.097, 0.129, 0.185, 0.138, 0.082, 0.215]).</p></div>
