<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A self-triggered sampling scheme is proposed for a networked control system with consideration of data losses and communication delays. By making use of this scheme, the next sampling instant does not depend on on-line estimation of an event-triggered condition and the successive measurement of the state, and can be dynamically determined with respect to the transmitted packet, the desired control performance, and the allowable number of consecutive data losses and communication delays. Consequently, the sampling interval can be adaptively adjusted. Therefore, the communication burden can be greatly reduced and the energy efficiency can be much improved while preserving the desired H∞ performance. An inverted pendulum and a one-area power system controlled over a wireless sensor network are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed self-triggered sampling scheme.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>the desired control performance at the same time has received much attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Furthermore, there are some reports on practical applications of NCSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. For example, an original two-layer structure is proposed to solve the set points compensation problem for a rougher flotation process under network-based environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. To tackle multi-rate networked industrial process control problem, a stirred tank reactor is used to illustrate the effectiveness of proposed double-layer architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>In an NCS, the driven manner of the system components is one of key concerns in the modelling, analysis and synthesis. In the existing literature, a time-triggered sampling scheme is widely adopted <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Generally speaking, executing the sampling in a time-triggered style is convenient for the analysis and design of NCSs, but it always leads to a conservative design. Since this sampling scheme uses the communication resources regardless of the behavior of the system and/or the current network load. Therefore, it is significant to design an appropriate communication/sampling scheme to ensure the desired performance while utilizing the less network bandwidth. Recently, a number of research results focus on event-triggered sampling schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and self-triggered sampling schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> for NCSs. In the event-triggered sampling scheme, the state of the system is periodically/continuously monitored and new measured-data is picked up when a predetermined triggering condition is violated. In the self-triggered scheme, the state of the system does not need to be sampled except that the predicted value of a function related with the state is larger than a certain threshold. Thus, the communication burden is reduced compared with a traditional periodic time-triggered communication scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. However, an aperiodic sampling scheme usually depends on a specialized hardware to carry out high-rate sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Especially, in wireless NCSs, the main cause for energy consumption is the idle listening for message, and the event-triggered sampling does not contribute to reduction of the time of the idle listening, since the sensor nodes are enforced to keep radio on to wait for reception of the sampled data <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. To improve the energy efficiency for energy-constrained NCSs, a self-triggered sampling scheme (STS) is more appealing in comparison with eventtriggered sampling. A self-triggered control scheme presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> is extended from real-time control systems to NCSs. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, a new approach is proposed to control several processes over a shared wireless network by an STS. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, a self-triggered coordination is proposed for optimal deployment of robotic networks. Furthermore, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, a welldesigned sampling control is provided to enlarge the sampling intervals compared with the periodic sampling case.</p><p>Different from point-to-point connected traditional control systems, NCSs are of some non-ideal network quality of service (QoS), for example, data losses and communication delays due to the introduction of the communication networks. This non-ideal QoS may deteriorate the control effect of NCSs and even may destabilize the systems if not considering it in the analysis and design of NCSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. There are some time-triggered sampling results in the literature for NCSs with data losses and communication delays <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. However, there are limited results on an aperiodic sampling scheme for NCSs by considering the above two issues simultaneously. In the limited results, an event-triggered communication scheme is presented for a distributed NCS with data losses and communication delays <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. By use of the time-delay analysis approach, a discrete event-triggered sampling scheme is presented for NCSs by considering the communication delays and ignoring the data losses in the communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. With a predetermined controller, an immature STS is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> for an NCS, in which the estimation of the upper bound of event-triggered condition ρ T (t)Ψ 1 ρ(t) in Lemma 1 and the self-triggered conditions ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">12</ref>) in Theorem 2 are needed to be essentially improved to accord with the practical network conditions. Furthermore, how to co-design the networked controller and the communication scheme is not considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. These above mentioned issues greatly motivate the present research.</p><p>In this paper, a novel STS is proposed for an NCS with data losses and communication delays. The next predicted sampling instant will be estimated with respect to the data losses and communication delays; the latest successfully transmitted time-stamped packets and the desired H ∞ performance. In comparison with some existing time-triggered sampling schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, the proposed scheme has an advantage in reduction the communication burden. In comparison with some existing self-triggered sampling schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, how to co-design the sampling scheme and the controller has been discussed. Notice that in the existing event-triggered sampling schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, the preselected eventtriggered condition must be checked at every sampling instant to decide whether the current sampling data should be transmitted or not over a communication-constrained wireless network. However, the proposed scheme in this paper can dynamically adjust the sampling interval without depending on the continuous/discrete measurement and on-line estimation of an event-triggered condition.</p><p>Notation: N denotes the set of positive integers.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. A NOVEL SELF-TRIGGERED SAMPLING SCHEME</head><p>Four theorems and an STS algorithm are provided in this section. In Subsection III-A, Theorem 1 is proposed to provide an event-triggered condition while preserving the desired control performance of the system (3). Theorem 2 is presented to evaluate the upper bound of the event-triggered condition in Theorem 1. In Subsection III-B, under consideration of the data loss and communication delay simultaneously, a novel STS is developed based on Theorems 1 and 2 to avoid real-time measurement and computation while reducing the utilization of limited network resources. Theorem 3 is provided to show that the desired performance is kept with the developed STS, and Theorem 4 is used to extend of Theorem 1 to tackle the controller design problem.</p></div>

Given τ m , ω, τ M , d M and L, where ω denotes the upper bound of the disturbance ω(t), τ M is the upper bound of the communication delay τ i k , d M is the allowable maximum number of consecutive data losses, and L denotes and the prescribed allowable maximum sampling interval between two consecutive samplings; Step 2. At f k , the self-triggered sensor begins to predict the next proximately violated instant p k+1 , which is the </p><formula xml:id="formula_23">λ 0 (t, f k , ω, x(i k ) ≤ x T (i k )Ψ 2 x(i k )<label>(19)</label></formula><p>In the case of p k+1 &gt; L+f k , one sets</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">p k+1 = L+f k ; Step 3.

For instance, Step 4 is used to to deal with an unreasonable case in the self-triggered sampling. From Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, it is seen that b k+1 &lt; f k , where the estimated sampling instant p k+1 is determined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, and the calculated next sampling instant b k+1 is computed based on Step 3. This implies that b k+1 should be carried out before f k . In other words, the sequence of next sampling instant f k and estimated sampling instant b k+1 is out of order. Thus, this initial predicted b k+1 is replaced by f k at Step 4.</p><p>From the above description, one can see that the proposed STS can be implemented in practice by taking data losses and communication delays into account.</p><p>Remark 4: Notice that the above mentioned STS includes cases of no data loss and constant communication delay in the communications as its special cases. For example, when there is no data loss in the communications, which means that d M = 0, one can derive that b k+1 = p k+1 in Step 3. In this case the proposed STS is still eligible.</p><p>Remark 5: If Step 4 is not included in Algorithm 1, it is possible that the next estimated instant b k+1 + τ m arriving at the actuator is less than the instant f k , that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">f k &gt; b k+1 +τ m .</formula><p>Clearly, it is not reasonable and should be avoided.

Since τ m is strictly larger than zero, on can conclude that H k &gt; 0. This is important since there is no Zeno behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> in the proposed scheme.</p><p>Remark 7: Notice that the the computation complexity of Algorithm 1 is dependent on the number of decision variables N and matrix rows L in ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>), and the searching step increment ζ to find the adaptive t in Step 2. The computation complexity of Algorithm 1 can be estimated as being proportional to N 3 Lζ -1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Since N = 3n 2 + 3n and L = 5n, where n is the given dimension of state variables in ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>), the searching precision and the computational complexity are related to ζ directly.

Therefore, different from Theorem 1, Theorem 2 does not depend on some specialized hardware for continuous measurement of the value of ρ(t). Moreover, notice that sufficient conditions ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">19</ref>) are derived in Theorems 1 and 2, and the allowable maximum number of consecutive data losses are considered in Algorithm 1, how to get fewer conservative criteria and algorithm are needed to be further study in the future.</p><p>As an extension of this work, define</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">X = P -1 , M = XM X, S = XSX, W = XW X, Q = XQX, Ñ = XN X and Y = KX.</formula><p>Then, pre-and post-multiplying both sides of ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>) with diag(X, I) and diag(X, X, X), respectively, and using Schur complement, one can readily derive the following Theorem based on Theorem 1.</p><p>Theorem 4: For a given scalar γ &gt; 0, the system (3) is asymptotically stable with an H ∞ norm bound γ and K = Y X -1 , if there exist matrices X &gt; 0, M &gt; 0, S &gt; 0, W &gt; 0, Q &gt; 0 and Ñ &gt; 0 of the appropriate dimensions such that the conditions ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_29">22</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_29">hold for t ∈ [f k , f k+1 ). i) for t ∈ [f k , f k+1 ), ρ T (t) Ψ1 ρ(t) ≤ x T (i k ) Ψ2 x(i k ),<label>(22)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">Ψ1 = X -1 M X -1 + X -1 SX -1 -X -1 W X -1 + X -1 Ñ X -1 &gt; 0 and Ψ2 = X -1 W X -1 - X -1 W Ñ -1 W X -1 -X -1 Y T D T DY X -1 &gt; 0; ii)     Ω B 1 √ 2XC T Y T D T B T 1 γ 2 I 0 0 √ 2CX 0 I 0 DY 0 0 I     &gt; 0<label>(23)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_31">  Q -W BY C T DY Y T B T M 0 Y T D T C 0 S   &gt; 0<label>(24)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">Ω = -(AX + BY ) -(XA + BY ) T -Q.

In general, the system (1) cannot be discretized due to the fact that there exists the unknown external disturbance in the system.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EXAMPLES</head><p>In this section, an inverted pendulum and a one-area power system controlled over IEEE 802.15.4-based wireless networks are used to illustrate the effectiveness of proposed sampling scheme.</p><p>Example 1: The state equation of an inverted pendulum is given as <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_34">ẋ(t) = 0 1 3(M+m)g l(4M+m) 0 x(t)+ 0 - 3 l(4M+m) u(t)+B 1 ω(t)<label>(26)</label></formula><p>where M = 8.0, g = 9.8, l = 0.5, m = 2.0, B 1 = [1 0.1] T , ω(t) = 0.01 |sin(t)|, and u(t) = [106.5970, 33.8599]x(i k ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Set γ = 200 and L = 0.36sec. First, we consider two cases: the constant communication delay τ i k = 0.09sec, and the time-varying communication delay on an interval, τ i k ∈ [0.03sec, 0.09sec]. With the different number of successive data losses, that is, d M = 1, 3, the used sampling instants and the predicted sampling instants based on Algorithm 1 are shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref><ref type="figure">5</ref><ref type="figure">6</ref><ref type="figure">7</ref>, where '⋄' is the practically used sampling instant, and '+' is the estimated sampling instant. One can see that from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> to Figure <ref type="figure">7:</ref> i) Most samplings occur at the initial adjustment period, and the sampling interval has lower and upper bounds;</p><p>ii) When the system states trend to the operating point, the proposed sampling scheme has the larger average sampling period while preserving the desired control performance; and iii) When the number of successive data losses increases, the allowable sampling intervals decrease. This shows that the proposed STS can adaptively adjust the sampling interval based on the allowable number of successive data losses. From <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, one can readily derive that the sampling interval should vary between 0.12sec and 0.36sec in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> and<ref type="figure">5</ref>,  and between 0.06sec and 0.36sec in Figures <ref type="figure">6</ref> and<ref type="figure">7</ref>. However, it can be seen that there are some special instants, such as those in 0-5 seconds, are lower than 0.12sec. As stated in Remark 6, the allowable lower bound of the sampling period is adopted in this special case. In addition, with the given initial condition x(0) = [2, -1] T , the system state responses are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>.</p><p>For the purpose of comparison, for a simulation time  Example 2: The load frequency control (LFC) of a onearea power system over a wireless network is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>, where ∆f , ∆P v , ∆P m and ∆P d denote the deviation of frequency, valve position, the generator output and power system load. M , R, D, T g and T ch denote the moment of inertia, speed drop, the generator damping coefficient, the time constant of the governor and the time constant of the turbine, respectively. Given the initial values of the parameters T ch = 0.3, T g = 0.1, R = 0.05, D = 1.0, β = 21.0, M = 10. By using a PI controller u(t) = -K P ACE -K I ACE, where ACE is the input of LFC, K p and K I are the pregiven proportional and integral gains, the dynamic model of the closed-loop power system with the LFC can be expressed as (3) with  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref> with constant and time-varying delays respectively, where '⋄' is the practically used sampling instant, and '+' is the estimated sampling instant. In the case of T = 20sec, one can get the number of transmitted packets is 251 with the proposed sampling scheme, in comparison with the time-triggered sampling adopted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, only 25.1% measured packets need to be transmitted over a wireless network. The corresponding state responses of system (3) is shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>. For further comparison, Table <ref type="table">II</ref> lists the number of the sampled packets for different sampling schemes. One can see that the number of sampled-data in the proposed STS is smaller than that in the traditional TTS.   V. CONCLUSION A novel STS has been proposed for a wireless NCS by considering the data losses and communication delays simultaneously. This scheme has an important role in reducing the utilization of the limited communication resources and energy while preserving the desired performance for the system under consideration. Based on the error estimation technique, the state value of the next sampling instant has been estimated without depending on on-line calculation of the event-triggered condition. Furthermore, the proposed STS can well adjust the sampling period with respect to the allowable number of consecutive data losses and the communication delays. Two examples on control of an inverted pendulum and LFC of a one-area power system have been given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed STS. The network-based performance tracking control of complex industrial processes with STS will be considered in the future research.</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">A =     -0.1 0.1 0 0 0 -3.33 3.33 0 -200 0 -10 0 21 0 0 0     , B =     0 0 -10 0     B 1 =     -0.1 0 0 0     , C =     21 0 0 0 0 0 0 1     T , K = K P K I Let L = 0.24sec, γ =</formula></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
