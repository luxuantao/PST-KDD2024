<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>It is generally recognised that the ability to reason with data which has a temporal dimension is an important attribute of many medical problem solving systems. However there is no single 'temporal dimension' -many variations are possible and include:</p><p>• Is the time between data samples constant or variable?</p><p>• What is the frequency of sampling? Clearly the description of a particular frequency as 'high' or 'low' will depend on the time-scales inherent in the process being observed. • Is one variable being sampled, or more than one? If we are sampling more than one, is the process being monitored such that we need to correlate changes in different variables? (We will use the term channel to refer to a series of samples from one variable). • Is the primary temporal construct the point or the interval?</p><p>• Is the final system intended to work in real time or retrospectively? In real time the only data available is in the past relative to the time at which we are trying to generate an interpretation. On the other hand, we may be trying to generate an interpretation for a given time series as a whole -for a time in the middle of that series we have both 'past' and 'future' data available.</p><p>• What is the goal of the interpretation? Many goals are legitimate: real-time alarming, diagnosis, treatment planning and monitoring, summarisation, clinical audit, etc. This paper is concerned specifically with data acquired from monitors in intensive care; the data come from several channels which are sampled regularly at relatively high frequencies; in the example which runs through this paper we look at two channels sampled once per second. Data samples are taken at time points, but our underlying temporal ontology is based on intervals. At present we consider our data retrospectively; however extension to real-time is one of our goals for the future.</p><p>Our current objective is the identification of specific events. By an event we mean a temporal interval over which the nature of the signal, usually in more than one channel, is characteristic of the occurrence of a particular process. The origins of the process may be external to the patient e.g. taking a blood sample or sucking out an endotrachael tube. Such events are generally referred to as artefacts in that they do not represent the true physiological state of the patient. Other events arise purely internally e.g. a pneumothorax. The distinction is not hard and fast -a blocked tube arises neither from the inherent physiological processes operating in the patient, nor is it the result of a totally external intervention. One reason for wanting to identify artefacts is to enable us to remove them from the data. However it may be of interest for audit purposes to know how often particular events take place.</p><p>In this paper we will discuss the interpretation of data from a neonatal ICU. The Mary<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">3</ref> system has been used in the Simpson Maternity Hospital, Edinburgh, for a number of years. Over that time a large data archive of over 1000 cases has been built up. A PC is located at each cot, and Mary is used to acquire, display and archive multi-channel data from the monitors.</p><p>The particular event we have worked with is the probe change. A small probe is attached to the baby's skin, and used to measure transcutaneous oxygen and carbon dioxide. Because the technology involves the underlying skin being heated, and because neonates have very delicate skin, the probe has to be lifted and re-sited every few hours to avoid permanent scarring. When the probe is removed the measured values move rapidly towards the O 2 and CO 2 levels in the atmosphere, the O 2 rising sharply and the CO 2 falling somewhat more slowly. On being replaced, the measured levels return to those corresponding to the levels in the blood -again the CO 2 levels respond more slowly than the O 2 .</p><p>The signals arising from events may be complex. However our observations in the COGNATE project shows that an experienced clinician can bring a considerable amount of background knowledge to their interpretation. The thesis developed in this paper is that although sophisticated mathematical techniques may have their place, capturing and representing expert knowledge is indispensable. However the very volume and richness of the data give rise to difficulties. Conventional knowledge acquisition normally includes sessions in which the expert is presented with a typical problem and comments on how (s)he arrives at an interpretation. When the data is sparse, individual data items can be referred to verbally ('the patient's history of anorexia'). However it is much more difficult to talk about a temporal pattern without being able to indicate which section of data is being referred to. For this reason we have developed a software tool (known as the Time Series Workbench) which displays multi-channel data and enables the expert to identify particular intervals in one or more channels and to attach a symbolic descriptor to each interval.</p><p>The organisation of the remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 sets out how the expert clinician uses the workbench to interact with examples of the event being analysed and to describe the features which will be used by the event detection system. This system is presented in Section 3 -it is based on an algorithm which automatically segments the time series into intervals and then passes these to a pattern matcher implemented as forward chaining rules. Section 4 summarises our preliminary results. Section 5 compares our approach with those of others and our final conclusions are presented in Section 6. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Knowledge Acquisition</head><p>Preliminary interviews with the expert are used to identify which type of event to investigate; we then build up a catalogue of examples of such events. The next step is to specify which features characterise the event. In our approach these have to be 1 2 3 4 5 -4 -specified as named temporal intervals with particular attributes. For probe changes our expert identified three main intervals in each of the O 2 and CO 2 channels: Removal, Atmosphere (when the probe is exposed to atmospheric levels) and Replacement. In addition, a preceding reference interval (Pre-Probe-Change) was also defined. It was further established that the slopes of the signals during the Removal and Replacement intervals were higher than normal.</p><p>We then formalised the characteristics of these features and their temporal relationships -for example the removal of a probe is defined by two overlapping intervals -an interval in which the O 2 rises with a slope of greater than S 1 and an interval in which the CO 2 falls at a rate greater than S 2 . Likewise for the probe replacement with its slopes S 3 and S 4 . The expert will often have a good idea as to what the values of the numerical parameters should be, but we can assist him by getting him to 'mark-up' a number of examples. Using the Workbench, he inspects the data for a particular event and drags the mouse over the data to identify, for each of the two channels, the four intervals defined above. Our expert marked up 45 probe changes in this way. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the data for a typical probe change; panels 1 and 3 show the expert's mark up. The meaning of panels 2, 4 and 5 will be explained later.</p><p>The timings of the intervals are recorded together with relevant statistics; currently we calculate the best fit straight line to the data points in the interval and record the mean and slope. These statistics are then analysed to derive values for the four slopes that we need. A histogram of values for the slopes of the signal during the O 2 Removal intervals is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Given that the expert has said that the slope during this interval is higher than normal, taking a value of 0.4 for S 1 means that the majority of such intervals will be identified. Similarly, values of -0.04, -0.03 and 0.005 were chosen in this way for S 2 , S 3 and S 4 respectively. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Automatic Segmentation</head><p>Our approach is based on temporal intervals. We therefore need a way of automatically segmenting the time series into a number of intervals in a meaningful way. Since we are interested in slopes it seems natural to approach segmentation from the point of view of trying to approximate to the data with a sequence of line segments. Panels 2 and 4 of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> present an example of the output of the algorithm that has been developed. It might be argued that higher order curve fitting would be more appropriate for some features, but linear fitting has the benefit of simplicity.</p><p>In essence the algorithm iterates by merging two adjacent intervals into a 'superinterval' until a halting condition is satisfied. It starts by converting the sequence of time points at which the samples occur into a sequence of elementary intervals. Thus if the samples are taken at times t i , t i+1 , t i+2 , etc, we construct intervals (t i , t i+1 ), (t i+1 , t i+2 ), etc. We then fit the best straight line to the data in each interval; since at this initial stage there are only two points per interval, the line passes through both points. The aim now is to decrease the number of intervals by selecting two adjacent intervals to merge. At each iteration we examine all pairs of adjacent intervals and calculate the regression line through the points in the super-interval that would be obtained by merging them. We define the error for the super-interval as the sum of the squares of the deviations of the points from the regression line (where n is the number of points in the potential super-interval):</p><p>We now select and perform the merge that minimises this error. In principle we could explore a search tree of possible merges. We have not investigated this possibility as we believe it to be computationally intractable, and have settled for the simpler 'greedy' approach.</p><p>Merging continues until the halting condition is satisfied. If merging were allowed to continue unchecked we would obtain one interval containing all the points in the time series. This is considered to be the 'worst case' segmentation; we therefore precompute the error for the entire time series and use this series error as a reference. As we iterate, we calculate the error (as defined above) for each interval and obtain the current error by summing these over all intervals (taking care not to double count the errors derived from the end points). The relative error at any particular iteration is defined as the ratio of the current error to the series error. Clearly the relative error is 0 before merging starts (as each line segment is fitted to two points with no error) and, unless the merging is halted, would ultimately rise to 1. Merging ceases when the relative error reaches a pre-set threshold. The lower this threshold, the earlier the merging will stop, the greater will be the number of intervals left, and the closer we</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( ( )) y mx c i i i n - + = 2 1</formula><p>-6 -will approximate to the original time series. More formally this best-fit algorithm is defined as follows:</p><p>• Decide on the relative error threshold;</p><p>• Use linear regression to fit the best line to all points t 1 -t N (where N is the number of points in the series); • Calculate the series error;</p><p>• FOR EACH of the N-1 time points t 1 .. t i .. t N in the time series construct an interval (t i , t i+1 ) -call this interval I i ; • REPEAT For each pair of adjacent intervals I i and I i+1 use linear regression to fit the best line to all the points in the potential super-interval and calculate the error; Find the lowest error; Merge the two corresponding intervals; Calculate the sum of the errors over all intervals -the current error • UNTIL (current error / series error) ≥ relative error threshold</p><p>We can get some indication of the appropriate value for the relative error threshold, by looking at the distribution of durations of the intervals which the expert has marked up; for probe changes this turns out to be in the range 100-300 seconds. We assume that once we have stopped merging, the average interval size should be comparable to the average interval duration as defined by the expert. The relationship between relative error and average duration can be investigated experimentally. For each example, we carry out the iterative best-fit, noting at each iteration the relative error and the average interval duration, letting the merging continue until a single interval is obtained. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the average (over 45 samples) duration for a given relative error for both channels. Once the average interval size is established we can work back to the relative error which would generate it. In this case it seems that to get an average duration in the range 100-300 seconds, we should set the relative error threshold around 10 -4 to 10 -3 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Pattern Matching</head><p>Event detection now proceeds as follows. Each channel is segmented using the best-fit algorithm. The slopes for each of the intervals is calculated. The set of intervals is passed to a forward chaining rule-based system with the following basic rules: The cumulative results for true positives are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. Our initial estimate for a suitable value for the relative error threshold of 10 -4 was perhaps too high; better results are obtained in the region of 10 -5 . It is difficult to know how to estimate the false positive rate as we do not have a fixed number of negative examples. For the 45 hours of data we looked at, the number of false positives is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. An additional complication was provided, in several cases, by the presence of one or more 'probe lift' events. Such an event occurs when the probe is not securely attached and, as the baby moves, the probe lifts temporarily from the skin, and the signals are perturbed briefly towards atmospheric levels before recovering. The origin and signature of such an event is very similar to a probe-change and indeed they are often followed by a probe change as the nurse resites the probe to get better adhesion. We felt that at this stage, since we had not asked our expert to identify probe lifts, it would be misleading to count them as false positives. We have kept a separate count of these and will investigate ways of distinguishing them from probe changes.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Rule: Probe-Off if ∃ interval,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Relationship to Previous Work</head><p>Temporal reasoning in medicine has attracted a considerable attention in recent years as a number of supporting theories and technologies have been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. However there is considerable variation in the nature of the underlying data and in the goal of the reasoning. It must be emphasised that in this paper we are concerned only with the detection of low level somewhat primitive events. Ultimately our techniques must be embedded in a system which generates higher levels of abstraction for monitoring, therapy planing, etc.</p><p>The merging algorithm described in Section 3 arose from previous work in our group <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. However Salatian's algorithm involved a more complex set of merging rules and required the setting of four numerical parameters, as opposed to our single relative error threshold.</p><p>Part of our approach is inspired by the Knowledge-Based Temporal Abstraction (KBTA) theory developed by Shahar <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The initial stage of our best-fit algorithm in which we construct elementary intervals from the raw data points is an instance of temporal interpolation. Similarly the merging of intervals into larger super-intervals may be considered as a form of horizontal temporal inferencing, albeit at the level of the raw data rather than at a higher level of abstraction. Finally (and somewhat obviously) the application of the event recognition rules is an instance of temporal pattern matching. The KBTA theory has been applied in a number of domains, but it would appear that these tend to be characterised by relatively large (and sometimes irregular) sampling intervals e.g. diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. At the level at which we are working, we do not need persistence functions since we assume that data samples are always available -and the 'absence' of data is recognised as, for example, a disconnection event. However once an event has been recognised as an artefact it needs to be removed from the raw data so that incorrect inferences are not drawn, and at that point we will need to appeal to some form of higher level temporal interpolation.</p><p>We have also been inspired by the trend template approach developed as part of the TrenDx system <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. TrenDx was initially developed in a domain (pediatric growth monitoring) in which the data frequency is somewhat low. It has been applied to the analysis of ICU data, but only to one patient; this makes it difficult to know how robust it will be in this type of domain. No indication is given as to how the trend templates are established -in contrast with our explicit approach to knowledge acquisition. Another major difference is that the extraction of features from the raw data by fitting regression lines and curves is an essential part of the attempt to instantiate a trend template. In our case the feature extraction (segmentation) is much more independent -the setting of the relative error threshold may depend on the event which we are trying to detect, but apart from that, feature extraction is complete before pattern matching starts.</p><p>Of obvious relevance is the VIE-VENT system for ventilator monitoring and therapy planning for neonates <ref type="bibr">[8.9]</ref>. The authors rightly point out <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> that in the ICU, validation of high frequency data is a sine-qua-non for the construction of reliable interpretations. Our intensively knowledge-based approach to interval-based validation is in contrast to their more statistical methods. Also VIE-VENT is designed to operate in real time -at present our technology is retrospective.</p><p>As the number of different types of event increases and as their temporal relationships become more complex we will need to look at more general theories of temporal reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>There is some way to go before we can claim that we have a robust technique for knowledge-based event detection of general applicability. However we believe that the preliminary results reported in this paper are encouraging. In particular we consider that the best-fit algorithm may be of interest to others. Our plans for the future include:</p><p>• verifying our approach on other event types (e.g. endotracheal suction, probe recalibration, etc.); • extending the best-fit algorithm to run in real-time;</p><p>• looking at the possibility of applying machine learning techniques to the set of marked up examples; it may be that the features that our expert has selected are not the most discriminatory; • extending the workbench so that think-aloud protocols can be recorded digitally and replayed in synchrony with the actions of the expert while browsing the data; • applying our approach to other domains -we are looking at the analysis of data from gas turbines, refrigerated food display cabinets, and the results of ecological A-life simulations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
