The most commonly used quadratic penalty often oversmoothes edges and fine features in reconstructed images. Nonquadratic penalties can preserve edges but often introduce piece-wise constant blocky artifacts and the results are also sensitive to the hyper-parameter that controls the shape of the penalty function. This paper presents a patch-based regularization for iterative image reconstruction that uses neighborhood patches instead of individual pixels in computing the nonquadratic penalty. The new regularization is more robust than the conventional pixel-based regularization in differentiating sharp edges from random fluctuations due to noise. An optimization transfer algorithm is developed for the penalized maximum likelihood estimation. Each iteration of the algorithm can be implemented in three simple steps: an EM-like image update, an image smoothing and a pixel-by-pixel image fusion. Computer simulations show that the proposed patch-based regularization can achieve higher contrast recovery for small objects without increasing background variation compared with the quadratic regularization. The reconstruction is also more robust to the hyper-parameter than conventional pixel-based nonquadratic regularizations. The proposed regularization method has been applied to real 3-D PET data.</p><p>Index Terms-Image reconstruction, patch regularization, penalized maximum likelihood, positron emission tomography.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I TERATIVE reconstruction techniques have been increas- ingly used in positron emission tomography (PET) to improve image quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Comparing to analytical reconstruction (e.g., filtered backprojection), iterative reconstruction can make use of noise statistics, accurate system modeling, and image prior knowledge. Maximum likelihood (ML) reconstruction method estimates image from projections by maximizing the log likelihood of PET data. However, a true ML solution can be very noisy, so some form of regularization is necessary to stabilize the image estimation. It is commonly achieved by either terminating the iteration before convergence or by using a penalty function to encourage spatially smooth images.</p><p>Here we focus on the latter approach. An ideal regularization function should be able to preserve two conflicting properties of PET images: spatial smoothness within a region and sharp transition at region boundaries. However, the success has been limited with existing regularization functions. The most commonly used quadratic penalty often oversmoothes edges and small objects in reconstructed images. Nonquadratic penalties can preserve edges but often introduce piece-wise constant blocky artifacts and the results can be sensitive to the value of the hyper-parameter that controls the shape of the penalty function.</p><p>We postulate that the main reason for the instability of traditional nonquadratic penalties is that the image roughness is calculated based on the intensity difference between neighboring pixels. When an image is noisy, pixel intensity differences are not reliable in distinguishing real edges from noisy fluctuation.</p><p>To overcome this problem, we propose a patch-based regularization that uses neighborhood patches instead of individual pixels in measuring image roughness. Since it compares the similarity between patches, the patch-based regularization is expected to be more robust than pixel-based regularizations. In addition to being edge preserving, patch-based regularization can also preserve features or texture within patches, which may have important applications beyond PET image reconstruction.</p><p>The patch-based regularization presented in this paper is closely related to the nonlocal regularization that has been studied in the context of image restoration <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and image reconstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. However, existing nonlocal regularization methods either require a preknown reference image for constructing the weight function or involve a nonconvex optimization (see Section III for more discussions). In image reconstruction, a good reference image is not directly available before reconstruction. A nonconvex optimization often suffers from unstable image estimation because of multiple local solutions. In comparison, the proposed regularization does not require a reference image before reconstruction and has a convex objective function, which allows us to derive an optimization transfer algorithm that guarantees convergence to the penalized likelihood solution. Part of this work was previously presented at the 2011 International Symposium of Biomedical Imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Yang and Jacob also presented a similar work at the same conference but focused on nonconvex penalty functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and applications in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p></div>

PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD RECONSTRUCTION</head><p>PET data can be well modeled as a collection of independent Poisson random variables with the log likelihood function as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> The expected data is related to the unknown image through an affine transform <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> where is the system matrix with denoting the probability of detecting an event originated at pixel by detector pair , accounts for background events such as randoms and scatters.</p><p>is the total number of detector pairs and is the total number of pixels in image.

Other examples of nonquadratic convex penalty functions include the hyperbola function , the Huber function <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and the penalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Nonconvex penalty functions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>) have also been proposed to form even sharper edges in reconstructed images. One problem with nonquadratic penalty functions is that reconstructed images are often very sensitive to the hyper-parameter and there has been no practical method to select the optimum value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PATCH-BASED REGULARIZATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Definition</head><p>We propose to use a patch associated with each pixel in calculating the image roughness between neighboring pixels and . Here, a patch of a pixel is defined as a square region centered at that pixel and all patches in an image share the same size. The new roughness function based on patches is defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> where is a feature vector consisting of intensity values of all pixels in the patch centered at pixel . The patch-based distance between pixel and is measured by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> where denotes the th pixel in the patch of pixel and denotes the th pixel in the patch of pixel , both having the same geometric relationship with respect to their center pixels.</p><p>is the total number of pixels in a patch. is a positive weighting factor equal to the normalized inverse spatial distance between pixel and pixel with <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> The pixel-based regularization in (4) can be considered as a special case of the patch-based regularization with . To obtain a convex penalized likelihood function, we require the penalty functions to satisfy the following conditions.</p><p>1) The function is symmetric and differentiable everywhere.</p><p>2) The first-order derivative <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> is nondecreasing (and hence is convex).</p><p>3) The curvature <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> is nonincreasing for , and . The above conditions are the same as those for the pixel-based convex regularizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The penalty is convex with respect to because it is a nondecreasing convex function of the convex norm function of ([21, p.84]). Therefore, the patch-based penalty given in ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) is convex for any that satisfies the above conditions. Examples of include the quadratic function, Huber function, Lange function, and hyperbola function. Note that when is the quadratic function, the patch-based regularization is equivalent to the pixel-based quadratic regularization with a scaled .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Relation to Other Work</head><p>Recently, nonlocal regularization has been proposed for image restoration, motivated by the work of nonlocal means filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Buades et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> proposed the regularization model <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> where is a reference image and is the nonlocal means defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> The weight function is often calculated on the reference image using patches <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> where is a filter parameter.</p><p>Kindermann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> proposed a general form for nonlocal regularization <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> in which nonlocal means filters can be interpreted as one step of fixed-point iteration when the Yaroslavsky function and patch-based distance are employed. Note that the regularization form defined in ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) is quite similar to the penalty function given in (4) but with the weights calculated based on a reference image.</p><p>A major problem with the nonlocal Yaroslavsky functional is that the corresponding optimization problem is hard to solve because the objective function is nonconvex. Inspired by the spectral graph, Gilboa and Osher <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> proposed to use the quadratic function to keep the objective function convex. Later, nonlocal total variation (TV) regularization was proposed for better preservation of structures than the nonlocal quadratic regularization <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. A general form of the penalty function is given by Elmoataz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> (17) with for the nonlocal TV regularization. Note that (17) reduces to the regular TV penalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> when and the neighboring pixels consist of the first-order nearest neighbors.</p><p>The nonlocal TV model has been applied to image reconstruction for computed tomography (CT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and for MRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>All the regularization models stated above rely on the weights that are calculated on a reference image . The reference image is usually required to be as close as possible to the true image so that they share the same structures. This might not be a problem for image denoising because a noisy image can be used directly as the reference image. However, for tomographic image reconstruction, a good reference image is not readily available before image reconstruction, although people have used filtered backprojection reconstruction as the reference image <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Alternatively, the weights in nonlocal regularizations can be computed on the unknown image and estimated simultaneously to avoid the need of a prior image and to improve the estimation precision <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. However, this leads to a complicated nonconvex optimization problem. Empirical iterative implementations are often used, which calculate the weights based on the current image estimate and then update the image assuming that the weights are fixed constants <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. However, no proof of global convergence has been established for this type of algorithms.</p><p>It is worth noting that the weights in ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) can also be determined without using patches and it has long history in Bayesian image reconstruction. One early example is the line site model where the weights were adaptively determined to preserve edges <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Anatomical CT or MRI images can also be used to define the line sites in PET or SPECT image reconstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Another example is the level set based regularization which estimates the weights using nonlocal boundary information <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Limitations of these approaches include either the challenging nonconvex optimization or the requirement of a perfectly aligned anatomical image.</p><p>In comparison, the regularization model presented in this paper has a convex objective function and does not require a prior reference image. In the next section, we shall present a deterministic optimization algorithm that guarantees global convergence.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Optimization Transfer</head><p>We develop an optimization transfer algorithm for the PL reconstruction using the patch-based regularization. The basic idea of optimization transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> is to construct a surrogate function of the image at the th iteration which minorizes the original objective function by satisfying the following two conditions: (18) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> where denotes the gradient with respect to . Then the maximization of is transferred into maximizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> The surrogate function is usually easier to optimize than the original objective function by design. The new update increases the original penalized likelihood monotonically <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> and this minorization-maximization procedure guarantees the convergence. The well-known expectation maximization (EM) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> is a special case of the optimization transfer algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Likelihood Surrogate</head><p>For the log-likelihood function, we borrow the surrogate function from the ML EM (expectation maximization) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> (22) where <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> and is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> where the expected projection at iteration is <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> From the derivation of the ML EM algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, we know that the surrogate function satisfies</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(26)<label>(27)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Penalty Surrogate</head><p>For a penalty function satisfying the three conditions described in Section III-A, the following quadratic surrogate function can be constructed <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>: <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> where and are defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> and ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>), respectively, and is a function of the known estimate but is independent of the unknown . Replacing and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> by and , we get the following surrogate function at iteration for the patch-based penalty term in (8) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> where the term related to is omitted and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> It is easy to show</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(31)<label>(32)</label></formula><p>By expanding the quadratic term in (29) for each neighborhood and combining together the pairs from different neighborhoods, the surrogate can be simplified to <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> where <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> with and denoting the th pixels in the patch and patch , respectively. Equation ( <ref type="formula">33</ref>) is in the same form as the nonlocal quadratic regularization, but with the weight adaptively determined by the penalty function and the current estimate at each iteration.</p><p>To obtain a closed-form update equation, we derive a separable surrogate function for the surrogate using the De Pierro's decoupling rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>: <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref> Applying the above inequality to Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> and combining all the terms involving , we obtain the following separable surrogate function <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref> where the pixel-wise weight is <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref> and the intermediate image is calculated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref> which corresponds to a local smoothing operation. A constant that is independent of has been omitted in . It is easy to prove that (39) (40) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Proposed Algorithm</head><p>The optimization of the original objective function is now transferred to the optimization of the combined surrogate function. The image is updated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref> which can be performed pixel-by-pixel (42) The above update equation reduces to the ML-EM formula when . This optimization transfer algorithm guarantees a monotonic convergence to the global solution when the penalty function satisfies the three conditions given in Section III-A. The whole algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Comparison With Pixel-Based Regularization</head><p>The proposed algorithm can be applied to both patch-based regularization and pixel-based regularization . The only difference between pixel-based regularization and patch-based regularization is the value of the weight . We use a noise-free step-edge image and a noisy image shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> to demonstrate the benefit of the patch-based regularization. We pick an edge pixel as the th pixel and compute the weights for the pixels in a 7 7 neighborhood of pixel , where is either the noise-free step-edge image or the noisy image. The Lange function is used here as the penalty function, with the curvature . The left column of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the images of the pixel-based weights. For the noise free image, the resulting weights are as expected with the pixels on the right-hand side of the image having higher weights than those on the left-hand side. However, weights are unstable for the noisy image and are also sensitive to the hyper-parameter that controls the shape of penalty function. For comparison, the weights calculated using 3 3 patches are shown in the right column of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Higher values are concentrated along the step edge because only these pixels share a similar patch pattern to the central pixel. The weights are fairly robust to the image noise and insensitive to the change of value.</p><p>The robustness of the patch-based weight comes from two factors: 1) the patch distance is computed based on pixels, so it is less sensitive to noise than pixel distance; 2) the weight in ( <ref type="formula">34</ref>) is a spatial average of . We expect that the patch-regularization will result in more robust image reconstruction.</p><p>While the weight given in ( <ref type="formula">34</ref>) is derived for the optimization transfer algorithm, it plays a critical role in preserving edges at convergence. To illustrate this point, let be the solution at convergence. The KKT condition states that must satisfy (46)</p><p>Substituting the matched gradient condition (32) into the above equation results in (47)</p><p>For each pixel , we have (48) Equation ( <ref type="formula">48</ref>) shows that the penalty of the pixel intensity difference between pixel and pixel is weighted by at convergence. Therefore, the patch-based regularization can preserve edges by adaptively computing the weighting factor , although the edges may not be as sharp as in pixelbased regularization because of the averaging operation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>. The quadratic regularization does not preserve edges because the corresponding is always unity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. COMPUTER SIMULATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Setup</head><p>Computer simulations were conducted to validate the proposed patch-based regularization algorithm. We simulated a GE Discovery ST PET scanner in 2-D mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The scanner has 420 crystals per ring with each crystal having a cross section of mm . A brain phantom [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(a)</ref>] was used to simulate PET tracer distribution in the gray matter, white matter and a tumor. The noise-free image was forward projected to generate a noise-free sinogram. A uniform background of 25% total true coincidences was added to simulate the random and scatter fraction in 2-D <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Independent Poisson noise was then introduced to generate 100 realizations, each having an expected total number of events equal to 500 k. Images were reconstructed by the ML EM algorithm and the penalized likelihood method with three different regularizations: the quadratic penalty, the pixel-based Lange penalty, and the proposed patch-based Lange penalty. The noisefree background sinogram was included in the forward model (2) for scatter and random correction. Two hundred iterations were used in each reconstruction. All images were represented by 111 111 pixels with a pixel size of mm . The patch size and the neighborhood size were both 3 3 pixels unless noted otherwise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Comparison With Pixel-Based Regularizations</head><p>The images reconstructed by different approaches are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>  regularization with , respectively. Both methods oversmoothed the tumor in order to control the noise in the brain region. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(d)-(f)</ref> shows the images reconstructed using the pixel-based edge-preserving Lange regularization with but different hyper-parameter values , 0.01, 0.001. Edges of the grey matter and tumor are preserved in the reconstructions. However, the resulting images are sensitive to the value of the hyper-parameter . In comparison, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(g)-(i)</ref> show the reconstructions using the patch-based Lange regularization with the same set of parameters. The tumor target is well preserved and the results are insensitive to the change of the hyper-parameter . This is because that the patch distance has a much smaller variance than the pixel distance and the spatial average in the weight calculation substantially reduces the chance of generating isolated noisy pixels. As long as is less than the minimum patch distance of true edges, the final reconstruction is insensitive to the exact value of . This greatly simplifies the selection of the hyperparameter in the edge-preserving regularization.</p><p>Quantitatively we compare the ensemble mean of tumor contrast recovery coefficient (CRC) versus the standard deviation of background noise as a function of the smoothing parameter between the quadratic regularization and patch regularization in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. The CRC of the th reconstructed image is calculated by <ref type="bibr">(49)</ref> where is the true contrast, denotes the mean activity of the tumor region and denotes the mean activity of the white matter region (background). Here, the true tumor and white matter regions are used. The results clearly indicate that the patch-based regularization can achieve higher contrast recovery (better performance) than the quadratic regularization at any given background noise level.</p><p>The comparison between the patch-based regularization and the pixel-based Lange regularization is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Each group contains four curves corresponding to different hyper-parameter values . As changes, the per- formance of the pixel-based Lange regularization changes dramatically, indicating the hyper-parameter has to be selected carefully for the pixel-based regularization. In comparison, the performance of the patch-based Lange regularization is insensitive to the change of value and achieves higher CRC at any given background SD level, which demonstrates that the patch-based regularization is more robust than the pixel-based regularization for image reconstruction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Effects of the Neighborhood Size and Patch Size</head><p>The computational cost of the patch regularization depends heavily on the patch size and neighborhood size. For fast computation, smaller patch and neighborhood are preferred. In addition, large patches may not be able to identify small image features and hence cannot preserve the corresponding edges. Here we study the effect of the neighborhood size and patch size on image quality. Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> shows the tumor contrast recovery versus the background SD curves for five different neighborhood sizes (3 3, 5 5, 7 7, 9 9, and <ref type="bibr">11 11)</ref>. The patch size was 3 3 and . The 3 3 neighborhood was found to have the best performance amongst all the cases studied, except at very low  standard deviation levels. The loss of performance with large neighborhood window can be due to the accumulation of small weights of nonsimilar patches, which biases the results <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>The effect of the patch size on the tumor contrast recovery is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>. The neighborhood window was set to 3 3 and the hyper-parameter was 0.01. Except for the patch size , which reduces to the pixel-based regularization, there are little difference in the performance among the other three patch sizes (3 3, 5 5, <ref type="bibr">7 7)</ref>.</p><p>The effects of neighborhood window size and patch size were also investigated at a lower count level of 150 k events and 25% background. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>. Except with an increase of background noise, the plots are similar to those at 500 k count level. Overall, 3 3 pixels appears to be a good choice for the neighborhood size and patch size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. APPLICATION TO REAL 3-D DATA</head><p>We applied the proposed algorithm to a 3-D nonhuman primate data set acquired on a microPET P4 scanner <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. The radiotracer is 23390 which binds to dopamine D1 receptors in the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The total number of prompt events is 3.6 M and number of delayed events is 1.3 M. Randoms were pre-corrected by the delayed window technique. A transmission scan was performed to estimate the attenuation map. Scatter sinogram was estimated by using the single-scatter simulation method <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The estimated scatter fraction was 24%. The estimated scatter sinogram and attenuation factors were incorporated into the forward model of the PL reconstruction. All images were reconstructed using an array of with a voxel size of mm . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref> shows the images reconstructed using the pixel-based quadratic regularization and the patch-based Lange regularization. The pixel-based Lange regularization was not shown here because the result highly depends on the hyper-parameter . Within each group, the left column shows the transverse, coronal and sagittal slices through the striatum regions, while the right column shows the slices through the eye glands. These regions were chosen because of their high uptake of the PET tracer. In the patch regularization, both the neighborhood and patch size were . The hyper-parameter in the Lange function was set to 0.001. The regularization parameters were for the quadratic regularization and for the patch regularization. They were chosen to match the background noise level.</p><p>Uptakes in regions of interest were quantified using the AMIDE software <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> to compare the quadratic regularization and the patch regularization. Ten spherical ROIs of 8 mm in diameter were randomly placed in the background regions of the brain as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref>. Another four ROIs were drawn in the striatum and gland regions, which have higher uptake. The mean and standard deviation of the activities inside each ROI are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref>. As expected, the two regularization methods have similar quantitative results for the background ROIs. However, the patch regularization produces higher uptake in the striatum and gland regions than the quadratic regularization. In particular, the average intensity of the two gland ROIs (3 and 4) obtained by the patch regularization is more than 30% higher than that obtained by the quadratic regularization.</p><p>The higher contrast recovery of the patch regularization is consistent with the expectation and simulation results. However, because no ground truth is available, we cannot perform any conclusive comparison for the real data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have proposed a patch-based regularization method for PET image reconstruction and developed an optimization algorithm to find the penalized likelihood solution. The proposed algorithm is validated by computer simulations. The results show that the patch-based regularization can achieve better quantitative performance than the commonly used quadratic regularization and the traditional pixel-based nonquadratic regularization. The application to the real primate brain data also showed promising results. The full benefit of the proposed algorithm for real PET studies will be evaluated in future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
