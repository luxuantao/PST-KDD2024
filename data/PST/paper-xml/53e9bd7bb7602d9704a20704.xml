<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Wireless Sensor Networks are comprised of a very large number of micro-sensors, which form an ad-hoc network communicating with each other wirelessly. The micro-sensors are deployed in an area of interest, in order to e.g. monitor crucial events and propagate the collected results to a base station, which is usually called the sink. There are many important applications of such networks ranging from military applications to environmental studies, based on the existence of a wide variety of sensor types, such as for temperature, motion, noise, seismic activity etc ( see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> for an excellent survey).</p><p>The dramatic progress in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) regarding the design and implementation of low-power electronics and low-power RF communication systems, has already led to small sized, low power and relatively inexpensive wireless sensors with important applications. However, wireless micro-sensors have to operate under severe limitations in their computational power, data storage, the quality of communication and, most crucially, their available amount of energy.Thus, the efficient distributed cooperation of sensor devices towards achieving a large computational and communication goal is a challenging task.</p><p>An important goal in the design and efficient implementation of wireless sensor networks is to save energy and keep the network functional for as long as possible. Towards this goal, various approaches including hop-by-hop transmission techniques ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>), as well as clustering techniques ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>) and alternating power-saving modes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> have been proposed. Energy aware data gathering protocol have been introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>All such techniques do not explicitly take care of possible overuse of certain sensors in the network. As an example, remark that in hop-by-hop transmissions towards the sink, the sensors lying closer to the sink tend to be utilized exhaustively (since all data passes through them). Thus, these sensors may die out very early, thus resulting to network collapse although there may be still significant amounts of energy in the other sensors of the network.</p><p>For a survey of data propagation protocols in wireless sensor networks, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. For a focused discussion of energy efficiency issues, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. For some recent research on energy efficiency and fault tolerance see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. For a random graph theoretic model that captures proximity and seems approperiate for wireless networks see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>Our Contribution. In the light of the above, one should try to combine energy efficiency with a balanced spread of energy consumption among sensors.</p><p>In this paper, we propose and analyze an energy efficient and energy balanced algorithm for data propagation in sensor networks. The energy balance property of the algorithm ensures that the average energy dissipation per sensor is the same throughout the execution of the protocol in all sensors.</p><p>In particular, for the analysis we assume a random uniform placement of sensors in the network area and a random uniform generation of events. Once a data message reaches a sensor, it is either propagated one hop closer to the sink or it is sent directly to the sink. The choice of whether to forward one hop or send directly is done locally at each sensor, in a probabilistic manner.</p><p>By a detailed analysis, we accurately estimate these probabilities in a recurrent way, that can be supported by current sensors computing technology. We note that these probabilities are found to depend only on the network size and the distance of each particular sensor from the sink. Under certain assumptions, we also provide a simple closed form for the probability p i to forward one-hop further. In particular, we show that p i = 1 -3x (i+1)(i-1) , where x is a free (e.g. con-trolling) parameter and i is related to the sensor's distance to the sink.</p><p>We note that, although we here present a specific model for energy dissipation in data transmission, our results can be easily extended to any energy cost model.</p><p>We also note that our protocol, besides being energy balanced is also energy efficient, in the sense that our analysis shows that, for guaranteeing energy balancedness, most transmissions must be one-hop transmissions, thus data is mostly transmitted along small distances and thus the overall energy consumption in the network is kept low.</p><p>Related Work. Our work has been inspired by the fundamental relevant work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> where the authors define the energy balancedness property and propose, analyze and evaluate an energy-optimal and energy balanced algorithm for sorting in wireless sensor networks. In particular, they consider a single-hop sensor network. Thus, our work extends their approach to the general case of a multi-hop network and for the (quite general) problem of propagating data to the sink.</p><p>Roadmap. In the next section (Section 2) we present the network model and define the problem of energy balanced data propagation. In Section 3 we present the distributed algorithm we propose. After some preliminary material in Section 4, we provide some simple examples of analysis in small networks, to get a feeling of the underlying ideas for the evaluation of the forwarding probability. In Section 6, we then carry out a detailed analysis of the general case leading to an accurate estimation of forwarding probabilities and discuss its behaviour for when we vary some parameters of the network. In Section 7 we provide a simple closed form for these probabilites under some assumptions that we discuss. Finally, in Section 8 we provide the analysis of the case where energy dissipation on the receipt of a data message is not negligible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The model and the problem</head><p>We assume that crucial events, that should be reported to a control center, occur in the network area. Furthermore, we assume that these events are happening at random uniform positions. Let N be their total number in a certain period (i.e. during the execution of the protocol).</p><p>The sensors are spread in the network area randomly uniformly so their number in a certain area is proportional to the area's size. There is a single point in the network, which Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> Sensor Network with n ring sectors, angle φ and ring "width" R we call the "sink" S, that represents the fixed control center where data about event realization should be reported to. The sink is very powerful, in terms of both energy and computing power. Sensors can be aware of the direction (and position) of the sink, as well as of their distance to the sink. Such information can be easily obtained during a set-up phase, by having the (powerful) sink broadcast control messages to the entire network area. We assume the transmission range of sensors can vary with time (in fact for each sensor our protocol may use only two different ranges: R and i • R, where R is set by the network operator and i can be defined as i = d/R with d to be the sensor's distance from the sink). We indeed assume a strong network model where all sensors are able to reach the sink in one hop. Similar modeling assumptions are made in the state-of-the-art (see e.g. the LEACH clustering protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>). However, we note that this strong assumption does not trivialize the problem: former protocol with the same strong modeling assumptions are not energy balanced (see Section 2). The sensors do not move.</p><p>We virtually "cover" the network area by a disk sector of angle φ (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The disk sector is divided into n ring sectors or "slices". The first slice has radius R (i.e. the sensors' transmission range). Slice i (2 ≤ i ≤ n) is defined by two successive disk sectors, one of radius i • R and the other of radius (i -1) • R. Taking a sufficiently large angle φ and/or by taking multiple sectors, we can cover the whole area.</p><p>As far as energy dissipation is concerned, we assume that the energy spent at a sensor when transmitting data messages is proportional to the square of the transmitting distance. Our protocol's performance analysis can be however extended to any energy cost model. The size of messages is considered to be constant. Note that the energy dissipation for receiving a data message is not always negligible with respect to the energy when sending such as in case when transmissions are too short and/or radio electronics energy is high (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>). In the analysis, initially, we only count (for simplicity) energy spent during transmissions. Since however in our protocol (see next section) there is one receipt for each transmission, it is clear that even when energy during receipt is more or less the same as energy during transmissions, the analysis can be extended easily to the full case (counting both transmissions and receipts). In fact, in Section 8 we explicitly provide the analysis of the full case.</p><p>Definition 1. The area between two consecutive cycle sectors is called a ring sector (or "slice"). Let T i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) be the i-th ring sector of the network.</p><p>T 1 stands for the ring sector with center the sink and radius equal to R. Definition 2. Let S i be the area size of the ring sector T i of the network (1</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">≤ i ≤ n).</formula><p>We wish to solve the "energy balanced data propagation problem", i.e. to propagate data to the sink in such a way that the "average" energy dissipation in each sensor is at each time the same. The average energy dissipation per sensor is taken to be the fraction of the total energy spent by sensors in a ring sector over the number of sensors in that sector. Because of our assumption that the number of sensors in an area is proportional to the area size, the average energy dissipation per sensor is calculated by dividing the total energy spent in a sector by the sector size.</p><p>We do not study here medium access aspects, assuming the existence of underlying MAC protocol.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The distributed data propagation protocol</head><p>We assume that each event is sensed by only one sensor. This assumption is not restrictive since we may consider multiple sensing and propagation of an event by various sensors as sensing and propagation of many different events. A sensor sensing an event generates a data message which should be eventually delivered to the sink. On each ring sector, T i , a number of events occur and a corresponding number of messages (one for each event) is generated.</p><p>Randomization is used to achieve some "load balancing" by evenly spreading the "load" (energy dissipation). In particular, on ring sector T i each event is propagated to T i-1 (i.e. the "next" sector towards the sink) with probability p i , while with probability 1p i it is propagated directly to the sink S. Each message in T i is handled stochastically independently of the other events' messages.</p><p>The choice of probability p i for T i is made so as the average energy consumption per area unit (and thus per sensor) is the same for the whole network. There is a trade-off from choosing p i : if p i increases then transmissions tend to happen locally, thus energy consumption is low, however sensors closer to the sink tend to be overused since all data passes through them. On the other hand, if p i decreases, there are distant transmissions (thus a lot of energy is consumed) however closer to sink particles are bypassed. Calculating the appropriate probability p i for each T i and solving the problem of energy balance is very important since it combines efficient data propagation with increased network's lifetime.</p><p>By using an underlying subprotocol we can guarantee that only one "next hop" sensor receives the transmitted message. Such a subprotocol can be any protocol that uses a (cheap) search phase to locate a "next" particle towards the sink and then directly transmits to that particle only. Such protocols are e.g. Directed Diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the Local Target Protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Note also that data messages are of fixed size i.e. no further information is added to a message on its route towards the sink.</p><p>Our protocol is (a) distributed, since each sensor chooses propagation probability independently of other sensors, (b) it uses only local information, in the sense that p i depends only on i, i.e. a parameter related to the distance from the sink. Note that distance from the sink info for each sensor can be easily obtained i.e. during a set-up phase where the sink broadcasts control messages to the network. Several techniques (including signal attenuation evaluation) can be used to estimate each sensor's distance for the sink. (c) The protocol is very simple, since it just uses a random choice based only on parameter i.</p></div>

The value of λ i is computed by the following lemma.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 3.

Because of the fact that events occur randomly uniformly in the network area we have that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">λ 1 = S 1 n i=1 S i = 1 n i=1 (2i -1) = 1 n 2</formula><p>Taking into consideration the random uniform distribution of the events in the network area and using Lemma 2, we have that λ i = (2i -1)λ 1 and the result is proved.</p><p>Let us now consider sector T i . We below provide the following basic definition: Definition 4. An area T i "handles" an event generated in ring sector j if either the message was generated in the area T i (i.e. j = i) or the message was propagated to T i from the ring sector T i+1 .</p><p>It is clear that, by the design of our algorithm, these options above are the only possible, since data is either propagated to the "next" sector or it is sent directly to the sink.</p><p>We now define energy i j spent for message j when sector i handles it. Definition 5. Let i j a random variable which measures the energy that dissipates the sector T i so as to handle the message j. For i j we have that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">i j = cR 2 with probability p i c(i R) 2 with probability 1 -p i</formula><p>where cR 2 is the energy dissipation for sending a message j from T i to its adjacent ring sector T i-1 and c is a constant.</p><p>Thus, the expected energy dissipation in sector i for handling a message is</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">E[ i, j ] = cR 2 • [i 2 -p i (i 2 -1)]<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Note: The expected energy above is the same for all messages; we use j just for counting purposes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remark:</head><p>We have used a special case for the energy cost model, for simplicity reasons. As will become evident in the analysis sections, our results can be easily extended to any cost model. Definition 6.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Small cases</head><p>As will become evident in the next sections, the calculation of probabilities p i is very complicated. In order to first get a feeling and an intuition for the general solution, we first solve some small cases. In particular, before calculating the values of p i for the general case of n sectors and N messages, we will give an example of this calculation for two special cases.</p><p>In the first case we calculate the values of p i 's for 2 sectors and 2 messages, (i.e. n = 2 and N = 2), while in the next subsection we provide in the next subsection the calculation for n = 3 and N = 2.</p><p>From Lemma 3 we have that</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">λ i = 2i -1 n 2</formula><p>In the specific case it is n = 2 thus λ 1 = 1 4 and λ 2 = 3 4 . There are three different possibilities concerning the distribution of events into sectors and the probability of each possibility is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Pr{2 events occur in sector 2} = (λ 2 ) 2 = 3 4 2 = 9 16 (case a)</formula><p>Pr{1 event occurs in each sector}</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">= 2λ 2 • λ 1 = 2 3 4 1 4 = 6 16 (case b)</formula><p>Pr{2 events occur in sector 1}</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">= (λ 1 ) 2 = 1 4 2 = 1 16 (case c)</formula><p>For each one of the three cases above we calculate the average energy that each sector dissipates. Here, for simplification of the calculations we consider R = 1 and c = 1. Thus the energy dissipation for one hop transmission is 1 and for an i-hops transmission it is i 2 . Thus we get:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">case a: sector 2: 2 • p 2 2 + 5 • 2 p 2 (1 -p 2 ) + 8(1 -p 2 ) 2 sector 1: 2 p 2 2 + 1 • 2 p 2 (1 -p 2 ) case b: sector 2: 1 • p 2 + 4(1 -p 2 ) sector 1: 2 • p 2 + 1(1 -p 2 )</formula><p>case c: sector 2: 0 sector 1: 2</p><p>To calculate the average energy dissipation per sensor in each ring sector we divide by sector area sizes:</p><p>Sector 2</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">E[E 2 ] S 2 = 9 16 2 • p 2 2 + 5 • 2 p 2 (1 -p 2 ) + 8(1 -p 2 ) 2 + 6 16 [ p 2 + 4(1 -p 2 )] 3 φ 2 1 2</formula><p>Sector 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">E[E 1 ] S 1 = 9 16 2 p 2 2 + 2 p 2 (1 -p 2 ) + 6 16 [2 • p 2 + 1(1 -p 2 )]+2 1 16 3 φ 2 1 2</formula><p>By taking</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">E[E 1 ] S 1 = E[E 2 ]</formula><p>S 2 we can solve for p 2 . The solution to this equation is</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">p 2 = 1 2</formula><p>Note. In this case (and also in the next) we remark that p 1 can be arbitrary. This is also verified by the general analysis (in the resulting recurrence relation the sequence term corresponding to p 1 is a free parameter).</p><p>The 2 × 3 case. An interesting special case is that in which there are 3 sectors and 2 messages. (i.e. n = 3 and N = 2). We take R = 1 (for calculation simplicity). By using Lemma 3 we calculate the values of λ i : λ 1 = 1 9 , λ 2 = 1 3 and λ 3 = 5 9 . There are six different cases concerning the distribution of events in sectors and the probability of each one to occur is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">Pr{2 events in sector 3} = (λ 3 ) 2 = ( 5 9 ) 2 = 25 81 (case a)</formula><p>Pr{2 events in sector 2}</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">= (λ 2 ) 2 = ( 1 3 ) 2 = 1 9 (case b)</formula><p>Pr{2 events in sector 1}</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">= (λ 1 ) 2 = ( 1 9 ) 2 = 1 81 (case c)</formula><p>Pr{1 event in each of the sectors 3 and 2}</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">= 2λ 3 λ 2 = 2 5 9 1 3 = 10 27 (case d)</formula><p>Pr{1 event in each of the sectors 3 and 1}</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">= 2λ 3 λ 1 = 2 5 9 1 9 = 10 81 (case e)</formula><p>Pr{1 event in each of the sectors 2 and 1}</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">= 2λ 2 λ 1 = 2 1 9 1 3 = 2 27 (case f)</formula><p>The total energy dissipation in each sector for each case is: case a sector 3:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">2 p 2 3 + 10 • 2 p 3 (1 -p 3 ) + 18(1 -p 3 ) 2 sector 2: 2 p 2 3 p 2 2 + 5 p 2 3 2 p 2 (1 -p 2 ) +8 p 2 3 (1 -p 2 ) 2 + 1 • 2 p 3 (1 -p 3 ) p 2 +4 • 2 p 3 (1 -p 3 )(1 -p 2 ) sector 1: 2 p 2 3 p 2 2 + 1 p 2 3 2 p 2 (1 -p 2 ) +1 • 2 p 3 (1 -p 3 ) p 2 case b sector 3 0 sector 2: 2 p 2 2 + 5 • 2 p 2 (1 -p 2 ) + 8(1 -p 2 ) 2 sector 1: 2 p 2 2 + 1 • 2 p 2 (1 -p 2 )</formula><p>case c sector 3 0 sector 2: 0 sector 1: 2 case d sector 3:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">1 p 3 + 9(1 -p 3 ) sector 2: 2 p 3 p 2 2 + 5 p 3 2 p 2 (1 -p 2 ) +8 p 3 (1 -p 2 ) 2 + 1(1 -p 3 ) p 2 +4(1 -p 3 )(1 -p 2 ) sector 1: 2 p 3 p 2 2 + 1 p 3 2 p 2 (1 -p 2 ) + 1(1 -p 3 ) p 2 case e sector 3: 1 p 3 + 9(1 -p 3 ) sector 2: 1 p 3 p 2 + 4 p 3 (1 -p 2 ) sector 1: 2 p 3 p 2 + 1 p 3 (1 -p 2 ) + 1(1 -p 3 ) case f sector 3: 0 sector 2: 1 p 2 + 4(1 -p 2 ) sector 1: 2 p 2 + 1(1 -p 2 )</formula><p>To calculate the average energy dissipation per sensor in each sector, we divide by the sector sizes:</p><p>Sector 3: Taking</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">E[E 3 ] S 3 =<label>25</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_31">E[E 1 ] S 1 = E[E 2 ] S 2 = E[E 3 ]</formula><p>S 3 we get a system of equations with solution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">p 3 = 0.5735 p 2 = 0.5815</formula><p>Note that we have not included p 1 in the calculation above.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem 3. The energy balance property is achieved if any ring sector (say T i ) propagates each message it handles with probability p i to the next ring sector, T i-1 , and with probability 1p i it propagates the message directly to the sink.

Note that, interestingly, p i 's are independent of the number N of the events that occur in the network, since p i 's depend only on i and the number of ring sectors n (which is broadcast to sectors by the sink). Thus the protocol assumes only local information.</p><p>We note that the analysis above allows the exact derivation of probabilities p i 's as a function of i and n which (although complicated and not obviously leading to a closed form) can be easily calcualted by the sensors in the network by carrying out very simple calculations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem 4. Given that the energy is each time on the average the same in all network sensors, each message will finally get to the sink.</head><p>Proof: Consider a message that is generated in a certain ring sector, say T i . Because of the energy balance property, all sensors are operational, thus in each step of the protocol the message is either propagated to the "next" (i.e. immediately closer to the sink) ring sector, T i-1 , or is directly propagated to the sink. Consequently, after a maximum of i steps, the message will finally reach the sink.</p><p>We note that we guarantee that the energy per sensor is the same on the average; we plan to study energy balance properties guarantees with high probability as well, by taking into account the distribution (both spatial and in time) of event generation.</p><p>6.1. Some remarks on the result obtained in <ref type="bibr">Theorem 3</ref> In this subsection we discuss some graphical representation of the probabilities p i as a function of the ring sector i for various network sizes and we study its behaviour. We also discuss a graphical representation of p i as a function of the exponent that signal attenuates with distance (capturing the energy cost model) for a specific network size.</p><p>Figures <ref type="figure">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref> represent p i as a function of the sector number i for two different network sizes: 100 and 1000 ring sectors.</p><p>We remark that for all cases the probability initially increases, in fact very rapidly; then there is a territory of the area for which p i is more or less constant and finally in the last 30-40 sectors the probability decreases slightly. This behaviour can be explained based on the fact that the energy spent in a transmission is proportional to the square of the transmission distance. Thus, only in close to the sink sectors Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> p i on the first territory direct transmissions to the sink tend to happen: this is why p i is pretty small for small i. In not very close to the sink sectors (i.e. when i becomes relatively large) then p i approaches 1 i.e. mostly one-hop transmissions tend to occur. This also suggests that our approach is energy efficient in the sense that (expensive) direct transmissions to the sink are not favoured by our algorithm. This very important finding shows that the protocol is at the same time both energy balanced and energy efficient.</p><p>The decrease in the value of p i when i approaches n is a consequence of the fact that there is an asymmetry between the furthermost ring sector and the other ring sectors. This asymmetry is due to the fact that, in contrast to other sectors, no sector propagates messages to the n-th ring sector. Thus the sectors close to n have a lighter load since they handle fewer events, thus, to achieve energy balance, they should spend more energy per message i.e. they should more frequently transmit directly to the sink. (Note that for large i the area size of adjacent sectors is approximately the same thus no significant increase in message generation happens when i is close to n).</p><p>In the following three figures we compare the behaviour of p i in these three "territories" of p i 's behaviour change (initial increase, stability, slight decrease) for network sizes of 100, 1000 and 2000 sectors. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> represents p i in the first territory where it increases.</p><p>In this figure we note that for the close to the sink sectors (i small) and independently of n, p i increases in almost exactly the same manner. This is because of the following reason: when n increases then it is less probable that events make it to sector in the territory i.e. close to the sink; thus, these few events should spend more energy by jumping more frequently to the sink In Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, we compare p i 's for the middle territory of the network. We note that although in the case of network size 1000 and 2000 p i 's are almost the same, in the case of the Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> p i on the third territory 100 ring sector network the probability is relatively small. This is because of the fact that the impact of the asymmetry effect of the last ring sector reaches even the middle territory of the network.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> we give a detailed graphical representation of p i in the last 50 sectors for all cases of network size. We notice that the probabilities p i decrease with i, almost in the same manner for all network sizes.</p><p>In large networks (e.g. n = 1000) the forwarding probability is indeed close to 1. However, the probability of directly transmitting to the sink at some stage is upper bounded by a geometric distribution with success probability close to 0. Thus, direct transmissions to the sink occur after some hops and lead to energy balance.</p><p>Finally, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">7</ref> we study the effect of the energy cost model. In particular, we focus on the impact of the power of the signal power fading. The qualitative behaviour is basically the same i.e. p i increases with i, close to the sink. However, when the fading factor increases (i.e. when transimssions are more expensive) direct transmissions to the sink are even less probable. This is why p i increases when the fading factor becomes bigger.</p><p>In the next section, we also provide a closed form for probabilities p i under certain simplifying (however reasonable) assumptions.</p></div>

We provide the following intuitive explanation of why this happens. Remark indeed that the area sizes of adjacent sectors (and thus the number of events generated in such sections) are more or less the same, especially when i increases. Furthermore, the probability p i of forwarding to the adjacent (towards the sink) sector increases very fast with i and becomes 1 in most sectors of the network (in the middle territory). Thus, the expected number of messages forwarded to adjacent sectors seems to be almost the same. In large networks (e.g. n = 1000) the forwarding probability is indeed close to 1. However, the probability of directly transmitting to the sink at some stage is upper bounded by a geometric distribution with success probability close to 0. Thus, direct transmissions to the sink occur after some hops and lead to energy balance.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">8</ref> we graphically display both functions of p i (i.e. the general solution and that obtained by the simple closed form). We indeed remark that the curves are very similar in shape and very close to each other. In particular in the "middle" territory (i.e. for 50 ≤ i ≤ 950 when n = 1000) the two curves almost coincide. For 1 ≤ i ≤ 50 (in the initial territory) the exact and approximation probability are in most sections less than 0.08 (Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>) apart and only in very few sectors the difference becomes 0.16. Finally, at the third territory (950 ≤ i ≤ 1000) the accurate solution and the approximation differ by less than 0.08 (Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>) This shows that our solution under the simplifying assumptions is very tight (Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref>).</p></div>

The expected total energy dissipation in sector i so as to receive the messages is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_86">E E r i = E[ f i ] • E r ik Proof:</formula><p>The variable r ik is constant for each area T i . Thus:</p><formula xml:id="formula_87">E E r i = E f i j=1 e r i j = e r i j • E[ f i ]</formula><p>Thus the expected mean value of the energy dissipation in each area T i is given by the following relation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_88">E[E i ] = E[h i ] • E e s i j + e r i j • E[ f i ]</formula><p>Recall that, according to Definition 7, to achieve the same on the average energy dissipation per area unit (and thus per sensor) in the network area, the following equality should hold:</p><formula xml:id="formula_89">E [E i ] S i = E[E j ] S j ∀i, j ∈ {1, . . . n}<label>(9)</label></formula><p>i.e. the average energy consumption per sensor should be equal in any two ring sectors. By induction, it suffices to guarantee this for any two adjacent ring sectors.</p><p>In what follows, we manage to guarantee the above balance property, by requiring a certain recurrence relation to hold. We note that this recurrence basically relates 3 successive terms of the E[ f i ] sequence (the E[g i ] terms depend only on i and on input parameters). Theorem 6. To achieve energy balance in the network, the following recurrency equation should hold:</p><formula xml:id="formula_90">b(i + 1)E[ f i+1 ] -(d(i) + b(i))E[ f i ] + d(i -1)E[ f i-1 ] = a(i)E[g i ] -a(i + 1)E[g i+1 ]</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_91">a(i) = (i R) 2 c 1 + c 2 2i -1 d(i) = [(i + 1) 2 -1]c 1 R 2 2i + 1 b(i) = a(i) + c 2 2i-1</formula><p>Proof: For the case j = i + 1 of the Eq. 9 and using the Lemmata 2 and 7 we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_92">E[h i ]E s i, j + e r i j E[ f i ] S i = E[h i+1 ]E[ i+1, j ] + e r i+1 j E[ f i+1 ] S i+1 ⇔ (i R) 2 c 1 + c 2 2i -1 E[h i ] -p i E[h i ] (i 2 -1)c 1 R 2 2i -1 + c 2 2i -1 E[ f i ] = = [(i + 1)R] 2 c 1 + c 2 2i + 1 E[h i+1 ] -p i+1 E[h i+1 ] [(i + 1) 2 -1]c 1 R 2 2i + 1 + c 2 2(i + 1) -1 E[ f i+1 ]</formula><p>Let</p><formula xml:id="formula_93">a(i) = (i R) 2 c 1 + c 2 2i -1 d(i) = [(i + 1) 2 -1]c 1 R 2 2i + 1 b(i) = a(i) + c 2 2i -1</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>By Lemma 5 we know that p i E[h i ] = E[ f i-1 ] and by Lemma 4 it is E[h</head><formula xml:id="formula_94">i ] = E[g i ] + E[ f i ] thus the last equation becomes: b(i + 1)E[ f i+1 ] -(d(i) + b(i))E[ f i ] + d(i -1)E[ f i-1 ] = a(i)E[g i ] -a(i + 1)E[g i+1 ]</formula><p>In order to have a recurrence involving only two (succesive in fact) terms of the E[ f i ] sequence, we will transform the recurrency relation of Theorem 6 simillarly to Theorem 1. Definition 14. Let t(i) = b(i + 1)E[ f i+1 ]d(i)E f i ], for i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n -1}.</p><p>The recurrency relation of Theorem 6 can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_95">t(i) -t(i -1) = a(i) • E[g i ] -a(i + 1) • E[g i+1 ] i = 0, . . . n -1 with t(0) = b(1) • E[ f 1 ]</formula><p>From Lemma 8 we know that t(i) = Now, the calculation of the probabilities p i is done as in Theorem 3.</p></div>
