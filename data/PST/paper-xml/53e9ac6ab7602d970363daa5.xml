<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper deals with the lateral motion control of four-wheel-independent-drive electric vehicles (4WID-EVs) subject to onboard network-induced time delays. It is well known that the in-vehicle network and x-by-wire technologies have considerable advantages over the traditional point-to-point communication. However, on the other hand, these technologies would also induce the probability of time-varying delays, which would degrade control performance or even deteriorate the system. To enjoy the advantages and deal with in-vehicle network delays, an H ∞ -based delay-tolerant linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control method is proposed in this paper. The problem is described in the form of an augmented discrete-time model with uncertain elements determined by the delays. Delay uncertainties are expressed in the form of a polytope using Taylor series expansion. To achieve a good steady-state response, a generalized proportional-integral control approach is adopted. The feedback gains can be obtained by solving a sequence of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Cosimulations with Simulink and CarSim demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller. Comparison with a conventional LQR controller is also carried out to illustrate the strength of explicitly dealing with in-vehicle network delays.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>D UE to concerns about environment pollution and energy shortages, development of electric vehicles (EVs) is currently at a rapidly growing phase. Meanwhile, there is great demand for vehicle driving safety, maneuverability, and driving comfort. Boosted by the fast development of electric motor, battery, and control technologies, the four-wheel-independentdrive electric vehicle (4WID-EV), as an emerging configuration of EVs, has attracted increasing research efforts from both the industry and academia. Equipped by in-wheel motors with quick, accurate, and flexible torque generations, 4WID-EVs possess considerable advantages in terms of vehicle dynamics control, energy optimization, and vehicle structural flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>For vehicle lateral stability control, steering-based systems and direct yaw-moment control (DYC) systems are most effective, and there have been various research studies on the combination of the two systems. Yu and Moskwa designed a four-wheel steering and independent wheel torque control system to enhance vehicle maneuverability and safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Bedner et al.</ref> proposed a supervisory control approach to manage both braking and four-wheel steering systems for vehicle stability control <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. A coordinated and reconfigurable vehicle dynamics control system that can coordinate the steering and braking actions of each wheel individually was designed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. There are also some works focusing on combining active front-wheel steering (AFS) and DYC systems. An integrated front-wheel steering and individual wheel torque controller was proposed to govern the vehicle lateral position using frequencyweighted coordination <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Nagai also proposed an integrated control system of AFS and DYC to control the vehicle yaw rate and the sideslip angle using a model-matching controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. A vehicle yaw stability control approach coordinating steering and individual wheel braking actuations was developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. A coordinated controller of AFS and DYC based on an optimal guaranteed cost method was designed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Mokhiamar and Abe compared different combinations of DYC with AFS, active rear-wheel steering (ARS), and AFS + ARS in simulation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Heinzl et al. also compared three different control strategies, namely, AFS, AFS plus unilateral braking, and ARS plus unilateral braking for vehicle dynamics control in a severe cornering and braking maneuver situation in simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Among all the solutions coordinating the steering-based system and the DYC control system, the combination of AFS and DYC shows the best compromise between control performance 0018-9545 © 2013 IEEE.

With in-wheel motors, each wheel of the 4WID-EV can generate not only individual braking torque but individual driving torque as well, are able to yield greater direct yaw-moment than the conventional vehicles. In addition, the 4WID-EV dynamics control capability can be further enhanced by the integration of an AFS. For example, Li et al. proposed an integrated model predictive control algorithm of AFS and DYC to improve the control performance of 4WID-EVs with in-wheel motors <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. However, all of these aforementioned control methods for combined AFS and DYC assumed that the controllers, sensors, and actuators were directly connected by wires. In other words, the 4WID-EV was considered as a centralized control system. Rather, with the development and appearance of in-vehicle networks and x-by-wire technologies, the control signals from the controllers and the measurements from some sensors are exchanged using a communication network in modern vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, i.e., Controller Area Network (CAN) or FlexRay. Thus, a 4WID-EV is a networked control system rather than a centralized control system, which imposes the effects of network-induced delays into the control loop. The unknown and time-varying delays of the network communication between different controllers could degrade the control performance of the entire system or even make the system unstable. For example, according to the research of Caruntu et al., timevarying delays of the CAN can lead to driveline oscillations in the control of a vehicle drivetrain <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>Vehicle motion controls are also characterized by fast dynamics as drivetrain control. Motivated by the adverse influences of network-induced delays, this paper aims to design a combined AFS and DYC controller that is robust to timevarying network delays. As the most dominant and representative in-vehicle network nowadays, the CAN is selected for studying the characteristic of network-induced delays in this paper. Based on the theoretical research on CAN-induced delays <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, a practical result of the CAN-induced delay model was adopted for the study of automotive system control loop closed by CAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. This CAN-induced delay model is also used to obtain the discrete model of the network-induced time-varying delays.</p><p>For networked control systems, an important issue is the appropriate handling of the nonlinearities from uncertain timevarying delays. There are numerous approaches for the appropriate handling based on polytopic inclusions, e.g., the method based on element-wise minimization-maximization (EMM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, the method based on Jordan normal form (JNF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the method based on Taylor series expansion (TA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and the method based on Cayley-Hamilton (CH) theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The accuracy of EMM, TA, and CH is of the same order of magnitude, whereas for JNF, the polytope is much larger <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Moreover, TA is one of the approaches with the least complexity among the aforementioned methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and, therefore, is chosen to cope with the nonlinearities of uncertain time-varying delays in this paper.</p><p>In the stabilization problem of networked control systems with time-varying network-induced delays, generally, there are two main control synthesis methods. One method is to construct the control Lyapunov function for an augmented system with the original states and previous inputs as the augmented states and then use a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach to yield a feedback controller offline <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The other method is to solve an online optimization problem for the original nonaugmented system <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Based on the former idea, which has the advantages in real-time performance, we propose an H ∞ -based linear quadratic regulator (LQR) tracking control scheme to cope with the tracking problem in this paper. The sufficient condition of system stability can be provided in the form of a sequence of LMIs, and the control gains of the tracking controller can be obtained by solving the LMIs.</p><p>The main contributions of this work are twofold. First, the network-induced delays are explicitly considered in the vehicle lateral motion control problem. Different from the conventional AFS and DYC control, the network-induced time-varying delays lead to a challenging control problem for the vehicle lateral stability and handling. The network-induced delays are described via the polytopic technique. With an augmented technique, the delayed system is converted into a polytopic timevarying system. Second, to track the reference model, trade off between the performance and control effort, and attenuate the effect of external input, an H ∞ -based LQR tracking control scheme is designed for the combined AFS and DYC, which simultaneously guarantees the control performance and the robustness against time-varying delays.</p><p>The remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows: In Section II, we introduce the networked control architecture of combined AFS and DYC and mathematically formulate the problem to be studied. A continuous-time model is introduced with the reference model states as the tracking control targets. Then, the original system is augmented and discretized. With the analysis of CAN-induced delays, the discrete control-oriented model is reformed and augmented into the final formulation. In Section III, the nonlinear uncertainties induced by the time-varying delays are expressed as polytopes of matrices by using the Taylor series approximation. In Section IV, we present the control synthesis for this problem. The H ∞based LQR is used for the tracking control design procedure and solved by using the LMI theory. In Section V, the validity of the proposed control design procedure is demonstrated via cosimulation with Simulink and CarSim, which is a commercial full-vehicle dynamics simulation package. Section VI presents some concluding remarks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Networked Control Architecture of Combined AFS and DYC</head><p>In an AFS system, the front-wheel steering angle is determined as a sum of two contributions. One is directly determined by the driver from her/his steering wheel angle input, and the other is decided by the steer-by-wire controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The two parts are combined by a planetary gear set with two inputs and one output in an AFS system <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. One input is from the steering wheel of the driver, whereas the other is from the servo motor controlled by the electronic controller of the AFS system, which is connected to the in-vehicle network via the CAN bus. The output shaft of the planetary gear set manipulates the front road wheels via a rack-and-pinion power steering system. (See <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> for detailed information on AFS systems.) In the DYC system of a 4WID-EV, the in-wheel motors are key components. With the development of in-wheel motor and integration technology, there have been several revolutionary electric wheel products such as the active wheel system from Michelin, which is highly integrated with in-wheel motor, braking system, and active suspension, and all these components are controlled by one control unit <ref type="bibr">[31]</ref>, which can be connected to the in-vehicle network via the CAN bus.</p><p>With the AFS system and integrated in-wheel motor systems connected via the CAN bus and coordinated by a higher level vehicle controller, networked control architecture of combined AFS and DYC for a 4WID-EV is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The vehicle motion control algorithm in the vehicle controller is hierarchical. The upper-level controller decides the steering angle to be superposed to the front wheels and the direct yawmoment to be imposed to the vehicle, whereas the lower-level controller distributes the total direct yaw-moment to the torque commands of the four in-wheel motors. This paper only studies the upper-level controller, which has the direct responsibility on the system robustness against time-varying network delays. (For control allocation of the total direct yaw-moment, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>.) In most vehicle motion control systems, the yaw rate sensor and the longitudinal/lateral acceleration sensor are usually directly connected with the vehicle controller, from which the vehicle yaw rate and the sideslip angle can be measured or estimated by the upper-level controller directly without going through the in-vehicle network. Therefore, only the network-induced delays in the forward path are settled in this paper, whereas feedback delays are not considered here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Control-Oriented Model for Vehicle Lateral Dynamics</head><p>In this paper, a 2-DOF bicycle model of vehicle lateral dynamics is used for controller design, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The vehicle has mass m and moment of inertia I z about the yaw axis through its center of gravity (CG). The distances from the front and rear axles to the CG are l f and l r , respectively. δ is the steering angle of the front wheels. Tire slip angles α f and α r lead to lateral force F yf and F yr while steering. V is the velocity of the vehicle CG with β being the vehicle sideslip angle and γ being the yaw rate of the vehicle.</p><p>According to the 2-DOF vehicle model, the lateral dynamics of a vehicle with AFS and DYC can be expressed as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ẋ = A c x + B wc w + B uc u (1)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x = [ β γ ] T w = δ f u = [ Δδ f ΔM z ] T A c = -2 C f +C r mV -2 C f l f -C r l r mV 2 -1 -2 C f l f -C r l r I z -2 C f l 2 f +C r l 2 r I z V B wc = 2C f mV 2l f C f I z , B uc = 2C f mV 0 2C f l f I z 1 I z .</formula><p>Sideslip angle β and yaw rate γ are the two states of the vehicle lateral dynamics, δ f is the portion of the front-wheel steering angle that is directly manipulated by the driver, and Δδ f is the portion of the front-wheel steering angle that is controlled by the AFS controller. The actual front-wheel steering angle δ is the summation of δ f and Δδ f . ΔM z is the external yaw moment generated by the longitudinal forces of the leftand right-side wheels. C f and C r are the cornering stiffness of the front and rear tires, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Reference State Responses</head><p>For the two states in the vehicle lateral dynamics control, the yaw rate reflects more on the handling performance, whereas the sideslip angle is more concerned with the vehicle stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The vehicle yaw rate can be readily measured by a sensor in modern vehicles with electronic stability control systems, whereas the sideslip angle is often estimated due to the cost and complexity of direct measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>. (On the sideslip angle estimation methods, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>, and it is assumed that both states can be made available in this paper.)</p><p>Generally, the reference sideslip angle is given as zero to ensure stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>, whereas the reference yaw rate is defined in terms of vehicle parameters, longitudinal speed, and steering input of the driver as <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">γ ref = V l f + l r + mV 2 (C r l r -C f l f ) 2C f C r (l f +l r ) δ f . (2)</formula><p>Therefore, the reference state responses can be expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">r = Rw (3) with r = β ref γ ref R = ⎡ ⎣ 0 V l f + l r + mV 2 (C r l r -C f l f ) 2C f C r (l f +l r ) ⎤ ⎦ T .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Augmented Model for Tracking Control</head><p>To track the reference state response, the original system described in (1) is augmented by defining a new vector x = [x T t 0 (r Tx T )dt] T . Then, the control-oriented model can be revised as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ẋ = Ax + B w w + B u u + B r r<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">A = A c 0 -I 0 B w = B wc 0 B u = B uc 0 B r = 0 I .</formula><p>By substituting (3) into (4), we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ẋ = Ax + B wr w + B u u (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">B wr = (B w + B r R).</formula><p>As modern vehicles are controlled by digital controllers communicating and exchanging data over in-vehicle networks, in an ideal case, each controller obtains and updates its control commands at a fixed cycle period T s . The discrete state-space equation can be written as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">x k+1 = A d x k + B wrd w k + B ud u k (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">A d = e AT s B wrd = T s 0 e A(T s -θ) dθ • B wr B ud = T s 0 e A(T s -θ) dθ • B u</formula><p>with xk , w k , and u k being the state vector and control input vectors at time kT s .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Analysis of CAN-Induced Time Delays</head><p>It is reasonable to assume that within an in-vehicle network (e.g., CAN), without physical disconnection, the induced timevarying delays are bounded, and this bound can be known in advance by experimental tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. There are a variety of theoretical research studies for calculating the upper bound of network-induced delays of each message sent on CAN in automotive applications, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. An explicit expression can be demonstrated as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, which is given as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">τ l arg e,j = (j + 2)l R - j-1 i=0 l c i<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where τ l arg e,j denotes the upper bound of the delay of the jth priority CAN message, l is the maximum frame length, R is the rate of a high-speed CAN, and c i is the cycle length of the ith priority message, which represents the period after which the message is repeated.</p><p>Based on these CAN time-delay models, some practical presentations of CAN-induced delays were adopted in engineering control systems, e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The delays of all messages introduced by CAN are assumed to be time varying and uniformly distributed in the interval [0, τ l arg e ], where τ l arg e = 1.7T s , and T s is the sampling period of the system, which has been proved to be convenient and reasonable for practical control designs.</p><p>Additionally, according to the protocol of CAN, messages within the same message ID group are queued while being sent, which leads to the fact that a message transmitted at a certain time can never arrive before a message with the same ID that was transmitted at a previous time <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Thus, the delay of a message sent at time kT s can be finally depicted with the following expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">max{0, τ k-1 -T s } ≤ τ k ≤ τ l arg e . (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Control-Oriented Model With Time-Varying Delays</head><p>With the time-varying delays induced by the CAN, the ideal condition under which ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">6</ref>) is derived is no longer satisfied. The procedure for vehicle dynamics control can be interpreted with  </p><formula xml:id="formula_15">u(t) = u k , ∀t ∈ [kT s + τ k , (k + 1)T s + τ k+1 ] . (9)</formula><p>It is reasonable to express the maximum delay as τ l arg e = (Υ + υ)T s <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> where Υ ∈ Z + and υ ∈ R [0,1) . Then, the control-oriented model with the time-varying delays can be derived as</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">x k+1 = A d x k + B wrd w k + B ud u k + Δ 0,k (u k-1 -u k ) + Δ 1,k (u k-2 -u k-1 ) + • • • + Δ Υ,k (u k-Υ-1 -u k-Υ )<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Δ i,k = ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ 0, τ k-i -iT s ≤ 0 τ k-i -iT s 0 e Ā(T s -θ) dθ • Bu , 0 ≤ τ k-i -iT s ≤ T s T s 0 e Ā(T s -θ) dθ • Bu , T s ≤ τ k-i -iT s . (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">)</formula><p>Defining a new state vector</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">ξ k = [x T k u T k-1 • • • u T k-Υ-1</formula><p>] T , we have the augmented system as</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">ξ k+1 = A aug ξ k + B wr,aug w k + B u,aug u k (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">A aug = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ Ād Δ 0,k -Δ 1,k • • • Δ Υ-1,k -Δ Υ,k Δ Υ,k 0 0 • • • 0 0 0 I • • • 0 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0 0 • • • I 0 ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ B wr,aug = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ Bwrd 0 0 . . . 0 0 ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦</formula><p>, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">B u,aug = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ Bud -Δ 0,k I 0 . . . 0 0 ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦</formula><p>. Thus, we have described the problem in the form of an augmented discrete-time control-oriented model with uncertain elements determined by the time-varying network delays. We will then propose the expression of the delay uncertainties in Section III and the control synthesis method in Section IV.</p></div>

DESCRIPTION OF NETWORK-INDUCED TIME-DELAY UNCERTAINTIES</head><p>As is shown in the problem formulation, the time-varying delays introduce system uncertainties to the control system. Therefore, to address the problem of time-varying delays, the first step is to express (13) with a corresponding format. There are several methods in robust control to describe and deal with system uncertainties, and the method that is most frequently used is polytopic inclusion.</p><p>For systems with linear uncertainties, it is a general way to express the uncertainties as a polytope of matrices. While for systems with time-varying delays, the uncertain terms (Δ 0,k , Δ 1,k , . . . , Δ Υ,k ) are caused by integral operation of time delay τ k , as is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. In other words, the uncertainties in (13) have nonlinear relationships with the time delay, which renders the polytopic inclusion method unable to be directly applied. To make use of the polytopic inclusion method, the uncertainties should be described in a linear formulation of time delay τ k . TA is a common approach for linearization and was used to describe the nonlinear uncertainties as a polytope of matrices by Hetel <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In this paper, the TA will also be employed.</p><p>Consider an integral term as</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">Γ(x) = x 0 e A c (T s -θ) dθ (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_25">)</formula><p>which is the general form of the uncertain terms in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. With the TA, ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_24">14</ref>) can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">Γ(x) = Γ(0) + Γ(0)x + Γ(0) x 2 2! + • • • + d q Γ dx q (0) x q q! + • • • = - ∞ q=1 (-x) q q! A q-1 c e A c T s . (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_27">)</formula><p>Focusing on the first h terms of (15), Γ(x) can be described as a finite summation and a remainder, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">Γ(x) = - h q=1 (-x) q q! A q-1 c e A c T s + Θ h . (<label>16</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_29">)</formula><p>With a proper selection of the number h, the high-order terms in the remainder can be relatively small. Neglecting the remainder Θ h , we can obtain the h-order approximation of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_24">14</ref>) with sufficient accuracy as</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">Γ h (x) = - h q=1 (-x) q q!

For all the possible integral expressions in our problem, variable "x" should be always in interval [0, T s ] or [0, υT s ]; then, we can include any integral term Δ i,k into a polytope with enough vertices.</p><p>The vertices of the convex polytope can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">Δ 0,i = [ G h G h-1 • • • G 2 G 1 ]φ 0,i B uc (20) Δ 1,i = [ G h G h-1 • • • G 2 G 1 ]φ 1,i B uc . (<label>21</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_35">)</formula><p>Then, for an arbitrary delay τ k ∈ [0, τ l arg e ], the uncertain terms in (13) can be expressed as a linear combination of the vertices in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">Δ i,k = h+1 l=1 μ i,l (k)Δ 1,l , for i = 0, 1, . . .

For each Δ i,k (i = 0, 1, . . . , Υ), an h-order Taylor series expansion generates (h + 1) terms (Δ 0,l or Δ 1,l , l = 1, 2, . . . , h + 1) in the approximate expression of ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. Therefore, based on the idea of the polytopic inclusion method, there will be a convex polytope with (h + 1) Υ+1 vertices to properly describe the network-induced time-delay uncertainties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONTROL SYNTHESIS</head><p>This section presents the control synthesis of the system with time-varying delays using the H ∞ -based LQR tracking control. In Section III, the delay uncertainties are described in the form of polytopic uncertainty. Based on this expression, the H ∞ -based LQR tracking control is obtained and solved in the form of a sequence of LMIs for the combined AFS and DYC controller of a 4WID-EV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. H ∞ -Based LQR Tracking Control</head><p>With the system in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, the control objective is to minimize the tracking error and the control input signals. A performance index is formulated as a combination of the tracking error and the control signals. In this paper, we adopt a quadratic form of the tracking error and the control signals as</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">J = ∞ i=0 e T i Qe i + u T i Ru i (<label>24</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_40">)</formula><p>where Q and R are two positive definite weighting matrices to regulate the weight of active steering angle correction and direct yaw-moment as well as the tolerance of tracking control error. In practical controller design, Q and R may vary by driving conditions such as vehicle speed to balance between vehicle handing, comfort, and safety, which is not our research emphasis here. Therefore, Q and R are selected as reasonable constants for control synthesis and simulation in this paper. The H ∞ -based LQR tracking controller is obtained by finding the optimized state-feedback gain K(u k = Kξ k ) to minimize index J, which is also equal to the 2-norm of the following constructed signal:</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">z k = Eξ k + F u k (<label>25</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_42">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">E = 0 Q 1/2 0 • • • 0 0 0 0 • • • 0 , and F = 0 R 1/2 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SIMULATION RESULTS</head><p>To study the performance of the proposed controller, simulations are conducted in Simulink with a full-vehicle model constructed by CarSim. The simulation diagram is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. The vehicle model parameter values were measured from a prototype in-wheel motor EV, and some key parameters are listed in Table <ref type="table">I</ref> [2], <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>The vehicle controller structure is composed of two levels as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, where a combined AFS and DYC controller is at the upper level, and a torque allocation strategy is at the lower level. For comparison, the proposed controller and a conventional LQR controller are adopted at the upper levels. For the two control systems to be compared, the same static torque allocation logic is employed as the lower-level controller, which distributes the direct yaw-moment equally to the driving/braking torque of the four wheels, such that each wheel has the same contribution to the total yaw-moment.</p><p>The network model simulates the message transfer delays induced by the CAN bus. With reference to the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, CAN-induced delays are assumed to be time varying and uniformly distributed in interval [0, 1.7 T s ], where T s = 10 ms is the sampling period of the closed-loop system. Meanwhile, delays of different messages should be subjected to the restraint introduced by (8).</p><p>The AFS system and four in-wheel motor blocks are modeled to transfer network control commands to the actual control outputs of actuators, with actuator dynamics properly taken into account. For 4WID-EVs studied in this paper, the AFS system is controlled by a servo motor, and the four wheels are directly driven or braked by in-wheel motors. Therefore, dynamics of an electric motor is mainly modeled here, including the rate limit and amplitude saturation of the driving/braking torque, the response time of the motor controller, motor inertia, and the AFS angle correction constraint. (For the DYC procedure accomplished by hydraulic braking units, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref> for actuator dynamics.) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TABLE I VEHICLE MODEL KEY PARAMETERS</head><p>The driver model gives steering wheel angle input for each driving maneuver. Three different maneuvers are considered here, with the respective steering wheel angle signals shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>. The first maneuver is ramp steering, which is usually adopted in a J-turn maneuver. The second maneuver is single lane changing with a single sinusoidal steering input. The third maneuver is double lane changing, which is produced from a prescribed steering input. All of the three maneuvers are commonly used in vehicle tests and can well imitate vehicles' performance in extreme cases, such as high-speed overtaking and obstacle avoidance. In addition, with the given steering signals, the AFS and DYC systems have the opportunities to cooperate well to track the driver's driving intention, which makes the evaluation of the proposed control system more convincing. In the simulations, the vehicle longitudinal speed is set to be 100 km/h, and the tire-road friction coefficient is 0.85 in all the maneuvers.</p><p>A conventional LQR controller without explicitly considering the network-induced time delays is designed as a compari-son with the proposed controller. The weighting matrices in the performance index of the conventional LQR are chosen as </p><formula xml:id="formula_61">Q c =<label>2000</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_62">)<label>36</label></formula><p>Simulation results and analyses are presented in the following sections. For each driving maneuver, the proposed controller and the compared controller are evaluated in two stages: The first stage is under the ideal in-vehicle network condition, where the controllers work as if in a centralized control system, with no time delays, to evaluate their tracking performance; then, the network-induced time-varying delays previously described in the network model are introduced into the system to assess the robustness of the controllers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Ramp Steering Maneuver</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> shows the simulation results of vehicle yaw rate response in the ramp steering maneuver. Under the ideal network condition without time delays, both the conventional LQR controller and the proposed controller give satisfactory results, and the proposed controller performs better without a steady-state tracking error, which is the effect of the generalized proportional-integral control approach achieved by the system augmentation in (4). However, with the time-varying delays induced by the CAN, the conventional LQR controller yields oscillations in the transient process and error in steady state, whereas the proposed controller can still track the desired yaw rate, as well as what it does under the ideal network condition. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Single Lane-Changing Maneuver</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> shows the simulation results of the vehicle yaw rate under a single lane-changing maneuver. Under the ideal network condition without delays, both the conventional LQR controller and the proposed controller are able to track the desired yaw rate well. Nevertheless, with the time-varying delays induced by CAN, there are significant oscillations in the vehicle yaw rate with the conventional LQR controller, and the oscillations still exist even when the steering wheel angle returns to zero in the last 2 s, which indicates that the vehicle system is almost at the criticality of instability. While for the proposed controller, there is almost no negative influence on the tracking performance even when the network delays are introduced. Intuitively, one can consider that the proposed robust controller based on the augmented system model containing the information of possible delays in the past few sample periods has some function similar to a low-pass filter, which can degrade the adverse impacts of the networkinduced time-delay uncertainties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Double Lane-Changing Steering Maneuver</head><p>In the double lane-changing maneuver, the comparative results shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref> are almost the same as those of the  previous two maneuvers. Both controllers perform well under the ideal network condition. However, once there are networkinduced time-varying delays in the closed-control loop, the yaw rate of the vehicle controlled by the conventional LQR controller significantly oscillates after a nonzero steering wheel angle trigger, whereas the proposed controller demonstrates good  robustness against the CAN-induced network time-varying delays as no evident control performance degradations can be observed.</p><p>In addition, as the steering action lasts long enough (from 1.5 to 6 s) in the double lane-changing maneuver, the effect of network-induced delays is hence significant enough to influence the vehicle global trajectory with the conventional LQR controller. Comparatively, for the proposed controller, the trajectory is just as the driver's expectation, which is displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>.</p><p>From the given three comparative vehicle maneuver simulations, it is evident that the in-vehicle network-induced actuator time delays considerably influence vehicle lateral dynamics control performance. Systematic and explicit incorporations of such time delays in the vehicle controller design can substantially attenuate the undesired effects and, thus, improve the robustness of the vehicle control systems implemented through in-vehicle networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, a combined AFS and DYC controller with good robustness against in-vehicle network-induced time-varying delays has been proposed for the lateral motion and stability control of 4WID-EVs. The main idea is to augment the original system with uncertain terms induced by time-varying delays and then describe the nonlinear uncertainties as polytopic inclusions with the help of TA. An H ∞ -based LQR tracking controller is introduced and adopted in the control synthesis. Three simulation maneuvers are carried out on a full-vehicle model constructed by CarSim to verify the performance of the proposed controller. Simulation results show that the proposed controller not only achieves a good control effect under an ideal network condition (no time delays) but guarantees enough robustness and performance when there are network-induced time-varying delays in the closed-control loop as well. Comparisons with a typical LQR vehicle lateral stability controller without explicit consideration on the in-vehicle network delays further evidenced the effectiveness of the proposed controller. In addition to the results of vehicle motion control, this paper also indicates that time-varying delays in networked control systems would induce adverse impacts to system performance, and additional attention should be paid to system analysis and control synthesis of networked control systems to enhance the robustness against network-induced time delays, particularly for systems with high-frequency dynamics.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
