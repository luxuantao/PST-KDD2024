<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Determining temporal relations (e.g., before or after) between events has been a challenging natural language understanding task, partly due to the difficulty to generate large amounts of high-quality training data. Consequently, neural approaches have not been widely used on it, or showed only moderate improvements. This paper proposes a new neural system that achieves about 10% absolute improvement in accuracy over the previous best system (25% error reduction) on two benchmark datasets. The proposed system is trained on the stateof-the-art MATRES dataset and applies contextualized word embeddings, a Siamese encoder of a temporal common sense knowledge base, and global inference via integer linear programming (ILP). We suggest that the new approach could serve as a strong baseline for future research in this area.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Temporal relation (TempRel) extraction has been considered as a major component of understanding time in natural language <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Do et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Uz-Zaman et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Minard et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Llorens et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ning et al., 2018a)</ref>. However, the annotation process for TempRels is known to be time consuming and difficult even for humans, and existing datasets are usually small and/or have low inter-annotator agreements (IAA); e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">UzZaman et al. (2013)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chambers et al. (2014)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">O'Gorman et al. (2016)</ref> reported Kohen's  and F 1 in the 60's. Albeit the significant progress in deep learning nowadays, neural approaches have not been used extensively for this task, or showed only moderate improvements <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dligach et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lin et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Meng and Rumshisky, 2018)</ref>. We think it is important for to understand: is it because we missed a "magic" neural architecture, because the training dataset is small, or because the quality of the dataset should be improved?</p><p>Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ning et al. (2018c)</ref> introduced a new dataset called Multi-Axis Temporal RElations for Start-points (MATRES). MATRES is still relatively small in its size (15K TempRels), but has a higher annotation quality from its improved task definition and annotation guideline. This paper uses MATRES to show that a long short-term memory (LSTM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997)</ref> system can readily outperform the previous state-of-the-art system, CogCompTime <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Ning et al., 2018d)</ref>, by a large margin. The fact that a standard LSTM system can significantly improve over a feature-based system on MATRES indicates that neural approaches have been mainly dwarfed by the quality of annotation, instead of specific neural architectures or the small size of data.</p><p>To gain a better understanding of the standard LSTM method, we extensively compare the usage of various word embedding techniques, including word2vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>, GloVe <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Pennington et al., 2014)</ref>, FastText <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bojanowski et al., 2016)</ref>, ELMo <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Peters et al., 2018)</ref>, and BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Devlin et al., 2018)</ref>, and show their impact on TempRel extraction. Moreover, we further improve the LSTM system by injecting knowledge from an updated version of TEMPROB, an automatically induced temporal common sense knowledge base that provides typical TempRels between events<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ning et al., 2018b)</ref>. Altogether, these components improve over CogCompTime by about 10% in F 1 and accuracy. The proposed system is public<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> and can serve as a strong baseline for future research.</p></div>

There have indeed been such attempts, e.g., in clinical narratives <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dligach et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lin et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tourille et al., 2017)</ref> and in newswire <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cheng and Miyao, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Meng and Rumshisky, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Leeuwenberg and Moens, 2018)</ref>. However, their improvements over feature-based methods were moderate <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lin et al. (2017)</ref> even showed negative results). Given the low IAAs in those datasets, it was unclear whether it was simply due to the low data quality or neural methods inherently do not work well for this task.</p><p>A recent annotation scheme, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ning et al. (2018c)</ref>, introduced the notion of multi-axis to represent the temporal structure of text, and identified that one of the sources of confusions in human annotation is asking annotators for TempRels across different axes. When annotating only sameaxis TempRels, along with some other improvements to the annotation guidelines, MATRES was able to achieve much higher IAAs. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> This dataset opens up opportunities to study neural methods for this problem. In Sec. 3, we will explain our proposed LSTM system, and also highlight the major differences from previous neural attempts.</p><p>agate to subsequent modules. Here we study the usage of LSTM networks<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> on the TempRel extraction problem as an end-to-end approach that only takes a sequence of word embeddings as input (assuming that the position of events are known). Conceptually, we need to feed those word embeddings to LSTMs and obtain a vector representation for a particular pair of events, which is followed by a fully-connected, feed-forward neural network (FFNN) to generate confidence scores for each output label. Based on the confidence scores, global inference is performed via integer linear programming (ILP), which is a standard procedure used in many existing works to enforce the transitivity property of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Do et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ning et al., 2017</ref>). An overview of the proposed network structure and corresponding parameters can be found in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Below we also explain the main components.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Handling Event Positions</head><p>Each TempRel is associated with two events, and for the same text, different pairs of events possess different relations, so it is critical to indicate the positions of those events when we train LSTMs for the task. The most straightforward way is to concatenate the hidden states from both time steps that correspond to the location of those events (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dligach et al. (2017)</ref> handled this issue differently, by adding XML tags immediately before and after each event (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>). For example, in the sentence, After eating dinner, he slept comfortably, where the two events are bold-faced, they will convert the sequence into After &lt;e1&gt; eating &lt;/e1&gt; dinner, he &lt;e2&gt; slept &lt;/e2&gt; comfortably. The XML markups, which was initially proposed under the name of position indicators for relation extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Zhang and Wang, 2015)</ref>, uniquely indicate the event positions to LSTM, such that the final output of LSTM can be used as a representation of those events and their context. We compare both methods in this paper, and as we show later, the straightforward concatenation method is already as good as XML tags for this task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Common Sense Encoder (CSE)</head><p>In naturally occurring text that expresses TempRels, connective words such as since, when, or until are often not explicit; nevertheless, humans can still infer the TempRels using common sense with respect to the events. For example, even without context, we know that die is typically after explode and schedule typically before attend. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ning et al. (2018b)</ref> was an initial attempt to acquire such knowledge, by aggregating automatically extracted TempRels from a large corpus. The resulting knowledge base, TEMPROB, contains observed frequencies of tuples (v1, v2, r) representing the probability of verb 1 and verb 2 having relation r and it was shown a useful resource for TempRel extraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LSTM</head><p>However, TEMPROB is a simple counting model and fails (or is unreliable) for unseen (or rare) tuples. For example, we may see (ambush, die) less frequently than (attack, die) in a corpus, and the observed frequency of (ambush, die) being before or after is thus less reliable. However, since "ambush" is semantically similar to "attack", the statistics of (attack, die) can actually serve as an auxiliary signal to (ambush, die). Motivated by this idea, we introduce common sense encoder (CSE): We fit an updated version of TEMPROB via a Siamese network <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bromley et al., 1994)</ref> that generalizes to unseen tuples through the resulting embeddings for each verb (Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>). Note that the TEMPROB we use is reconstructed using the same method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ning et al. (2018b)</ref> with the base method changed to CogCompTime. Once trained, CSE will remain fixed when training the LSTM part (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a or b</ref>) and the feedforward neural network part (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>). We only use CSE for its output. In the beginning, we tried to directly use the output (i.e., a scalar) and the influence on performance was negligible. Therefore, here we discretize the CSE output, change it to categorical embeddings, concatenate them with the LSTM output, and then produce the confidence scores (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data</head><p>The MATRES dataset<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> contains 275 news articles from the TempEval3 workshop <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(UzZaman et al., 2013)</ref> with newly annotated events and TempRels. It has 3 sections: TimeBank (TB), AQUAINT (AQ), and Platinum (PT). We followed the official split (i.e., TB+AQ for training and PT for testing), and further set aside 20% of the training data as the development set to tune learning rates and epochs. We also show our performance on another dataset, TCR<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Ning et al., 2018a)</ref>, which contains both temporal and causal relations and we only need the temporal part. The label set for both datasets are before, after, equal, and vague. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results and Discussion</head><p>We compare with the most recent version of CogCompTime, the state-of-the-art on MATRES.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">7</ref> Note that in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, CogCompTime performed slightly different to <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ning et al. (2018d)</ref>: Cog-CompTime reportedly had F 1 =65.9 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> Line 3 therein) and here we obtained F 1 =66.6. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ning et al. (2018d)</ref> only reported F 1 scores, while we also use another two metrics for a more thorough comparison: classification accuracy (acc.) and temporal awareness F aware , where the awareness score is for the graphs represented by a group of related TempRels (more details in the appendix). We also report the average of those three metrics in our experiments.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> compares the two different ways to handle event positions discussed in Sec. 3.1: position indicators (P.I.) and simple concatenation (Concat), both of which are followed by network (d) in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> (i.e., without using Siamese yet). We extensively studied the usage of various pretrained word embeddings, including conventional embeddings (i.e., the medium versions of word2vec, GloVe, and FastText provided in the Magnitude package <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Patel et al., 2018)</ref>) and contextualized embeddings (i.e., the original ELMo and large uncased BERT, respectively); except for the input embeddings, we kept all other parameters the same. We used cross-entropy loss and the StepLR optimizer in PyTorch that decays the learning rate by 0.5 every 10 epochs (performance not sensitive to it).</p><p>Comparing to the previously used P.I. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dligach et al., 2017)</ref>, we find that, with only two exceptions (underlined in Given the above two observations, we further incorporated our common sense encoder (CSE) into "Concat" with ELMo and BERT in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. We split TEMPROB into train (80%) and validation (20%). The proposed Siamese network (Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>) was trained by minimizing the crossentropy loss using Adam <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kingma and Ba, 2014)</ref> (learning rate 1e-4, 20 epochs, and batch size 500). We first see that CSE improved on top of Concat for both ELMo and BERT under all metrics, confirming the benefit of TEMPROB; second, as compared to CogCompTime, the proposed Con-cat+CSE achieved about 10% absolute gains in accuracy and F 1 , 5% in awareness score F aware , and 8% in the three-metric-average metric, with p &lt; 0.001 per the McNemar's test. Roughly speaking, the 8% gain is contributed by LSTMs for 2%, contextualized embeddings for 4%, and CSE for 2%. Again, no statistical significance were observed between using ELMo and BERT. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> furthermore applies CogCompTime and the proposed Concat+CSE system on a different test set called TCR <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Ning et al., 2018a)</ref>. Both systems achieved better scores (suggesting that TCR is easier than MATRES), while the proposed sys-tem still outperformed CogCompTime by roughly 8% under the three-metric-average metric, consistent with our improvement on MATRES.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>Temporal relation extraction has long been an important yet challenging task in natural language processing. Lack of high-quality data and difficulty in the learning problem defined by previous annotation schemes inhibited performance of neural-based approaches. The discoveries that LSTMs readily improve the feature-based stateof-the-art CogCompTime on the MATRES and TCR datasets by a large margin not only give the community a strong baseline, but also indicate that the learning problem is probably better defined by MATRES and TCR. Therefore, we should move along that direction to collect more high-quality data, which can facilitate more advanced learning algorithms in the future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1: Overview of the neural network structures studied in this paper.
