<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we present a theoretical investigation of the influence of blood flow through a tumour-induced capillary network, whereby the vascular architecture adapts as it grows to the associated haemodynamic forces resulting in what we describe as adaptive tumour-induced angiogenesis (ATIA). The network is generated in response to tumour angiogenic factors (TAFs), which are released from hypoxic cells within a solid tumour. We first describe a refined model for tumour-induced angiogenesis, which aims to describe the capillary growth process at the cellular level by explicitly taking into account the effects of matrix degrading enzymes and the local properties of the host tissue during endothelial cell migration. We then incorporate blood rheological properties into the formulation and investigate the influence of wall shear stress induced by the blood flow during dynamic vascular growth. We then go on to examine a number of feedback mechanisms affecting vascular resistance and network architecture. The mechanisms considered include those proposed by Pries and co-workers [A.R.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Flow modelling in a tumour-induced capillary network has been considered recently in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In these papers, flow simulations through vascular networks were performed in order to investigate the efficiency of chemotherapy treatments as they passed from parent blood vessel to tumour surface via an associated capillary bed. The capillary bed was generated from an angiogenesis model proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Vascular growth was described by a discrete formulation of the associated system of partial differential equations. This approach and modelling technique permitted the tracking of each individual endothelial cell as it emerged from a parent vessel and migrated through the extracellular matrix. Endothelial cells were assumed to have several different components of migration comprising: (i) random motility, (ii) chemotaxis in response to a generic tumour angiogenic factor (TAF) released by the tumour cells, and (iii) haptotaxis in response to fibronectin gradients emerging from the extracellular matrix and through degradation and production by the endothelial cells themselves. Flow modelling techniques used previously in the context of petroleum engineering to model the flow of water, oil and gas through the interstices of a porous rock <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> were adapted to model blood and drug flow through these microvascular networks. Although blood was rather crudely considered to be a Newtonian fluid in this early work, results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> highlighted two important effects that could be responsible for the failure of some therapy regimes. First, it was found that a considerable amount of the drug injected into the parent vessel simply by-passed the tumour by way of the highly interconnected capillary bed. The second effect related to the dilution of the drug as it became dispersed throughout the tumour-induced vasculature: the concentration of any drug reaching the tumour became so dilute as to have little effect on the tumour cells. Simulations were then performed to investigate ways of reducing these two effects and thereby optimise the drug uptake by the tumour. Increasing the mean capillary radius of the capillary bed and/or decreasing the blood viscosity both led to a significant increase in the drug uptake. Although these results were interesting from a qualitative perspective, the model was somewhat naïve, with blood perfusion modelled as the flow of a Newtonian fluid through rigid cylindrical capillaries.</p><p>The second paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> examined how vascular remodelling affected the distribution of blood flow in the system. Capillary pruning algorithms were designed to reflect how different anti-vascular and anti-angiogenic drugs were thought to operate in vivo. Simulations demonstrated that drug uptake could be increased by up to 130% via the random removal of vessels and this suggested the possibility of developing a new cancer treatment strategy, viz, coupling the administration of an antiangiogenic drug (to first of all optimise the vasculature) to subsequent chemotherapy treatment (thereby ensuring maximum delivery).</p><p>The aim of the current paper is to implement a number of significant improvements in the modelling approach by considering the flow of a non-Newtonian fluid in an adaptive network: a network that evolves both spatially and temporally in response to its associated flow distribution. We present results corresponding to a number of different stages in the formulation of what we call our adaptive tumour-induced angiogenesis (ATIA) model.</p><p>Blood is a complex fluid, the rheological properties of which lead to interesting feedback mechanisms during perfusion. For example, shear stresses generated within the capillary bed by the flowing blood strongly influence vessel adaptation and network remodelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. These shear stresses are, in turn, affected by blood viscosity, the distribution of which depends upon a non-uniform distribution of haematocrit (the volume fraction of red blood cells in the blood) within the host vasculature (the Fåhraeus effect). However, the distribution of haematocrit itself depends upon the spatial architecture of the underlying network and so the feedback is established.</p><p>Blood rheology and its influence on the remodelling of microvascular networks has been intensely studied in [1-3] both experimentally and theoretically. From these studies Pries and co-workers have formulated a model for vascular adaptation incorporating a number of feedback mechanisms. They have demonstrated that the basic requirement for the generation of stable vascular structures involves a combination of both haemodynamic and metabolic stimuli. Such vascular adaptation processes have been recently applied to model radii adaptation of a regular network <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The aim in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> was to model the oxygen distribution within a two-dimensional hexagonal network and to determine its influence on the dynamics of a colony of normal and cancerous cells. Subsequent simulations produced inhomogeneous distributions of haematocrit and oxygen tension and highlighted the important role played by hypoxic cells during tumour invasion.</p><p>The model of adaptive tumour-induced angiogenesis presented in this paper begins with a discussion of a new formulation of tip cell migration that acknowledges the important function of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> during angiogenesis in the absence of flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. The aim of this new model is to incorporate mediation in vessel growth via extracellular matrix (ECM) proteolysis by specific enzymes produced by endothelial cells (EC). A number of recent publications have demonstrated the importance of enzymes from the MMP family and their involvement in the regulation of the various stages of the angiogenic process <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. These MMPs are involved in the migration of EC within the ECM, EC proliferation, and the remodelling of the basement membrane of newly formed vessels. Their importance is such that these proteinases and their regulation form new targets for cancer treatment. As our ultimate goal is to propose a global modelling framework within which to further investigate new treatments, it is important to incorporate the MMP effect into the modelling. Another key aspect of the MMP issue relates to its effect on transmural transport -tumour vascular networks are very leaky and proteolitic activity plays a vital part in the breaching of pre-capillary (non-mature) membranes by ECs during sprout formation. Although we will not take vessel leakiness into account in the present paper, this aspect is currently under investigation in an attempt to describe drug diffusion through the tumour tissue itself.</p><p>Having described the extended model of angiogenesis to be used as a foundation for further development, attention is next focused upon some aspects of vascular adaptation. The earlier paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> considered angiogenesis and flow as two separate (i.e. non-interacting) issues -a rigid network of capillary elements was generated from the PDE formulation and then the flow of a Newtonian fluid was considered within this static structure. Here, however, we will consider an angiogenesis model that is coupled to perfusion. This involves modelling a dynamic network that interacts with a non-Newtonian fluid. Two different feedback mechanisms are considered separately in order to assess their individual impact upon drug delivery. Their combined effects will be presented at a later time.</p><p>We begin by considering the influence of blood flow on the branching process -blood circulation creates a shear stress distribution on the capillary walls and, in some cases, this enhances the sprouting and branching potential for non-mature vessels, i.e. vessels which have not yet been coated and stabilised by the formation of a basal lamina. The resulting vascular structures are compared with structures generated without shear stress effects.</p><p>We then go on to consider vascular remodelling, where the radii of vessels within a pre-existing homogeneous network evolve dynamically under the influence of different haematocrit distributions. The implications for cancer therapy are then discussed in relation to the results. The ultimate aim of this work is to produce a model of adaptive tumour-induced angiogenesis with bed architecture evolving under the combined effects of tumour-angiogenic factors, fibronectin, random motility, matrix degrading enzymes and blood perfusion.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">A discrete stochastic description of network growth</head><p>The model proposed here describes how endothelial cells emerging from a parent vessel migrate towards a tumour and ultimately form a vascular network that supplies nutrients for continued development. The model is inspired by the tumour-induced angiogenesis model initially proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The model assumes that endothelial cells migrate through (i) random motility, (ii) chemotaxis in response to tumour angiogenic factors (TAF) released by the tumour and (iii) haptotaxis in response to fibronectin (FN) gradients in the extracellular matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. If we denote by n the endothelial cell density per unit area, then the equation describing endothelial cell conservation is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∂n ∂t = random D∇ 2 n - chemotaxis ∇ • (χ (c)n∇c) - haptotaxis ρ∇ • (n∇ f ) .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The chemotactic migration is characterised by the function χ (c) = χ /(1 + δc) which reflects the decrease in chemotactic sensitivity with increased TAF concentration. The coefficients D, χ and ρ characterise the random, chemotactic and haptotactic cell migration respectively.</p><p>Tumour angiogenesis factors (TAFs) and fibronectin (FN) bind to specific membrane receptors on endothelial cells and subsequently trigger molecular cascades inside the ECs, activating cell migratory machinery. One consequence of this activation process is the production by the cells of a matrix degrading enzyme (MDE), which enhances the attachment of the cells to fibronectin contained in the extracellular matrix. The endothelial cells are consequently able to exert the traction forces required to propel themselves during migration.</p><p>In the initial model <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, endothelial cell densities and their global influence on TAF and FN concentrations were considered in a continuous formulation. Here, we choose to focus on local effects and consider the influence of each individual cell on its local environment. The model is then given by the following set of equations: The displacement of each individual endothelial cell, located at the tips of each growing sprout, is given by the discretised form of the endothelial cell mass conservation Eq. (1). The discretisation performed from Euler finite difference approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> leads to: n q+1 l,m = n q l,m P 0 + n q l+1,m P 1 + n q l-1,m P 2 + n q l,m+1 P 3 + n q l,m-1 P 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> where l and m are positive parameters which specify the position of the endothelial cell on the 2D grid i.e. x = l x and y = l y. Time discretisation is represented by t = q t. The migration of the individual cell is determined by the set of coefficients P i which relate to the likelihood of the cell being stationary (P 0 ), or moving left (P 1 ), right (P 2 ), up (P 3 ) or down (P 4 ) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). These coefficients incorporate the effects of random, chemotactic and haptotactic movement and depend upon the local chemical environment within the ECM (i.e. the local FN and TAF concentrations).</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∂c ∂t = -ηn i c,<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">∂ f ∂t = βn i -γ m f,<label>(3)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Modified rules for branching and anastomosis</head><p>The processes of branching (formation of new sprouts from existing sprout tips) and anastomosis (formation of loops by fusion of two colliding capillary sprouts) are incorporated into the discretised form of the model as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. These rules constitute the basic requirements for the generation of realistic vascular networks. One weakness of the model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for network growth, however, is that the influence of the wall shear stress is not considered (despite the fact that this mechanism plays a leading role in growth and branching). In the current paper, we incorporate this mechanism into the modelling and assess its effect upon network architecture. The rules for branching have been adapted, as both sprouts and vessels can branch under the influence of wall shear. As the shear stress is due to the blood flowing through the capillaries, vessel branching can only occur after some degree of anastomosis has taken place. Additional conditions for vessels branching are as follows: (i) the likelihood of a vessel branching increases with both the local TAF concentration and the magnitude of the shear stress affecting the vessel wall; (ii) the vessel must reach a certain level of maturation before it is able to branch. This is based on experimental observations by laser scanning confocal imaging of fluorescent vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> which reveals that angiogenic sprouts mainly emanate from functional vessels, i.e. vessels which have formed a lumen to carry plasma and blood. Contrasting this, once a basal lamina is formed around a vessel, the endothelial cells become less sensitive to angiogenic factors and branching cannot occur anymore <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Boundary and initial conditions</head><p>The domain considered is a square of length L = 2 mm <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The parent vessel from which the vascular network grows is located at the upper edge of the domain and the tumour is located on the opposite edge as indicated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>We assume that the capillary sprouts remain confined within the boundary of the domain, which means that no-flux boundary conditions are imposed on the boundaries. Initial TAF and FN profiles are shown schematically in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. In order to initiate the vascular growth, five initial sprouts are evenly distributed along the parent vessel as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(a) and 2(b).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Non-Newtonian blood properties</head><p>Blood is a very complex biphasic medium, composed of many different constituents. The solid phase essentially contains cellular elements: (i) red blood cells (erythrocytes) involved in oxygen and carbon dioxide transport; (ii) white blood cells (leukocytes) involved in the organism's defence against invasion by bacteria and viruses, and (iii) platelets involved in clotting cascades. These solid elements are carried in the plasma, which constitutes the fluid phase. The plasma is a solution containing electrolytes as well as organic molecules such as metabolites, hormones, enzymes, antibodies and other proteins. Solid elements represent approximately 45% of the total blood composition -red cells are predominant. A measure of the solid phase is given by the blood haematocrit, which represents the volume fraction of red blood cells contained in the blood. The average human haematocrit has a value of around 45%. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows representative sizes of the red blood cells in comparison with the capillary microvessels.</p><p>Owing to its biphasic nature, blood does not behave as a continuum and the viscosity measured while flowing at different rates in microvessels is not constant. At a given flow rate (Q) in a cylindrical capillary of radius R, measured viscosity is really an "apparent viscosity" and is determined from the following expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">µ app = π R 4 8L • P Q (6)</formula><p>where L is the capillary length and P the axial pressure drop. The relative apparent viscosity (a dimensionless parameter) is then defined by dividing the apparent viscosity by the plasma viscosity, i.e.: µ rel = µ app /µ plasma .  The plasma viscosity is typically 1.2 cp <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Direct measurement of blood viscosity in living microvessels is very difficult to achieve with any degree of accuracy. Pries et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> have proposed an alternative approach, which entails comparisons of the flow distribution in a numerical network (generated by a mathematical model) with similar experimental systems. The relationship which was found to offer the best fit with the experimental data at the microvascular scale is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">µ rel (R, H D ) = 1 + (µ 0.45 -1) f (H D ) 2R 2R -1.1 2 2R 2R -1.1 2 (7)</formula><p>where µ 0.45 is the viscosity corresponding to the normal average value of the discharge haematocrit (H D = 0.45), R the vessel radius and f (H D ) a function of the haematocrit. These terms are defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">µ 0.45 = 6e -0.17R + 3.2 -2.44e -0.06(2R) 0.0645 ,<label>(8)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">f (H D ) = (1 -H D ) C -1 (1 -0.45) C -1 ,<label>(9)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">C = (0.8 + e -0.15R ) -1 + 1 1 + 10 -11 (2R) 12 + 1 1 + 10 -11 (2R) 12 . (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>The apparent viscosity corresponding to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">8</ref>) is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> for various values of the haematocrit over the range of radii typical of the capillary scale. It can be seen that the apparent blood viscosity generally increases with decreasing capillary radius, although the precise relationship is actually haematocrit-dependent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Modelling flow through a network</head><p>This area of research has been extensively studied in the context of petroleum engineering, where the main focus has been to investigate the flow of water, oil, and gas through the interstices of a porous rock (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> for an overview). A first step towards adaptation of fluid modelling techniques from the oil industry to biomedical applications has previously been performed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. However in this earlier work, blood viscosity and vessel radii were considered invariant (constant blood viscosity and fixed capillary radii), whereas biological structures tend to exhibit some degree of compliance. Here, we extend the earlier formulation to account for variable blood viscosity and evolving capillary radii. Network flow calculations are based upon a local relationship between pressure gradient D and flow Q at the scale of a single capillary element of length L and radius R. Such a relationship in the case of a non-Newtonian fluid can be approximated by the following expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Q = π R 4 P 8µ app (R, H D )L<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where µ app (R, H D ) is the apparent blood viscosity which depends on the local blood haematocrit and radius of the vessel through Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">8</ref>). Assuming mass conservation and incompressible flow at each junction (i, j) where capillary elements meet (a node) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), we can write for each node:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">N k=1 Q (i, j),k = 0 (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>where the index k refers to adjacent nodes and N = 4 in 2D or 6 in 3D. This procedure leads to a set of linear equations for the nodal pressures (P i ) which can be solved numerically using any of a number of different algorithms (e.g. Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR), Choleski conjugate gradient method, Lanczos method). Once nodal pressures are known, Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">11</ref>) can be used to calculate the flow in each capillary element in turn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Stimuli influencing vessel diameter adaptation</head><p>Blood rheological properties and microvascular network remodelling are interrelated issues. Indeed, blood flow creates stresses on the vascular wall (shear stress, pressure, tensile stress) which lead to adaptation of the vascular diameters via either vasodilatation or constriction. In turn, blood rheology (viscosity, haematocrit, etc.) is affected by the new network architecture. To model vascular remodelling of a pre-existing network, we propose to use the theoretical model developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The model considers a number of stimuli on vessel diameter adaptation (S i ) that account for the influence of the wall shear stress (S wss ), the intravascular pressure (S p ) and a metabolic mechanism depending on the blood haematocrit (S m ). The authors argue that these stimuli (S wss , S p , S m ) form a basic set of requirements in order to obtain stable network structures with realistic distributions of vessel diameters and flow velocities. The theoretical model assumes that for each segment of the network considered, the change in its radius ( R) over a time step t is proportional to both the global stimulus (S tot ) applied on the segment and to the initial vessel radius R, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">R = S tot R t. (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>The global stimulus on the segment under consideration corresponds to the sum of each individual stimulus S wss , S p , and S m corresponding to the wall shear stress, the intravascular pressure, and the metabolic stimulus respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, hence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">S tot = S wss + S p + S m .<label>(14)</label></formula><p>Each stimulus will now be briefly discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1.">Wall shear stress</head><p>The organisation of vascular networks depends on a number of physical principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the first of which was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. This principle is based on the minimization of energetic costs in order to sustain blood flow throughout the vasculature. A consequence of this principle implies that the wall shear stress should remain constant in each vessel <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. This is realised via adaptations in vessel radii. Hence vessel radius tends to increase with increasing wall shear stress, whilst wall shear stress decreases with increasing radius. The wall shear stress stimulus is here described as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, by the following logarithmic law:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">S wss = log(τ w + τ ref )<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where τ w is the actual wall shear stress in a vessel segment calculated from:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">τ w = 4µ(R, H D ) π R 3 |Q| (<label>16</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>and τ ref is a constant included to avoid singular behaviour at low shear rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Adaptation in response to the wall shear stress stimulus alone tends to reinforce a single dendritic path in the network corresponding to the main flowing backbone of the vasculature whilst simultaneously eliminating the low-flow paths. In this case, the resulting network is unstable, as no consistent balance for the radius and flow distribution can be achieved if the wall shear stress stimulus is considered in isolation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2.">Intravascular pressure</head><p>Intravascular pressure is another key stimulus for vascular adaptation. Pries et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> have experimentally observed on the rat mesentery the dependence of the magnitude of the wall shear stress with the local intravascular pressure (P). They proposed a parametric description of their experimental data, which exhibits a sigmoidal increase of the wall shear stress with increasing pressure through the following (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>): τ e (P) = 100 -86 • exp -5000 • log(log P) 5.4 . The sensitivity of the corresponding stimulus to intravascular pressure is then described by: S p = -log τ e (P).</p><p>(18)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.3.">Metabolic haematocrit-related stimulus</head><p>The introduction of a metabolic stimulus stabilizes the network by stimulating vessel growth in segments with low flows.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Simulation results</head><p>In the following section, we present results corresponding to a number of different stages in the formulation of our adaptive tumour-induced angiogenesis (ATIA) model. The first series of simulations is undertaken to demonstrate the effect of explicitly incorporating matrix degrading enzyme activity into the formulation. We are particularly interested in assessing its effect upon global bed architecture, i.e. can this extended model produce realistic vascular structures that compare well with experimental observations? Throughout this first set of simulations, only sprout branching is considered and this is assumed to be controlled primarily by TAF concentrations in the local sprout environment. The next series of simulations, however, models capillary growth, sprout branching and vessel branching under the combined effects of both local TAF concentration and local wall shear stress. The resulting vascular structures are compared with structures generated without shear stress effects.</p><p>The final series of simulations examines the influence of blood rheological properties on vascular remodelling.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Simulation of tumour-induced capillary growth</head><p>The new model for tumour-induced capillary growth described by the system of equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) was solved numerically on an 80 × 80(x, y) grid using square cells of side x = y. The system of equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) was solved for each grid point at each time step and the resulting variables c and f were then used to calculate the coefficients P 0 to P 4 appearing in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), which define the preferred migratory direction of each endothelial cell, i.e. the direction of growth of each sprout. Unless otherwise indicated, the dimensionless parameter values used for the simulations presented in this paper were as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">D = 0.00035 δ = 0.6 χ = 0.38 ρ = 0.16 η = 0.1 β = 0.05 γ = 0.1 α = 10e -6 ε = 0.01 ν = 3.</formula><p>The time parameter was normalized as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">t = t τ<label>(21)</label></formula><p>with τ = L 2 /D c , where L = 2 mm was the length of the domain and D c = 2.9 × 10 -7 cm 2 s -1 was taken as the diffusion coefficient for TAF <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. At this stage, only sprout branching was considered, with the likelihood of a sprout branching only depending upon the local TAF concentration. The sprout branching probabilities associated with the various TAF concentration ranges have been chosen on a qualitative basis and reflect the well-documented observation of increased branching close to a tumour boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. The values chosen are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and reflect the values in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> present the simulation results associated with an initial linear gradient of TAF (cf.

We observe in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> the stochastic nature of each of the five sprout trajectories as they progress towards the tumour (the surface of which occupies the lower boundary of the domain). At time t = 2 (corresponding to t = 3 days), sprout branching starts to occur for sprouts 2 and 4 (numbered from left to right) and by t = 3 (4.5 days) a small degree of local anastomosis has already taken place for three of the five sprouts. Note, however, that no perfusion would occur within the capillary bed at this time, as no large-scale arcades have yet been formed.</p><p>Anastomosis increases considerably with increased sprout branching in regions far from the parent vessel and the various vascular trees rapidly connect with one another after t = 6 (9 days). This increase in anastomosis is related to an increase in lateral migration due to the appearance of a connected MDE front as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> (from t = 6). It takes approximately 15 days for the growth process to be completed, i.e. for the vasculature to connect the tumour to the parent vessel and hence to the blood supply. It is assumed that once a sprout reaches the tumour, it continues to grow into it. In terms of the present model this means that the sprouts disappear from the domain of simulation, and this explains why the MDE is no longer present in the domain at the end of the simulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>).</p><p>Figs. 9 and 10 present simulation results associated with an initial circular gradient of TAF (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(b)</ref>) and show the network growth and associated MDE concentration in the domain. We observe that the five initial sprouts rapidly converge (t = 3.5). This consequently leads to the fusion of the individual MDE sources which restricts the capillary growth to a narrow corridor, where the MDE concentration is high. This continues until the sprouts reach the tumour and the sources disappear from view. Once again, the vascularisation process takes approximately 15 days.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Capillary network growth regulated by the wall shear stress</head><p>We now present results from simulations that take into account the influence of wall shear stress upon the branching process -this leads to vessel branching in addition to the existing sprout branching previously considered. Note that sprout branching is still important in the production of the first connections between the growing vascular trees, allowing blood to flow into the evolving capillary bed, thereby creating the shear stresses required for vessel branching. The combined effects of the local wall shear stress and TAF concentration upon vessel branching probability have been implemented in the model as described in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. The probabilities chosen for the vessel branching process have once again been defined on a qualitative basis in order to reflect the combined influence of the wall shear stress (WSS) and local TAF concentration. High values of WSS in tandem with high local TAF concentrations lead to a higher branching probability, whilst lower values of one or both of WSS and TAF concentration lead to lower branching probability. Note that the process of vessel branching supplements the process of sprout branching. Therefore the probabilities of sprout branching are still the same and given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>; hence, we regain the original results (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>) when the shear stress effect is removed.</p><p>Another constraint on vessel branching is the age of the vessel. This range has been fixed at <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> days in the simulations (i.e. from t = 2.66 to t = 5.33), and corresponds to a timescale where the vessel is sufficiently mature for branching but has not had sufficient time to develop a basal lamina (which would contribute considerably to the stabilization of the network) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</p><p>Figs. 11 and 13 display the simulation results, which correspond to an initial linear gradient of TAF and an initial circular gradient of TAF, respectively. We note that the model parameters used for these simulations are the same as those used in the previous simulations. The associated MDE density evolution corresponding to each case are given in (The TAF concentrations are normalized by the maximum value c 0 = 10 -10 M taken for the simulations as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and the WSS values are fractions of the maximum stress τ ref <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.)</p><p>Figs. 12 and 14. In both cases, sprout branching is initially the only branching process and the vascular architectures are identical to those emerging from the previous simulations (compare Figs. 11 and 13 with Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>). Vessel branching only begins after the vascular trees have formed arcades -the capillary bed then becomes perfused with blood and shear stresses are exerted on vessel walls. The effect is highlighted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">15</ref>, where new capillaries can be seen branching from mature vessels once more distal arcades have formed and begun to flow. At this stage the vascular architectures diverge from the previous cases (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>) with high capillary densities close to the tumour surface.</p><p>The new emerging sprouts produce MDE and can therefore be easily spotted on the MDE density snapshots displayed in Figs. 12 and 14. For the linear case (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref>) at time t = 8 new patches appear behind the initial MDE front produced via sprout branching. At time t = 14 additional isolated patches appear but rapidly vanish as the newly formed vessels reconnect to the dense network.</p><p>Vessel branching is even more apparent for the circular tumour case (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">14</ref>), as the main growing vessels rapidly converge. Although the primary front of MDE (due to sprout branching) has already reached the tumour at time t = 6, a secondary front of MDE (now due to vessel branching) appears. This progresses once again towards the tumour, reinforcing network density and connectivity. Isolated patches of MDE can still be seen at later times until the network becomes fully mature and stabilised.</p><p>The evolution of the vasculature is dynamic and continuous, with local increases in network connectivity leading to a global redistribution of wall shear stress. This redistribution can, in turn, reinforce vessel connectivity in other parts of the network and modify flow accordingly. We can see in all cases how the part of the network close to the surface of the tumour becomes particularly dense -the branching probability in this region is high and this contributes to the reinforcement phenomenon. The model consequently reproduces the brush border effect observed experimentally particularly well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Comparison of the network architectures</head><p>Although differences in bed architecture with and without the influence of WSS may, at first glance, appear somewhat modest, the global effects of these variations can be very profound indeed, particularly with regard to drug delivery to the tumour <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The aim of this section is to quantitatively compare vasculatures generated from a sprout-only branching model with those obtained from a model that includes vessel branching. To this end, three vasculatures have been generated corresponding to three different values of the haptotactic coefficient (ρ = 0.12, ρ = 0.16 and ρ = 0.20). We then compare the density and spatial distribution of connectivity under sprout-only branching and sprout-plus-vessel branching. The connectivity is defined here as the number of capillary elements meeting at a given node (junction) of the vascular network. Hence for 2D vasculatures, the branching coefficient at each node can either be 4, 3, 2 or 1 (identified as z 4 , z 3 , z 2 and z 1 in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">16</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">17</ref>). The global architecture of a network is then characterised by scanning the capillary bed parallel from the parent vessel to the tumour. At each cross-sectional ordinate (x) we calculate the sums:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">z tot i = total</formula><p>number of nodes having i capillary elements connected to it (i = 1, 2, 3, 4). This procedure was proposed in an earlier paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and allows us to construct a "fingerprint" for each network. Comparisons between vasculatures generated with and without the influence of wall shear stress show some major differences in vessel density and connectivity. In the first case presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">16</ref> (no WSS effect), the capillary density increases monotonically as we approach the tumour surface and the connectivity is essentially dominated by z 2 (i.e. connections between two vessels). In the second case (with WSS), the increase in vessel connectivity is more dramatic as we approach the tumour surface, dominated this time by z 3 and z 4 (i.e. involving connections between 3 or 4 vessels). These latter vascular beds thus exhibit a more complex level of organisation with distinct, identifiable regions, viz a ramified region proximal to the parent vessel and a dense, highly connected region close to the tumour surface. The reinforcement mechanism described previously is responsible for the amplification in vascular connectivity (branching and anastomosis) near the tumour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Capillary network adaptation to rheological constraints</head><p>The second feedback mechanism we consider in the context of dynamic angiogenesis involves vascular remodelling, where the radii of vessels within a pre-existing homogeneous network evolve dynamically under the influence of different haematocrit distributions. The vasculatures generated in the previous sections were homogeneous in radius, in the sense that the radii of all the vessels were assumed to remain invariant throughout a simulation. In reality, the distribution of capillary radii is highly heterogeneous, as the radius of a capillary strongly depends upon its associated flow, blood haematocrit, blood viscosity and upon a range of stimuli, both haemodynamic (shear stress, intravascular pressure) and metabolic. Obviously, adaptation of the vessel radii begins as soon as blood begins flowing through capillary arcades. This means that the vasculature is constantly adapting and remodelling itself during the growth process and this is the underlying ethos of adaptive tumour-induced angiogenesis. As a precursor to our ultimate aim of producing a fully-adaptive model, we begin by considering how perfusion within an initially homogeneous capillary bed influences radii adaptation, i.e. vascular remodelling. We note that a similar approach, coupled to a cellular automaton model of tumour growth, has recently been used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> to investigate heterogeneous distributions of haematocrit within tumours.</p><p>In the simulations presented below, the initial condition is that of a homogeneous bed, corresponding to that generated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>. The initial radius of each capillary segment is 6 mm except the radius of the parent vessel, which is 14 mm and is assumed to remain constant. Remodelling of the vessels is permitted within a range, from a minimum radius of 2 mm to a maximum radius of 12 mm. These values correspond to vessel radii at the capillary level, where the size of the vessels are very close to the size of the red blood cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The parameters of the adaptation model given in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">19</ref>) are:   Q ref to the flow in the parent vessel, calculated from Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">11</ref>) with R = 14 µm, L = 2 mm and P = 8000 Pa (60 mmHg) (pressure drop across the parent vessel). The apparent viscosity µ app is measured from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> for a discharge haematocrit H D = 0.45 which is assumed to remain constant in the parent vessel <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">18</ref> shows the results of vascular remodelling. Initially, the vasculature is filled only with plasma i.e. the blood haematocrit H D = 0 (note that there is no contribution from the metabolic stimulus, i.e. k m = 0 until H D is non-zero). Red blood cells then begin flowing into the network from a parent vessel of constant haematocrit H D = 0.45. The left column of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">18 (a, c, e</ref> and<ref type="figure">g</ref>) shows the evolution of vessel radii at times t = 1, 2, 3.5 and 4 respectively. The right column of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">18 (b, d, f</ref> and<ref type="figure">h</ref>) shows the corresponding haematocrit distribution in the vasculature. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">19</ref> shows the results of vascular remodelling for the same architecture containing an initial patch of red blood cells (haematocrit H D = 0.45) located in the middle of the network (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">19(b)</ref>). The aim here was to assess the importance of the initial haematocrit distribution in the network in determining its final morphology. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">19 (a,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>, e and g) shows the vessel radii at times t = 1, 2, 3.5 and 4 respectively, and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">19 (b, d, f</ref> and<ref type="figure">h</ref>) the corresponding haematocrit profiles. Comparison of the two resulting adapted vasculatures shows that there are only minor differences in the final distributions of vessel radii.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Nutrient and drug transport through the adapted network</head><p>In the previous section, the implementation of vascular adaptation mechanisms allowed us to generate a network that appears morphologically realistic. The aim of this section is to quantify the efficiency of such a network vis à vis its ability to carry blood-borne material (nutrients, drugs) to the tumour. In order to achieve this, we infuse a tracer into the parent vessel and observe its evolution within the capillary bed. Two different drug delivery regimes have been considered, either a continuous infusion or a bolus injection.</p><p>Figs. 20 and 21 correspond to the continuous infusion case. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">20</ref> shows how the total mass of tracer in both the adapted and homogeneous vasculatures vary with time. We observe that the amount of tracer is significantly higher in the adapted vasculature and steady-state is reached far sooner. This is due to (i) radial adaptations resulting in a doubling of the total volume of the vasculature itself, and (ii) vascular remodelling at the bed scale, which mitigates the bypassing effects characteristic of highly connected homogeneous systems. This has important consequences for modelling cancer treatment using cytotoxic drugs -Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">21</ref> presents a comparison of drug uptake between the adapted and homogeneous vasculatures (assuming the tracer to be a cytotoxic agent). We find that delivery to the tumour under conditions of continuous infusion is faster and more effective in the adapted network.</p><p>Figs. 22 and 23 correspond to the bolus injection case, with the aim to investigate dilution effects. The injection is turned off at the normalized instant t = 1.45. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">22</ref> shows, as in the previous continuous case, that the resistance to the flow has been significantly reduced in the adapted network as the radii of the main vessels are bigger. This effect is not only reflected in the differences of amplitude between the curves but also by the shapes of the curves. Whereas in the adapted case the amount of drug decreases linearly as soon as the injection of drug is turned off, the decrease is non-linear in the homogeneous case and reflects the resistance effect. This means that no main path exists to direct the flow towards the tumor and blood has to find its way through the gap in connectedness existing between the few main upper vessels and the bulk of the network (more connected). This obstacle is reduced in the adapted network where preferential paths for blood flow have been formed to connect the parent vessel to the tumour. Although the same amount of drug has been perfused in both the homogeneous and the adapted network, we observe from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">22</ref> that most of it does not even penetrate into the vasculature in the homogeneous case. Consequently, the amount of drug reaching the tumour is significantly smaller for this vasculature compared to the adapted one as exhibited in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">23</ref>.</p><p>These simulations demonstrate that vascular adaptation and the resulting bed architecture are important issues that cannot be ignored when modelling angiogenic processes at the micro-scale. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion and conclusion</head><p>The mathematical modelling of blood flow in a tumour-induced capillary network was considered in earlier papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The aim then was to investigate the process of drug delivery to a tumour via a static vascular network containing a Newtonian fluid of constant viscosity. These hypotheses were clearly very crude approximations of the actual physical situation and the present paper has sought to make significant improvements concerning both network growth and flow modelling. To this end, we have presented results corresponding to a number of different stages in the formulation of our adaptive tumour-induced angiogenesis (ATIA) model. Firstly, a new formulation for tumour-induced angiogenesis in the absence of flow has been proposed. This new model, utilized as a foundation   for subsequent development, is based on the earlier approaches in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Here, we explicitly take account of the regulation of the growth process by a matrix-degrading enzyme (MDE), produced by the migrating endothelial cells. The motivation for taking this enzyme into account explicitly in the modelling formulation is due to its importance as a new target for therapy. Indeed, several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> have shown that the formation of a functional vascular network is strongly dependent upon the proteolytic activity of this protein. Another aim of this study has been to increase the realism of vascular modelling algorithms, leading to improved simulations of therapy protocols and allowing treatment efficiency to be quantified more effectively. A more in-depth analysis of cancer therapy will be the focus of a forthcoming paper. Here, we have focused on network adaptation due to rheological constraints, where blood has been considered as a non-Newtonian fluid, in keeping with its biphasic nature.</p><p>We have first considered the influence of blood flow on the vascular growth process itself and our approach has been based upon experimental observations, which suggest that the wall shear stress associated with perfusion could be responsible for the emergence of new sprouts via endothelial cell stimulation. It has been assumed, not unreasonably, that vessel branching occurs preferentially in immature vessels that have not yet formed a basal lamina. The growth mechanism related to shear stress thus allows the network to adapt its architecture dynamically as the flow distribution within the capillary bed evolves. A reinforcement mechanism has emerged from our study, whereby the vessel density dramatically increases via vessel branching near the tumour surface. This is due to high levels of localised wall shear stress in parts of the vasculature far from the parent vessel. Increased anastomosis (i.e. the formation of capillary arcades) aids the progressive release of shear stress near the tumour, whilst ensuring vessel connection to the parent vessel. The resulting vasculatures are highly heterogeneous, consisting of a sparse network proximal to the parent vessel coupled to a dense distal ensemble of capillaries. Many of these structures contrast sharply with those generated without the influence of wall shear stress.</p><p>In the final part of the study, we have implemented a number of feedback mechanisms related to the adaptation of vessel radii to both haemodynamic and metabolic stimuli. We have adapted an existing model proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, based on experimental observations and measurements performed on the rat mesentery. It has emerged that both haemodynamic (shear stress, transmural pressure) and metabolic stimuli must be included in order to generate stable vascular structures. A remodelling algorithm has been used in the context of a tumour-induced vasculature, with the aim of assessing the efficiency of subsequent chemotherapy treatments (i.e. successful drug delivery to the tumour). Results presented here have focused upon a posteriori adaptation, i.e. adaptation of an existing fully-grown vasculature. In order to evaluate the importance of the initial haematocrit condition upon the final adapted network, we have considered two different initial conditions: first a network free of red blood cells (H D = 0), and secondly, a network with a patch of red cells (H D = 0.45) at its centre. The resulting networks are virtually identical, with only minor differences reflecting the variation in the initial conditions. Hence, if sufficient time is allowed for remodelling, the same optimised architecture appears to emerge regardless of the initial haematocrit distribution. Of course, the initial distribution is no longer an issue if adaptation is considered during growth. This work is ongoing and it will be interesting to see if the same optimised architecture is produced.</p><p>The natural and important extension to our model of allowing the simultaneous adaptation (vasodilation and vasoconstriction) of parts of the network as it grows is expected to have considerable implications for therapy. This formulation would allow us to investigate dynamically the effects of anti-angiogenic drugs on the growing vascular network. We then expect to be able to test and optimise, via numerical simulations, various treatment protocols that couple chemotherapy with anti-angiogenic therapies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

Successive snapshots of the capillary bed taken at different stages of the growth process showing the associated magnitude of the wall shear stress in the vessels. Each vascular tree grows independently until it connects with another. Each connection leads to a sharp increase in the local wall shear stress, as the blood is able to flow in the recently-connected structure (for t = 7.2 a connection occurs in the middle of the bed and for t = 9 other connections are made). This leads to the emergence of new sprouts (highlighted by the white circles) in upper parts of the network where the wall shear stress is sufficiently high. The colour code represents fractions of the maximum WSS.</figDesc><graphic coords="20,44.75,63.40,451.39,274.26" type="bitmap" /></figure>
