<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Finding paths of minimal length between two areas on a three dimensional surface is of great importance in many fields such as computer-aided neuroanatomy, robotic motion planning (autonomous vehicle navigation), geophysics, terrain navigation, etc. Paths of minimal Euclidean distance between two points on a surface are usually referred to as minimal geodesics.</p><p>A new approach for dealing with the problem of finding the minimal distance paths, in which the surface is given as height samples on a rectangular grid, is introduced. As a first step, a distance map from the source area is calculated. The distance map is computed via equal distance curve propagation on the surface. Equal distance curves are calculated as the zero sets of a bivariate function evolving in time. This formulation of curve evolution processes is due to <ref type="bibr">Osher and Sethian,</ref><ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[17]</ref>. It overcomes some topological and numerical problems encountered in direct implementations of curve evolutions using parametric representations. The implicit representation of the evolving curve produces a stable and accurate numerical scheme for tracing shock waves in fluid dynamics.</p><p>The proposed numerical scheme is consistent with the continuous propagation rule. The consistency condition guarantees that the solution converges to the true one as the grid is refined and the time step in the numerical scheme is kept in the right proportion to the grid size. This is known not to be the case in general graph search algorithms that suffer from digitization bias due to the metrication error when implemented on a grid <ref type="bibr">[IO]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>.</p><p>The relation between minimal paths, geodesics and equal distance contours may be found in elementary differential geometry textbooks, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[2]</ref>. Geodesics are locally shortest paths in the sense that any perturbation of a geodesic curve will increase its length. The minimal length paths between two points are the minimal geodesics connecting those points. A simple way of determining minimal geodesics is by constructing a so-called geodesic polar coordinate system on the surface around the source area. Using such a coordinate system readily provides the geodesic circle map, or the map of equal distance contours on the surface.</p><p>In the next section an analytic model for the equal distance contour evolution is discussed. In Section 111, a numerical implementation of the analytic propagation is presented. The results of the nu- merical algorithm are demonstrated by an example in Section IV. We conclude with a discussion of some possible extensions of the algorithm and comment on its complexity in Section V.</p></div>

Assume there is a parameterization point u I # uo through which the minimal path passes at t = a + E (? = b -E ) . According to that assumption there is a minimal path PI -+ adul, a) + a + E) .r* P2 of length a + E + ( b -E). However, part of this path, PI .-3 as(ul, a), is not equal to the original subpath of the minimal path PI 4 a&amp;(), a), and this contradicts the assumption that the minimal path should pass through q u o , a), and concludes the proof. 0</p><p>We also have the following result.</p><p>COROLLARY 1 .

Note that the shortest paths are minimal value level sets of the function 34s + 34~. This observation will later be used on to find the minimal paths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="111.">THE NUMEFUCAL APPROXIMATION</head><p>When implementing curve evolution equations such as (2) on a digital computer, a number of problems must be solved.</p><p>Topological changes may occur while the curve evolves, i.e., the curve may change its topology from one connected curve to two separate evolving curves, or, two curves may merge into one. In [ 171, [ 141 some numerical problems which characterize a direct formulation of (2) are described. The problems are caused due to a time varying coordinate system (U, t) of the direct representation (where U is the parameterization, and tthe time). An initial smooth curve can develop curvature singularities. The question is how to continue the evolution after singularities appear. The natural way is to choose the solution which agrees with the Huygens principle <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. Viewing the curve as the front of a buming flame, this solution states that once a particle is burned, it cannot be reignited <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[17]</ref>. It can also be proved that from all the weak solutions of (2) part the singularities, the one derived from the Huygens principle is unique, and can be obtained by a constraint denoted as the entropy condition [ 141. <ref type="bibr">Sethian and Osher [ 171,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[ 141</ref> proposed an algorithm for curve and surface evolution that elegantly solves these problems. As a first step in constructing the algorithm, the curve is embedded in a higher dimensional function. Then, evolution equations for the implicit representation of the curve are solved using numerical techniques derived from hyperbolic conservation laws [ 121.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Eulerian Formulation</head><p>Let the curve C(t) be represented by the zero level set of a smooth Lipschitz continuous function Q : R'x [0, T)+ R, so that $ is negative in the interior and positive in the exterior of the zero level set $ = 0. Consider the zero level set defined by {X(t) E R2 : NX, t ) = 0).</p><p>We have to find the evolution rule of $, so that the evolving curve C(t) can be represented by the evolving zero level set X(t), i.e.,</p></div>

X, + &amp;(A', t) = 0.</formula><p>Note that for any level set the planar normal can be written as = V$/llV$ll. Using this relation in conjunction with the condition equation (2) we obtain where the curve C(t) is obtained as the zero level set of Q. This procedure is known as the Eulerian formulation [ 171.</p><p>This formulation of planar curve evolution processes frees us from the need to take care of the possible topological changes in the propagating curve. The numerical implementation of (4) is based on monotone and conservative numerical algorithms, derived from hyperbolic conservation laws and the Hamilton-Jacobi "type" equations of the derivatives [ 141. For some normal velocities these numerical schemes automatically enforce the entropy condition, a condition equivalent to Huygensprinciple [ 161.</p><p>Using the normal component of the velocity, in (4), we get in our case</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">$, = Jucx.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Finite Difference Approximation</head><p>In our implementation, which is motivated by the relation to the Hamilton-Jacobi type equations, we use the following finite difference approximation These finite difference approximations yield a first order numerical scheme for the equal distance contours evolution. Using a forward difference approximation in time gives the following numerical scheme for the propagation of the hnction $Fj = $(&amp;, jAy, n h ) on the (x, y ) rectangular grid <ref type="figure">c,</ref><ref type="figure">,</ref><ref type="figure">~ minmod( D;</ref><ref type="figure">Q,</ref><ref type="figure">,</ref><ref type="figure">f,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>;Qi.j)minmod(D,+Qi.j, D;)i.j)]i which is the finite difference approximation of (5). This numerical scheme is stable and inherently overcomes topological changes in the evolving contour. For higher order accuracy numerical schemes that deal with such HumiltonJacobi type of equations see [ 121.</p></div>

Initialization</head><p>The function #x, y , 0) is actually an implicit representation of ai -the projection of the boundary of the source area 3s to the Nx, y, 0) using the observation that we are interested in the function behavior only near the relevant contour, (the zero level set).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Distance Assignment</head><p>After the initialization is completed, the Q function is propagated according to (6). While propagating the function, our goal is to find the distance of each grid point. A simple way of achieving (first order) accurate results is by interpolating the zero crossings. At every iteration step, for each grid point, check Using this procedure, each grid point gets its distance at the "time" when the @ functions'-zero level passes through it.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Iv. EXAMPLES AND RESULTS</head><p>We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm by applying it to a synthetic surface and finding the paths of minimal length given on a mesh of 256 x 256 points.

The (black) minimal geodesics connecting the source and the destination on the egg-box surface is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4a</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4b</ref> present the projection of the equal distance contours from the source point, on which the minimal (plus epsilon) level set is displayed as a smooth black curve and the two minimal geodesics as a chain of pixels. The sum of the distance maps from the source and destination is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4c</ref> and the geodesic distance from the destination point in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4d</ref>. The minimal level set of that sum surface (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4c</ref>) is the minimal geodesics. V. CONCLUDING REMARKS We have described a numerical method for calculating a geodesic distance map from a given area on a surface, so that topological problems in the propagated equal distance contours are inherently avoided. An algorithm for finding the minimal geodesics between two areas on the surface based on the distance mapping was constructed. The algorithm works on a grid: therefore it is easy to implement the algorithm in parallel using each mesh point as a small calculating device which communicates with its four close neighbors.</p><p>In each iteration we need to calculate the values of $(x, y , t) in those grid points close to the current contour and the rest of the grid points serve as sign holders. This can be exploited to reduce calculation effort. When not considering any possible redundancy, the calculation effort is of order O(&amp;;-m.n), where I, is the length of the shortest geodesic path and m . n is the number of grid points.</p><p>It was shown that wavefront propagation methods in fluid dynamics also provide a nice approach to the problem of finding the minimal geodesics.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Manuscript received Jan 27, 1993; revised Mar. 13, 1995.
