<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The fundamental requirements of information hiding systems are good visual quality, high hiding capacity, robustness and steganographic security. In this paper, we propose a new data hiding method which can increase the steganographic security of a data hiding scheme because it is less detectable by RS detection attack and the steganalytic histogram attack of pixel-value difference. In our method, a cover image is first mapped into a 1D pixels sequence by Hilbert filling curve and then divided into non-overlapping embedding units with two consecutive pixels. Because the human eyes tolerate more changes in edge and texture areas than in smooth areas, and pixel pairs in these areas often possess larger differences, the method exploits pixel value differences(PVD) to estimate the base of digits to be embedded into pixel pairs. Pixel pairs with larger differences are embedded with digits in larger base than those pixel pairs with smaller differences to maximize the payload and image quality. By using an optimization problem to solve the overflow/underflow problem, minimal distortion of the pixel ternaries cause by data embedding can be obtained. The experimental results show our method not only to enhance the embedding rate and good embedding capacity but also to keep stego-image quality.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Data hiding techniques can be carried out in three domains(Langelaar, Setyawan, Lagendijk, 2000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>), namely, spatial domain <ref type="bibr">(Mielikainen, 2006[2]</ref>), compress domain <ref type="bibr">(Chang, Kieu, Chou,2009a[3]</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Chang, Kieu, Chou, 2009[4]</ref>; Chang, Tai, Lin, 2006 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>), and frequency domain <ref type="bibr">(Lee, Yoo, Kaller, 2007[6]</ref>). Each domain has its own advantages and disadvantages in regard to hiding capacity, execution time, and storage space. The fundamental requirements of information hiding systems are good visual quality(i.e., image quality), high hiding capacity, robustness, and steganographic security(i.e., statistically undetectable) <ref type="bibr">(Langelaar et al.,2000[1]</ref>).</p><p>Designing a new data hiding system achieving good visual quality, high hiding capacity, robustness, and steganographic security is a technically challenging problem. Thus, there are different approaches in designing data hiding systems in the literature. Some of these approaches are as follows. The first approach is to increase hiding capacity(also called embedding capacity or payload)while maintaining a good visual quality or at the cost of lower visual quality <ref type="bibr">(Lan and Tewfik, 2006[7]</ref>). This approach is appropriate to applications where high hiding capacity is desired. The second approach purposes to devise a robust data hiding scheme <ref type="bibr">(Ni et al.,2008[8]</ref>). This design serves robust watermarking systems. The third approach aims at enhancing visual quality while keeping the same hiding capacity or at the cost of lower hiding capacity <ref type="bibr">(Ni, Shi, Ansari and Su, 2006[9]</ref>). The fourth approach intends to devise a data hiding scheme with high embedding efficiency <ref type="bibr">(Fridrich, Goljian, Soukal, 2006[10]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Mielikainen, 2006</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Westfeld, 2001[11]</ref>). This approach can increase the steganographic security of a data hiding scheme because it is less detectable by statistical stegnalysis <ref type="bibr">(Fridrich et al., 2007[12]</ref>).</p><p>In recent years many researchers are more enthusiastic to improve the embedding efficiency and decrease the possibility of detection. Least-significantbit(LSB) matching is the conventional efficient steganography method, and it is proved much more difficult to detect than simple LSB replacement.</p><p>To defeat the histogram based steganalysis methods, many efforts have</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT</head><p>been made by researchers to protect the histograms of images. One of the first solutions to defeat these attacks was LSB matching. LSB matching increases or decreases the pixel values with the same probabilities when the least significant bit of the pixel value is not equal to the message bit. In 2006, Mielikainen <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> developed a pairwise LSB matching method to improve the embedding efficiency. Nevertheless, Mielikainen's scheme is incomplete because the scheme only exploits two modification directions for secret data embedding.</p><p>Tan and Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> showed that the readjusting step of LSB matching revisedbased edge-adaptive <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> produces some effects in the long exponential tail of the histogram of the absolute difference of the pixel pairs. By using these effects, they proposed a steganalysis technique that could detect stego images and could estimate the used threshold in the data hiding process. In addition, Ghazanfari et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> proposed an adaptive steganography method based on the LSB matching which increases the capacity up to 150% <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and 158% <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Their second work <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is the extension of their previous scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> into the DCT domain. The LSB+ method suggested by Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> preserved the image histogram in spatial domain by embedding some extra bits in images. This method, however, results in statistical and perceptual distortions. A new technique for image steganography, called LSB ++ , was proposed in Kazem et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, which improves the LSB + by keeping some pixels from changing, results in reducing the number of extra bits. Their later work <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, they improved the LSB ++ method by proposing a technique to distinguish the sensitive pixels and keep them from extra bit embedding, as the embedding process causes fewer traces in the co-occurrence matrixes.</p><p>To fully exploit different modification directions for secret data embedding. Zhang and Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> also proposed the exploiting modification direction (EMD) method, which employs n pixels as an embedding unit, and embeds digits in 2n + 1 base. Its maximum payload is 1  2 log 2 5 ≈ 1.161bpp when n = 2. Zhang and Wang claimed that the modification directions of Mielikainen's scheme are not explored fully. Specifically, the PSNR value of the EMD method is slightly smaller than that of Mielikainen's scheme at hiding capacity of 1 bpp. In addition, for n = 2, Zhang and Wang's method only utilizes four modification directions. Kieu and Chang <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>(FEMD) proposed a novel extraction function (also called the modified extraction function) by modifying the extraction function proposed by Zhang and Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The modified extraction function allows the proposed method to exploit eight modification directions for embedding secret data, restrict the embedding</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT</formula><p>distortion into a square of various sizes(e.g.2 × 2, 3 × 3, and so on) and use the minimum distortion embedding(MDE) process. By this way, the proposed method can achieve various hiding capacities and good visual qualities compared to two recently published works, namely Mielikainen's method <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, Zhang and Wang's method <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. To solve the irreversibility of the EMD method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, Qin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> proposed a novel data hiding scheme based on EMD with reversibility by using two steganographic images, which can also achieve satisfactory performances of the hiding capacity and the stego image quality.</p><p>Inspired by EMD, Chao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> proposed a diamond encoding(DE) method to greatly improve the payload of EMD. DE employs a search region of B = 2k 2 + 2k + 1 elements to increase the payload because digits in base B can be embedded into a pixel pair, where k ≥ 1. A larger k indicates that a larger payload can be embedded with greater image distortion. DE employs an extraction function to generate diamond characteristic values(DCV), and uses an embedding parameter k to control the payload. A digit in a Bary notational system can be concealed into two pixels by modifying the pixel pairs according to their DCV's neighborhood set. However, DE can't embed digits in any notation system and the distortion caused by DE is larger than some other embedding methods with the same payload. Although DE has these advantages, it does not allow embedding digits in multiple bases, Which is the essential requirement for an embedding method with the consideration of HVS. Besides, to prevent the overflow and underflow problems from occurring, the pixel values exceed 0 or 255 will be added or subtracted by B to keep the pixel values within the range[0, 255]. This adjustment may cause a large distortion, and may result in image noise when the embedding parameter k is large. For example, if k = 5, then the base B used to conceal data is 2 × 5 2 + 2 × 5 + 1 = 61. However, a pixel value that is subtracted by 61 or added by 61 will cause a large distortion.</p><p>The aforementioned methods regard all pixels within an image can tolerate equal amounts of changes without causing visual artifacts to an observer. However, the tolerance of the changes to pixel values is different in smooth and edge areas according to human visual system(HVS). Based on the fact that edge areas can tolerate more severe changes than smooth areas, edge adaptive schemes have been proposed, which conceal more data in edge areas to acquire more embedding capacity whereas conceal less data in smooth area to preserve the visual quality. Moreover, in the kieu-Chang's scheme needs a storage place to store the search matrix data and they use the match method</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT</head><p>to embed the secret data. As a result, it is time-consuming and impractical for those method.</p><p>Another group of embedding strategies takes HVS into consideration, namely these methods embed more data in edge areas to acquire more payload whereas embed less data in smooth areas to preserve the visual quality. In 2003, Wu and Tsai <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> proposed a data embedding method based on pixel value differencing(PVD). In their method, the difference of two pixels in the cover image is calculated. The number of bits to be embedded into these two pixels is determined by their absolute difference and a pre-defined range table. Data bits are then embedded by modifying these two pixel values. Because the same range in the range table will be referred before and after data embedding, the same number of data bits can be determined and thus the embedded data bits can be exactly extracted. Due to pixel pairs with larger difference are often located in complex regions, PVD embeds more data into pixel pairs with larger differences. However, the PVD method may cause considerable distortion, leading to degradation in image quality. Moreover, the difference histogram of the stego image apparently deviates from that of the natural image; therefore, it is vulnerable to the detection of histogram analysis. In 2008, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> adopted the concept of PVD and proposed a data embedding method using pixel value differencing and modulus(MF-PVD). MF-PVD used the same mechanism that was used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> to determine the number of bits to be embedded into a given pixel pair, and then the remainder of these two pixels is calculated. Data is then embedded by modifying the remainder values. Compared to Wu and Tsai method, MF-PVD achieves a higher payload and better image quality.</p><p>Similarly, Hong <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> proposed a new scheme using the concept of pixel value differentiation and a patched reference table (PVD-PRT) to provide a better image quality and extendable embedding capacity. Furthermore, Lee et al. presented a practical method of using a cover image to hide the secret message using tri-way pixel-value differencing. The goal of the proposed approach is to provide secrecy while avoiding the detection by dual statistics steganalysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. In addition, Hong and Chen <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> proposed a steganography method based on pixel pair matching (PPM). This method utilizes the values of pixel pairs as a reference coordinate. To hide the message bits, this method first searches for a coordinate in the neighborhood set of this pixel pair based on the message bits. Then, this method replaces the pixel pair with the selected coordinate to embed the message bits.</p><p>In above PVD-based methods, the differences used for data hiding are</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT</formula><p>collected along a simple travel route, such as in the raster scanning order or zig-zag scanning order. These scanning methods take no account of image's contents and destroy the correlation of local pixels to some extent, so some revealing clues for detectors will be leaved. Hilbert filling order has better locality-preserving behavior than raster order and zig-zag order. This locality property preserves the correlation of adjacent pixels well and thus makes the distortion caused by data embedding more inconspicuous <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>In order to quick embedding secret and improve on these shortcomings, in this paper, we adopt the concept of PVD and employ two pixels as an embedding unit. Hilbert filling curve is used to map the cover image into a 1D pixel sequence. The proposed method not only consider HVS and the correlation of local pixels but also avoid storing the search matrix data.</p><p>The following is the introduction of each chapter. The second chapter is the related works, briefly reviewing EMD and Kieu-Chang's method. The third chapter explains the proposed method, describing the embedding and extracting algorithm by using a mathematical approach. The fourth chapter is an example of the embedding and extracting algorithms of the proposed method. The fifth chapter lists the experimental results. The sixth chapter is analysis and discussions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related works 2.1 Exploiting Modification Direction (EMD)</head><p>In the EMD scheme, all pixels in a cover image are pseudo-randomly permuted using a secret key to partition the pixels into a series of groups. A pixel group will be denoted as (g 1 , g 2 , ..., g n ), where n ≥ 2. In order to hide secret digits, digits for hiding need to be converted into a sequence of digits of a (2n+1)-ary notational system. A secret binary message can be divided into L = ⌊K × log 2 (2n + 1)⌋bits, and the decimal value of each part of the secret will be represented by K digits in the (2n + 1)-ary notational system. In this scheme, only one pixel in each pixel group is incremented or decremented by 1. A vector (g 1 , g 2 , ..., g n )in n-dimensional space is represented by its f value, which is calculated using Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">1</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f (g 1 , g 2 , ..., g n ) = (g 1 × 1 + g 2 × 2 + ... + g n × n)mod(2n + 1).<label>(1)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT</head><p>No modification of a pixel g is needed if a secret digit d equals the extraction function of the original pixel group. If the secret digit d = f , we must calculate s = d -f mod (2n + 1). If s is no more than n, the value of g s is increased by 1; otherwise, the value of g 2n+1-s is decreased by 1. The merit of the EMD scheme is that it provides good stego image quality with a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of more than 52 dB, because at most one cover pixel needs to be increased or decreased by 1 in each pixel group. Thus, the stego image has the advantage of resisting various steganalysis techniques. However, the EMD scheme has room for further improvement of its embedding capacity, because the embedding rate is R = (log 2 (2n + 1))/n.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.2.Kieu and Chang Scheme[21]</head><p>In order to improve the data hiding capacity kieu and Chang modified the extract function and proposed a new data hiding scheme to improve the data hiding capacity from 1 bpp to 4.5 bpp. In other words, the main idea of Kier-Chang scheme is that the value of s 2 can be hidden into 2 adjacent pixels in the cover image. Therefore, Kieu and Chang proposed another extraction function F (x i , x i+1 ) shown as Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">2</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">F (x i , x i+1 ) = [x i × (s -1) + x i+1 × s] mod s 2 . (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>where x i is the i th pixel value, s is the weighting coefficient. Then, Kieu and Chang use a 256 × 256 S-matrix to represent F (x i , x i+1 ) where the value of the x th i row and the x th i+1 column in S-matrix is F (x i , x i+1 ).

Subsequently, using the search matrix structure W (2r+1)×(2r+1) (s, (x i , x i+1 ), r) to embed the secret data by Kieu and Chang. In other words, the k-bit secret data can be embedded into pair(x i , x i+1 ) of cover image by using the S-matrix structure with the search range r, where k = ⌊log 2 s 2 ⌋ and r = ⌊s/2⌋. In order to reduce stego-image distortion, Kieu and Chang use the minimum distortion strategy method shown as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">D min = min j=a,b,c |x i -x j | + |x i+1 -y j |.<label>(3)</label></formula><p>to select local optimal solution D min in S(x j , y j ).

The embedded secret data is comprised of a random bit-stream that is generated from a random number generator beforehand. The operating system is Windows 7 Professional and our algorithms are programmed by Matlab2013a.

In principle, a lower value for MSE means less error, and as considered in Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_28">12</ref>), the inverse relationship between the MSE and PSNR translates to a high value of PSNR. Logically, a higher value of PSNR is good and signifies that the ratio of signal-to-noise is higher. In this representation, the "signal" is the original image, and the "noise" is the error in reconstruction. Therefore, the lower the MSE(and the higher the PSNR), the better the visual quality of the image.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> displays the experimental results of the original image and the cover image from the above experiment.

We can clearly know that if the cover image after embedding will be easily detected by human's eyes or not.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT</head><p>number of s 2 . They have a common character which have a same value of n(or s)in the whole original image in the embedding process. By contrast, the modulo is by the number s 2 i in our scheme, it was decided by the pixelvalue difference, in other word, different pixel-value difference have different values of s i . In addition, it therefore offers more accommodations than EMD and Kieu et.al's method to the embedding secret to conduct the capacitypromoting for higher capacity required in information hiding studies. Since the value of s 2 i is random rather than a fixed value in the whole image, our proposed is more secure than them. Additionally, in EMD method, to deal with the underflow or overflow problem, they change the saturated-pixel by one and run the embedding scheme again until the non saturated-pixel occurs. In our scheme, by using the six candidate pixel pairs decreases the number of the saturated-pixel and exploits the optimization problem to the rest of the pixel value encountering the condition of underflow or overflow among [0, 255].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">RS analysis</head><p>In this section, to check whether the function of the proposed embedding method can be detected with some newly announced related statistical data hiding techniques, we tested the cover images yielded by our method with the dual statistics method proposed by Fridrich et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> as a demonstration. By the method, all the pixels of a cover image into three pixel groups: the regular group R m or R -m , the singular group S m or S -m , and the unusable group. The cover image will pass the RS statistical analysis when R m ∼ = R -m and S m ∼ = S -m . Otherwise, the cover image will be judged as a suspicious object. The detection results our scheme gave (with the cover image being the one in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, where the x-axis represents the percentage of hiding capacity and the y-axis represents the percentage of the regular and singular pixel groups with masks m = [0110] and -m = [0 -1 -10]. Such diagrams are referred to as RS-diagrams. According to Fridrich et al, if more and more LSBs are replaced with random data, then the percentages R m and S m of the two pixel groups( regular and singular, respectively) in the diagram will become equal gradually when the mask of m is adopted in the statistics analysis process, or the percentages R -m and S -m will become more and more unequal when the mask of m is adopted. From the RS-diagram of Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> pixels embedded with data into their LSBs approaches 100%, the percentages of the regular and singular pixel groups will become more and more equal or unequal. But Fig. <ref type="figure">6(b),</ref><ref type="figure">(d</ref>)indicate that the cover images seemingly do not contain any embedded data in their LSBs, because the expected value of R m is seen close to that of R -m and so are the case of S m and S -m , i.e., R m ∼ = R -m . and S m ∼ = S -m . Accordingly, we can make a solid statement that the proposed scheme is secure against the RS detection attack.</p><p>[Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> about here.]</p></div>

In <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, Zhang and Wang showed that the original PVD scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> will inevitably introduce some undesired steps in the histogram of the differences between two continuous pixels in each embedding unit due to its fixed division of embedding units and its fixed quantization steps. By detecting and analyzing such artifacts, it is possible to estimate the size of hidden message especially when the embedding rate is high. Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> shows the PVD histograms of some original image and their corresponding stegos using our proposed method with the maximum embedding capacity, respectively.

In order to preserve the contents of the cover image better, we employ Hilbert filling curve to create 1D pixels sequence. The contributions of the proposed method are summarized as follows. Firstly, the original EMD method considers no image characteristic and embeds digits in the same base into the whole cover image; therefore, each pixel pair embeds equal amount of</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT</head><p>data. The proposed method modified the EMD method so that the digits in any bases can be embedded according to the local complexity of the cover image. Secondly, the proposed method reduces the detectable artifacts caused by the readjusting phase for overflow, underflow or falling-off boundary problem, which are serious in other PVD method. Third, our method does not require any memory space whereas Kier-Chang scheme requires about 524Kbytes(256 × 256 × 8 = 524.288Kb) to store the embedding matrix, because they use the search matrix method to finish embedding the secret data. Finally, Our scheme is able to resist the RS detection attack and the steganalytic histogram attack of pixel-value difference, and our method is more secure than PVD in both resisting statistical analysis. In conclusion, our scheme takes advantage of among pixel value-differencing, EMD and Kieu-Chang's method enabling it to produce an embedded image with significantly low distortion. Thus we can conclude that the proposed method has some merits and is applicable to steganographic application such as privacy protection of information transmission which requires high confidentiality and large embedding capacity.       </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>about here.] [Figure 2 about here.]</figDesc></figure>
