Another much smaller discone antenna2 covered tefrequency rneof 1.5 Gzup t H and we also deployed a radom antenna3 specified up to IofGHz, although we measured only up to 6 GHz. All antennas are vertically polarized, have an omnidirectional characteristic in horizontal plane and have small amount of directivity in the vertical plane. All equipment besides the antennas was enclosed in a weatherproof box made of wood, which was shielded in order not to cause unwanted emissions.

Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows these results for the lowest measured spectrum band from 20 to 1520MHz. Some bands such as the FM radio around 100 MHz and the GSM channels around 900 MHz can be clearly identified because in contrast to most of the other spectrum bands also the measured .minimum leve was above -80 dBm. Another example is the thin peak around 3 80-390 MHz, which is the uplink channel of in the Aachen area. The thermal noise floor and thus the rough sensitivity level of the measurement system is clearly below -ll0dBm. As the average PSD is well above -ll0dBm we can determine that in all bands actual man-made transmissions were received for considerably long periods. Additionally, the mea.surement period was about seven days and any signal caused only by thermal noise should average out and lead to a flat spectrum. Such flat subbands are not present so that The average PSD for both bands is about -100dBm or 3 -900 l slightly above.
