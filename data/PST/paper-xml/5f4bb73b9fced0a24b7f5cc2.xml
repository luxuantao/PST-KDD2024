<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>modify the reference/control signals or transfer the constrained variables into new ones to modulate the final control input indirectly. Recently, the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) has attracted more and more attention and acts as an effective tool in the control design for constrained nonlinear uncertain systems. The control law is derived directly from the Lyapunov stability analysis. Successful applications can be found in the prescribed tracking performance control of serial robot manipulators <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, handling the tracking error constraints effect on the marine surface vessel <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and the full state-constrained control for nonlinear systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>So far, many types of BLF have been proposed to handle the constraint effect, such as the log-type BLF <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the integraltype BLF <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and the tan-type BLF <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. However, at the beginning of the control, a BLF-based controller usually needs prescribed time-varying transient performance constraints to achieve valid and stable control, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Besides, to satisfy the constraints when the constrained variables limitlessly approach the predefined boundaries, the control input of a BLF-based controller tends to be infinite, which results in a paradox for the existence of the input saturation. Therefore, to handle the constraints, the BLF-based controller should meet the feasibility condition in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, i.e., the constrained variable should always stay within the predefined boundaries. Parameters should also be appropriately designed, as it may be impractical if the constraints region is too small. Much research work has been made in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> to remove the strict feasibility condition. In these works, the time derivative of the universal barrier function in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is regarded as an auxiliary system, which is subsequently incorporated into the control system. Then, the controller for the augmented system is designed under the dynamic surface control scheme. However, in authors' opinion, this method only partially relaxes the feasibility condition because of two points: 1) the initial system states still need to satisfy the constraints and 2) the control law will be discontinuous when the constrained variable equals to the constraints, and the case involving constraint violation has not been studied in the simulation. To further narrow the reality gap and to provide an alternative way to remove the feasibility condition radically, a new type of BLF should be designed and have the following properties: 1) be positive outside the constrained space and 2) the partial derivative with relative to the constrained variables be bounded at the whole space. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing BLF being qualified for these conditions, which motivates part of the research in this article.</p><p>For constrained control, the input saturation effect, representing the capacity limitation of a plant, is a nontrivial source of the degradation of system performance or even system instability if not being properly handled with <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the input saturation effect is formulated as a model predictive control problem, and then, the proposed algorithms are adopted for estimating the upper bound of the control horizon, while this method is only suitable for linear time-invariant system. Model predictive control is widely used in the chemical industry and is able to handle input saturation. The control barrier function is also one of the methods to verify and enforce the safety properties of a plant. It is applied to the safety-critical control and unified with the Lyapunov function through quadratic programming to track the reference signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. However, these methods are of high computational burden when the controlled plant is complex, nonlinear, and with uncertainties. To handle the output constraints and the input saturation simultaneously, an adaptive control framework would be a better choice. Wu and Xie <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> employed time-varying asymmetric BLFs, an auxiliary subsystem, and the Nussbaum gain technique to design an adaptive controller for uncertain nonlinear systems with time-varying full state constraints, input saturation, and unknown control direction. Yan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> introduced a nonlinear smooth function to tackle the saturation input nonlinearity, with HODOs compensating the unknown time-varying disturbances. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the adaptive fuzzy output-feedback control is developed for a class of output-constrained uncertain nonlinear systems with input saturation and unmeasured states using a log-type BLF and an auxiliary system incorporating into the virtual control variable. This framework is refined and systematically illustrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, where the input and output constraints are circumvented simultaneously. In the process of controller design, in order to obtain a smooth control law, the saturation function (τ ) is replaced with a hypertangent function tanh(τ ) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and the auxiliary system is driven by the discrepancy between τ and tanh(τ ). However, the nonlinearity of tanh(•), to some degree, may degrade the control performance since the states of the auxiliary system representing the influence of the input saturation will not converge to zero when the control input is not equal to zero.</p><p>This article considers both the output error constraints and the input saturation of robot manipulators and presents a trajectory tracking controller to fulfill these requirements simultaneously. Comparing with the existing results, the contributions of this article are summarized as follows.</p><p>1) A bounded BLF (BBLF) is proposed. Different from most of the existing BLF-based controllers, the proposed BBLF-based controller in this article is designed on the premise of taking the case when constraints violation occurs into consideration. 2) Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, a modified auxiliary system is introduced to handle the input saturation effect, where the system states will converge to zeros if no control input saturation occurs. 3) A simplified RBFNN structure is adopted to greatly reduce the complexity of the network. Furthermore, a simple criterion is proposed to quantify the contribution of the four items that constitute the proposed control law, so as to examine their respective effectiveness.</p><p>Notations are defined throughout this article: λ min/max (A) denotes the maximum/minimum eigenvalue of A; a b = [a 1 b 1 , a 2 b 2 , . . . , a n b n ] T denotes the elementwise product between a and b; and |x| and x denote the absolute and norm value of x, respectively. vec(x i ), i = 1, 2, . . . , n, denotes a column vector whose entries are x i in sequence; diag(x i ), i = 1, 2, . . . , n, denotes a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are x i with the rest entries being 0; and 0 denotes a compatible zero vector or zero square matrix.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Problem Formulation</head><p>Consider an n-link serial robot manipulator, its dynamics is governed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H (q) q + C(q, q) q + G(q) = (τ ) (1)</formula><p>where H (q), C(q, q), and G(q) represent the inertia matrix, the Coriolis/centrifugal matrix, and the gravitation torque, respectively. q is the joint position with q being its corresponding velocity. In the following, H (q), C(q, q), and G(q) are abbreviated for H, C, and G for saving space, and C and G are unknown. 1) Input Saturation: (τ ) embodies the input saturation effect with (τ ) = ϕ(τ, μ) + τ , where</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">i (τ i ) = ⎧ ⎨ ⎨ ⎨ ⎩ τ max i , τ i &gt; τ max i τ i , τ min i ≤ τ i ≤ τ max i τ min i , τ i &lt; τ min i ϕ i (τ i , μ i ) = ⎧ ⎨ ⎨ ⎨ ⎩ μ i τ max i + τ max i , τ i &gt; μ i τ max i τ i , μ i τ min i ≤ τ i ≤ μ i τ max i μ i τ min i + τ min i , τ i &lt; μ i τ min i (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>where τ i , μ i , i (•), and ϕ i (•, •) are the i th elements of τ , μ, (•), and ϕ(•, •), respectively, τ max i &gt; 0 and τ min i &lt; 0 are the upper and lower limits of the i th actuator, μ i ∈ (0, 1) is a user-defined parameter, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">τ max i = (1 -μ i )τ max i tanh τ i -μ i τ max i (1 -μ i )τ max i τ min i = (1 -μ i )τ min i tanh τ i -μ i τ min i (1 -μ i )τ min i .</formula><p>We notice that the piecewise function ϕ(τ, μ), μ ∈ (0, 1), is twice differentiable relative to τ , and τ is bounded, which helps to get a smoother control input around the limits by designing a control law τ and then substituting it into ϕ(τ, μ) rather than into (τ ). Note that, by using ϕ(τ, μ) instead of v × tanh(τ/ v) employed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> with v being the limit of the actuator, the discrepancy τ between ϕ(τ, μ) and (τ ) totally vanishes in [μ τ min , μ τ max ], and its maximum value can be tuned by μ.</p><p>2) Output Error Constraints: The output error constraints are defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">:= q ∈ R n -k ci &lt; q i -q di &lt; k ci , i = 1, 2, . . . , n<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where n is the degree of freedom of the robot manipulator, and k ci are user-defined constraints. For simplicity, only symmetric constant constraints are considered in this article, while it is easy to deduce the time-varying and asymmetric constraints controller analogous to the proposed control framework.</p><p>The control problem to be resolved is stated as follows: design a trajectory tracking controller with a control law ϕ(τ, μ) for an n-link robot manipulator in (1) under the output error constraints in (3) and the input saturation (τ ), such that the ultimately uniformly bounded (UUB) stability of the whole system is guaranteed and the tracking errors converge to a small bounded neighborhood around the origin.</p></div>

For the ease of control design, the following lemma is introduced.</p><p>Lemma 1 (See [22, Corollary 1.1 and Lemma 1.2]): Let the Lyapunov function candidate V (χ) be positive and continuously differentiable with a bounded initial value V (χ(0)) and ρ c χ 2 ≤ V (χ), where χ is a column vector consists of system states and weights of the neural networks, ρ c is a positive scalar. If the following inequality holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">V (χ) ≤ -γ V (χ) + ρ (4)</formula><p>where γ &gt; 0 and ρ &gt; 0, then V (χ) is bounded, and the solution of χ will converge exponentially to a compact set <ref type="bibr">Definition 2]</ref>): A BLF is a scalar function V BLF (x) defined with respect to the system ẋ = f (x) on an open region D containing the origin.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. BOUNDED LYAPUNOV FUNCTION</head><p>Let us begin with an example. Consider a second order integrator system given as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ẋ1 = x 2 ẋ2 = f 2 (x 1 , x 2 ) + u (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><p>where constraint is imposed on x 1 , requiring that |x 1 | &lt; k c , and the Lyapunov function candidate is chosen as V = V BLF (x 1 )+ 0.5x 2  2 , where V BLF (x 1 ) is a BLF relative to x 1 . To guarantee system stability, the control law is designed as where τ b := ∂ V BLF /∂ x 1 refers to the corresponding control term derived from a BLF. Remark 1: Considering input saturation, the output error constraints are regarded as soft constraints, which implies that constraint violation should be taken into account during the control design. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the curves of τ b derived from different types of BLFs in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">7</ref>) from <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_10">u = -f 2 (x 1 , x 2 ) -k 2 x 2 -τ b (6)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">V Log BLF = 1 2 log k 2 c k 2 c -x 2 1 , τ Log b = x 1 k 2 c -x 2 1 V Tan BLF = k 2 c π tan π x 2 1 2k 2 c , τ Tan b = x 1 cos 2 π x 2 1 2k 2 c V Tan 2 BLF = k c π tan 2 π x 1 2k c , τ Tan 2 b = sin π x 2 1 2k 2 c cos 3 π x 2 1 2k 2 c .

Although V Tan 2 BLF (x 1 ) &gt; 0 for |x 1 | &gt; k c , τ Tan 2 b</formula><p>behaves an opposite control direction, which may lead to system instability. Besides, all these τ b s suffer from the singularity problem at |x 1 | = k c if they are applied directly to handle the soft constraints. Therefore, BLFs in (7) cannot guarantee the system stability outside the constrained space. Furthermore, the infinite increase of the control torque around the constraints may also boost the saturation effect. Hence, we turn our attention to the magnitude and control direction of τ b along x 1 ∈ R and circumventing the singularity problem of τ b at |x 1 | = k c . Next, a new form of BLF will be designed whose curves of τ b will have similar shape as other BLFs.</p><p>To handle the constraints' effect under the consideration of input saturation, we propose the BBLF whose definition is given as follows.</p><p>Definition 2: A BBLF is a scalar function V BBLF (x), x ∈ R defined with respect to the system ẋ = f (x) along the real axis. BBLF is continuous, positive definite, and has first-order partial derivative. Let D be a close region and ∂ D be the boundary of D. BBLF has the property that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">1) ∂ V BBLF (x)/∂ x → τ max b , as x → ∂ D and 2) ∂ D = arg max x |τ b (x)|.</formula><p>The following shows the specific mathematical form of BBLF:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">V (z 1 ) = 1 2 n i=0 V BBLF (z 1i ) + 1 2 z T 1 K 1 z 1 V BBLF (z 1i ) = k des i k 2 ζ i ζ 2 i 1 -k 2 ζ i ζ 2 i , ζ i = tanh κ i z 1i k ci (8)</formula><p>where K 1 is a positive diagonal matrix, z 1i is an element of the constrained variable z 1 ∈ R n , k ci is the user-defined constraint, k ζ i ∈ (0, 1) is a user-defined scaling factor for ζ i such that V BBLF is bounded for ∀z 1i ∈ R, and k des i is the control gain determined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. (1/2)z T 1 K 1 z 1 is an augmented component for the BBLF such that the magnitude of the feedback term will not vanished when k ci → ∞. Note that if k ζ i = 1 and κ i is chosen wisely, then the proposed BBLF will behave as the traditional BLFs, i.e., as z 1i → k ci and V → ∞.

For the convenience of expression, we define the region of z 1 , where |τ b (z 1 )| &gt; 0.1τ des as the activate zone. We can see that τ b mainly activates around the constraints at z 1 = ±k c . Besides, as k ζ → 1, the active zone becomes narrower such that when z 1 converge to zero, and τ b vanishes more quickly. The proposed BBLF can be applied on iterative learning control to guarantee the control accuracy of the final iteration, such as the motion control of a soft robot in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, tracking control for strict-feedback systems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and the policy iteration for human-robot coordination in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, while the traditional BLFs are hard to realize that, at the first iteration of the iterative learning control, the control performance usually does not achieve the prescribed control performance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONTROLLER DESIGN</head><p>Unlike backstepping control in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> where the controller is designed step by step, we introduce some auxiliary variables and give out the Lyapunov function candidate directly. Define the auxiliary variables q r and r as follows: q r = qd + e r = ė + e where q d denotes the desired joint trajectory; e := q d -q is the tracking error; and represents a positive-definite diagonal matrix. Subsequently, we have q = q rr and q = qr -ṙ . In the field of adaptive control, there are many approximation tools to tackle unknown dynamics; in this article, the RBFNN that is time-efficient is employed, substituting which into (1) yields the following equality:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">H ṙ = W T S + ε + H qr -Cz 2 -(τ ) (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">)</formula><p>where W T S + ε = C(q r -ã) + G, W T S stands for the approximation of the lumped uncertainty, ε ∈ L ∞ is the approximation error, and S is short for S(q r , q, q, ã); z 2 := r -ã, where ã is another auxiliary variable regarding the input saturation, and it will be specified later.</p><p>Let us take a further look at the approximation component W T S; expanding the lumped uncertainty yields C(q, q)q r + G(q) -C(q, q) ã = C(q d -e, qd -ė)( qd +e) + G(q d -e)</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">≈ Ŵ T 1 S 1 -C(q, q) ã ≈ Ŵ T 2 S 2 .

Hence, S = [S T 1 , S T 2 ] T , and</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">Ŵ T = [ Ŵ T 1 , Ŵ T 2 ]. Remark 3:</formula><p>To reduce the number of the hidden neurons, a simplified structure of the RBFNN for Ŵ T 1 S 1 is adopted, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, where Ŵ T 2 S 2 (q, q, ã) shares a similar structure, S 1 = [ q d (q d ) T , qd ( qd ) T , e (e) T , ė( ė) T ] T , S 2 = [ q (q) T , q ( q) T , ã ( ã) T ] T , and the Gaussian function is</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">φ(x) = exp -(x -c) T 2 -1 (x -c) (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_27">)</formula><p>where c is the center, x is the input signal, and is the standard deviation matrix. Although the simplified network may results in larger ε, it can greatly reduce the complexity of the network. Simulation results show that the degradation of the control performance is acceptable. Besides, we select the input signals of the first RBFNN as q d , qd , e, ė rather than the commonly used q, q, q r out of the consideration that at the transient phase, magnitudes of q and q are unpredictable, the centers will need some gut feeling to be set, and these parameters may varies with different desired trajectories.

The recommended choice of k ζ ranges from 0.99 to 1 × 10 -4 , τ des being half of the limits of the actuator. Trial and error is still needed to find a suitable set of control parameters.  The control performance of the proposed control scheme is compared with the controller in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> (refers to "Comparison controller") and the PD+ controller given as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">v pd = K p e + K d ė + G (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_42">)</formula><p>where K p = diag(320, 150), K d = diag(50, 15), τ max /τ min = ±[30, 15] T , and the gravitation torque is fully compensated by G.</p><p>The robot manipulator is commanded to track two reference trajectories with different frequencies using the same set of control parameters.

The effectiveness of the proposed controller will be examined by three cases. 1) Case One: The tracking performance will be examined under w = 1.0 and 4.0 rad/s separately, and the convergence of Ŵ1 and Ŵ2 will be checked. Note that the parameters of the proposed controller will remain unchanged under different choices of w, only except the choices of centers of qd and q in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>. 2) Case Two: We will take a further research at the control at w = 4.0 rad/s, where the contributions of the four components A, B, C, and D in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> are discussed and quantified by the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">P A i = |A i |/T i , P B i = |B i |/T i P C i = |C i |/T i , P D i = |D i |/T i T i = |A i | + |B i | + |C i | + |D i |.<label>(24)</label></formula><p>This evaluation index only shows the tendency of the control torque, as D does not exactly reflect the control torque relating to the input saturation. 3) Case Three: The tracking performance when constraint violation happens will be analyzed, by means of deliberately decreasing the absolute value of τ max /τ min , i.e., the saturation of the actuator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Simulation Results</head><p>1) Case One: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows the tracking performance of the controllers. It is obvious that the proposed controller guarantees the tracking errors within the constraints and has much smaller tracking errors than the PD+ controller and the comparison controller, which demonstrates its superiority. Besides, the bounded errors are also in line with the results of stability analysis in the Appendix. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6(c)</ref> shows the convergence of the weights, which, to some extent, proves the approximation capability of the simplified RBFNN structure.</p><p>2) Case Two: The effectiveness of handling the constraints and input saturation effect is demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> by comparing the tracking errors when masking C&amp;D (i.e., let C + D = 0) and D (i.e., let D = 0) of τ in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, respectively. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, we can notice that when C&amp;D is masked, the output error constraint violation of a joint 2 happens. Furthermore, when we compare the tracking errors of case τ = A + B + C and case τ = A + B + C + D, we can clearly find that the addition of D improves the controller's tracking performance. These results motivate us to analyze the contribution of each component at the transient phase of the control, which is quantified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> and showed in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. From this figure, we can see that at the beginning of the control (t = 0∼0.5 s), B dominates the control input, while, as the tracking errors decrease, P B becomes smaller in contrast to an increase of P A . During this transient period, P D climbs to its maximum to suppress the undesired saturation effect. Similarly, the contribution of C mainly focuses on the time interval when the tracking error approximates the predefined constraints. As the system becomes stable, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. Case Two: time series of the proportion for the contribution of each components in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> when tracking with the reference trajectory of w = 4.0 rad/s under τ = A + B + C + D. Left: stack graphs of the proportion for the contribution of A, B, C, and D, where the upper subfigure shows the case of joint 1 and the lower one shows the case of joint 2. Right: charts of specific proportion for each component in its left subfigure at t = 0∼2 s. the output of the neural networks A takes the dominant place of the control input. Furthermore, as the saturation effect vanishes, P D finally equals to zeros. These observations are in line with the theoretical control design, since each component has functioned well in tackling its corresponding effect.</p><p>3) Case Three: To further verify the distinct property of the proposed BBLF function, i.e., constraint violation does not affect the system's stability and the smoothness of the control input, we deliberately change the saturation of the actuators into τ max /τ min = <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> T N•m such that constraints violation is bound to happen periodically, which can be seen in the tracking errors of the PD+ controller (see the dotted blue line in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>). From the tracking errors in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, we can see that the comparison controller fails to stabilize the system when the constraint violation happens. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>, although constraint violation incurs the saturation problem and the periodic activation of C, with the proposed controller, the system is still stable and has smaller tracking errors than those of the PD+ controller. These observations support the theoretical stability analysis of the proposed control scheme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES</head><p>To further verify the validity of the proposed control scheme, some experiments are carried out on the Baxter robotic platform. Its left arm is of 7-DOF named "left s 0 ," "left s 1 ," "left e 0 ," "left e 1 ," "left w 0 ," "left w 1 ," and "left w 2 " from the base to the end-effector. The left arm of the Baxter is commanded to track predefined trajectories with varying payloads, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>. The scenarios that the left robot manipulator performing trajectory tracking task grasping nothing, half bottle of water, and a full bottle of water are referred as Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3, respectively. The initial joint positions of the left arm in these cases are -π/9, -π/4, 0, π/2+0.1, 0, π/4-0.1, and 0 rad in sequence. For the sake of simplicity and without generality, "left e 1 " (joint 1) and "left w 1 " (joint 2) are selected to carry out the tasks, whose reference trajectories are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, while   </p><formula xml:id="formula_46">(0) = [-0.1, 0.1] T rad q d = [π/2 + 0.2 cos(4t) -0.2, π/4 + 0.2 sin(4t)] T .

It is in line with the plots of τ b in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>; as the constrained variable is away from the constraints, the magnitude of τ b will become smaller. Plots of ã and τ b show their boundedness during the control. More importantly, when the predefined constraints are not physically realizable, the proposed controller can remain stable and has smaller tracking errors compared with the PD+ controller.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>A trajectory tracking controller for robot manipulators is developed considering both the output error constraints and the control input saturation effects. Using BBLF to handle the constraints' effect, we guarantee that the system could remain stable when the output errors go beyond the constrained boundaries. A modified auxiliary system and a simplified RBFNN structure are also incorporated to improve control performance. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the validation and the superiority the proposed method.
