<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Fuzzy ontologies are envisioned to be useful in the Web. On the one hand, ontologies serve as basic semantic infrastructure, providing shared understanding of certain domain across different applications, so as to facilitate machine understanding of Web resources. On the other hand, being able to handle fuzzy and imprecise information is crucial to the Web. Web data are likely to be uncertain or conflicting and could raise trust issues. It has been argued that uncertainty representation and reasoning could help to harmonise and integrate Web data from different sources. To this end, W3C has recently set up an incubator group on Uncertainty Reasoning for the Web <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> .</p><p>Although recently there have been quite a lot of work on Description Logics (DLs) based fuzzy ontology languages, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25]</ref>, there exist no fuzzy ontology reasoners that could be efficient and/or scalable enough to handle the scale of data that the Web provides. Interestingly, there currently exist two fuzzy ontology reasoners, namely the tableaux based fuzzy reasoner FiRE<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref>, which supports a nominal and datatype-free subset of fuzzy-OWL DL, i.e. fuzzy-SHIN , and the mixed integer programming fuzzy reasoner fuzzyDL<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> , which supports fuzzy-OWL Lite, namely fuzzy-SHIf (D) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>. Like their crisp counterparts, fuzzy-SHIN and fuzzy-SHIf (D) come with (at least) EX-PTIME computational complexity, thus the scalability of the above systems is doubtful. Following current research developments in crisp DLs, there is an effort on lightweight fuzzy ontology languages. In particular, Straccia <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> extended the DL-Lite ontology language <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> to fuzzy DL-Lite. DL-Lite, which is expressive enough to represent most features of UML class diagrams, enables highly efficient query answering procedures by making use of database technologies. There are major limitations on Straccia's query language for fuzzy DL-Lite: the proposed query language has the same syntax as the query language of the crisp DL-Lite, and thus does not allow one to specify either thresholds for query atoms (such as "tell me e-shops that are popular [with degrees at least 0.8] and sell good books [with degrees at least 0.9]"), or weights and preferences on query atoms (such as "get me all cars that are fast and fancy but consider speed more important [with weight 0.7] than design [with weight 0.3]"), so as to exploit fuzzy assertions in fuzzy ontologies. To the best of our knowledge, there exist no report on scalable query engines for fuzzy DL-Lite, let alone supporting more expressive fuzzy query languages.</p><p>This paper makes the following major contributions:</p><p>1. It proposes a general framework, which consists of threshold queries and general fuzzy queries (Section 3.1), for querying over fuzzy ontologies, covering all the existing query languages for fuzzy ontologies as well as some new ones that can be customised by users. Comparing with Straccia's query language, the threshold query language is flexible as it allows one to specify a threshold for each query atom (as shown in the above ex-ample). In fact, entailment of threshold queries generalises the entailment problem of fuzzy assertions. On the other hand, the general fuzzy query language is a general form of the fuzzy threshold query language, which in turn is a general form of Straccia's query language. General fuzzy queries are motivated by the field of fuzzy information retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> where weighted Boolean queries <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> have been proposed for retrieving fuzzy information from fuzzy relational databases.</p><p>Our general fuzzy query language generalises most former approaches of weighted Boolean queries <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4]</ref> and several new approaches, like the p-norm approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, the geometric mean approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>, the so called fuzzy weighted t-norm queries from Chortaras et. al. <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, which in turn generalise weighted min queries <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, and aggregation queries from Vojtas <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. Thus, the main strength of the general fuzzy query language is the openness of the use of semantics of conjunction and that of the degree-associated atoms. Consequently, the framework can accommodate different intuitive meaning on the associated degrees, like preferences, degrees of importance, fuzzy thresholds and more.</p></div>

Our extension uses specially formatted SPARQL comments, thus the fuzzy queries are still valid SPARQL queries, and it does not affect current SPARQL tools and implementations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.</head><p>It not only proposes the syntax of query languages, but also provides semantics (Section 3.1) and algorithms for answering such queries over arbitrary fuzzy DL-Lite ontologies together with sound and complete proofs (w.r.t. the semantics); and the algorithms cover all the mentioned languages in the framework (Section 3.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.</head><p>To the best of our knowledge, it presents the first ever scalable query engine for fuzzy ontologies, based on the ONTOSEARCH2 system 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, which consists of, among others, a query engine for DL-Lite and one for fuzzy DL-Lite. The performance of the fuzzy DL-Lite query engine is evaluated against a benchmark (a fuzzy variant of the Lehigh University Benchmark (LUBM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>, called f-LUBM) that we propose, which is the first of its kind and against which future implementations can also be evaluated. The query engine is able to handle millions of individuals, according to the preliminary but encouraging evaluation (Section 4).</p><p>5. It presents a use cases about searching ontology based on keyword-plus-entailment searches, so as to show how to apply our efficient querying support for fuzzy ontologies.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">DL-based Ontologies and Query Answering</head><p>Due to the limitation of space, we do not provide a formal introduction of Description Logics (DLs), but rather point the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>. It should be noted that, even for the smallest propositionally closed DL ALC (which only provides the class constructors ¬C, C ⊓ D, C ⊔ D, ∃R.C and ∀R.C), the complexity of logical entailment is Exptime. Recently, Calvanese et. al. proposed DL-Lite, which has a low reasoning overhead (worst case polynomial time) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. A DL-Lite ontology (O) is a set of axioms of the following forms: Typical reasoning ontology services include ontology consistency checking (i.e., whether there exists an interpretation of an ontology), subsumption checking (i.e., whether the interpretation of a class C1 is a subset of the interpretation of a class C2 in all interpretations of the ontology), instance checking (i.e. whether an assertion is logically implied by an ontology) and query answering. In this paper, we will focus on query answering. A conjunctive query (CQ) q is of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">q(X) ← ∃Y .conj(X, Y )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>or simply q(X) ← conj(X, Y ), where q(X) </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">is</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">I of O satisfies q [X →S] ,</formula><p>we say O entails q [X →S] ; in this case, S is called a solution of q. A disjunctive query (DQ) is a set of conjunctive queries sharing the same head. Theoretically, allowing only named classes and properties as atoms is not a restriction, as we can always define such named classes and properties in ontologies. Practically, this should not be an issue as querying against named relations is a usual practice when people query over relational databases.</p><p>After some careful query rewriting by DL-Lite reasoners <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>, query answering over DL-Lite ontologies can be carried out by an SQL engine, so as to take advantage of exist-ing query optimisation strategies and algorithms provided by modern database management systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">f-DL-LITE</head><p>Straccia <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> proposed fuzzy DL-Lite (or f-DL-Lite for short), which extends DL-Lite core with fuzzy assertions of the forms B(a) ≥ n, R(a, b) ≥ n, where B is basic class, R is a property, a and b are individuals and n is a real number in the range [0, 1]. The semantics of f-DL-Lite ontologies is defined in terms of fuzzy interpretations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. A fuzzy interpretation is a pair I = (∆ I , • I ) where the domain ∆ I is a non-empty set of objects and • I is a fuzzy interpretation function, which maps:</p><p>• an individual a to an element of a I ∈ ∆ I ,</p><p>• a named class A to a membership function A I : ∆ I → [0, 1], and</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">• a named property R to a membership function R I : ∆ I × ∆ I → [0, 1].</formula><p>Using the fuzzy set theoretic operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, fuzzy interpretations can be extended to interpret f-DL-Lite class and property descriptions. Following Straccia <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, we use the Lukasiewicz negation, c(a) = 1a and the Gödel t-norm for interpreting conjunctions, t(a, b) = min(a, b). The semantics of f-DL-Lite class and property descriptions, and f-DL-Lite axioms are depicted in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Abstract and RDF/XML Syntax</head><p>Since DL-Lite (resp. f-DL-Lite) is a sub-language of OWL (resp. f-OWL DL), we provide an abstract and RDF/XML syntax for DL-Lite and f-DL-Lite ontologies in this subsection, following the paradigm of OWL DL <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. OWL DL ontologies in RDF/XML syntax can be generated from those written in the abstract syntax, using the official mapping between the two kind of syntax provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. Our proposed abstract syntax for DL-Lite core is based on that of the DL-Lite specified in the OWL1.1 member submission (an extension of OWL DL) in the tractable fragments document <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. It is slightly different from that in the OWL 1.1 document, mainly due to the fact that it uses the OWL DL syntax (which is slightly different from that of OWL 1.1) and RDF/XML serialisation.</p><p>Besides disallowing several expressive OWL DL constructors, DL-Lite restricts the use of several of the allowed constructors and especially w.r.t. which side of class axioms they can appear. Thus, the definition of an abstract syntax is slightly trickier than that of OWL. In OWL DL, for example, disjointness, equivalence and subclass axioms are defined by the following abstract syntax:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">axiom ::= 'DisjointClasses(' description description { description } ')' | 'EquivalentClasses(' description { description } ')' | 'SubClassOf(' description description ')'</formula><p>where "description" can be any OWL DL class description. In DL-Lite, only basic classes are allowed on the left-hand side of axioms, while general classes are allowed only on the right-hand side. Thus, the above abstract syntax should be adjusted to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">axiom ::= 'DisjointClasses(' basicClass basicClass { basicClass } ')' | 'EquivalentClasses(' basicClass { basicClass } ')' | 'SubClassOf(' basicClass generalClass ')'</formula><p>where "basicClass" and "generalClass" represent the basic and general classes of DL-Lite, respectively. The abstract syntax for these two elements should also follow the restrictions of DL-Lite; e.g., a "generalClass" can be an intersection of classes while a basic class is not. By using the RDF/XML serialisation mapping described for OWL DL, one is able to obtain DL-Lite and f-DL-Lite ontologies in RDF/XML syntax. For example, the following class axiom in RDF/XML syntax is a valid DL-Lite axiom, &lt;owl:Class rdf:ID="C"&gt; &lt;rdfs:subClassOf&gt; &lt;owl:Class&gt; &lt;owl:intersectionOf rdf:parseType="Collection"&gt; &lt;owl:Class&gt; &lt;owl:complementOf&gt; &lt;owl:Restriction&gt; &lt;owl:onProperty rdf:resource="#R"/&gt; &lt;owl:someValuesFrom rdf:resource="&amp;owl;Thing"/&gt; &lt;/owl:Restriction&gt; &lt;/owl:complementOf&gt; &lt;/owl:Class&gt; &lt;owl:Class&gt; &lt;owl:complementOf rdf:resource="#A"/&gt; &lt;/owl:Class&gt; &lt;/owl:intersectionOf&gt; &lt;/owl:Class&gt; &lt;/rdfs:subClassOf&gt; &lt;/owl:Class&gt; which corresponds to the axiom C ⊑ ¬∃R ⊓ ¬A.</p><p>Finally, fuzziness in the individual axioms of f-DL-Lite is defined by a restriction of the abstract syntax of facts of f-OWL DL presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, since we are only allowing the inequality "≥". The abstract syntax is the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">individual ::= 'Individual(' [individualID] {annotation} {'type'( type ')' [ineqType] [degree]} {value [ineqType]</formula><p>[degree] } ')' ineqType ::= '&gt;=' degree ::= real-number-between-0-and-1-inclusive</p><p>Similarly, we can follow the RDF/XML serialization proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> to have fuzzy individual axioms in a f-DL-Lite file. For example, stating that o is Heavy to degree at-least 0.7 could be specified by the following RDF/XML syntax.</p><p>&lt;Heavy rdf:about="o" owlx:ineqType="≥" owlx:degree="0.7"/&gt;</p><p>The full specification of the f-DL-Lite (and consequently DL-Lite) abstract syntax can be found in the Appendix. The ONTOSEARCH2 system allows users to submit their crisp and fuzzy ontologies to its repository. Furthermore, it provides an RDF/XML syntax checker for DL-Lite.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">QUERYING F-DL-LITE ONTOLOGIES</head><p>In this section, we present a general framework for representing expressive fuzzy queries over f-DL-Lite ontologies. More precisely, we will introduce two query languages for f-DL-Lite ontologies. The first language extends conjunctive queries with thresholds for atoms in queries. Entailment of threshold queries generalises the entailment problem of fuzzy assertions. The second language is a general fuzzy query language, motivated by the field of fuzzy information retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>, where weighted Boolean queries have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref>. As it was showed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> most of these approached could be represented under a general framework using general fuzzy operators, like t-norms and fuzzy implications. Our general fuzzy query language extends these results by allowing more fuzzy operators and thus generalising many of the recent approaches like the query language proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> for fuzzy DL-Lite, weighted t-norm queries <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, which in turn generalise weighted min queries <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, p-norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, fuzzy aggregations <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> and the geometric mean <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>. In order to enable such types of queries in the Semantic Web, we also propose the extension of the SPARQL <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> query language, so as to represent the queries in our general framework. In what follows, we first introduce these new query languages, providing their syntax and semantics. We then present the extension of SPARQL, and finally we provide algorithms of query answering for queries in the proposed query languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Two New Query Languages</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Threshold Queries</head><p>As noted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> in DL-Lite the instance checking problem is a special case of conjunctive queries. Since f-DL-Lite extends DL-Lite with fuzzy assertions, it would be natural to define a query language so that the entailment of such queries could generalise entailment checking of fuzzy assertions. Accordingly, we define conjunctive threshold queries (CTQ) which extend atoms A(v), R(v1, v2) in conjunctive queries of the form (1) into the following forms A(v) ≥ t1, R(v1, v2) ≥ t2, where t1, t2 ∈ (0, 1] are thresholds. It turns out that threshold queries are very important types of queries since in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> the authors used them in order to devise a reasoning algorithm for the fuzzy language fuzzy-CARIN.</p><p>Example 1. We can query models who are tall with a degree no less than 0.7 and light with a degree no less than 0.8 with the following conjunctive threshold query:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">q(v) ← Model(v) ≥ 1, Tall(v) ≥ 0.7, Light(v) ≥ 0.8.</formula><p>It is obvious that threshold queries are more flexible than queries of the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(1)</ref> in that users can specify different thresholds for different atoms in their queries.</p><p>Formally, given an f-DL-Lite ontology O, a conjunctive threshold query qT and an evaluation [X → S], we say O entails qT (denoted as O |= qT ) if every interpretation I of O satisfies the following condition: for each atom A(v) ≥ t1 (R(v1, v2) ≥ t2) of qT , we have A I (v)X →S ≥ t1 (resp. R I (v1, v2)X →S ≥ t2). In this case, S is called a solution of qT . A disjunctive threshold query (DTQ) is a set of conjunctive threshold queries sharing the same head.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">General Fuzzy Queries</head><p>Since f-DL-Lite associates assertions with degrees of truth, another useful feature for its query language is to associate degrees of truth with answers in answer sets of queries over f-DL-Lite ontologies. In threshold queries, an evaluation [X → S] either satisfies the query entailment or not; hence, answers of such queries are crisp. In this subsection, we introduce general fuzzy queries which allow fuzzy answers. Syntactically, like the query language proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> and threshold queries, general fuzzy conjunctive queries (GFCQ) extend the atoms A(v), R(v1, v2) of conjunctive queries of the form (1) into ones with the following form A(v) : k1, R(v1, v2) : k2, where k1, k2 ∈ (0, 1] are degrees. . The strength of the general fuzzy query language is the openness of the use of fuzzy operations. Indeed, as many theoretical and practical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4]</ref> have pointed out, the choice of fuzzy operations is usually context dependent. Following the style of the semantics of fuzzy-SWRL <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> the existential quantifier is interpreted as sup, while we leave the semantics of the conjunction (G) and that of the degreeassociated atoms (a) open. To simplify the presentation of the semantics, we use a unified representation atomi(v) for atoms in general fuzzy conjunctive queries. Given an f-DL-Lite ontology O, an interpretation I of O, a general fuzzy conjunctive query qF and an evaluation [X → S], the degree of truth of qF under I is</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">d = sup S ′ ∈∆ I ×•••×∆ I {G n i=1 a(ki, atom I i (v) [X →S,Y →S ′ ] )}</formula><p>where ki ∈ (0, 1] are degrees ( 1 ≤ i ≤ n), atomi are atoms in the query, G is the semantic function for conjunctions and a is the semantic function for degree-associated atoms. S : d is called a candidate solution of qF . When d &gt; 0, S : d is called a solution of qF . Furthermore, the semantic functions should satisfy the following condition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">If atom I i (v) [X →S,Y →S ′ ] ) = 0 for all possible S ′ , d = 0.</formula><p>(2) A general fuzzy disjunctive query (GFDQ) is a set of general fuzzy conjunctive queries sharing the same head. The disjunction is interpreted as the s-norm (u) of disjuncts.</p><p>In what follows, we give some examples of the semantic functions for conjunctions and degree-associated atoms.</p><p>1. Fuzzy threshold queries: If we use t-norms (t) as the semantic function for conjunctions and R-implications (ωt) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> as the semantic function for degree-associated atoms, we get fuzzy threshold queries, in which the degree of truth of qF under I is</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">d = sup S ′ ∈∆ I ×•••×∆ I {t n i=1 ωt(ki, atom I i (v) [X →S,Y →S ′ ] )}.</formula><p>Given some S ′ , if for all atoms we have atom I i (v) [X →S , Y →S ′ ] ≥ ki, since ωt(x, y) = 1 when y ≥ x <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, we have d = 1; this corresponds to threshold queries introduced earlier. On the other hand, different from threshold queries, if 0 &lt; atom I i (v) [X →S,Y →S ′ ] &lt; ki, then d = 0 because of use of the R-implication which filters (penalises) the degree atom I i (v) [X →S,Y →S ′ ] against the fuzzy threshold ki.</p><p>As it was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> many of the approaches for weighted Boolean queries that have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20]</ref> are actually special cases of fuzzy threshold queries.</p><p>2.

More precisely, Salton, Fox and Wu <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> proposed the model of p-norms where the semantic function is given by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">d = sup S ′ ∈∆ I ×•••×∆ I n i=1 (atom I i (v) [X →S,Y →S ′ ] ) w n 1/w</formula><p>where w1 = w2 = . . . = wn = w and w ∈ (0, +∞].

Fuzzy weighted t-norm queries: If we use generalised weighted t-norms <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> as the semantic function for conjunction, we get fuzzy weighted queries, in which the degree of truth of qF under I is</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">d = sup S ′ ∈∆ I ×•••×∆ I { n min i=1 u(k-ki, t(k, atom I i (v) [X →S,Y →S ′ ] ))},</formula><p>where k = max n i=1 ki. The main idea of this type of queries is that they provide an aggregation type of operation, on the other hand an entry with a low value for a low-weighted criterion should not be critically penalized. Moreover, lowering the weight of a criterion in the query should not lead to a decrease of the relevance score, which should mainly be determined by the high-weighted criteria (see <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> for more details).</p><p>Yager <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, proposes the use of and S-implication <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> (in contrast to R-implications of fuzzy threshold queries), i.e. the function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">d = sup S ′ ∈∆ I ×•••×∆ I { n min i=1 u(1-ki, atom I i (v) [X →S,Y →S ′ ] )},</formula><p>This is a special case of fuzzy weighted t-norms, where k = 1, since t(1, a) = a. A similar approach was proposed by Sanchez <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</p><p>It is easy to show that all the above four specific fuzzy query languages satisfy the condition (2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Supporting Querying with SPARQL</head><p>After presenting the abstract syntax and semantics of our proposed languages, in this section, we show how to extend the syntax of SPARQL <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, a well known Semantic Web query language, for the proposed languages. We call our extension f-SPARQL. SPARQL is a query language (candidate recommendation from the W3C Data Access Working Group) for getting information from RDF graphs. SPARQL allows for a query to constitute of triple patterns, conjunctions, disjunctions and optional patterns. A SPARQL query is a quadruple Q = (V, P, DS, SM ), where V is a result form, P is a graph pattern, DS a data set and SM a set of solution modifiers. Among others, SPARQL allows for select queries, formed in a SELECT-FROM-WHERE manner. The result form represents the set of variables appearing in the SELECT, the dataset forms the FROM part, constituted by a set of IRIs of RDF documents, while the graph pattern forms the WHERE part which is constituted by a set of RDF triples. In order to maintain backward compatibility with existing SPARQL tools, we propose to use specially formatted SPARQL comments to specify extra information needed in our proposed languages (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Firstly, one should declare the query type before a select query. For example, #TQ# declares a threshold query, while #GFCQ:SEM=FUZZY THRESHOLD# declares a general fuzzy query, with the fuzzy threshold semantic functions. Secondly, following each triple in the WHERE clause, one can use #TH# (resp. #DG#) to specify a threshold in a threshold query (resp. a degree in  #DG# 0.7 ?x rdf:type Light .</p><p>#DG# 0.8 } Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> presents the f-SPARQL syntax. f-SPARQL extends two of SPARQL's elements, namely the "Query" and the "TriplesBlock" element. As illustrated above, each select query is extended with the element QueryType. In particular, for general fuzzy queries, the declaration '#GFCQ:SEM=' is followed by the element FuzzySemantics, which is used to specify the semantic functions, such as the ones we presented in the previous section. More precisely, we use the keywords 'FUZZYTHRESHOLD', 'FUZZYTHRESHOLD-1', 'AGGREGATION' and 'FUZZYWEIGHTEDNORMS' to indicate the four fuzzy general queries we introduced in Section 3.1.2. When one uses 'FUZZYTHRESHOLD-1', the fuzzy threshold set as 1, and the values specified by the #TH# comments are ignored. Finally, the "TriplesBlock" element is extended with the elements TripleWeight and Degree, which are used to associated a threshold or weight with each triple of the SPARQL query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Query Answering</head><p>It should be noted that the query languages in the previous sections can be used with any fuzzy ontology languages. In order to provide efficient query answering services using our proposed query languages, we choose f-DL-Lite as our fuzzy ontology language. This sub-section provides algorithm to answer threshold queries and general fuzzy queries over f-DL-Lite ontologies.</p><p>Algorithms for answering queries in f-DL-Lite mainly consist of four steps (like the algorithm for crisp DL-Lite <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>): (i) normalisation of the set T of the class axioms of O by the procedure Normalise(T ), which returns the normalised set T ′ of class axioms; (ii) normalisation and storage of the set A of individual axioms in O by the procedure Store(A) that normalise A and returns the relational database DB(A) of A, as well as checking the consistency of O by the procedure Consistency(O, T ′ ); (iii) reformulation of the input query q against the normalised set T of the class axioms by the procedure PerfectRef(q, T ′ ), which returns a set Q of (conjunctive) queries; (iv) transformation of the set Q of (conjunctive) queries into SQL queries by the procedure SQL(Q), as well as the evaluation of SQL(Q) by the procedure Eval(SQL(Q), DB(A)).</p><p>As steps (i) and (ii) are very similar to those for the crisp case, here we focus on steps (iii) and (iv) on answering conjunctive threshold queries and general fuzzy queries.</p></div>

Firstly, if O is inconsistent, query answering is meaningless, since every tuple is a solution of every query w.r.t. O.</p><p>Secondly, the procedure PerfectRef T (qT ,T ′ ) of reformulating an input conjunctive threshold query qT (into a set of conjunctive queries) is essentially the same as the PerfectRef (q,T ′ ) for DL-Lite <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. Here we do not repeat PerfectRef(q,T ′ ) but explain its main ideas instead. PerfectRef T (qT ,T ′ ) rewrites atoms in qT based on positive inclusions (PIs) in T ′ . For example, given a PI B ⊑ B1, if B1(v) ≥ k is an atom of qT and B is a named class A (resp. of the form ∃R, or of the form ∃R -), B1(v) ≥ k can be rewritten as A(v) ≥ k (resp. R(v, ) ≥ k, or R( , v) ≥ k, where represent nondistinguished non-shared variables 5 ). The generated query can be further written, based on the PIs in T ′ . It can be shown that such rewriting process always terminates <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>, and it produces a set of generated conjunctive queries from the input query qT Q.</p><p>Thirdly, the procedure SQL T (Q) transforms a set of conjunctive threshold queries into SQL queries in an obvious way, taking into accounts the thresholds. Namely, it use Select-Clause, From-Clause, WC-Binding and WC-Threshold to construct the select-clauses, from-clauses and where-clauses of SQL queries, respectively. Due to limitation of space, we do not provide full details of these procedures but illustrate them with the following example. Given the query q(v) ← Model(v) ≥ 1, Tall(v) ≥ 0.7, Light(v) ≥ 0.8, Select-Clause(q) returns the select-clause 'SELECT tab Model [0]', From-Clause(q) returns the from-clause 'FROM tab Model , tab Tall , tab Light ', WC-Binding(q) returns the binding part of the where-clause 'WH-ERE tab Model [0] = tab Tall [0], tab Model [0] = tab Light [0]' and WC-Threshold(q) returns the threshold-related part of the whereclause 'tab</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">Model [1] ≥ 1, tab Tall [1] ≥ 0.7, tab Light [1] ≥ 0.8'.</formula><p>Construct-SQL puts all these together and returns the corresponding SQL query 'SELECT tab</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">Model [0] FROM tab Model , tab Tall , tab Light WHERE tab Model [0] = tab Tall [0], tab Model [0] = tab Light [0], tab Model [1] ≥ 1, tab Tall [1] ≥ 0.7, tab Light [1] ≥ 0.8'.</formula><p>Theorem 1.

In other words, the DL-Lite procedures Eval, SQL, PerfectRef can be reused here (line 9 of Algorithm A-3). The task (ii) is done by the procedure Cal, which is a general algorithm to calculate the degree of each tuple S in the answer set SS returned by the DL-Lite engine, based on the chosen semantic functions a and G. Accordingly, we have the following theorem. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Implementation</head><p>Our implementation is based on the ONTOSEARCH2 system 6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31]</ref>, which is an infrastructure for supporting ontology searching and query answering. The f-DL-Lite query engine is implemented as an extension of the crisp DL-Lite query engine in ONTOSEARCH2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, so as to support threshold queries and general fuzzy queries. The core part of the f-DL-Lite query engine includes implementations of Algorithms A-1 to A-4, which are presented in Section 3.3. The system was written in Java 5 and uses PostgreSQL 8.1 RDBMS for the repository storage. PostgreSQL was setup with default installation, no additional configuration was performed.</p><p>Users of the f-DL-Lite query engine can submit f-DL-Lite ontologies via the Web interface of ONTOSEARCH2 6 , and then submit f-SPARQL queries against their target ontologies. The fuzzy query engine operates in two modes: TQ mode (for threshold queries) and GFCQ mode (for general fuzzy queries). When users submit an f-SPARQL query, the fuzzy query engine parses it, so as to determine the query type (whether the query is a threshold query or a general fuzzy query), as well as the thresholds (for threshold queries) or degrees (for general fuzzy queries), depending on the query types. Accordingly, the fuzzy query engine operates in either TQ mode (Algorithms A-1 and A2) or GFCQ mode (Algorithms A-3 and A-4).</p><p>Besides the DL-Lite query engine and the f-DL-Lite query engine, the ONTOSEARCH2 system consists of other components, such as the ontology search engine. In Section 5, we will show how the ontology search engine uses the f-DL-Lite query engine to perform keyword-plus-entailment searches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Benchmark and Evaluation</head><p>In this section, we present some preliminary evaluation of the f-DL-Lite query engine presented in Section 4.1. We will first discuss the benchmark that we used in the evaluation, and then present the the evaluation results. 6 http://www.ontosearch.org/ To the best of our knowledge, there exists no benchmark for query answering over fuzzy ontologies that we could use to evaluate our f-DL-Lite query engine. Accordingly, we propose a fuzzy variant of the well known Lehigh University Benchmark (LUBM), called f-LUBM, which is the first of its kind and against which future implementation of f-DL-Lite query engines can also be evaluated. f-LUBM allows the use of fuzzy classes and restricts the expressive power of the underlying ontology to that of f-DL-Lite. More precisely, we added two fuzzy classes to the LUBM University ontology, namely "Busy" and "Famous". The former one is determined by the number of courses taught or taken by a member of staff or student, while the latter one is determined by the number of papers published. The values are calculated using the s-shaped curve functions k f (n) to calculate the fuzzy value for fame given n papers published, and k b (n) to calculate the fuzzy value for busyness given n courses taken: Like in LUBM, it is possible to create arbitrarily large datasets for individual axioms, generated by a Java program in f-LUBM (http://www.csd.abdn.ac.uk/∼sttaylor/f-LUBM.zip). To test the f-DL-Lite query engine, we created datasets containing 1, 10 and 50 universities, with the largest data set (for 50 universities) containing 6,888,642 individuals. We used fuzzy aggregation queries as representatives for GFCQs in our test. In order to investigate the overhead of fuzzy queries, we compare the performance in the f-DL-Lite query engine with the DL-Lite query engine, which is used to answer the following two crisp queries.</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">k f (n) = 2 1+exp(-0.1n) -1, k b (n) =</formula><p>crisp-1(v) ← Famous(v) crisp-2(v1) ← Student(v1), Buzy(v1), Faculty(v2), Famous(v2), teacherOf (v2, v3), takesCourse(v1, v3)</p><p>The results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. The first column lists the queries used in the test. The second (resp. third and fourth) column show the time (in millisecond) needed to answer the queries for 1 university (resp. 10 and 50 universities). In general, the evaluations match nicely with our expectation: crisp queries are faster than CTQs as the system needs to take care of more joins due to the thresholds, while CTQs are faster than GFCQs as the former ones do not require post-processing to calculate the degrees. Furthermore, it is encouraging to see that the performance of the fuzzy query engine is in most cases close to the performance of the crisp query engine. With the smallest data </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">USE CASE: ONTOLOGY SEARCHING</head><p>This section presents an online application 6 , the ontology search engine in the ONTOSEARCH2 system, of the f-DL-Lite query engine presented in Section 4. One of the major limitations of existing ontology search engines is that searching is only based on keywords and metadata information of ontologies, rather than semantic entailments of ontologies (e.g., one wants to search for ontologies in which BassClarinet is a sub-class of Woodwind). On the other hand, searching only based on semantic entailments might not be ideal either, as synonyms appearing in the metadata could not be exploited.</p><p>By making use of the f-DL-Lite query engine, our ontology search engine supports keyword-plus-entailment searches, such as searching for ontologies in which class X is a sub-class of class Y, and class X is associated with the keywords "Bass" and "Clarinet", while class Y is associated with the keyword "Woodwind". The search could be represented as the following threshold query: 1: #TQ# 2: SELECT ?x WHERE { 3: ?x hasKeyword i-bass . #TH# 0.6 4: ?x hasKeyword i-clarinet . #TH# 0.6 5: ?x rdfs:subClassOf ?y . 6: ?y hasKeyword i-woodwind . #TH# 0.7} where i-bass, i-clarinet and i-woodwind are representative individuals for keywords "Bass", "Clarinet" and"Woodwind", resp. The thresholds 0.6 and 0.7 can be specified by users.</p><p>In order to support keyword-plus-entailment searches, our ontology search engine, for each indexed ontology, stores its semantic approximation (in DL-Lite) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> and accompanies each ontology in its repository with an f-DL-Lite metaontology, which (i) materialises all TBox reasoning based on the semantic approximation and, most importantly, (ii) uses fuzzy assertions to represent associations of each class (property) and keywords 7 appearing in the metadata of the ontology, with some degrees. Keywords appearing in the ontology metadata are associated with scores based on ranking factors <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">8</ref> . We use these scores to calculate the tf • idf <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> for 7 As mentioned above, keywords are represented by representative individuals. each keyword, and normalise them using a sigmoid function such as the one shown in (3) to a degree between 0 and 1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">w(n) = 2 1.2 -n + 1 -1<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Hence, the ontology search engine can use the f-DL-Lite query engine to query across all the meta-ontologies in its repository, so as to support keyword-plus-entailment searches. Further discussions of this use case go beyond the scope of this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">DISCUSSIONS</head><p>How to apply Description Logic based ontologies in the Web has been a pressing issue for the Semantic Web community <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. Web applications require ontology engines to be able to handle fuzzy and imprecise data in an efficient and scalable manner, which has been a big challenge for existing fuzzy ontology engines. In this paper, we tackle this issue by providing efficient and scalable query services for lightweight fuzzy ontologies (in f-DL-Lite), based on the the two novel query languages we proposed for fuzzy ontologies. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to report on implementations and evaluations of scalable and expressive conjunctive query answering over fuzzy ontologies. Our online use case application shows that the f-DL-Lite query engine can be used to enable keyword-plusentailment searches.</p><p>Our proposed query languages are related with weighted Boolean queries <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref> proposed in the field fuzzy information retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. On the one hand, motivated by these extensions we propose a completely novel query language, that of threshold queries, which is very important since it generalises the entailment of fuzzy assertions. On the other hand, the main strength of the proposed general fuzzy query language is its openness of the use of semantics generalising most previous approaches, like those based on fuzzy implications <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>, aggregation functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref>], Straccia's query language <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> for fuzzy DL-Lite and weighted t-norm queries <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. With the general fuzzy query language, we could provide top-k query answering service over f-DL-Lite ontologies, similar to that proposed by Straccia <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> for a variant of DL-Lite ontologies. In short, the openness of the use of fuzzy semantics and the generality of the presented algorithms make the fuzzy querying service more adaptable for different application needs.</p><p>One aspect of our future work is to investigate scalable querying services for more expressive fuzzy ontology languages, such as Fuzzy OWL <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. Another part of our future work should also consist of a survey on which query language/semantics could/should be used in what scenarios in Web applications.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>class inclusion axioms: B ⊑ C where B is a basic class B := A | ∃R | ∃R¯and C is a general class C := B | ¬B | C1 ⊓ C2 (where A denotes an named class and R denotes a named property); 2. functional property axioms: Func(R), Func(R¯), where R is a named property; 3. individual axioms: B(a), R(a, b) where a and b are named individuals.

Firstly, we present the abstract syntax of crisp DL-Lite by restricting the elements of the OWL DL syntax. Then, we provide the definition of individual axioms in fuzzy-DL-Lite which additionally contain a membership degree and an inequality type. </p></div>
