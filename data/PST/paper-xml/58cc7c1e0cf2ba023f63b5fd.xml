<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper presents safety barrier certificates that ensure scalable and provably collision-free behaviors in multirobot systems by modifying the nominal controllers to formally satisfy safety constraints. This is achieved by minimizing the difference between the actual and the nominal controllers subject to safety constraints. The resulting computation of the safety controllers is done through a quadratic programming problem that can be solved in real-time and in this paper, we describe a series of problems of increasing complexity. Starting with a centralized formulation, where the safety controller is computed across all agents simultaneously, we show how one can achieve a natural decentralization whereby individual robots only have to remain safe relative to nearby robots. Conservativeness and existence of solutions as well as deadlock-avoidance are then addressed using a mixture of relaxed control barrier functions, hybrid braking controllers, and consistent perturbations. The resulting control strategy is verified experimentally on a collection of wheeled mobile robots whose nominal controllers are explicitly designed to make the robots collide.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HE design of multirobot coordination strategies is typi- cally concerned with realizing primary, global behaviors such as achieving and maintaining formations, covering areas of interest, environmental exploration, and boundary tracking, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and references therein. Collision avoidance and other safety considerations are then added as secondary objectives, resulting in a hierarchical composition of multiple objectives, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Thus, what is ultimately deployed on the system is a combination of a "formally" designed nominal controller together with a "hand-crafted" collision avoidance algorithm, as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, with the basic idea being that the multirobot system executes the nominal, primary controller most of the time, while the secondary, collision avoidance controller takes over when the robots are too close to each other, e.g., following the behavior-based design paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. This approach is typically successful when the nominal controller, e.g., for covering an area or assembling and maintaining a formation, is allowed to dominate most of the time. However, as the robot "density" increases, e.g., when the number of agents increases, the collision avoidance strategy starts to dominate the behavior, with the robots spending most of the time avoiding collisions and, as a result, they do not progress toward achieving the primary objectives, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>A remedy to this problem is to design a collision avoidance controller that is minimally invasive in the sense that it only modifies the nominal controller when collision is truly imminent. This idea was pursued in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for pairs of aircraft, where the aircraft switches between normal operation modes and evasive maneuvers that were guaranteed to be safe no matter what actions the other aircraft were taking. Technically, this becomes a differential game problem and the computational cost associated with solving the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs Equation can be prohibitive, even for two agents and, as such, does not lend itself to real-time applications. A similar idea was pursued in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, where a so-called "velocity obstacle" method was used to calculate the optimal, safe velocity. Although computationally cheap, the underlying, infinite acceleration and constant velocity assumptions make it not suitable for highly dynamical collision avoidance behaviors. A mixed-integer quadratic program approach was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> to plan robot trajectories that avoid both inter-robot collisions and static obstacles. But the computational complexity of this approach prohibits its application to large swarms of robots.</p><p>In this paper, we follow this line of inquiry, whereby the nominal controller is allowed to influence the system as much as possible. However, as the robots are about to collide, barrier certificates, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, are employed to ensure that the collisions are avoided. Barrier certificates were used for safety verification of dynamical systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The existence of barrier certificates for safe dynamical systems was established in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Romdlony and Jayawardhana <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> merged control barrier function with control Lyaponov function for safe system stabilization. However, these barrier certificates are often overly restrictive by requiring the barrier function to always descend. A more permissive control barrier function was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> with correctness guarantees. In particular, in this paper, we use this type of more permissive control barrier functions to synthesize safety certificates-these provide the minimum modification necessary to formally guarantee safety. In fact, barrier certificates for multirobot collision avoidance IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS were introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and was extended to heterogeneous multirobot systems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The results in this paper extend and generalize these previous ideas by supporting a nonconservative decentralization of the certificates, guaranteeing that safe controllers do indeed exist by establishing feasibility, and providing approaches for deadlock avoidance.</p><p>In particular, in this paper, a safe set is defined over the joint state space of the multirobot team modeled as double integrators, which yields barrier certificates, i.e., control barrier functions, that are used to ensure that the robots remain in this set for all time. As a result, if a controller satisfies the safety barrier certificates, it is safe. At the same time, the actual control action is taken to be as close as possible to the nominal control action, i.e., it should be minimally invasive. However, the admissible control space permitted by the safety barrier certificates might be small or even empty. Therefore, there is a need to expand the admissible control space so that the nominal controller has the authority to perform desired control actions. The proposed barrier certificates have augmented admissible control space by using the so-called relaxed zeroing control barrier functions (ZCBF) as compared to past certificates. Additionally, the proposed barrier certificates utilize ZCBFs (as opposed to past schemes which used reciprocal barrier functions), with the result being both invariance and robust stabilization of the safe set.</p><p>The second main contribution in this paper is the establishment of feasibility of the underlying QP problem by combining the ZCBF controllers with an emergency braking maneuver. More specifically, multiple safety barrier constraints are combined as inequality constraints in the QP. If the QP is feasible, it guarantees that all barrier functions can be satisfied. In the case of infeasibility, we propose a method that ensures safety: Emergency braking. It will be shown that the emergency braking maneuver always constitutes a feasible action to avoid collisions and, as such, the feasible set is nonempty.</p><p>Finally, as the safety barrier constraints are designed to be decentralized and use only local sensing information, the lack of a central coordination signal might lead to deadlock among multiple robots with conflicting primary objectives. In fact, the potential for deadlock behavior is well-established, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, whereby the robots no longer progress toward the realization of the primary objective. The solution in this paper is based on a novel deadlock-detection scheme in combination with a consistent perturbation method that is inspired by symmetry-breaking traffic rules.</p><p>The decentralized safety barrier certificates for collision avoidance were implemented experimentally on a multirobot system consisting of multiple differential-drive mobile robots. The nominal controllers, designed to make agents swap positions or to execute leader-follower maneuvers, were explicitly designed to cause collisions in confined workspace. With the decentralized safety barrier certificates, all robots successfully achieved their goals, and avoided potential collisions while staying close to the nominal controllers. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we briefly recall the ZCBF construction from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. In Section III, the safety barrier certificates are first formulated in a centralized manner in order to call out what the information requirements really are to make safety barrier certificates effective. A decentralized formulation is proposed by assigning the admissible control space to different agents in Section IV followed by several modifications, namely enlargement of the admissible control space of the safety barrier certificates by introducing a Relaxed ZCBF in Section V, feasibility for safety critical system in Section VI, and deadlock detection and resolution in Section VII. In Section VIII, the safety barrier certificates are validated on an actual multirobot system, where the results show strong agreement with the simulation. A summary of the work is presented in Section IX.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. BACKGROUND: CONTROL BARRIER FUNCTIONS</head><p>In this section, the fundamentals for ZCBF are briefly recalled. The basic idea is to define a set of safe states and then use the ZCBF to formally guarantee the forward invariance of the desired set, i.e., if the system starts in the safe set, it stays in the safe set <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Conceptually, ZCBFs are similar to control Lyapunov functions in that they both can ensure certain properties of the system without explicitly calculating the forward reachable set.</p><p>We first review some of the basic ideas behind ZCBFs and then retool them to ensure that teams of robots that start out collision-free will indeed remain collision-free. The main robot model under consideration in this paper is the double integrator. However, for the sake of generality, we first consider dynamical systems on control affine form</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ẋ = f (x) + g(x)u (1)</formula><p>where the state x ∈ R n and control u ∈ U ⊂ R m , f and g are locally Lipschitz continuous. The system (1) is assumed to be forward complete for simplicity, i.e., x(t) is defined ∀t ≥ 0. Note that the state x is taken to be an aggregate of all the robot states in the team and f and g encode the collective robot dynamics-these entities will be made concrete in subsequent sections when we specialize the system to the particular multirobot system under investigation. Let the set C ⊂ R n be the safe set, i.e., the set where we wish that the aggregate robot states should stay. The task is then to design a controller that guarantees the forward invariance of set C , i.e., if x(0) ∈ C , then x(t) ∈ C , ∀t ≥ 0. And, to arrive at a mathematically manipulable formulation, we encode C through the super-level set of a ZCBF candidate function h :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">R n → R C = {x ∈ R n | h(x) ≥ 0}.<label>(2)</label></formula><p>We note that the time derivative of h(x) along the state trajectories is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">dh(x) dt = ∂h(x) ∂x ẋ = ∂h(x) ∂x (f (x) + g(x)u)</formula><p>or, using the Lie derivative formalism</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">dh(x) dt = L f h(x) + L g h(x)u.</formula><p>Definition II.1: A continuous function κ : (-b, a) → R for some a, b &gt; 0 is called an extended class-K function if it is strictly increasing and κ(0) = 0.</p><p>Definition II.2: Given a dynamical system (1) and a set C ⊂ R n defined by (2) for a smooth function h :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">D → R, with C ⊆ D ⊂ R n . The function h is called a ZCBF, if there exists an extended class-K function κ such that sup u ∈U {L f h(x) + L g h(x)u + κ(h(x)) ≥ 0} for all x ∈ D.</formula><p>Given a ZCBF, the admissible control space S(x) can be defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">S(x)={u ∈ U | L f h(x) + L g h(x)u + κ(h(x)) ≥ 0} , x ∈ D</formula><p>Now, we need to guarantee that C is forward invariant, and this is ensured by the following theorem.</p><p>Theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>: Given a set C ⊂ R n defined by (2) and a ZCBF h defined on D, with C ⊆ D ⊂ R n , any Lipschitz continuous controller u : D → R such that u ∈ S(x) for the system (1) renders the set C forward invariant. And C is asymptotically stable in D.</p><p>The extended class-K function κ regulates how fast the state of the system can approach the boundary of C . Therefore, different choices of κ, e.g., κ(r) = r P for any positive odd integer P , lead to different behaviors near the boundary. In this paper, the particular choice of κ(h(x)) = γh 3 (x) with γ &gt; 0 will be adopted, which means that the controller needs to satisfy</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L f h(x) + L g h(x)u + γh 3 (x) ≥ 0<label>(3)</label></formula><p>to render the set C forward invariant. Note that this form of the barrier function can equivalently be stated as a reciprocal barrier function of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">B(x) = 1 h(x)</formula><p>which was used in previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. CENTRALIZED SAFETY BARRIER CERTIFICATES</head><p>The key to being able to ensure that the robots avoid collisions is that all potential, pairwise robot-to-robot collisions are accounted for. As such, a natural first attempt is to let a centralized computation keep track of all robot pairs and then dictate how the nominal controllers should be modified in order to avoid collisions. In this section, we will see how such a centralized computation should be structured. The subsequent sections will be devoted to the relaxation of the need to consider all pairs to a significantly smaller subset of pairs, and to the decentralization of the computation in order to allow the robots themselves make decisions in real-time (see Section IV).</p><p>Concretely, consider a multirobot system consisting of N planar, mobile robots, indexed by M = {i | i = 1, 2, . . . , N}. As the acceleration limitations play a crucial role when avoiding collisions (otherwise, the robots could just set their velocities to zero instantaneously to avoid collisions), we choose to model the robot dynamics as double integrators</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ṗi vi = 0 I 2×2 0 0 p i v i + 0 I 2×2 u i (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><p>where  Next, a pairwise robot-to-robot safety constraint is formulated to guarantee that a safety distance D s between any two agents can be ensured. Algorithms to avoid imminent collision with static obstacles were developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> by decelerating the agent to zero velocity with the maximum braking force. However, to avoid imminent collision with a moving agent, the relative velocity between two agents needs to be reduced to zero instead of the absolute velocity. Consider any two agents i and j, the relative position and relative velocity between them are Δp ij = p i -p j and Δv ij = v i -v j . As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the normal component of the relative velocity</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">p i ∈ R 2 , v i ∈ R 2 ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">(Δv = ˙ Δp ij = Δ p T i j Δ p i j Δv ij )</formula><p>is the actual component that might lead to collision between agents i and j, while the tangent component of Δv ij only leads to rotation around each other. Therefore, we need to regulate Δv so that imminent collisions can be avoided if the maximum relative braking force is applied.</p><p>Assuming the normal component of the relative velocity between agents i and j is Δv(t 0 ) at the current time instance t 0 , it takes the time T b = 0-Δ v (t 0 ) α i +α j to reach Δv(t 0 + T b ) = 0, while the maximum braking acceleration (α i + α j ) is applied to both robots. In order to remain farther away from the safety distance D s , the following safety constraint needs to be satisfied</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Δp ij + t 0 +T b t 0 Δv(t 0 + t) dt ≥ D s , ∀i = j where Δv(t 0 + t) = Δv(t 0 ) + (α i + α j )t, which means that Δp ij - (Δv) 2 2(α i + α j ) ≥ D s , ∀i = j. (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>Note that this safety constraint only needs to be enforced when agents are moving closer to each other, i.e., when Δv ≤ 0. It is always considered safe when the agents are moving away from each other, i.e., when Δv &gt; 0. By combining this observation with the constraint in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">- Δp T ij Δp ij Δv ij ≤ 2(α i + α j )( Δp ij -D s ) ∀i = j.</formula><p>As such, the pairwise safe set C ij is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">C ij = {(p i , v i ) ∈ R 4 |h ij (p, v) ≥ 0} ∀i = j, h ij (p, v) = 2(α i + α j )( Δp ij -D s ) + Δp T ij Δp ij Δv ij (6)</formula><p>where h ij (p, v) is the level set function of the set C ij as well as the ZCBF candidate used to ensure the forward invariance of C ij . For ease of notation, we use h ij to denote h ij (p, v). As seen, the forward invariance of C ij requires the satisfaction of the ZCBF constraint in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. Combining ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) with (3), the safety barrier constraint can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">-Δp T ij Δu ij ≤ γh 3 ij Δp ij - (Δv T ij Δp ij ) 2 Δp ij 2 + Δv ij 2 + (α i + α j )Δv T ij Δp ij 2(α i + α j )( Δp ij -D s ) , ∀i = j. (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>Despite the seemingly complex form of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">7</ref>), it should be noted that the safety barrier constraint can in fact be written as a linear constraint in u i and u j , which in turn can be represented as</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">A ij u ≤ b ij , with A ij = [0, . . . , -Δp T ij agent i , . . . , Δp T ij agent j , . . . , 0] and b ij = γh 3 ij Δp ij - (Δv T i j Δ p i j ) 2 Δ p i j 2 + (α i +α j )Δv T i j Δ p i j √ 2(α i +α j )( Δ p i j -D s ) + Δv ij 2 .</formula><p>We denote all pairwise safety barrier constraints in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> as the centralized safety barrier certificates for the multirobot system. The centralized safety barrier certificates define the admissible control space S u as the intersection of different half-spaces</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">S u = {u ∈ R 2N | A ij u ≤ b ij ∀i = j}. (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">)</formula><p>Note that as the swarm size N grows, S u might become empty, which is a feasibility problem that will be addressed in Section VI.</p><p>The safe set C for the overall system is now formally defined as the intersection of all possible pairwise safe sets, i.e., all potential pairwise collisions are eliminated from</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">C C = i∈M ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ j ∈M j =i C ij ⎫ ⎪ ⎪ ⎬ ⎪ ⎪ ⎭</formula><p>where the product is the Cartesian product over the state space of all agents.</p><p>Definition III.1: The multirobot system indexed by M , with dynamics given in (4), is safe if the ensemble state</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">(p(t), v(t)) ∈ C , ∀t ≥ 0.</formula><p>With definitions for safety and the safety barrier certificates, the following result is presented to ensure the safety of the multirobot system.</p><p>Theorem III.1: Given a multirobot system indexed by M with dynamics in (4), if the controller u(t) satisfies the centralized safety barrier certificates in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, and (p(0), v(0)) ∈ C , then the multirobot system is guaranteed to be safe.</p><p>Proof: If the controller satisfies the centralized safety barrier certificates, then u(t) is always constrained inside the admissible control space S u and satisfies all the pairwise safety barrier constraints in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. As ensured by the ZCBFs in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, C ij is forward invariant for all i = j, i.e., C is forward invariant.</p><p>Since (p(0), v(0)) ∈ C , (p(t), v(t)) will stay in C for all time. Hence, the multirobot system is guaranteed to be safe.</p><p>Note that the safety barrier certificates can also deal with static or moving obstacles. When bounded with circles, the obstacles can be treated as agents with no control inputs. For example, consider a moving obstacle k with radius R k centered at p k , a ZCBF hik (p, v) similar to (6) can be designed to ensure that agent i does not collide with obstacle k</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">hik (p, v) = 2α i ( Δp ik -( D s 2 + R k )) + Δp T ik Δp ik Δv ik</formula><p>where obstacle k is assumed to be moving at a constant velocity v k .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Minimally Invasive Collision Avoidance Using a QP-Based Controller</head><p>In order to ensure that the nominal, primary control objective is respected to the highest degree possible, the collision avoidance strategy needs to be minimally invasive in the sense that it should modify the nominal controller as little as possible. And, as we have seen that the safety constraint is linear in the control signal, we can add a quadratic cost that penalizes deviations from the nominal controller (in the least-squares sense), resulting in a quadratic programming (QP) problem. As a consequence, the QP-based controller minimizes the difference between the actual control command u i and nominal control command ûi , while ensuring safety using the centralized safety barrier certificates discussed in the prior section</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">u * = argmin u∈R 2 N J(u) = N i=1 u i -ûi 2 s.t. A ij u ≤ b ij , ∀i = j (9) u i ∞ ≤ α i , ∀i ∈ M .</formula><p>The resulting controller u mimics the nominal controller û completely when the system is safe, and only modifies its behavior when collisions are truly imminent, which is what we mean by minimally invasive safe modification of the nominal controller û.</p><p>This QP-based controller requires central computation and coordination, which suffers from poor scalability, reactiveness, and robustness as the number of agents grows. But it provides a starting point toward decentralized safety barrier certificates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Reduced Neighborhoods</head><p>The centralized safety barrier certificates in the previous section considers all pairs of robots, which is potentially a very large number. Topologically speaking, that requires all-to-all interactions, i.e., a complete graph. As a result, the associated computation and sensing requirements will increase significantly as the number of robots increases. Motivated by the fact that agents sufficiently far apart will not collide within a finite time horizon, a neighborhood notion should be developed that reduces the required information structure to a disk graph, i.e., only pairs of nearby (within a certain distance) robots are needed, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The neighborhood set of agent i is thus defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">N i = {j ∈ M | Δp ij ≤ D i N , j = i} (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_26">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">D i N = D s + 1 2(α i + α min ) 3 2(α i + α max ) γ + β i + β max 2</formula><p>is the choice of the radius of the neighborhood which will be elucidated later, α min = min j ∈M {α j } and α max = max j ∈M {α j } are lower and upper bounds of all agents' acceleration limits, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">β max = max j ∈M</formula><p>{β j } is the upper bound of all agents' speed limits.</p><p>With this notion of neighborhood, we will say that each agent only needs to consider its nearby agents to avoid collision, even though the computation, so far, is done by a centralized unit.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Simulated Centralized Safety Barrier Certificates</head><p>The centralized safety barrier certificates are validated on a simulated multirobot system consisting of 20 mobile robots modeled with double integrator dynamics. As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(a)</ref>, all agents were equally spaced on a circle at the beginning. The goal of the nominal controller is to make all agents swap their positions with the agents on the opposite side of the circle. The nominal controller is designed as a simple PD controller ûi = -k 1 (p i -r i )k 2 v i , which drives the robot to the desired position r i with zero velocity. Intuitively, all agents will collide at the center of the circle if no collision avoidance strategy is executed. This test case generates a "crowded" and collision-prone scenario to validate the effectiveness of the safety barrier certificates.</p><p>The result of running the nominal position swapping controller wrapped with the centralized safety barrier certificates is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. When collisions were not imminent, all agents moved toward the center and followed the nominal controllers closely [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(b)</ref>]. As robots became too close to each other, the safety barrier certificates modified the controller as little as possible to keep the desired safety distance [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(c)</ref>]. In the end, all robots successfully navigated through the "crowded" region and headed straightly toward the opposite side of the circle without colliding into each other [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(d)]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. DECENTRALIZED SAFETY BARRIER CERTIFICATES</head><p>The centralized safety barrier certificates proposed in Section III ensure provably safe multirobot coordination, while the reliance on a central coordination unit potentially compromises the multirobot system's scalability, reactiveness, and robustness. To address those issues caused by the centralized coordination, the safety barrier certificates will be distributed to individual agents without losing the safety guarantee in this section.</p><p>The safety barrier certificates define the admissible control space, which can be partitioned to smaller subsets. Each agent only needs to stay within its own subset to remain safe. Motivated by the fact that agents with larger acceleration limits are more agile in performing collision avoidance maneuvers, the admissible control space is partitioned based on the agents' acceleration limits. For more details about decentralized safety barrier certificates for heterogeneous multirobot systems, we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. More specifically, the pairwise safety barrier constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> between agent i and agent j is distributed to each agent as</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">-Δp T ij u i ≤ α i α i + α j b ij Δp T ij u j ≤ α j α i + α j b ij .</formula><p>With the decentralized safety barrier constraints and the notion of neighborhood, the sensing and computation tasks are completely distributed to each individual agent.

When j / ∈ N i , (p i , v i ) still stays in C ij due to Theorem III.2. Therefore, C is forward invariant, and this completes the proof.</p><p>Although safety is still ensured, the collision avoidance interventions enforcing the decentralized safety certificates have to happen earlier than the centralized case due to the lack of central coordination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Simulation for Decentralized Safety Barrier Certificates</head><p>The decentralized safety barrier certificates are validated on a simulated multirobot system for the same position swapping task described in Section III-C. As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, all agents successfully navigated through the crowded center region to the opposite side of the circle without collision. Meanwhile, the agents were much slower in the vicinity of other agents and spent more time to complete the same task without central coordination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Computational Complexity and Solver Details</head><p>The computational complexity of the QP for enforcing the safety barrier certificates is analyzed in this section. Numbers of decision variables M d and linear constraints M c are two important factors that determine the computation complexity of the QP. As shown in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>, the decentralization of the safety barrier certificates and the neighborhood reduction significantly decrease M d and M c (in the worst case). In particular, for the decentralized safety barrier certificates with reduced neighborhood, each robot only needs to run a QP with two decision variables and at most ceiling(</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">D 2 N D 2 s</formula><p>) constraints for arbitrary swarm size N . Here the ceiling(•) function maps a real number to the smallest integer no less than itself. In the worst case scenario, the neighborhood disk of the robot is densely populated with at most ceiling(</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">π D 2 N π D 2 s</formula><p>) robots. Thus the decentralized safety barrier certificates are scalable to arbitrarily large groups of robots. Note that since the actual value of D N depends both on D s and γ according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, the sensing range of the robot can be used to replace D N if a more specific upper bound is required.</p><p>The actual computation times of the certificates per iteration are listed in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>. The centralized barrier certificates can handle up to 60 robots with an update rate of more than 30 Hz. Meanwhile, the decentralized barrier certificates can handle more than 100 robots with an update rate of more than 100 Hz. All the computations are performed on an Ubuntu laptop with a 2.60 GHz Intel Core i5 processor using the MATLAB quadprog solver.</p></div>

RELAXED SAFETY BARRIER CERTIFICATES</head><p>The decentralized safety barrier certificates remove the need for central computation at the cost of using a more conservative collision avoidance strategy, i.e., the nominal controller might be modified earlier than truly necessary to avoid collisions.</p><p>Motivated by the need to enlarge the admissible control space, the relaxed ZCBF is introduced through a relaxation parameter k r (t) ∈ [1, ∞), which is continuous in t.</p><p>The idea now is to insist that ḣ(x) ≥ -k r (t)κ(h(x)), and prove that we can still formally guarantee the forward invariance of the set C when the ZCBF constraint is relaxed with k r (t).

We know that the solution is of the form z(t) = σ(z(0), t), where κ is a class-K function and σ is a class-K L function, as shown, for example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>The corresponding "relaxed" dynamical system is given by ż = -k r (t)κ(z ), and the solution to this system is Comparing the relaxed system with ḣ ≥ -k r (t)κ(h) (use the Comparison Lemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>), we have that</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">z (t) = σ z (0), t 0 k r (s) ds ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_42">h(x(t)) ≥ σ h(0), t 0 k r (s)ds .</formula><p>Note that t 0 k r (s) ds ≥ 0 and ∞ 0 k r (s) ds = ∞.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. FEASIBLE SAFETY BARRIER CERTIFICATES</head><p>The safety barrier certificates ensure safety as long as all agents' control actions stay within the admissible control space. However, the admissible control space might become empty in extreme scenarios, where the QP-based controller becomes infeasible, i.e., no solution exists and safety cannot be guaranteed. This can be remedied by the robustness feature of ZCBF, which means the ZCBF will force the states back to the safe set C when violation occurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. But it is important to synthesize safety barrier certificates with guaranteed feasibility such that a solution to the QP-based controller always exists. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Safety Barrier Certificates With Guaranteed Feasibility</head><p>Intuitively, if all agents can decelerate to zero velocity without colliding into each other, then they can stay static to remain safe thereafter. Therefore, we can synthesize a ZCBF which ensures that decelerating to zero velocity is always a feasible safe control action. This is achieved by designing two modes of operations: normal mode and braking mode. The safety barrier certificates operate in the normal mode when the QP-based controller is feasible, and switch to the braking mode when it is infeasible. In the braking mode, the agent will apply the maximum braking force until it stops.</p><p>Assume that two agents start to apply their maximum braking force at any arbitrary time t 0 , they both reach zero velocity at time t s .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Simulation Results for Three Types of Decentralized Safety Barrier Certificates</head><p>Up until now, three types of decentralized safety barrier certificates, namely the nominal safety barrier certificates in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, the relaxed safety barrier certificates in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, and the feasible safety barrier certificates in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>, have been developed in this paper. Their performance is briefly compared here through simulations of two agents executing go-to-goal controllers regulated by three types of decentralized safety barrier certificates.</p><p>As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>(a), two agents started simultaneously from the square markers, and successfully reached the cross markers in all three cases. Safety was always guaranteed as  shown by the evolution of the distance between two agents in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>(b). Among these three types of safety barrier certificates, the relaxed safety barrier certificates allow the largest admissible control space, and therefore agents can approach the safety distance more aggressively. The feasible safety barrier certificates have stricter constraints on the admissible control space to guarantee feasibility, which leads to more conservative behaviors when agents are approaching the safety distance.</p><p>The nominal and actual control signals during the simulation are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>. Comparing the total time of intervention, it can be concluded that the relaxed safety barrier certificates are the least invasive to the nominal controller with only 2.9 s of intervention.</p><p>Based on the simulation results and earlier discussions in this paper, a comparison across the three types of decentralized safety barrier certificates is listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. DEADLOCK DETECTION AND RESOLUTION</head><p>When the objectives of multiple agents conflict with the safety barrier certificates, the agents might get stuck into a deadlock. In the deadlock scenario, the agents are safe but their tasks cannot be completed. Deadlock occurs because the safety barrier  certificates are designed to take the local information only. In order to detect and resolve the deadlock issue, we first come up with a definition of the deadlock.</p><p>Definition VII.1: A robot agent i is said to be stuck in a deadlock, if it remains stationary (u i = 0 and v i = 0) and the nominal control command ûi = 0.</p><p>With this definition, the deadlock scenarios can be further classified into three types based on the solution to the QP problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. The admissible control space for the QP problem is a convex polygon P i defined as the intersection of multiple half spaces, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_62">P i = {u i ∈ R 2 | Āij u i ≤ bij , ∀i = j}</formula><p>where P i is a decentralized counterpart of the centralized admissible control space S u in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. The size of the feasible control space, termed the width of the feasible set <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, can be evaluated with a Linear Program (LP) The solution of the LP characterizes how much control margin is left for the strictest safety barrier constraint. If δ LP ≤ 0, the corresponding QP is solvable. A more negative δ LP indicates larger admissible control space. Otherwise, no feasible control option is available, and the admissible control space is empty.</p><formula xml:id="formula_63">min u i ∈R 2 ,δ L P ∈R δ LP s.t. Āij u i ≤ bij + δ LP , ∀i = j, u i ∞ ≤ α i .</formula><p>The deadlock scenarios are categorized into the following three cases based on the relation between u i and P i 1) Type 1 deadlock: δ LP &lt; 0, u i = 0 ∈ vertex(P i );</p><p>2) Type 2 deadlock: δ LP &lt; 0, u i = 0 ∈ edge(P i ); and 3) Type 3 deadlock: δ LP ≥ 0.</p><p>It should be noted that these three types of deadlock comprise all possible types of deadlocks. This is because u i is either on the edge or the vertex of P i , when the optimal solution of the constrained QP controller (u i = 0) is different from the unconstrained optimal solution (û i = 0), due to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>More intuitively, these three deadlock scenarios are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>.</p><p>One way to resolve the deadlock scenarios is to perturb the QP controller so that the robot agents can move around each other when they get stuck. The QP controller needs to be perturbed consistently, because multiple robot agents might still be acting against each other with random perturbations. Inspired by the traffic rule used in transportation to resolve conflicts <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, the following consistent perturbation method is proposed to resolve different deadlocks 1) Type 1 deadlock: As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>(a), the left barrier constraint is relaxed (k γ (left) &gt; 1) and the right barrier constraint is compressed (k γ (right) &lt; 1). 2) Type 2 deadlock: As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_64">(b), ûi is perturbed with δ ⊥ = k δ [ 0 1 -1 0 ]û i ,</formula><p>which is a normal perturbation to the left of ûi .</p><p>3) Type 3 deadlock: u i = 0, no perturbation is performed since no admissible perturbation is available. Note that the online relaxation of the left and right barrier constraints is enabled by the relaxed ZCBF introduced in Section V.</p><p>The deadlock resolution strategies are consistent for different types of deadlocks in that a clockwise motion will emerge for all agents involved in the deadlock. Therefore when multiple agents get into a deadlock, they will be perturbed to give way to the agent on the right side as if traffic rules are enforced.</p><p>Proposition VII.1: Type 1 and Type 2 deadlocks are resolved with the Decentralized Deadlock Detection Resolution algorithm.</p><p>Proof: For Type 1 Deadlock, u i = 0 ∈ vertex(P i ). When the left barrier constraint is relaxed and the right barrier constraint is compressed, u i = 0 / ∈ vertex(P i ) as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9(a)</ref>. Therefore, the optimal control command to the perturbed QP-based controller is ūi = 0.</p><p>For Type 2 deadlock, u i = 0 ∈ edge(P i ). Due to KKT conditions, ûi is perpendicular to the edge of P i , otherwise u i = 0 is not the optimal solution for the QP. When δ ⊥ , a perturbation normal to ûi , is applied, u i = 0 is no longer the optimal control command to the perturbed QP-based controller. Therefore, the actual control command ūi = 0 as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9(b)</ref>. Combining the two cases, the adjusted control command ūi is nonzero without compromising the safety guarantee. Therefore, Type 1 and Type 2 Deadlocks are resolved.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>, the decentralized deadlock detection resolution algorithm is validated against different deadlock scenarios. The algorithm successfully perturbed agents away from deadlock scenarios in a consistent way (clockwise rotation around each other emerges in both cases).</p><p>The consistent perturbation approach provides solutions to resolve all types of deadlocks except Type 3 deadlocks. In addition, livelock might still exist even if deadlock is resolved. This is because the safety barrier certificates in this paper is proposed to provide safety guarantee regardless of the purpose of the nominal controller. As the safety controller is not informed about what the nominal controller is ultimately trying to achieve, livelock becomes a somewhat diffuse concept. One possible idea could be to combine the safety certificates with navigation functions, such that the robots only move in the directions where the navigation function decreases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>The decentralized safety barrier certificates were implemented on a multirobot system consisting of multiple Khepera III robots. Two experiments were performed to demonstrate collision avoidance with static and moving obstacles while executing multirobot coordination strategies. A diffeomorphism controller similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> is used to approximate the unicycle dynamics of the robots with double integrator dynamics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Multirobot Swapping Positions in Confined Workspace</head><p>The higher level goal of the first experiment was to make all robots in the multirobot system swap positions with each other in a confined workspace, where collisions were very likely to occur. A nominal controller ûi = -k 1 (p i -r i ) k 2 v i was executed on each robot assuming no collision would happen.</p><p>During the experiment, the decentralized safety barrier certificates were wrapped around the nominal controller using the QP based controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref> are several snapshots of the robots' positions taken by an overhead camera during the experiment. All agents started on Pos i, i = 1, 2 . . . , 8, and moved straightly toward their goal positions following the nominal controller [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11(a)</ref>]. As they moved closer to the center of the workspace, the safety barrier certificates started modifying the nominal control commands as little as possible to avoid collisions [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11(b)</ref> and<ref type="figure">(c)</ref>]. Then all robots successfully navigated out of the "crowded" region and swapped their positions [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11(d)]</ref>. A video of the experiment can be found online <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Leader-Follower Formation Among Static Obstacles</head><p>A multirobot leader-follower formation traveled through an environment populated with static obstacles in the second experiment. The leader-follower formation controller is adapted from a translational invariant formation controller for double integrators in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">12</ref>, the leader-follower formation of five robots successfully traveled from the initial position to the final position without colliding with each other or the static obstacles.</p><p>Notice that the shape of the formation was deformed by the safety certificates in the vicinity of obstacles. A video of the experiment is available online <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. CONCLUSION</head><p>A general framework of minimally invasive collision avoidance for multirobot systems was formally synthesized using control barrier functions. The computation and sensing requirements were reduced significantly by distributing safety barrier certificates to each individual agents and only considering neighboring agents without losing the safety guarantee. Then a series of problems related to safety barrier certificates, i.e., the conservativeness of the certificates, the feasibility of the QP-based controller and deadlock-avoidance, were addressed. The proposed safety barrier certificates were validated through various simulations, and then implemented on a real multirobot system consisting of multiple Khepera robots.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
