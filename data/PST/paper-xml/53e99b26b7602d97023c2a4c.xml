<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Partial group actions arise by weakening the usual definition of a group action. To define what they are, let G be a group and X a set. A partial function from G × X to X is denoted by (g, x) → g • x, and we write ∃g • x to mean that g • x is defined. We say that (g, x) → g • x defines a partial action of G on X if the following two conditions hold: (PA1) ∃g • x implies that ∃g -1 • (g • x), and g -1 • (g • x) = x. (PA2) ∃g • (h • x) implies that ∃(gh) • x and g • (h • x) = (gh) • x.</p><p>We say that the partial action is unital if the following condition also holds: (PA3) ∃1 • x for every x ∈ X, and 1 • x = x. a</p><p>The essential difference between partial group actions and the usual "global" group actions lies in condition (PA2): from the existence of g • (h • x) we can infer the existence of (gh) • x, but not conversely. b This condition also distinguishes partial group actions amongst the local transformation groups of differential geometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> of which they form a special class; for arbitrary local transformation groups, the existence of g • (h • x) does not imply the existence of (gh) • x.</p><p>The term "partial action of a group" was introduced by Exel <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, who incorporated axiom (PA3) in his definition, whereas Coulbois <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> uses the term "pre-action" for a special class of unital partial actions. We have adopted Exel's terminology because the relationship between partial actions and actions parallels the relationship between partial bijections and bijections.</p><p>The reader will recall that an action of a group G on a set X can also be defined by means of a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group on X. We can similarly reformulate partial group actions in terms of appropriate morphisms. To do this, we need the notion of a "premorphism" introduced in 1977 by McAlister and Reilly <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. First recall that on an inverse semigroup S we can define a partial order by a ≤ b if and only if a = be for some idempotent e. That this is a partial order is a standard result proved in any of the semigroup references. It is called the natural partial order and, whenever we use a partial order on an inverse semigroup, it will always be this one. A function θ: S → T between inverse semigroups is said to be a premorphism c if the following two axioms hold: (PM1) θ(s -1 ) = θ(s) -1 for all s ∈ S. (PM2) θ(s)θ(t) ≤ θ(st) for all s, t ∈ S.</p><p>If S and T are both monoids then the premorphism is said to be unital if the following axiom also holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(PM3) θ(1) = 1.</formula><p>The theory of premorphisms was subsequently developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, where they were called "prehomomorphisms". It is evident that a partial action of a group G on a set X is nothing other than a premorphism from G to the inverse semigroup I(X), the symmetric inverse monoid on X. The partial action is unital precisely when the corresponding premorphism is unital.</p><p>Partial group actions are extremely widespread in mathematics. One of the first examples arises in the theory of Möbius transformations: the Möbius group acts globally on the Riemann sphere but only partially on the complex plane. More generally, if G is any group which acts globally on the set X, and Y is any subset of X, then it is easy to check that G acts partially on Y . We say that the partial action arises by restricting the global action. In the case of Möbius transformations, one starts with the partial action and proves that it is the restriction of a global action. We say that the action arises from the partial action by globalization. In addition, partial group actions play a role in: C * -algebras <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>; the Ribes-Zalesskiȋ property of groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>; model theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>; tilings <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>; R-trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>; and group presentations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. We shall discuss some of these examples in more detail at the appropriate places in the paper.</p><p>Since the first draft of this paper was distributed, Benjamin Steinberg has developed some of the ideas in this paper much further <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. He characterises when a partial action on a connected complex has a connected globalization and when it has a globalization which is a tree.</p><p>We prove two basic results on partial group actions.</p><p>Result 1. In Sec. 2, our main result, Theorem 2.4, was motivated by Exel's paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Exel proves (his Theorem 4.2) that there is an inverse semigroup S(G) with the property that there is a one-to-one correspondence between unital partial actions of G on X and actions of S(G) on X. Exel constructs S(G) by means of generators and relations. Although he obtains a lot of information about the structure of S(G), his work falls slightly short of an explicit description. We rectify this by showing that S(G) is the Birget-Rhodes expansion of the group G (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>) using Szendrei's description of this semigroup in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. We apply Theorem 2.4 to the theory of graph immersions partially motivated by some ideas to be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</p><p>Result 2. Whereas in Sec. 2, we kept the set X fixed and replaced the group G by an inverse monoid constructed from G, in Sec. 3, we keep the group G fixed and replace the set X by a larger set X which contains X and on which G acts globally.</p><p>In our second main result, Theorem 3.4, we prove that every partial group action can be globalized in a universal way. The construction which underpins our result has been rediscovered a number of times and we make no claim to novelty in that; the novelty, such as it is, lies in our proof of the role of this construction within the theory of partial actions of groups. The construction has appeared in a surprisingly wide variety of areas which suggests to us that partial actions of groups are of some interest. Here are a few examples.</p><p>• It is the basis of Poincaré's theorem for constructing Fuchsian groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>• It is the basis of Macbeath's theorem on group presentations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>• It is the basis of Munn's proof of the P -theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>• It is the basis of Megrelishvili's work on embedding topological spaces into spaces with strong properties of homogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. • It was used by Hrushovski <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> as a tool in establishing the small index property for certain structures in model theory.</p><p>• In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the authors mention that Rips uses the construction in studying groups acting on R-trees.</p><p>We describe applications of the globalization theorem to continuous partial actions in Sec. 3.2 and to partial actions on posets in Sec. 3.3; this latter makes the connection with Munn's work mentioned above. Throughout this paper, we shall use basic results from inverse semigroup theory; see Howie <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Lawson <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> or Petrich <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Partial Actions of Groups and Actions of Inverse Semigroups</head><p>In Sec. 2.1, we show how to construct an action of an inverse monoid from a partial action of a group, completing the work of Exel <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. We describe an application of this result to the theory of graph immersions in Sec. 2.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Completing Exel's construction</head><p>Before proving our main results, we need to show that the definition of a unital partial action of a group given in the Introduction and the one given by Exel (in the form stated in his Proposition 4.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>) are in fact equivalent.</p><p>Proposition 2.1. Let G be a group, and S an inverse monoid. Then a map θ: G → S is a unital premorphism if and only if the following two conditions hold :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(i) θ(1) = 1. (ii) θ(s)θ(t)θ(t -1 ) = θ(st)θ(t -1 ) for all s, t ∈ G.</formula><p>Proof. Let θ: G → S be a unital premorphism. We need only prove condition (ii). By (PM2),</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">θ(s)θ(t)θ(t -1 ) ≤ θ(st)θ(t -1 ) ≤ θ(s) . Now θ(st)θ(t -1 ) ≤ θ(s) implies that θ(st)θ(t -1 ) = eθ(s) for some idempotent e ∈ S. Thus θ(st)θ(t -1 )θ(s) -1 θ(s) = θ(st)θ(t -1 ) . From θ(s)θ(t)θ(t -1 ) ≤ θ(st)θ(t -1 ) we obtain θ(s)θ(t)θ(t -1 ) = θ(st)θ(t -1 )(θ(s)θ(t)θ(t -1 )) -1 θ(s)θ(t)θ(t -1 ) . Hence θ(s)θ(t)θ(t -1 ) = θ(st)θ(t -1 )(θ(t)θ(t) -1 )(θ(s) -1 θ(s))(θ(t)θ(t) -1 )</formula><p>using axiom (PM1). But the three bracketed pairs of elements on the right-hand side of the above equation are idempotents and idempotents commute in inverse semigroups. Thus using the fact that θ(st)θ(t -1 )θ(s) -1 θ(s) = θ(st)θ(t -1 ) .</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">θ(s)θ(t)θ(t -1 ) = θ(st)θ(t -1 )(θ(s) -1 θ(s))(θ(t)θ(t) -1 ) = θ(st)θ(t -1 )</formula><p>We now prove the converse. Let θ be a function satisfying conditions (i) and (ii) above. Since (i) is just axiom (PM3), we have to show that axioms (PM1) and (PM2) hold. We begin with axiom (PM1). In condition (ii), replace s by t -1 . We thus obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">θ(t -1 )θ(t)θ(t -1 ) = θ(1)θ(t -1 ) = θ(t -1 )</formula><p>using condition (i). Again, in condition (ii), replace s by t, and t by t -1 . We thus obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">θ(t)θ(t -1 )θ(t) = θ(1)θ(t) = θ(t) .</formula><p>Hence θ(t -1 ) is the inverse of θ(t) in the inverse semigroup S. Thus θ(t) -1 = θ(t -1 ). We can now prove that axiom (PM2) holds. By condition (ii), we have that</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">θ(s)θ(t)θ(t -1 ) = θ(st)θ(t -1 ) .</formula><p>Multiplying this equality on the right by θ(t) and using axiom (PM1), which we have just established, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">θ(s)θ(t) = θ(st)(θ(t) -1 θ(t)) ≤ θ(st) , since θ(t) -1 θ(t) is an idempotent.</formula><p>The identity (ii) in Proposition 2.1 is of fundamental importance for our calculations. To be explicit, we have restated it and its dual below as a lemma to which we shall make frequent reference; both identities were first proved by Exel <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Lemma 2.2. Let G be a group and S an inverse monoid. Let θ: G → S be a unital premorphism. Then for all s, t ∈ G we have that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">(i) θ(s)θ(t)θ(t -1 ) = θ(st)θ(t -1 ). (ii) θ(s -1 )θ(s)θ(t) = θ(s -1 )θ(st).</formula><p>We now describe an inverse monoid constructed from a group G which we shall prove to be the universal inverse monoid constructed by Exel by means of generators and relations. Let G be a group with identity 1. Denote by P 1 (G) the set of all finite subsets of G containing 1. Put</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">GR = {(A, g) ∈ P 1 (G) × G: g ∈ A} with multiplication (A, g)(B, h) = (A ∪ g • B, gh) ,</formula><p>where g •B = {gb: b ∈ B}. Then GR is an inverse monoid which Szendrei <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> proves is the Birget-Rhodes expansion of the group G. It is also an F -inverse monoid, a term we now define. The minimum group congruence σ is defined on any inverse semigroup S by s σ t if and only if there exists a ∈ S such that a ≤ s, t, where ≤ is the natural partial order. An inverse semigroup is said to be E-unitary if the σ-class of an idempotent contains all and only the idempotents. An inverse monoid is said to be F-inverse if each σ-class contains a maximum element; F -inverse monoids are necessarily E-unitary.</p><p>Let S be an F -inverse monoid and let G = S/σ. Let s g be the maximum element in the σ-class g. Define ι: G → S by ι(g) = s g . Now the identity of G is the σ-class containing the identity of the monoid. Since S is E-unitary, the only elements σrelated to the identity are the idempotents. Thus ι(1) = 1. Next, observe that s g ∈ g and s h ∈ h implies that s g s h ∈ gh. Thus s g s h ≤ s gh . It follows that ι: G → S is a unital premorphism. In the case of the F -inverse monoid GR the map ι: G → GR is given by ι(g) = ({1, g}, g) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Lemma 2.3. The semigroup GR is generated by the elements ι(g) where g ∈ G.</p><p>In particular , if (A, g) = ({1, g 1 , . . . , g n }, g n ), where g = g n , then</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">(A, g) = ι(g 1 )ι(g -1 1 g 2 ) . . . ι(g -1 n-1 g n ) .</formula><p>Furthermore, the following equations hold for all s, t ∈ G:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">(i) ι(s -1 )ι(s)ι(t) = ι(s -1 )ι(st). (ii) ι(s)ι(t)ι(t -1 ) = ι(st)ι(t -1</formula><p>).</p><p>(iii) ι(s)ι(1) = ι(s).</p><p>(iv) ι(1)ι(s) = ι(s).</p><p>Proof. Let (A, g) = ({1, g 1 , . . . , g n }, g n ). Then</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">(A, g) = ({1, g 1 , . . . , g n-1 }, g n-1 )({1, g -1 n-1 g n }, g -1 n-1 g n ) .</formula><p>Repeating, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">(A, g) = ({1, g 1 }, g 1 ) n k=2 ({1, g -1 k-1 g k }, g -1 k-1 g k ) ,</formula><p>as required. The identities (i) to (iv) are easy to check.</p><p>By [5, Proposition 2.2], the above result implies that the semigroup GR is a homomorphic image of Exel's semigroup S(G); the theorem below, the main result of this section, will imply that we actually have an isomorphism. Theorem 2.4. Let G be a group, and S be an inverse monoid. Then for every unital premorphism θ: G → S there exists a unique monoid homomorphism θ * : GR → S such that θ * ι = θ.</p><p>Proof. Let (A, g) = ({1, g 1 , . . . , g n }, g n ) be a typical element of GR . Define Since each product θ(g j )θ(g j ) -1 is an idempotent, the definition of θ * is independent of the order of the elements g j . Thus θ * is a well-defined function from GR to S.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">θ * (A, g) = θ(g 1 )θ(g 1 ) -1 • • • θ(g n )θ(g n ) -1 θ(g) .</formula><p>Observe that θ * ({1}, 1) = θ(1) and so θ * maps the identity of GR to the identity of S. Furthermore,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">θ * (ι(g)) = θ * ({1, g}, g) = θ(g)θ(g) -1 θ(g) = θ(g) .</formula><p>Thus θ * ι = θ.</p><p>We now prove that θ * is a homomorphism. Let (A, g), (B, h) ∈ GR , where A = {1, g 1 , . . . , g m } and g = g m , and B = {1, h 1 , . . . , h n } and h = h n . By definition</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">θ * (A, g) = θ(g 1 )θ(g 1 ) -1 . . . θ(g m )θ(g m ) -1 θ(g) and θ * (B, h) = θ(h 1 )θ(h 1 ) -1 . . . θ(h n )θ(h n ) -1 θ(h) .</formula><p>Observe that</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">θ(g)θ(h 1 )θ(h 1 ) -1 θ(h 2 )θ(h 2 ) -1 . . . θ(h n )θ(h n ) -1</formula><p>can be written as θ(g) times products of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">θ(h p )θ(h p ) -1 θ(g) -1 θ(g) where 1 ≤ p ≤ n. Now θ(g) • θ(h 1 )θ(h 1 ) -1 θ(g) -1 θ(g) is equal to θ(gh 1 )θ(gh 1 ) -1 • θ(g)</formula><p>by Lemma 2.2. Continuing in this way, we obtain that</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">θ(g)θ(h 1 )θ(h 1 ) -1 . . . θ(h n )θ(h n ) -1 is equal to θ(gh 1 )θ(gh 1 ) -1 . . . θ(gh n )θ(gh n ) -1 θ(g) . Now θ(g)θ(h) = θ(g)θ(g) -1 θ(g)θ(h) which is equal to θ(g)θ(g) -1 θ(gh) by Lemma 2.2. It follows that θ * (A, g)θ * (B, h) = m k=1 θ(g k )θ(g k ) -1 n l=1 θ(gh l )θ(gh l ) -1 θ(g)θ(g) -1 θ(gh) . But θ(g)θ(g) -1 occurs as θ(g m )θ(g m ) -1 , consequently θ * (A, g)θ * (B, h) = ( m k=1 θ(g k )θ(g k ) -1 )( n l=1 θ(gh l )θ(gh l ) -1 )θ(gh) .</formula><p>On the other hand, (A, g)(B, h) = ({1, g 1 , . . . , g m , gh 1 , . . . , gh n }, gh) .</p><p>It is now evident that θ * (A, g)θ * (B, h) = θ * ((A, g)(B, h)). Finally, to prove uniqueness, let φ: GR → S be any homomorphism such that φι = θ. Let (A, g) = ({1, g 1 , . . . , g n }, g n ). By Lemma 2.3, we have that</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">(A, g) = ι(g 1 )ι(g -1 1 g 2 ) . . . ι(g -1 n-1 g n ) . Thus φ(A, g) = θ(g 1 )θ(g -1 1 g 2 ) . . . θ(g -1 n-1 g n ) using φι = θ.</formula><p>We now obtain an alternative expression for</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">θ(g 1 )θ(g -1 1 g 2 ) . . . θ(g -1 n-1 g n ) . By Lemma 2.2, we have that θ(g 1 )θ(g -1 1 g 2 ) = θ(g 1 )θ(g 1 ) -1 • θ(g 2 ) .</formula><p>Continuing in this way, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">φ(A, g) = θ(g 1 )θ(g 1 ) -1 . . . θ(g n )θ(g n ) -1 θ(g n ) which is equal to θ * (A, g).</formula><p>If we specialize the above theorem to the case where the inverse semigroup S is the symmetric inverse monoid I(X) then we obtain the result proved by Exel in the first four sections of his paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. It is important to note, however, that Exel actually constructs a presentation of S(G) and so, by our result, of GR .</p></div>

In model theory, Hrushovski <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and later Herwig <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> used it in connection with establishing the small index structure for certain relational structures in model theory. In combinatorial group theory, Macbeath <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> (see also Serre <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>) used it to obtain a presentation of a group acting suitably on a space; it is also used in the proof of Poincaré's theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>; and Rips uses it in studying groups acting on R-trees (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, pp. 644-645).</p><p>The following result enables us to spot globalizations easily. We now sketch out an alternative approach to the theory of partial group actions and their globalizations which uses groupoids. We begin by recalling some standard terminology. A groupoid is a category in which every element is invertible. If G is a groupoid, then the identities of G are denoted by G o . We denote by d(x) the right identity of the element x and by r(x) the left identity. The product xy is defined if and only if d(x) = r(y). A functor θ: G → H between groupoids is star injective if θ(a) = θ(b) and d(a) = d(b) imply that a = b; it is star surjective if for each e ∈ G o and for each h ∈ H such that θ(e) = d(h) there exists g ∈ G such that d(g) = e and θ(g) = h. A functor which is both star surjective and star injective is said to be a covering.</p><p>Let G be a group acting partially on the set Y . Let</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">G = G(G, Y ) = {(g, y) ∈ G × Y : ∃g • y} .</formula><p>Define a partial binary operation on G as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">(g, x)(h, y) = (gh, y) if x = h • y undefined else ,</formula><p>and define π: G → G by π(g, y) = g.</p><p>The next result is a generalization of the well-known construction of a groupoid from a group acting on a set. Proposition 3.6. Let G act partially on the set Y . Then G is a groupoid and the function π: G → G is a star injective functor , which is a covering if and only if G acts globally on Y .</p><p>Proof. The partial product is well-defined. For if (g, x), (h, y) ∈ G and the product (g, x)(h, y) is defined then ∃g • x, ∃h • y and x = h • y. It follows that ∃g • (h • y) and so by condition (PA2), we have that ∃(gh) • y. Hence (gh, y) = (g, x)(h, y) ∈ G. Define d(g, x) = (1, x) and r(g, x) = (1, g • x). Then clearly</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">∃(g, x)(h, y) ⇔ d(g, x) = r(h, y) .</formula><p>It is now easy to check that G is a category with the set of identities given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">G o = {(1, y): y ∈ Y } , using condition (PA3). For each (g, x) ∈ G define (g, x) -1 = (g -1 , g • x)</formula><p>. This is well-defined by condition (PA1). It is now easy to check that G is a groupoid.</p><p>The function π: G → G is clearly a functor, and evidently star injective. Suppose now that G acts globally on Y . We claim that π is also star surjective. Let (1, y) be any identity in G and let g ∈ G. Then the pair (g, y) ∈ G because g • y is always defined by assumption. But d(g, y) = (1, y) and π(g, y) = g. Conversely, suppose that G acts partially on Y and the functor π is star surjective. Let g ∈ G and y ∈ Y . Then (1, y) ∈ G o and g ∈ G thus by surjectivity there exists (h, x) ∈ G such that d(h, x) = (1, y) and π(h, x) = g. It follows that (h, y) = (g, x) and so ∃g • x.</p><p>The following result provides a converse to the above construction. Proposition 3.7. Let H be a groupoid. Let θ: H → G be a star injective functor to a group G. Put Y = H o and define a partial function from G × Y to Y by ∃g • x if there exists h ∈ H such that d(h) = x and θ(h) = g in which case g • x = r(h). Then this defines a partial group action. The action is global if and only if θ is also star surjective.</p><p>Proof. (PA1) holds: suppose that ∃g • x. Thus by definition there exists h ∈ H such that d(h) = x and θ(h) = g and g (PA3) holds: let x ∈ Y . Then x is an identity of H and so θ(x) = 1. It follows that 1 • x is defined and equals x.</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">• x = r(h). Observe that g -1 • (g • x) exists because θ(h -1 ) = g -1 and d(h -1 ) = r(h) = g • x. By definition g -1 • (g • x) = r(h -1 ) = d(h) = x. (<label>PA2</label></formula><p>Suppose that the action is global. Let x ∈ H o and g ∈ G. Then since the action is global g • x is defined and so there exists h ∈ H such that d(h) = x and θ(h) = g. But this says precisely that θ is star surjective. Conversely, if θ is star surjective then the action is global.</p><p>Let G be a group. Then one can define two categories based on G: the category of all star injections to G and the category of all partial actions of G. It is straightforward to prove, using Propositions 3.6 and 3.7 above, that these two categories are equivalent. We omit the details.</p><p>We now show how globalizations fit into this framework. Let G act partially on the set Y . Let π: G(G, Y ) → G be the corresponding star injective functor. Let Y G be the globalization of the partial action, and let ι: Y → Y G . Let Π: G(G, Y G ) → G be the corresponding covering functor. We may define an injective functor ν: G(G, Y ) → G(G, Y G ) by ν(g, y) = (g, ι(y)).

We have proved that the universal globalization of a partial action of a group G gives rise to an enlargement of the corresponding star injective functor into G. Now let (ν, Π) be any enlargement of π. To simplify things we assume that ν is subset inclusion. We conclude that the universal globalization of a partial action of G gives rise to an enlargement in the category of star injective functors over G, and conversely.

Hence π -1 (ι(U )) = m -1 (U ).</formula><p>Suppose first that the partial action of G on X is continuous. Thus by definition, m is continuous. Let U be an open subset of X. We prove that ι(U ) is an open subset of ι(X). By assumption,</p><formula xml:id="formula_63">m -1 (U ) is open in G * X. Thus there is an open subset V of G × X such that m -1 (U ) = (G * X) ∩ V . Thus π -1 (ι(U )) = (G * X) ∩ V by the observation above. It follows that ι(U ) = π((G * X) ∩ V ). Now π((G * X) ∩ V ) ⊆ π(G * X) ∩ π(V ); on the other hand, if [g, x] ∈ π(G * X) ∩ π(V ), then ∃g • x and [g, x] = [h, y] for some (h, y) ∈ V . Thus ∃h • y and so (h, y) ∈ (G * X) ∩ V . Hence [g, x] ∈ π((G * X) ∩ V ), and so π((G * X) ∩ V ) = π(G * X) ∩ π(V ) . Hence ι(U ) = ι(X) ∩ π(V ). But V is open in G × X, and so π(V ) is open in X G , since π is an open map. Thus ι(U ) is open in ι(X).</formula><p>Conversely, suppose that ι:</p><formula xml:id="formula_64">X → ι(X) is an open map. Let U be an open subset of X.

Hence m is continuous.</p><p>Combining Propositions 3.9, 3.11 and 3.12, we are led to define the following class of partial group actions. Let G be a topological group, X a topological space, and let θ: G → Γ(X) be a unital premorphism. Then we say that G acts nicely on X if G * X is an open subset of G × X and m: G * X → X is continuous. The following theorem gives both an "internal" and an "external" characterization of such nice actions. Theorem 3.13.</p><p>(i) Let G be a topological group with a nice partial action on the topological space </p><formula xml:id="formula_66">X. Then ι: X → X G is an open map.

Since each element g of G induces a homeomorphism of Y , it follows that θ(g) induces a homeomorphism between its domain and image. Thus G acts partially on the space</p><formula xml:id="formula_68">Y . Since G × Y → Y is continous by assumption, its restriction to G * X → X is also continuous. It remains to show that G * X is an open subset of G × X. Let (g, x) ∈ G * X. Put x = g • x. Then x ∈ X ∩ g • X, and X ∩ g • X is an open subset of Y . Since µ is continuous, µ -1 (g • X ∩ X) is an open subset of G × Y containing (g, x)</formula><p>. Thus from the definition of the product topology on G × Y , we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_69">µ -1 (g • X ∩ X) = A i × U i ,</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_70">A i ⊆ G and U i ⊆ Y are open sets.

Hence (g, x) ∈ A i × (U i ∩ X) ⊆ G × X .</formula><p>Thus G * X is an open subset of G × Y . The partial action θ: G → I(X) has a globalization X G . Define the function α: X G → Y by α([g, x]) = µ(g, x). We have already seen (Proposition 3.5) that this is a well-defined bijection, and that the action of G on Y is isomorphic to the action of G on Y G , and that α maps ι(X) to X. It remains to show that α is a homeomorphism. Observe that απ = (µ|G × X).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Möbius transformations</head><p>We conclude with a very simple classical example which can be handled using globalizations. The Möbius group, which is isomorphic to the projective general linear group P GL(2, C) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, acts partially on the complex plane because the composition of two Möbius transformations on C as partial functions need not be a Möbius transformation but is contained in a unique Möbius transformation.</p><p>We temporarily adopt a naive approach: let us pretend for a moment that we do not know what the globalization of this partial action is. The following lemma provides conditions for the globalization to be obtained by adjoining one extra point.</p><p>Lemma 3.15. Let θ: G → I(Y ) be a unital partial action of the group G on the set Y . Suppose that for each g ∈ G the set dom θ(g) is equal to Y itself , or omits at most one point from Y, which we denote by x g . In this case we say that g omits x g . Suppose that for all g, h ∈ G such that g omits x g , and h omits x h we have (h -1 g) • x g = x h . Then Y G is obtained from ι(Y ) by the adjunction of exactly one extra point.</p><p>Proof. We need to consider two cases. Suppose first that [g, x] ∈ Y G and g does not omit x from its domain. Then g • x is defined and [</p><formula xml:id="formula_73">g, x] = [1, g • x] ∈ ι(Y ). Now let [g, x], [h, y] ∈ Y G be</formula><p>any two elements such that g omits x from its domain, and h omits y from its domain. Then by assumption, (h</p><formula xml:id="formula_74">-1 g) • x = y. Thus [g, x] = [h(h -1 g), x] = [h, (h -1 g) • x] = [h, y] .</formula><p>This shows that there is exactly one element in Y G which is not in ι(Y ).</p><p>Continuing with the assumptions of the above lemma, we may describe exactly how the globalization behaves. Denote by ∞ the unique point adjoined to ι(Y ) to obtain Y G . Suppose that g omits x g from its domain. Then from the proof of the lemma, we have that ∞ = [g, x g ]. Let φ be the globalization of θ. Then φ(g)(ι(x g )) = φ(g) <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref> x g ] = ∞; thus ι of the point omitted by θ(g) from its domain is sent to ∞ by φ(g). To determine the value taken by φ(g)(∞), observe that θ(g) and θ(g -1 ) are mutually inverse partial bijections. Thus θ(g -1 ) omits the point x g -1 from its domain. By the proof of the lemma, we have that ∞</p><formula xml:id="formula_75">= [g -1 , x g -1 ]. Thus φ(g)(∞) = [gg -1 , x g -1 ] = [1, x g -1 ] = ι(x g -1 )</formula><p>, which is ι of the point omitted by θ(g -1 ). We therefore know exactly how the globalization behaves.</p><p>We now return to Möbius transformations. It is easy to check that (h -1 g)( -d c ) = -δ γ . The conditions of Lemma 3.15 are therefore satisfied. Thus the globalization is obtained by adjoining exactly one extra point, which we denote by ∞. The argument following the proof of Lemma 3.15 now shows that our globalization of the partial action of the Möbius group is algebraically identical to the globalization obtained by embedding the complex plane in the Riemann sphere.</p><p>To describe the topology on the globalization constructed above, it is easiest to abandon our naive approach. The Möbius group P GL(2, C) acts continuously on the Riemann sphere S, and so restricts to a nice partial action on C. Clearly G • C = S. The conditions of Theorem 3.13(ii) hold, and so there is a homeomorphism from C G to S.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">The P -theorem</head><p>Let G be a group acting globally on the set X, and let Y ⊆ X such that G • Y = X. Then G acts partially on the set Y and by Proposition 3.5, the globalization of this partial action is isomorphic to the action of G on X. Thus the pair (G, X) is a globalization of the partial action determined by the pair (G, Y ). This situation is reminiscent of one of the basic constructions of inverse semigroup theory, which we now recall.</p><p>A McAlister triple (G, X, Y ) consists of a group G, a partially ordered set X, a subsemilattice and order ideal Y of X, together with an action of G on X by order automorphisms such that G•Y = X, and for every g ∈ G we have that g •Y ∩Y = ∅; this last condition is equivalent to the statement that the premorphism θ from G to I(Y ) induced by the partial action of G on Y has the property that θ(g) is always non-empty. Such triples are used to construct E-unitary semigroups. In this section, we explain the exact connection between globalizations of partial actions of groups and the theory of E-unitary inverse semigroups. As a consequence, we shed light on Munn's proof of the P -theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. To do this, we shall need to consider a special class of partial actions of groups: namely, partial actions of groups on semilattices, together with their globalizations. We begin by making precise the definition of such actions.</p><p>Let Y be a meet semilattice, and let I(Y ) denote the inverse monoid consisting of order isomorphisms between non-empty order ideals of Y . Observe that the intersection of two non-empty order ideals of Y is again non-empty because Y is a meet semilattice. A unital premorphism from a group G to I(Y ) will be said to define a unital partial action of the group G on the semilattice Y .</p><p>The first result is essentially a restatement of the contents of the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> in terms of partial actions. Theorem 3.17. From each unital partial action of the group G on the semilattice Y we can construct an E-unitary inverse semigroup S such that the semilattice of S is isomorphic to Y and S/σ is isomorphic to G.</p><p>From each inverse semigroup S we can construct a unital partial action of S/σ on the semilattice E(S).</p><p>These two constructions are, upto isomorphism, inverses of each other.</p><p>Proof. We sketch out the proof and refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> for details. This construction is a structured version of the construction described in Proposition 3.6, modified to use images rather than domains. If we begin with the inverse semigroup S, and apply Construction 1 followed by Construction 2, then by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 26]</ref>, we end up with an inverse semigroup isomorphic to S. Consequently, every E-unitary semigroup is isomorphic to one obtained from a partial action of a group on a semilattice by means of Construction 1.</p><p>It remains to show that if we start with a unital premorphism θ: G → I(Y ) and apply Construction 1 followed by Construction 2, then we end up essentially with θ. To this end, we say that two partial actions θ: G → I(Y ) and φ: G → I(Z) are isomorphic if there is an isomorphism of semilattices ι: Z → Y such that ι(φ(g)(z)) = θ(g)ι(z) for all g ∈ G. We can now prove the result. Let θ: G → I(Y ) be a unital premorphism. Form the E-unitary semigroup S according to Construction 1. We now describe the result of applying Construction 2 to S; we denote the corresponding premorphism by θ . Let g ∈ G. The σ-class of S corresponding to g, is the set of all elements of the form (y, g) ∈ S. Now (y, g) -1 (y, g) = (g -1 • y, 1). Thus dom θ (g) = {(g -1 • y, 1): y ∈ im θ(g)}. But y ∈ im θ(g) if and only if g -1 • y ∈ dom θ(g). By Construction 2, we have that θ (g)(g -1 • y, 1) = (y, g)(y, g) -1 = (y, 1). On the other hand, θ(g)(g -1 • y) = y. Define ι: Y × {1} → Y by ι(y, 1) = y. Then θ is isomorphic to θ , as required.</p><p>As an aside, it is interesting to note that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> congruences on an E-unitary inverse semigroup are constructed in terms of the corresponding partial action on the semilattice.</p><p>Let θ: G → I(Y ) be a unital partial action on a semilattice. We now investigate the properties of the globalization φ: G → I(Y G ) obtained in Theorem 3.4. We now show that ≤ defines a partial order on Y G . It is clear that ≤ is reflexive. Suppose that [h, y] ≤ [g, x] and [g, x] ≤ [h, y]. Then by the observation above, given (g, x) there exists x ≤ x such that (g, x ) ∈ [h, y]. Similarly, given (g, x ) there exists x ≤ x such that (g, x ) ∈ [g, x]. However, this implies that [g, x ] = [g, x], and so x = x by (i). But x ≤ x ≤ x and so x = x. Thus (g, x) = (g, x ) ∼ (h, y) and so [g, x] = [h, y]. Transitivity follows readily from our initial observation.</p><p>(iv) It is immediate from the definition of ≤ that ι defines an order-preserving function from Y to ι(Y ). Suppose that ι(y) ≤ ι(x). Then [1, y] ≤ <ref type="bibr">[1, x]</ref>. Thus there exists x ≤ x such that <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref> x ] = <ref type="bibr">[1, y]</ref>. But then x = y by (i).

We can determine when the globalization is also a semilattice by using inverse semigroup theory. An E-unitary inverse semigroup is constructed from a McAlister triple (G, X, Y ) in which X is a semilattice precisely when the semigroup is of a type known as F-inverse (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr">Sec. 7.4</ref>] for more information and references). We may therefore deduce the following result from Theorem 3.19. Theorem 3.20. Let θ: G → I(Y ) be a unital partial action of the group G on the semilattice Y . Then the universal globalization of θ is a semilattice if and only if the E-unitary inverse semigroup constructed from θ is F -inverse.</p></div>			</div>
