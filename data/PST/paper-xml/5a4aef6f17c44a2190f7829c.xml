<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In view of the importance of seasonal forecasting of agricultural commodity price, particularly vegetable prices, and the limited research attention paid to it previously, this study proposes a novel hybrid method combining seasonal-trend decomposition procedures based on loess (STL) and extreme learning machines (ELMs) for short-, medium-, and long-term forecasting of seasonal vegetable prices. In the formulation of the proposed method (termed STL-ELM), the original vegetable price series are first decomposed into seasonal, trend, and remainder components. Then, the ELM is used to forecast the trend and remainder components independently, while the seasonal-na√Øve method is used to forecast seasonal components with a 12-month cycle. Finally, the prediction results of the three components are summed to produce an ensemble prediction of vegetable prices. In addition, an iterated strategy is used to implement multi-stepahead forecasting. In terms of two accuracy measures and the Diebold-Mariano test, the experimental results show that the proposed method is the best-performing method relative to the competitors listed in this study, indicating that the proposed STL-ELM model is a promising method for vegetable price forecasting with high seasonality.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>According to China Agricultural Yearbook 2011 , 1 the vegetable yield in China increased by 232% from 204 million tons in 1991 to 679 million tons in 2011, accounting for 52% of the total vegetable yield in the world. Both the yield and production value of the vegetables were greater than those of grain in 2011, indicating that vegetables have become one of the most important agricultural commodities in the daily life of Chinese people since 2011.</p><p>Vegetable prices have been exceptionally volatile over the past several years, reaching a low of 1.37 RMB/kg in July 2003 and a high of 11.73 RMB/kg in January 2014 (kidney bean is presented as an example here), as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> . This has increased the risk faced by practitioners of agriculture when making decisions related to production, marketing, inventory, and resource allocation. In addition, the highly perishable nature of vegetables further intensifies this risk. Therefore, an understanding of price behavior is a critical element in making decisions under uncertain conditions that significantly affect the returns of the agricultural market participants. In this sense, most of the decisions are made at the beginning of the planting season, but not all of them are reversible. Therefore, price forecasting is a crucial step, and research on vegetable price forecasting is of great significance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> .</p><p>A significant characteristic of vegetable price series is the seasonality (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> ), which is the biggest obstacle for obtaining accurate forecasts of vegetable prices. Given the complexity of the price series, many models have been specified for capturing the behavior of vegetable prices, but researchers have not reached a consensus on the best model for vegetable prices. The literature reviews on price forecasting in the agricultural commodity market, particularly vegetable markets, are detailed in Section 2.1 .</p><p>An extensive investigation of the literature reveals that considerable efforts have been devoted to improving or developing techniques and tools to analyze and forecast time series with high seasonality. The seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> is the most popular and widely used technique for forecasting seasonal time series <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> . However, the forecasting performance may be very poor if the SARIMA built using linear assumptions for time series with high nonlinearity is used. Recently, the area of artificial neural networks (ANNs) has witnessed substantial improvements in terms of seasonal time series forecasting. Notable works on ANN in seasonal forecasting include those of Zhang and Qi <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and Zhang and Kline <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> . More recently, support vector regression (SVR) has been extensively applied as a powerful alternative to traditional ANN for seasonal time series forecasting across a wide range of disciplines <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> . Although good performances using SVR for seasonal time series forecasting were reported in many areas, similar to the traditional ANN model, SVR also suffers from expensive computational costs and sensitivity to parameter selection.</p><p>Recently, another type of ANN, namely extreme learning machine (ELM), was proposed by Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> . ELM is an improved single-layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN) that uses a more efficient learning algorithm. The most attractive advantage of ELM is its extremely fast learning speed, and the generalization of ELM is superior to that of traditional ANN and comparable to that of SVR <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> . In addition, only the output weights of ELM need to be tuned relative to traditional ANN because the input weights and biases are randomly determined in advance in ELM <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> . Due to its excellent performance, till now, ELM has attracted more attention from the academic community and has been successfully used in many different areas, such as energy markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> , environmental engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> , business management <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> , medical science <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> , and single processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> . To the best of our knowledge, however, the application of ELM for seasonal time series forecasting has not been widely explored.</p><p>In this study, the ELM, in conjunction with a decomposition technique, is selected to handle forecasting problems of seasonal vegetable price series. It has been documented in the literature that seasonal adjustment of time series using certain decomposition techniques before further forecasting is an efficient practice for improving seasonal time series forecasting. A well-established decomposition technique, seasonal-trend decomposition based on loess smoothing (STL) proposed by Cleveland et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> , is used for decomposition of the seasonal vegetable price series into its constituent components in this study. The most important advantages of the STL, relative to other decomposition techniques, are its strong robustness to outliers in the examined time series and ease of use <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> . In addition, the seasonal component obtained using STL always exhibits a rigorous cycle, which facilitates forecasts by means of the seasonal-na√Øve method. In this study, for example, the seasonal component of the vegetable price exhibits a standard 12-month cycle. Thus, the seasonal-na√Øve method is the optimal model for forecasting the seasonal component.</p><p>Motivated by the points mentioned above, a hybrid method combing STL and ELM, termed STL-ELM, is developed for the seasonal forecasting of vegetable price series in this study. In the proposed method, STL is first used to decompose the examined vegetable price series into seasonal, trend, and remainder components. Second, ELM is applied to forecast the trend and remainder components, while the seasonal-na√Øve method is used to fore-cast the seasonal component with a 12-month cycle. Finally, the prediction results of three components are combined by simple summing to generate an aggregated output, which can be seen as the final prediction for the original vegetable price series. The monthly prices of five vegetables, i.e., cabbage, pepper, cucumber, green bean, and tomato, from the Chinese agriculture market are chosen as experimental datasets. Apart from the individual ELM, for comparison purposes, four well-established methods used in seasonal time series forecasting, i.e., SARIMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> , time delay neural network (TDNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> , SVR <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> , and SARIMA-Kalman filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> , are selected as benchmarks. The quantitative assessments are established on the basis of short-, medium-, and long-term forecasting performance in terms of two accuracy measures and the Diebold-Mariano test. In terms of the implementation of mediumterm (three-step-head) and long-term (six-step-head) forecasting, the extensively used iterated strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> is used in this study.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 , a literature review and the contributions of this paper are introduced. Section 3 presents a brief description of STL, ELM, and the iterated strategy, followed by a formulation of the proposed STL-ELM model in detail. The research design of the data description, measurement criteria, and benchmark prediction models is provided in Section 4 . Section 5 illustrates and discusses the experimental results for five vegetable price series. Concluding remarks are finally made in Section 6 .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Literature review</head><p>Although accurate forecasts of vegetable prices can provide critical and useful information for agricultural market participants, it is easy to see that studies on vegetable price forecasting are limited in number. Dieng <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> investigated the performance of three traditional parametric models for forecasting tomato, potato, and onion prices and further made recommendations to potential users in Senegal. To analyze the seasonal variations of tomato prices, Adanacioglu and Yercan <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> developed a SARIMA model to forecast the monthly tomato price at a wholesale level in Turkey. Martin-Rodriguez and Caceres-Hernandez <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> proposed a restricted evolving spline model to capture the dynamic process of change in the seasonal pattern of tomato prices and further forecast them. Taking advantage of computational intelligence, Nasira and Hemageetha <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> developed back-propagation neural network (BPNN)-based prediction models to forecast tomato prices. Amiri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> examined and compared the ability of geostatistical models, inverse distance weighting, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems, and the winter method for seasonal forecasting of potato and onion prices in Iran. Melin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> developed several ANNbased prediction models for simulating and predicting the dynamic behavior of tomato prices in the U.S. Hemageetha and Nasira <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> developed a prediction model based on radial basis function neural networks to predict tomato prices.</p><p>In addition, some analyses and discussions on the existing literature on price forecasting related to agricultural commodity spot markets will help provide some useful suggestions and implications for seasonal forecasting of vegetable prices. Colino et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> examined and compared the predictive performance of outlook hog price forecasts with several alternative time series methods. Davenport and Funk <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> proposed a characteristic-based clustering method to facilitate forecasts of cross-country grain price data and identify dissimilarities in price behavior across multiple markets in Kenya. Three ANN-based models and an integrated prediction model were developed by Luo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> to forecast the price of Lentinus edodes in Beijing. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> developed a shortterm prediction model based on chaotic ANN for forecasting the weekly retail prices of eggs in China. After testifying that the seasonality present in cereal prices is deterministic, Jumah and Kunst <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> applied traditional in-sample fit and moving-window techniques to model the seasonal pattern and forecast the cereal prices. Jha and Sinha <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> examined and compared the price forecasting capabilities of ARIMA and time-delay neural network (TDNN) in forecasting prices of soybean, groundnut, rapeseed, and mustard in India. The results obtained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> show that the TDNN in general provides better forecasts as compared to ARIMA for nonlinear patterns. As such, TDNN is adopted as the benchmark in this study. To capture the mean dependence, volatility, and, more importantly, high frequency of zero changes in German milkbased commodities prices, K√∂mm and K√ºsters <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> proposed a Markov switching mixture model for forecasting milk-based commodity prices in Germany. Onour and Sergi <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> developed two competing models, i.e., the thin-tailed normal distribution and the fat-tailed student t -distribution models, to model and forecast the volatility of prices of wheat, rice, sugar, beef, coffee, and groundnut. Ribeiro and Oliveira <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> proposed a hybrid model integrating the ANN and Kalman filter techniques for forecasting the prices of sugar. Ramirez and Fadiga <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> examined the ability of asymmetric-error generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models to forecast soybean, sorghum, and wheat prices in the U.S. Shih et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> proposed a weighted casebased reasoning approach to construct a price prediction model for broiler prices. Ticlavilca <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> proposed a multi-step-ahead prediction model based on multivariate relevance vector machines to forecast the prices of cattle, hog, and corn in the U.S. By extracting two factors from a panel of commodity prices themselves using principal components analysis, West and Wong <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> constructed a static factor model to model and forecast the monthly prices of corn, cotton, and soybean. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> developed an aquatic product price forecasting support system. Zou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> compared the predictive ability of ARIMA, neural networks, and a hybrid model for forecasting wheat prices in China.</p><p>A summary of the models, forecasted agricultural commodity type, prediction horizon, seasonality, and time scale of these studies is provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Research contribution</head><p>As seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> , in summary, our contributions can be outlined as follows.</p><p>(1) Because only seven out of 23 studies are associated with vegetable prices, the current study adds to a fairly limited body of research in this area. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> Only seven studies paid attention to the seasonal pattern in agricultural commodity prices, but none of them investigated the ability of decomposition techniques to address seasonal variation. To this end, a well-established STL is applied to handle seasonal patterns of vegetable prices and further facilitate forecasts in this study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> The neural network is the most commonly used computational intelligence tool in these studies. However, neural networks suffer from expensive computational costs and sensitivity to parameter selection. Thus, a novel modeling technique, ELM, is used in the current study. A novel hybrid method combing STL and ELM is proposed for the seasonal forecasting of vegetable prices. (4) Of the 23 studies conducted, most focused on one-step-ahead forecasting, and only one study conducted multi-step-ahead forecasting for vegetable prices. Thus, the present study provides the first experimental evidence within the literature to examine the capability of computational intelligence methods and traditional statistical methods for short-, medium-, and long-term forecasting for vegetable prices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> In terms of the few studies focused on the Chinese market (only 4 studies focus on Chinese market), this study provides empirical ev-idence on agricultural commodity price forecasting in the Chinese market.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodologies</head><p>This section introduces the general process of the proposed STL-ELM method. First, the STL and ELM are briefly presented. Then, the proposed STL-ELM method is formulated, and the corresponding steps are described in detail.</p></div>

Significantly different from traditional seasonal decomposition techniques, such as X-12-ARIMA and the ratio-to-moving-average method, STL provides more robust results when dealing with the outliers in the examined time series.</p><p>Given a vegetable price series X t , STL decomposes X t into the three additive components of seasonal S t , trend T t , and remainder R t components: X t = S t + T t + R t . STL is an iterative method consisting of two recursive procedures, inner and outer loops. Each of the passes through the inner loop consists of a seasonal smoothing that updates the seasonal component, followed by a trend smoothing that updates the trend component once. Upon the completion of the inner loop, robustness weights are calculated in the outer loop, which are then applied to decrease the influence of the outliers on updating seasonal and trend components in the following inner loop. Specifically, the inner loop is composed of six steps as follows:</p><p>Step 1 : Detrending. At iteration k + 1 of the inner loop, the original series X t is detrended with the estimated trend component T (k )   t obtained at the k th pass:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X detrend t = X t -T (k ) t .</formula><p>Step 2 : Seasonal smoothing.

In Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> (a), using the historical values of the remainder component ( R t-d+1 , . . . , R t-1 , R t ) , the subsequent (one-step-ahead) value ÀÜ R t+1 is predicted. In Fig. <ref type="figure">3 (b)</ref>, based on the historical values of the remainder component ( R t-d+2 , . . . , R t-1 , R t ) and the previously predicted value ÀÜ R t+1 as the predictor, the two-step-ahead predicted value ÀÜ R t+2 is obtained. In Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> (c), using the historical values of the remainder component ( R t-d+3 , . . . , R t-1 , R t ) and the previously predicted values ÀÜ R t+1 and ÀÜ R t+2 as the predictors, the three-stepahead predicted value ÀÜ R t+3 is obtained. Similarly, the six-stepahead predicted value ÀÜ R t+6 is obtained. Regarding the seasonal component, it is clear that S t , t = 1 , 2 , . . . , n exhibits a standard 12-month cycle, i.e., S t+12 = S t . Accordingly, the seasonal-na√Øve method is the optimal model for forecasting the seasonal component. In the seasonal-na√Øve method, the future value at period t + 12 is equivalent to the historical value at period t . This model can be represented as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">X t = S t + T t + R t , t = 1 , 2 , . . . ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">ÀÜ S t+12 = S t , t = 1 , 2 , . . . , n<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where S t is the true value at period t of the seasonal component and ÀÜ S t+12 is the predicted value at period t + 12 of the seasonal component.</p><p>Step 3: Summation . The prediction results of the trend and remainder components generated by ELM and the seasonal component using the above seasonal-na√Øve method in Step 2 are summed to produce an aggregated output, which is the final predicted price of the original kidney bean price.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Data description</head><p>The monthly price series of five vegetables, i.e., cabbage, pepper, cucumber, green bean, and tomato, are used as experimental datasets in this study because these vegetables play an important role in the daily life of Chinese people. The datasets are collected from Chinese bazaars and are freely available from the China Monthly Statistics provided by the National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref>The objective of the current study is to propose an STL-ELM method for seasonal vegetable price forecasting with various prediction horizons ( H = 1, 3, and 6). The monthly prices of five vegetable price series from January 2002 to April 2014 are used here, depending on the availability. For each vegetable, the price series are split into the estimation and holdout samples following the commonly used two-thirds norm. Accordingly, the first 98 observations from January 2002 to February 2010 are selected as the estimation sample, which is used to determine the unknown parameters of the pre-defined models. The last 50 observations from March 2010 to April 2014 are used as the holdout sample, which is applied to evaluate the forecasting performance of the obtained models. To evaluate the prediction ability of the proposed STL-ELM method, we carry out one-, three-, and six-step-ahead forecasting to examine the short-, medium-, and long-term forecasting ability, respectively. It should be noted that an iterated strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref> is used for implementing the medium-and long-term forecasting. In addition, in order to avoid inputs in greater numeric ranges from dominating those in smaller numeric ranges, a linear transformation is adopted to adjust the original vegetables prices series scaled into the range of [0, 1] in this study.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> depicts the monthly price series mentioned above. From Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> . it can be seen that all five vegetable price series have a significant cyclical characteristic, which is mainly determined by the seasonality of vegetable production and consumption. In addition, a growth trend can be observed in these price series, which is mainly influenced by the inflation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Measurement criteria</head><p>To compare the forecasting performance of the proposed STL-ELM method with that of four selected competitors, no single accuracy measure can capture the distributional features of the errors. Accordingly, two indices, the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) and mean absolute scaled error (MASE), are used as prediction accuracy measures. These indices are as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">SMAPE = 1 T T t=1 x t -ÀÜ x t | x t | + ÀÜ x t / 2 (6) MASE = 1 T T t=1 x t -ÀÜ x t 1 N-1 N i =2 | x i -x i -1 | (7)</formula><p>where x t is the observation at period t , ÀÜ</p><p>x t is the forecast of x t , and T and N are the numbers of observations in the estimation sample and hold-out sample (in this case, N = 98 and T = 50 ), respectively.</p><p>Apart from the accuracy measures, the Diebold-Mariano (DM) statistic is used to test the statistical significance of two competing prediction models <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> . The DM test aims to test the null hypothesis of equality of the expected forecast accuracy against the alternative of different forecasting abilities across models. The loss function is set to the mean square prediction error (MSPE), and the null hypothesis is that the MSPE of the tested model te is not less than that of the reference model re . In particular, the DM statistic can be defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">S DM = ·∏° V g /N (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>where ·∏° = (</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">N t=1 g t ) /N, g t = ( x t -ÀÜ x te,t ) 2 -( x t -ÀÜ</formula><p>x re,t ) 2 , and</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">V g = Œ≥ 0 + 2 ‚àû t=1 Œ≥ t ( Œ≥ t = cov ( g t+1 , g t ) )</formula><p>. Œ≥ 0 is the variance of g t , ÀÜ</p><p>x te,t and ÀÜ x re,t</p><p>represent the predicted values of x t calculated using the tested method te and reference method re , respectively, in period t. N is the number of observations in hold-out sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Methodologies implementation</head><p>The purpose of this study is to propose a novel hybrid method combining STL and ELM for short-, medium-, and long-term forecasting of seasonal vegetable prices. The implementation of the proposed method is detailed as follows.</p><p>In this study, STL is implemented using the stl function of the library stats in the R statistical software environment. To execute the stl function, six parameters are to be determined in advance:</p><p>(1) the number of observations n p in each cycle, (2) the number of iterations of the inner loop n i , (3) the number of iterations of the outer loop n o , (4) the smoothing parameter n s used for obtaining the seasonal component in Step 2 , (5) the smoothing parameter n l used for the low-pass filter in Step 3 , and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) the smoothing parameter n t used for obtaining the trend component in Step 6 . As such, six parameters in STL should be defined in advance. By doing so, the parameters in STL are determined according to the recommendations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref> as follows: n p = 12 , n i = 1 , n o = 6 , n s = 12 , n l = 13 , and n t = 21 .</p><p>ELM is implemented using the ELM package<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">4</ref> in the MATLAB computing environment. The number of input nodes is determined by the input selection using the filter method with partial mutual information. Specifically, the maximum embedding order d is set to 24 here. The number of output nodes is set as one, as the iterated strategy is used for implementing the multi-step-ahead forecasting. A logistic sigmoid function is selected as the activation function. As discussed in Section 3.2 , ELM randomly determines the input weights and hidden biases, which do not require any tuning in the following training process. Thus, once these parameters are randomly generated in advance, the number of hidden nodes is determined in a trial-error fashion. We thereby construct twelve ELM models with various numbers of hidden nodes (varying from 4 to 15). Each ELM model is trained repeatedly 30 times on the estimation samples, and then, the average MSE of each ELM is calculated on the holdout sample. The ELM that yields the smallest average MSE value is selected as the best model. By doing so, the optimal number of hidden nodes in STL-ELM and pure ELM for five vegetable prices are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> .</p><p>As discussed in Section 1.2, SARIMA, TDNN, SVR, ELM, and SARIMA-Kalman filter are selected as the benchmarks for the purpose of comparison. This subsection presents the implementation of these benchmarks in detail following two aspects, the software or program packages involved and parameter selection. The implementation of ELM, which is already presented above, is not repeated here.</p><p>(1) SARIMA: A vegetable price series X t is SARIMA ( p, d, q ) √ó ( P, D, Q ) S process with seasonal period length S if d and D are nonnegative integers and if the differenced series</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">W t ( 1 -B ) d ( 1 -B S ) D X t</formula><p>is an ARIMA process, where B is the backshift operator defined by B a W t = W t-a . In view of the strong seasonal pattern observed in five vegetable prices series, SARIMA is used as a benchmark here. The SARIMA is estimated using an automatic model selection algorithm implemented using the program package "forecast"<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">5</ref> in the R statistical software environment. The optimal SARIMA models parameters for five vegetables prices are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> .</p><p>(2) TDNN: To perform time series forecasting, the short-term memory existed in time series itself is required to make neural network dynamic. One simple way of building short-memory into the neural network is through the use of time delay. As such, the time delay neural network (TDNN) with one hidden layer used in this study is the commonly-used feed-forward neural network where lagged observations of the time series are used as the inputs in the input layer. Specifically, the number of input nodes which are lagged observations is determined using filter method with partial mutual information (maximum embedding order d = 24). The number of output nodes is set to one, and the number of hidden nodes is determined in a trial-error fashion. Similarly to optimization procedure for the number of hidden nodes in ELM presented above, we varied the number of hidden nodes from 4 to 15 with fivefold cross-validation method. The optimal number of input nodes, hidden nodes, and output nodes in TDNN for five vegetable prices are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> . The logistic sigmoid function is also selected as the activation function. Different from the ELM model, the Levenberg and Marquardt Algorithm is used for training the TDNN. The TDNN is implemented using the neural network toolbox in the MATLAB computing environment.</p><p>(3) SVR: The SVR is implemented using LibSVM (version 2.86)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">6</ref> in the MATLAB computing environment. Analogously, the input variables of SVR are also determined by input selection using the filter method with partial mutual information (maximum embedding order d = 24). The widely used radial basis function (RBF) is employed as the kernel function for SVR modeling. The hyper-parameters (i.e., C , …õ , and Œ≥ ) are determined by the wellestablished and straightforward grid search method in a trial-error fashion.</p><p>(4) SARIMA-KF (Kalman filter): Although the SARIMA process is well-suited to capture seasonal pattern existed in vegetable prices, another limitation of the SARIMA is the difficulty of adjusting the model's parameters when new information arrives. By addressing this issue, Kalman filter (KF), proposed by Kalman <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> , has been used successfully by several researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> to tune the parameters of SARIMA or ARIMA model. Therefore, the SARIMA-KF method is also adopted as the benchmark here. For the detail formulation of pure KF and the hybrid SARIMA-KF method, please refer to <ref type="bibr">[21,4 8,4 9]</ref> . In this study, after initializing the state equation and measurement equation for each vegetable price series based on the obtained SARIMA ( p, d, q ) √ó ( P, D, Q ) S model presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> , the KF is used for vegetable price forecasting using a KF recursive step, such the one found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> . The KF is  implemented using toolbox<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">7</ref> in the MATLAB computing environment in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results and discussions</head><p>Using the research design mentioned above, the forecasting experiments for the vegetable price series are conducted. Accordingly, the forecasting performances of all of the examined models are evaluated using the two accuracy measures and the Diebold-Mariano test.</p><p>The decomposition results of the five vegetable price series using STL are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure">5</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref>. It can be seen that each original vegetable price series is decomposed into seasonal, trend, and remainder components using the STL technique. All of the seasonal components of these vegetable price series show a 12-month cycle. In addition, a constant growth trend can be seen in all of the trend components, except for cabbage, where a downward trend can be observed after 2014. After the decomposition, as discussed in Section 3.4 , the ELM coupled with the iterated strategy is used to forecast the extracted trend and remainder components, while a seasonal-na√Øve method is used to forecast the extracted seasonal component, as shown in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">5</ref>) . Finally, the prediction results of   the seasonal, trend, and remainder components are summed to generate an aggregated output.</p><p>The forecasting performances of the six examined models (i.e., STL-ELM, ELM, SARIMA-KF, SVR, TDNN, and SARIMA) across the three prediction horizons (i.e., H = 1, 3, and 6) for SMAPE and MASE are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> . In each row of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> below, the entry with the smallest value is set in boldface.</p><p>From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> , it is clear that the proposed STL-ELM method is the best one for seasonal vegetable price forecasting across all pre- diction horizons (i.e., one-, three-, and six-step-ahead) for the five vegetable price series, relative to the other five competitors listed in this study, though there are a few exceptions. It is conceivable that the reason behind the inferiority of the ELM, TDNN, and SVR relative to STL-ELM is that these three pure techniques cannot model seasonality directly, keeping in line with the works of Zhang and Qi <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and Hong <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> . Therefore, the prior data processing, such as decomposition and seasonal adjustment, is necessary and critical to build a better forecaster <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> , which is implemented as the proposed STL-ELM method in this study.</p><p>In addition, from all of the models examined in this study, the SARIMA is consistently the worst forecasting model for all of the vegetable price series, regardless of the prediction horizons and accuracy measures considered. It is conceivable that the reason behind the inferiority of the SARIMA is that it is a class of typical linear model and thus cannot capture nonlinear patterns hidden in the vegetable prices.</p><p>Apart from the proposed STL-ELM and SARIMA models, which perform the best and worst, respectively, among all of the examined models, other listed models produce some interesting mix results, which are analyzed in terms of short-term ( H = 1), mediumterm ( H = 3), and long-term ( H = 6) forecasting.</p><p>First, regarding short-term ( H = 1) forecasting, the results of the SMAPE and MASE criteria show that STL-ELM performs the best, followed by SARIMA-KF, ELM, TDNN, and SVR. The worst model is the SARIMA model. The SMAPE values for STL-ELM are 3.217, <ref type="bibr">3.231, 3.197, 3.185, and 3.205</ref> for cabbage, pepper, cucumber, green bean, and tomato price forecasting, respectively, which is clearly less than those of the other listed models. In the pure artificial in-telligence (AI) models (i.e., ELM, TDNN, and SVR), it can be seen that ELM performs slightly better than TDNN. One exception occurs in the case of the cabbage price with SMAPE where the TDNN slightly outperforms the ELM. In addition, ELM and TDNN perform better than SVR, though there are a few exceptions.</p><p>Second, with respect to medium-term ( H = 3) forecasting, SARIMA-KF also ranks second after STL-ELM, followed by the SVR, TDNN, ELM, and SARIMA models in terms of SMAPE and MASE. The reason behind the superiority of the SARIMA-KF relative to the four pure models is due to the use of a Kalman filter to handle stochastic uncertainty of the vegetable price <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> . The MASE values of STL-ELM are 0.850, 0.837, 0.847, 0.859, and 0.865 for cabbage, pepper, cucumber, green bean, and tomato price forecasting, respectively, which are the minimum values. In addition, all of the MASE values of SARIMA are close to 1.350, which is the maximum value. Different from the ranking among ELM, SVR, and TDNN for short-term forecasting, SVR is superior to ELM and TDNN in most cases, regardless of the accuracy measures and vegetable price series considered, though there are a few exceptions.</p><p>Third, in the case of long-term ( H = 6) forecasting, some similar observations can be drawn. The proposed STL-ELM method performs better than all of the other competitors for all of the cases, though there are a few exceptions, followed by SARIMA-KF, ELM, SVR and TDNN, almost with a tie, and SARIMA. Three exceptions are observed when considering the cabbage price with MASE and the green bean price with SMAPE, where the ELM slightly outperforms the STL-ELM, and when considering the cucumber price with MASE, where SVR slightly outperforms the STL-ELM. In all cases, the SARIMA invariably delivers the worst performance.   To further evaluate the forecasting performance of the examined forecasting models, the DM statistic is used to test the statistical significance of the listed models. Tables 6-8 report the results of the DM test, where S DM statistics are listed with p -values in brackets for the different models for one-, three-, and six-stepahead forecasting.</p><p>From the results in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_8">8</ref>, we can deduce the following observations. First, generally speaking, the proposed STL-ELM method outperforms the other listed models at a 5% level of statistical significance in all the cases, though there are some exceptions, where the difference between STL-ELM and SARIMA-KF/ELM/SVR/TDNN is not significant. Second, the SARIMA model is inferior to all of the other listed models at a 10% level of statistical significance, with few exceptions. Third, the difference between the SARIMA-KF and ELM is not significant. Fourth, in the three AI models, ELM is not significantly superior to TDNN and SVR, with one exception at a 5% level of statistical significance.</p><p>Overall, from the above analysis of the experimental results obtained in this study, several important conclusions can be drawn as follows. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> The proposed STL-ELM method is generally the bestperforming model, relative to the other competitors listed in this study, for vegetable price forecasting in terms of the SAMPE and MASE criteria. The results of the DM test further illustrate that the proposed STL-ELM method outperforms other competitors at a 5% level of statistical significance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> In terms of the comparison between the STL-ELM and ELM, the STL-ELM is generally the winner. This indicates that seasonal adjustment of the time series using certain decomposition techniques before further forecasting can effectively improve the forecasting performance in the case of vegetable prices. (3) Due to the highly seasonal and nonlinear pattern hidden in the vegetable price series, nonlinear models with seasonal adjustment are more suitable for forecasting time series with seasonal volatility than linear models. (4) The proposed STL-ELM method can be used as a promising solution for seasonal time series forecasting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>Due to the distinct seasonal characteristics of the vegetable prices, this study proposes a novel hybrid model combining STL and ELM for seasonal forecasting of monthly vegetable prices in the Chinese agriculture market. The experimental results obtained show that the proposed STL-ELM method achieves the best prediction performance relative to the listed competitors for short-, medium-, and long-term forecasting. Thus, the proposed STL-ELM method can be used as a promising tool for forecasting vegetable prices with high seasonality.</p><p>In addition to vegetable prices, the proposed STL-ELM method might be applied for other difficult seasonal forecasting tasks in the agriculture market, such as fruit and pork price forecasting. Furthermore, this study restricts attention exclusively to point forecasting; the interval forecasting of vegetable prices is of greater value to practitioners in the agriculture market, which requires further study.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
