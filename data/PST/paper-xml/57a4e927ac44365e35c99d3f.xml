<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The original study of Roman domination was motivated by the defense strategies used to defend the Roman Empire during the reign of Emperor Constantine the Great, 274-337 AD. He decreed that for all cities in the Roman Empire, at most two legions should be stationed. Further, if a location having no legions was attacked, then it must be within the vicinity of at least one city at which two legions were stationed, so that one of the two legions could be sent to defend the attacked city. This part of the history of the Roman Empire gave rise to the mathematical concept of Roman domination, as originally defined and discussed by Stewart <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> in 1999, and ReVelle and Rosing <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> in 2000, and subsequently developed by Cockayne et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> in 2004. Since then about 95 papers have been published on various aspects of Roman domination in graphs, including: (i) Roman domination <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, (ii) independent Roman domination <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and (iii) weak Roman domination <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Let G = (V , E) be a graph having order n = |V | vertices. The open neighborhood of a vertex v ∈ V is the set N(v) = {u|uv ∈ E}, and its closed neighborhood is N <ref type="bibr">[v]</ref> = N(v) ∪ {v}. Vertices u ∈ N(v) are called the neighbors of v.</p><p>A vertex with exactly one neighbor is called a leaf and its neighbor is a support vertex. A support vertex with two or more leaf neighbors is called a strong support vertex. The open neighborhood of a set S ⊆ V is the set N(S) = ∪ v∈S N(v), and the closed neighborhood of a set S is the set N[S] = N(S) ∪ S = ∪ v∈S N <ref type="bibr">[v]</ref>.</p><p>A set S ⊆ V in a graph G is called a dominating set if N[S] = V . The domination number γ (G) equals the minimum cardinality of a dominating set in G, and a dominating set of G with cardinality γ (G) is called a γ -set of G.</p><p>Let f : V → {0, 1, 2} be a function having the property that for every vertex v ∈ V with f (v) = 0, there exists a neighbor u ∈ N(v) with f (u) = 2. Such a function is called a Roman dominating function. The weight of a Roman dominating function is the sum f (V ) =  v∈V f (v). The minimum weight of a Roman dominating function on G is called the Roman domination number of G and is denoted γ R (G). A Roman dominating function on G with weight γ R (G) is called a γ R -function of G.</p><p>As previously mentioned, the original papers on Roman domination were motivated by the defense strategies used to defend the Roman Empire during the reign of Constantine the Great. But over the years after the time of Constantine, the Roman defense budget significantly exceeded spending at home, and outstripped their ability to raise new revenues. Even at their peak, the Romans could not conquer all of Britain, and so they built Hadrian's Wall, as a defense against the tribes to the north of the wall. But after some time, the Romans finally left all of England. And over the centuries they began a slow, but steady retreat from all conquered lands.</p><p>What the Romans badly needed was a more efficient, stronger, yet leaner, defense strategy. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, Henning and Hedetniemi proposed weak Roman domination, which provided a reasonable level of defense at a cheaper cost. A vertex v with f (v) = 0 is said to be undefended with respect to f if it is not adjacent to a vertex w with f (w) &gt; 0. A function f is called a weak Roman dominating function if each vertex v with f (v) = 0 is adjacent to a vertex w with f (w) &gt; 0, such that Recall that with Roman domination, one legion is required to defend any attacked vertex. What we propose is a stronger version of Roman domination that doubles the protection by ensuring that any attack can be defended by at least two legions. In both Roman domination and weak Roman domination at most two Roman legions are deployed at any one location. But as we will see in what follows, the ability to deploy three legions at a given location provides a level of defense that is both stronger and more flexible, at less than the anticipated additional cost.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">the function f ′ = (V ′ 0 , V ′ 1 , V ′ 2 ) defined by f ′ (v) = 1, f ′ (w) = f (w) -1, and f ′ (u) = f (u) for all u ∈ V -{v,</formula><p>A function f : V → {0, 1, 2, 3} is a double Roman dominating function on a graph G if the following conditions are met.</p><p>Let V i denote the set of vertices assigned i by function f .</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(i) If f (v) = 0, then vertex v must have at least two neighbors in V 2 or one neighbor in V 3 . (ii) If f (v) = 1, then vertex v must have at least one neighbor in V 2 ∪ V 3 .</formula><p>The double Roman domination number γ dR (G) equals the minimum weight of a double Roman dominating function on G, and a double Roman dominating function of G with weight γ dR (G) is called a γ dR -function of G.</p><p>One can quickly see a real benefit of double Roman domination. For the star, K 1,n-1 , it is easy to see that γ dR (K 1,n-1 ) = 3 [simply assign the value of 3 to the center vertex of a star]. Note that this is only one more than γ R (K 1,n-1 ) = 2. Thus, we can sometimes double the defense of a graph (defend against each attack with at least two legions) with an added cost of no more than 50% of the cost of defending against each attack with one legion.</p><p>For another example, consider the complete bipartite graph K 2,n-2 , for n ≥ 4, where the Roman domination number is 3 (in a partite set of size two, assign the value 2 to one of the vertices and 1 to the other, and assign 0 to all other vertices). But in order to achieve double Roman domination all you have to do is to increase the value of the vertex assigned 1 to 2. Thus, you can double your defenses with an increase in expenditure of only 33%! That is, the Roman domination number equals 3, while the double Roman domination number is only 4.</p><p>In Section 2, we consider double Roman domination and its relationship to Roman domination, while in Section 3, we present bounds on the double Roman domination number of a graph G in terms its domination number. Finally, in Section 4, for connected graphs G, we determine a sharp upper bound on γ dR (G) in terms of the order of G and characterize the graphs attaining this bound.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Double roman domination and roman domination</head><p>We begin by showing that for any graph G, there exists a γ dR -function of G where no vertex is assigned a 1, that is, V 1 = ∅ for some γ dR -function of G. Proposition 1. In a double Roman dominating function of weight γ dR (G), no vertex needs to be assigned the value 1.</p><p>Proof. Let f be a γ dR -function on a graph G. Suppose that for some v ∈ V , f (v) = 1. This means that there is a vertex u ∈ N(v), such that either f (u) = 2 or f (u) = 3. If f (u) = 3, then we can achieve a double Roman dominating function by reassigning a 0 to v. This results in a function with strictly less weight than f , contradicting that f is a γ dR -function of G. If f (u) = 2, then we can create a double Roman domination function g defined as follows: g(x) = f (x) for all x ̸ ∈ {u, v}, g(v) = 0, and g(u) = 3. This results in a double Roman domination function with weight equal to f . By Proposition 1, for any double Roman dominating function f ′ , there exists a double Roman dominating function f of no greater weight than f ′ for which V 1 = ∅. Henceforth, without loss of generality, in determining the value γ dR (G) for any graph G, we can assume that V 1 = ∅ for all double Roman dominating functions under consideration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposition 2. Let G be a graph and f</head><formula xml:id="formula_2">= (V 0 , V 1 , V 2 ) a γ R -function of G. Then γ dR (G) ≤ 2|V 1 | + 3|V 2 |. Proof. Let G be a graph and f = (V 0 , V 1 , V 2 ) be a γ R -function of G. We define a function g = (V ′ 0 , V ′ 2 , V ′ 3 ) as follows: V ′ 0 = V 0 , V ′ 2 = V 1 , and V ′ 3 = V 2 .</formula><p>Note that under g, every vertex assigned a 0 has a neighbor assigned 3, and no vertex is assigned 1. Hence, g is a double Roman dominating function. Thus, γ dR (G)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">≤ 2|V ′ 2 | + 3|V ′ 3 | = 2|V 1 | + 3|V 2 |, as desired. ) - 3</formula><p>Clearly, the bound of Proposition 2 is sharp, as can be seen with the family of stars G = K 1,n-1 , where γ R (G) = 2 and γ dR (G) = 3. We also note that strict inequality in the bound can be achieved. Consider the subdivided star G = K * 1,k , formed by subdividing each edge of the star K 1,k , for k ≥ 3, exactly once. We note that γ R (G) = k + 2 and γ dR (G) = 2k + 2. To see this, assign 1 to each leaf, 2 to the center, and 0 otherwise for a Roman dominating function f = (V 0 , V 1 , V 2 ); and assign 2 to each leaf, 2 to the center, and 0 otherwise for a double Roman dominating function. It is simple to check that these functions are optimal. Hence, |V 1 | = k and |V 2 | = 1, and so, 2k</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">+ 2 = γ dR (G) &lt; 2|V 1 | + 3|V 2 | = 2k + 3. Corollary 3. For any graph G, γ dR (G) ≤ 2γ R (G) with equality if and only if G = K n . Proof. Among all γ R -functions of G, let f = (V 0 , V 1 , V 2 ) be one that minimizes the number of vertices in V 1 . Since γ R (G) = |V 1 | + 2|V 2 |, by Proposition 2, we have that γ dR (G) ≤ 2|V 1 | + 3|V 2 | = γ R (G) + |V 1 | + |V 2 | ≤ 2γ R (G). If γ dR (G) = 2γ R (G) = 2|V 1 | + 4|V 2 |, then since γ dR (G) ≤ 2|V 1 | + 3|V 2 |, we must have that V 2 = ∅. Hence, V 0 = ∅ must hold, and so V = V 1 .</formula><p>Since |V 1 | is minimized under f , we deduce that no two vertices in G are adjacent, for otherwise, if u and v are adjacent, then the function f ′ which assigns a 0 to u, a 2 to v, and a 1 to every other vertex is a γ R -function of G having a smaller number of vertices assigned 1 than f does. Thus, G = K n .</p><p>From this, the next corollary is immediate.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Corollary 4. If G is a nontrivial, connected graph, and f = (V 0 , V 1 , V 2 ) is a γ R -function of G that maximizes the number of vertices in V 2 , then γ dR (G) ≤ 2γ R (G) -|V 2 |.</formula><p>By Corollary 4, we see that for a connected graph G, double Roman domination does in fact provide double the protection with strictly less than double the cost of a Roman dominating function. For example, let G be a nontrivial graph with γ (G) = 1. Then γ R (G) = 2 and γ dR (G) = 3. On the other hand, using the example of the subdivided star</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">G * = K * 1,k , with k ≥ 3, we see that the γ dR (G) approaches 2γ R (G) for some graphs. Recall that γ R (G * ) = k + 2 and γ dR (G * ) = 2k + 2,</formula><p>and thus, the ratio of</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">γ dR (G * ) to γ R (G * ) is 2k+2</formula><p>k+2 and approaches 2 as k approaches infinity. Next we see that the Roman domination number is strictly smaller than the double Roman domination number.</p></div>

Since V 2 ∪ V 3 dominates G, it follows that V 2 ̸ = ∅. Thus, all vertices are assigned either the value 0 or the value 2, and all vertices in V 0 must have at least two neighbors in V 2 . In this case one vertex in V 2 can be reassigned the value 1 and the resulting function will be a Roman dominating function, that is, γ R (G) &lt; γ dR (G).</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Corollary 6. If f = (V 0 , V 2 , V 3 ) is any γ dR -function of a graph G, then γ R (G) ≤ 2(|V 2 | + |V 3 |) = γ dR (G) -|V 3 |. Corollary 7.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Double roman domination and domination</head><p>We first give some straightforward lower and upper bounds on the double Roman domination number in terms of the domination number.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Proposition 8. For any graph G, 2γ (G) ≤ γ dR (G) ≤ 3γ (G).</formula><p>Proof. For the lower bound, let f = (V 0 , V 2 , V 3 ) be a γ dR -function of a graph G. Let S be a γ (G)-set.

For the upper bound, as we have seen, the family of non-trivial stars K 1,n-1 has γ (K 1,n-1 ) = 1 and γ dR (K 1,n-1 ) = 3. For the lower bound, we also recall that the family of complete bipartite graphs</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">K 2,k , k ≥ 2, has γ (K 2,k ) = 2 and γ dR (K 2,k ) = 4.</formula><p>The 2-domination number γ 2 (G) equals the minimum cardinality of a set S such that every vertex in V -S is adjacent to at least two vertices of S.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Proposition 9. For any graph G, 2γ (G) = γ dR (G) if and only if γ (G) = γ 2 (G). Proof. Let f = (V 0 , V 2 , V 3 ) be a γ dR -function on G. Note that 2γ (G) ≤ 2(|V 2 | + |V 3 |) ≤ 2|V 2 | + 3|V 3 | = γ dR (G). If 2γ (G) = γ dR (G)</formula><p>, then both inequalities must be equalities. The first inequality is an equality if and only if V 2 ∪ V 3 is a minimum dominating set. The second inequality is an equality if and only if V 3 = ∅. This happens if and only if V 2 is a minimum dominating set and (V -V 2 , V 2 , ∅) is a γ dR -function of G. Hence by definition, every vertex in V -V 2 must have at least two neighbors in V 2 . Therefore, γ (G) = γ 2 (G).</p><p>As we have seen both the bounds of Proposition 8 are sharp for bipartite graphs. In particular, the lower bound is sharp for the family of complete bipartite graphs K 2,k for k ≥ 2, and the upper bound is sharp for some trees, namely, stars. However, our next result shows that the lower bound can be improved for trees. The double star S r,s is the tree with exactly two adjacent non-leaf vertices, one of which is adjacent to r leaves and the other to s leaves. For a tree T rooted at a vertex r and a vertex v ̸ = r of T , let T v denote the subtree of T rooted at v, consisting of v and its descendants in T . Further, let T -T v denote the tree rooted at r formed by removing the subtree T v from T . Note that the vertices and edges of T v and the edge from v to its parent in T are removed from T to form T -T v and that T -T v is a tree. Theorem 10. If T is a non-trivial tree, then γ dR (T ) ≥ 2γ (T ) + 1.</p><p>Proof. Let T be a non-trivial tree of order n. We proceed by induction on n. Note that if T is the star K 1,n-1 , then γ (K 1,n-1 ) = 1 and γ dR (K 1,n-1 ) = 3 = 2γ (K 1,n-1 ) + 1. Hence, we may assume that diam(T ) ≥ 3. If diam(T ) = 3, then T is the double star S r,s (where 1 ≤ r ≤ s), and γ (S r,s ) = 2 and γ dR (S r,s ) = 5 when r = 1 and γ dR (S r,s ) = 6 when r ≥ 2. In either case, γ dR (S r,s ) ≥ 2γ (S r,s ) + 1. Hence, we may assume that the diameter of T is at least 4. This implies that n ≥ 5.</p><p>Assume that any tree</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">T ′ with order 2 ≤ n ′ &lt; n has γ dR (T ′ ) ≥ 2γ (T ′ ) + 1.</formula><p>We first show that the result holds if T has a strong support vertex. Assume that T has a strong support vertex z adjacent to a leaf u. Since z has at least two leaf neighbors, if any double Roman dominating function of T assigns a value less than 3 to z, the total weight of assigned to z and its leaf neighbors is at least 4. It follows that any γ dR -function of T will assign a 3 to z and 0 to its leaf neighbors. Consider T ′ = Tu. Since z is a support in T ′ , we have that γ (T ) = γ (T ′ ) and γ dR (T ) ≥ γ dR (T ′ ). Moreover, T ′ is a non-trivial tree, so we can apply our inductive hypothesis showing that γ dR (T ) ≥ γ dR (T ′ ) ≥ 2γ (T ′ ) + 1 = 2γ (T ) + 1. Since the desired result holds for graphs having a strong support vertex, henceforth we may assume that every support vertex is adjacent to exactly one leaf. Among all leaves of T , choose r and v to be two leaves such that the distance between r and v is the diameter of T . We root the tree T at vertex r. Let w be the unique neighbor of v, and x be the parent of w. Note that by our choice of v, every child of w is a leaf of T . Since T has no strong support vertices, it follows that deg(w) = 2.</p><p>We consider two cases based on the degree of x.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Case 1. deg(x) ≥ 3. Let T ′ = T -T w .</formula><p>Let D be a γ -set of T containing all the support vertices of T (this is possible since every leaf or its support must be in any dominating set), and let D ′ denote the restriction of D on T ′ . Now w ∈ D and v ̸ ∈ D. By our choice of v, every child of x is either a leaf or the support of exactly one leaf. In any case, either x or a child of x is in D. Since deg(x) ≥ 3, x is dominated by D ′ . Thus, γ (T ′ ) ≤ |D ′ | = |D| -1 = γ (T ) -1, that is, γ (T ) ≥ γ (T ′ ) + 1. Conversely, any dominating set of T ′ can be extended to a dominating set of T by adding w, so γ (T ) ≤ γ (T ′ ) + 1. Thus, γ (T ) = γ (T ′ ) + 1.</p><p>Among all γ dR -functions of T , let f be one such that the weight of f restricted to T w is minimized. Let f ′ be the restriction of f onto T ′ . We claim that f ′ is a double Roman dominating function of T ′ . Note that f (w) ∈ {0, 3} and f (v) ∈ {0, 2}. Moreover, either f (w) = 3 and f (v) = 0 or f (w) = 0 and f (v) = 2.</p><p>As we have established, every child of x is a leaf or a support of a leaf. If f (x) = 0, then any leaf neighbor of x must be assigned 2 under f , and every support vertex adjacent to x is assigned a 3. If x has two or more support vertices as children, then let g be the function obtained assigning a 2 to x, 0 to each of the children of x that are support vertices, 2 to their leaf neighbors, and f (a) for all vertices in T -T x . If x has three or more support vertices as children, then g is a function with smaller weight than f , contradicting that f is a γ dR -function of T . If exactly two of the children of x are support vertices, then g is a γ dR -function of T with smaller weight restricted to T w than f has, contradicting our choice of f . Thus, if f (x) = 0, we may assume that w is the only child of x that is a support vertex, implying that deg(x) = 3 and x has exactly one leaf neighbor. But then this leaf would be assigned a 2 under f , while f (w) = 3. But the function formed from f by assigning f (v) = 2, f (w) = 0, f (x) = 3, and 0 to the leaf neighbor of x is a γ dR -function of T , where the weight of T w is less than under f . Hence, we may assume that f (x) ≥ 2, that is, f ′ is a double Roman dominating function of T ′ . Hence, γ dR (T ′ ) ≤ γ dR (T ) -2.

Further, since any γ -set of T ′ can be extended to a dominating set of T by adding the vertex w, we have that γ (T ) ≤ γ (T ′ ) + 1. Note that we can choose a dominating set D of T that does not include x, so D -{w} is a dominating set of T ′ .

But then letting g(v) = g(x) = 0, g(w) = g(z) = 3, and g(u) = f (u) for all u ∈ V -{v, x, w, z} yields a γ dR -function of T , where the weight assigned to T x under g is less than the weight under f , a contradiction to our choice of f .

Let r be the number of children of u, other than v, with degree 2 and s be the number of leaf children of u in T ′ .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof.</head><p>Let T be a tree in F . Observe that if H is an induced subgraph of T such that H is isomorphic to P 4 and the leaves of H are leaves of T , then every double Roman dominating function of T assigns a weight of at least 5 to H. By our construction of T , T has n/4 disjoint copies of the induced subgraph P 4 , where the leaves of the P 4 are leaves of T . Hence, γ dR (T ) ≥ 5(n/4) = 5n/4. By Theorem 13, γ dR (T ) = 5n/4.</p><p>To show that every tree T that has γ dR (T ) = 5n/4 is in F , we appeal to our proof of Theorem 13. The proof is by induction on n. Since P 4 ∈ F , and n is a multiple of 4, we may assume that n ≥ 8. From the proof of Theorem 13, there is only one case, namely, a subcase of Case 3, where it is possible to achieve equality. Using the terminology from this proof, we have that T is rooted at a peripheral vertex, the diameter of T is at least 4, and v is a vertex adjacent to a vertex that is maximum distance from the root. Further, u is the parent of v, that is, u is the non-leaf neighbor of v, and let w is a leaf neighbor of v.</p><p>Recall that T ′′ = T -T u . In the case where equality is achieved T u is isomorphic to P 4 and the leaves of T u are leaves of T . Moreover, 5n/4 = γ dR (T ) ≤ γ dR (T ′′ ) + 5 ≤ 5n ′′ /4 + 5 = 5(n -4)/4 + 5 = 5n/4, implying equality throughout. Thus, γ dR (T ′′ ) = 5n ′′ /4, and so, T ′′ ∈ F . Now clearly, T ∈ F , since f (T ′′ , x) = T , where x is the parent of u in T .</p><p>Let H be the family of connected graphs G of order n that can be built from n/4 copies of P 4 by adding a connected subgraph on the set of centers of n 4 P 4 .</p><p>Theorem 16. The family H is precisely the family of connected graphs G for which γ dR (G) = 5n/4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof.</head><p>Let G ∈ H. As in the proof of Theorem 15, we have that γ dR (G) = 5n/4. Now assume that γ dR (G) = 5n/4. Since removing edges cannot decrease γ dR (G), it follows that every spanning tree of G has double Roman domination number 5n/4. Thus, every spanning tree of G is in F . If any edge joins the leaves of a spanning tree, then a double Roman domination function with a smaller weight can be assigned. Hence, G ∈ H.</p></div>
