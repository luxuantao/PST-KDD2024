<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Amplitude-modulation (AM) and frequency-moddation (FM) systems are widely applicable to the modeling and transmission of information in signals. In this paper it is shown that the nonlinear energy-tracking signal operator P (x) = (i)' -xx and its discrete-time counterpart can estimate the AM and FM modulating signals. Specifically, Y can approximately estimate the amplitude envelope of A M signals and the instantaneous frequency of F M signals. Bounds are derived for the approximation errors, which are negligible under general realistic conditions. These results, coupled with the simplicity of I, establish the usefulness of the energy operator for AM and F M signal demodulation. These ideas are then extended to a more general class of signals that are sine waves with a time-varying amplitude and frequency and thus contain both an AM and an F M component; for such signals it is shown that P can approximately track the product of their amplitude envelope and their instantaneous frequency. The theoretical analysis is done for both continuous-and discrete-time signals. I. INTRODUCTION N his extensive work on nonlinear speech modeling, I Teager [14]-[I61 noted the dominance of modulation as a process in the production of speech. He also noted the importance of analyzing speech signals from the point of view of the energy required to generate them. One of the beautifully simple algorithms for signal analysis he devised and used extensively was the following nonlinear energy-tracking operator \k given either in its discrete form qd when operating on discrete-time signals x (n):</p></div>

The reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> proceeds as follows: Consider an undriven linear undamped oscillator consisting of a mass m and a spring of constant k . Its displacement x ( t ) is governed by the motion equation m x + k x = 0, for which the general solution is a cosine x ( t ) = A cos ( w o t + e) with wo = m.</p><p>The instantaneous energy E,, of this undamped oscillator is constant and equal to the sum of its kinetic and potential energy; i.e., m = 2 (AO")* <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> Thus the energy of the linear oscillator is proportional both to the amplitude squared and the frequency squared of the oscillation, a fact noted in <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. Further, Namely, when \k, is applied to the oscillation signal, the output of qc is equal to the energy (per half unit mass) of the source producing the oscillation.</p><p>Kaiser <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> found the following important properties of qc: for any constants A , r , and wo and for any signals The discrete operator also has similar properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>: \kd[Ar" cos (0nn + e)] = A2r2n sin2 (0,) (7) In this paper we apply the operators \k, and \kd to the broad class of amplitude-modulated (AM) and frequencymodulated (FM) signals. (For the fundamentals of AM and FM systems see any book on communications, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[</ref> 131 .) Since we analyze both continuous-and discretetime signals, first the relationship between \k, and \kd is investigated in Section 11. Then, in Section 111, we show how these energy operators can approximately track the envelope of AM signals. In Section IV they are found to be able to approximately estimate the instantaneous frequency of FM signals. For all these results we also provide the magnitude of the approximation errors involved. Section V deals with the generalized case of AM-FM signals, i.e., FM signals with a time-varying amplitude envelope, or equivalently AM signals with a time-varying instantaneous frequency. For such signals we show that the energy operators can approximately track the product of their amplitude envelope and their instantaneous frequency. In Section VI it is shown that various general classes of AM-FM signals yield a nonnegative signal in the output of the energy operators; such a guarantee for the nonnegativity of the energy operators is needed for using them in AM and FM demodulation. In Section VI1 we conclude and outline some extensions and applications of our work.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">q d [x (n)y (n)l = x 2 (n)*'d [ Y + Y ( n P , [x -q,, [x @)I*, [ Y @)I.</formula><p>Given the simplicity of the energy operators and the broad applicability of AM and FM models in signal processing and communications systems, the results derived in this paper are very useful. For example, some results in this paper have been used in the ongoing work of Maragos, Quatieri, and Kaiser [ 5 ] , <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> on speech modeling using an AM-FM model where, inspired by Teager's work, several amplitude/frequency modulation phenomena in time-varying speech resonances are being investigated. In addition, our results in this work have been used by <ref type="bibr">Quatieri et al. [12]</ref> in detecting transient signal signatures corrupted by AM-FM noise. In this paper, however, we do not assume anything about the specific nature or source of the AM or FM signals.</p><p>Throughout the paper we deal with real-valued signals. Finally, although we treat both discrete-and continuoustime signals and operators, our most general results and intuition are derived for and from the continuous-time case.</p><p>11. DISCRETIZING THE CONTINUOUS-TIME OPERATOR By using certain combinations of discretized derivatives we can obtain from 9, an expression closely related to \kd and thus link the two operators.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VU. DISCUSSION</head><p>We have shown that the energy operator 'k, followed by a square root operation, can approximately estimate the envelope of AM signals and the instantaneous frequency of FM signals. In both cases we have found upper bounds for the maximum and mean absolute value of the approximation errors. We have also shown that their magnitudes relative to the corresponding signal values are much smaller than unity under very general conditions for the modulating signals, namely, by assuming that the AM or FM information signals have a bandwidth much smaller than the carrier frequency and/or that they do not vary much in value with respect to the camer. Our results apply to general AM signals both in continuous and discrete time, as well as to general continuous-time FM signals. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Noise</head><p>Throughout all our analysis we assumed that the AM and FM signals are clean, i.e., do not contain noise, Next we provide some preliminary discussion for the case when the signal is corrupted by noise. Kaiser <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> showed that if w(n) is a discrete-time zero-mean white noise sequence, then Of course, the relative magnitude of this high-pass error component with respect to the desired term a2w: is in the order of O ( w : / w : ) . Thus, for small ratios w , / w , &lt;&lt; 1 , the error is already negligible and hence a further low-pass filtering may be an unnecessary computational For FM signals cos [ 4 ( t ) ] , the approximation error when \E tracks the instantaneous frequency term w f (f) is, by (83), E ( t ) = $ ( t ) sin [24(t)]/2. Hence, if wf is the bandwidth of w , ( t ) , the spectrum of the error is approximately concentrated in the interval [2w, -2w,,, -2 9 , 2w, + 2w,, + 2wf], whereas the desired term has highest frequency 2wf. Thus, if the ratio (U,,, + 2 w f ) / w c is smaller than one, then elimination of the error component through low-pass postfiltering is possible, although a very small value of this ratio (which is common in realistic FM systems) guarantees that the error magnitude is negligible compared to the desired term.</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">€{*[x(n) + w ( n ) ] ) = \k[x(n)l + a?,<label>(</label></formula><p>Similar conclusions can be made for the general AM-FM case and for discrete-time signals, as has been experimentally found in [ l 11.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Other Demodulation Approaches</head><p>A standard envelope estimation approach in AM systems [13] consists of passing the AM signal through a memoryless nonlinearity (e.g., a square law), followed by low-pass filtering. In these systems the estimation er-rors are introduced either via the imperfections of the lowpass filter that always has a nonideal cutoff frequency response or via the nonlinearities that may introduce distortions such as higher powers of the envelope. However, the energy operator approach does not require a low-pass filter. Using a low-pass filter at the output of f i may further reduce the approximation error, but it may not be needed since the error is already small if w, &lt;&lt; U,. or K &lt;&lt; I . Similar arguments apply for the FM case.</p><p>Given a real AM-FM signal x ( t ) = a ( t ) cos [ 4 ( t ) ] , an alternative approach to estimate its envelope I a ( t ) I and instantaneous frequency $(f) is to use the Hilbert transform i ( t ) of x ( t ) . The Hilbert transform approach can provide an envelope</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">r ( t ) = Jx'(t) + i 2 ( t )</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>and an instantaneous frequency &amp; t ) , where 6 ( t ) = arctan [ i ( t ) / x ( t ) ] .</head><p>Of course, there will be some error because r ( t ) and 6 ( t ) will generally be different from their counterparts I a ( t ) I and $ ( t ) imposed by the true modulations in x. In [ 111 there is some work reported on comparing the Hilbert transform with the energy operator approach in 171, [8]. Experiments on N-sample discrete AM-FM signals indicate that when the ratio of carrier U,. versus the information signals' bandwidths U , , wr is in the order of O( lo), then the discrete Hilbert transform (implemented via an FIR filter) can give a smaller error but at a computational complexity O ( N 2 ) which is higher than the very low O ( N ) complexity of the energy operator approach. Decreasing the complexity of the Hilbert transform to an O ( N ) by using a shorter impulse response makes its error larger than that of the energy operator. In addition, if the ratio of w,. versus a,, wj is in the order of O( 100) or higher, then the energy operator yields a smaller error than the more complex Hilbert transform approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D . Applications</head><p>In proving that the energy operator can be used for tracking the envelope of AM signals or the instantaneous frequency of FM signals with negligible error we assumed that the carrier frequency w,. is much larger than the bandwidth w, or wfof the AM or FM information signal and that the AM index K or the FM depth w,/w, are much smaller than one. All these assumptions are very realistic and universally used by AM or FM communication systems. For example, commercial AM broadcasting systems use a carrier frequency in the range 15.50, 16001 kHz and the transmitted information is band limited to 5 kHz; hence, in this case the average relative error that * would incur while tracking the envelope would be in the order of w z / w : &lt; lop4. Similarly in commercial FM broadcasting systems the carrier is in the range 188, 1081 MHz, whereas the message bandwidth is 15 kHz, and the maximum frequency deviation does not exceed 75 kHz. This implies that using * to track the instantaneous frequency would incur an average relative error in the order of w n l w l / w ~ &lt; lo-'. Thus both in AM/WC and FM communications systems the energy operator is applicable since it can provide signal demodulation with very small error and can be implemented very simply.</p><p>Another very promising applications area for the results in this paper is the problem of tracking modulations in speech resonances. Motivated by several nonlinear and time-varying phenomena during speech production, we proposed in [ 5 ] , <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> an AM-FM modulation model for speech signals by representing a single speech (formant) resonance as a damped AM-FM signal and the total shorttime speech signal S ( t ) within a pitch period as a sum of such AM-FM signals where K is the number of speech formants, w , , ~ is the center value of the kth formant, w,.~ is its maximum frequency deviation from w&lt;,k, q k ( t ) is the normalized frequency deviation signal, and a , ( f ) = e p u A ' A k ( t ) is its time-varying amplitude that includes an exponential decay and a generally non-constant amplitude signal Ak ( t ). The instantaneous value of the kth formant frequency is ~, , ~( t ) = w , , ~ + w,,,,kqk(r). In contrast to the above AM-FM model, the standard linear time-invariant (within a short-time frame) model for speech implies that each formant has no FM (i.e., w , , ~ = 0) and no AM beyond the exponential damping (i.e., Ah(f) is a constant). In our speech experiments [5]-[SI we have found that the energy operator applied to single speech resonances (extracted via bandpass filtering of speech) is very efficient in tracking modulation patterns with significant amounts of AM and FM . These time-varying instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes extracted from each speech resonance can be used for a variety of applications including speech coding, synthesis and recognition.</p><p>In another application, we have applied the energy operator to detection of weak acoustical events in an interfering AM-FM signal background [ 121. Examples of such interference occur in an underwater environment (e.g., interference from biologics or active sonar) or in environments for mechanical system monitoring (e.g., interference from large rotating machinery). We have developed an AM-FM model for the narrowband background, and to detect acoustic signals in this background we applied the discrete energy operator. When the signal of interest does not satisfy the assumed AM-FM model, the operator's output is shown to produce a large deviation from the slowly-varying modulation components. One interpretation of this deviation is that the operator is performing a nonlinear short-time estimation of the AM-FM background; when the background deviates from the assumed model, the estimation error grows. In essence the energy operator senses the perturbations from the AM-FM background. Preliminary results indicate that this technique can detect short-duration signals in a slowlyvarying AM-FM background. Robustness of the method in noise and the formulation of a "detection statistic" are now being investigated.</p><p>In conclusion, the instantaneous adapting nature of the energy operator and its ability to track amplitude and frequency modulations, as well as its low complexity, makes the energy operator a very useful tool for signal processing and its application to communications, speech analysis, and signal detection.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>x and y q,.[Ae" cos (oat + e)] = A2e2"w; q c [x (OY (01 = x 2 (W,.

We have also analyzed general AM-FM signals a ( [ ) cos (1; w, ( T ) ~T ) , for which we showed that (if the relative approximations errors involved in the AM and FM demodulation are &lt;&lt; l ) Thus the J\k output is the product of two parts: the instantaneous frequency wi ( t ) and the amplitude envelope 1 a ( t ) 1.

Finally, all our results for continuous-time signals can be easily extended to incorporate any multiplicative constant amplitude A # 1 and/or any exponential factor err in the input signal by just multiplying the energy operator's output with A2 e2rt, because 'k,.[Ae"x(f)] = A2e2" *,.[x(t ) ] .
