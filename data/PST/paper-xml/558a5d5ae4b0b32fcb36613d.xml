<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design, Control, and Energetics of an</head><p>Electrically Actuated Legged Robot Pedro Gregorio, Mojtaba Ahmadi, and Martin Buehler, Member, IEEE Abstract-To study the design, control and energetics of autonomous dynamically stable legged machines we have built a planar one-legged robot, the ARL Monopod. Its top running speed of 4.3 km/h (1.2 m/s) makes it the fastest electrically actuated legged robot to date. We adapted Raibert's control laws for the low power electric actuation necessary for autonomous locomotion and performed a detailed energetic analysis of our experiments. A comparison shows that the ARL Monopod with its 125 W average power consumption is more energy efficient than previously built robots.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>L EGGED robots capable of dynamic operation and active balance have the potential for similar mobility, efficiency, and dexterity as their biological counterparts. Such robots would be able to operate in a much larger range of environments and surface conditions than current wheeled and tracked vehicles. Moreover, similar system design and control advances would benefit applications beyond those requiring traditional locomotion, for example dextrous mechanisms for the inspection of power lines, steel trusses, or pipe systems. Once stable and autonomous legged systems are feasible and affordable, there will be no lack of applications. While the Ambulatory Robotics Lab (ARL) Monopod is not yet power-autonomous, its low power and unprecedented efficiency represent important milestones toward that goal.</p><p>Legged robots generally fall into one of two classes; those capable of dynamic operation and those designed for static walking. In static walkers, stability is assured through kinematics by keeping the center of mass of the machine above the polygon formed by the supporting feet <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. As a consequence, these machines have at least four legs (or very large feet) although they are often built with six legs to improve mobility. Static walkers do not balance actively and since dynamics of motion are not considered, speeds are low. Dynamic robots which balance actively require fewer legs and have a greater potential for speed and power efficiency.</p><p>Even though legged robots were proposed a long time ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, experimental research on actively balanced legged robots began with Matsuoka's planar one-legged hopping machine <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> which was sliding on an inclined plane and was thrusted by an electric solenoid. The first walking machine with active balance was built by Miura and Shimoyama <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. It operated with stiff legs, similar to humans on stilts. Our work has been inspired primarily by Raibert <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> who has led the field of dynamically stable legged locomotion during the past 15 years. He built and controlled successfully one-, two-, and four-legged robots. Except for the first one-legged planar hopper, which was pneumatically actuated, his designs use powerful hydraulic actuators and rely on pneumatics for the leg spring only. By effectively eliminating power constraints, he was able to focus on robot design and control issues. This strategy was eminently successful-most of the robots were based on an almost standardized set of parts and controlled by some derivative of the tri-partitioned decoupled control developed for the original one-legged planar hopper. The first application of Raibert's design and control ideas to an electrically actuated robot comes from Papantoniou <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> whose one-legged robot performs the "compliant walk" gait to cope with power limitations. Today, there are many research labs devoted to dynamic locomotion. A broader review of research in legged locomotion can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. In Section II we describe the mechanical design of the ARL Monopod. The two transmission mechanisms (one for the robot's hip and one for the leg) are optimized for electric actuation and are the key to the successful and energy efficient operation of the robot. In Section III, we describe the adaptation of Raibert's controller for our robot and demonstrate its performance with experimental runs. A detailed energetic analysis of our robot's running as well as an efficiency comparison with other land vehicles and other modes of locomotion is provided in Sections IV and V. These results can be used as a basis for further energy improvements. The paper concludes with a discussion of our results and a proposal for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. EXPERIMENTAL HARDWARE</head><p>The success of the ARL Monopod is based on a systems approach, where the mechanical and the controller design are closely coupled and based on our knowledge of the operating regime. In this section we describe the overall mechanical design, and detail the hip transmission design as an example of this systems approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. ARL Monopod</head><p>While the actuation and transmission systems of the ARL Monopod are quite different from Raibert's one-legged robot design <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> the overall size and kinematics are similar: The robot consists of a prismatic leg, which is attached to the body via a revolute hip joint, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>The leg is a linear arrangement of an electric motor, a ballscrew, a spring, and the lower leg. Its purpose is to support a quasipassive vertical oscillation between the body mass and the leg spring via periodic excitation by the leg motor. In contrast to Raibert's design, we have replaced the hydraulic actuator-pneumatic spring combination with an electric motorballscrew-coilspring system. In the process, there are many design parameters that have to be selected properly to be able to transfer sufficient energy into the system during the short stance phase. This process is similar the hip design described below, and can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>The leg connects to the body via a revolute hip joint, which is actuated by a pulley-cable-ball screw-electric motor system. The cables (4) are fixed at one end to the hip pulley (3) which actuates the leg <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. At the other end, the cables run over idlers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> and attach to the ball nut of a high efficiency ball screw <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. The ball screw is actuated by the hip motor (8) through a timing belt <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and pulleys and converts motor torque into an axial force at the ball nut. This ball nut force, in turn, tensions the cables which actuates the hip pulley.</p><p>This overall design satisfies several goals. The body inertia should be high compared to that of the leg in order to minimize the pitching motion of the body in response to leg swinging.</p><p>At the same time, body mass should be kept low to minimize energy consumption for vertical motion. Both requirements are satisfied by a long body whose mass is concentrated at the ends. To generate the 55 Nm hip torque required for forward running from our 1.8 Nm stall torque, 80 W motors, the transmission system provides a 30:1 gear ratio.</p><p>The motion of the robot is constrained to a vertical plane via a low friction "planarizer"-a three degree of freedom prismatic-prismatic-revolute mechanism mounted above a treadmill. This setup facilitates systematic experimentation, while preserving all the complexity of control and energetics in the plane. The control algorithms discussed below together with I/O, signal processing, data logging, safety, etc., executed on a transputer-based real-time control board <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> which issues motor torque commands at a rate of 1 kHz.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Hip Transmission Design</head><p>This section describes our optimization procedure for selecting the parameters of the hip actuation system for two different operating conditions. The first is direct actuation, which is the topic of this paper, and second compliant actuation, where a spring is inserted in the transmission cable for our ongoing research on passive dynamic running <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. We have assumed as a given the electric motor characteristics, and search for the hip pulley radius the ball screw lead , and the hip compliance stiffness</p><p>For direct actuation, is set to a large value equal to the cable stiffness. The design requires that the motor's torque-speed curve not be exceeded while the leg swings during running.</p><p>We simulated the hip transmission dynamics and forced the hip actuator to track a sinusoidal trajectory similar to the expected trajectory for robot running. Results from vertical hopping experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> were used to select the parameters of this sinusoidal trajectory. A frequency of 2 Hz equal to the vertical hopping frequency and an amplitude of 20 corresponding to a running speed of 0.9 m/s were selected. The effects of body pitching were neglected.</p><p>The variables involved in the dynamical equations of the hip actuation system are given in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. Based on the equations of motion of a ball screw where accounts for the combined inertia of the ball screw and ball nut, we obtain the tension in the hip cable Approximating for small angles, the dynamics of the actuated hip are represented as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> Solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where the leg angle follows the sinusoidal path gives the motor torque </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TABLE I TRANSMISSION VARIABLES</head><p>where and are functions of the system design parameters, primarily the lever arm the stiffness and ball screw lead as well as the parameters of the leg trajectory. We can now evaluate the motor's torque requirements as a function of leg speed,</p><p>The peak motor torque, depends on the design parameters in a simple fashion This maximum torque is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> for the direct actuation case with a leg swing amplitude of 20 and frequency of 2 Hz. The maximum hip motor torque, is plotted against the ball screw lead, expressed in mm/rev for three values of pulley radius m m, and m. The next step in the design process is to select the optimal combination of ball screw lead and pulley radius. Unfortunately, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> is only one of many constraints. In addition, the motor characteristics impose a velocity dependent peak torque. Furthermore, ball screws are available only in coarsely discrete leads and lengths and their inertial parameters are only available via lookup tables. The cable tension should be kept small because it affects the overall size and weight of our structures. Since we plan to use elastomeric springs in series with the actuator in the future, the spring stiffness is limited to 5 kN/m due to energy storage limitations. The ball screw travel should be less than 0.1 m to limit the ball screw inertia and mass as well as body length. The design is further complicated by the necessity to meet the constraints for both direct and compliant actuation. The compliant case is facilitated by large pulley radius resulting in smaller torque requirements, but this increasing when combined with the optimum lead, increases motor velocity, acceleration, ball screw travel, and ball screw lead in the direct actuation case.</p><p>The final design parameters of lead mm/rev, pulley radius m, and spring constant N/m satisfy all the constraints concerning pulley radius, ball screw lead, and maximum motor torque and velocity. In addition, this set of parameters minimizes the motor torque-speed requirements for compliant running by matching the natural frequency of the system with the frequency of the vertical oscillations of 2 Hz <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. CONTROL</head><p>The ARL Monopod, like any legged robot, is an intermittent dynamical system, whose equations of motion as well as state space dimensionality change between stance and flight phases. During flight, the system possesses five degrees of freedom and during stance only four. At all times, only two of these degrees of freedom are actuated, namely the hip angle and the leg actuator length.</p><p>Raibert developed a control strategy which decouples the complex coordinated running motion into three separate tasks; hopping height control, forward speed control, and attitude control <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Dynamic coupling effects (which increase with increasing velocity) between the different controllers are treated as perturbations. Hopping height is controlled during stance (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) by thrusting the leg actuator while body attitude is controlled simultaneously by applying hip torques. During flight, the hip actuator controls forward speed by placing the foot in proper location for the next touchdown, while the leg actuator simply retracts to its nominal position. To control our robot, we took Raibert's three part control algorithm and applied some hardware specific modifications. Experimental results with the ARL Monopod demonstrate the effectiveness of these controllers. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Hopping Height Control</head><p>The motors which actuate the leg spring and hip angle behave like ideal "torquers," that is, we can control instantaneous current up to the thermal and operational limits imposed by the motor construction and the drive electronics. Since we operate intermittently we are able to draw the maximum stall torque of 1.8 Nm and utilize the operational regime for short term operation in the first quadrant given by the manufacturer and verified experimentally as First quadrant Second quadrant Third quadrant Fourth quadrant.</p><p>(2)</p><p>The same qualitative limits apply to other motors in this class of fractional horsepower motors. It is therefore evident that the traditional actuator limit of the form is not applicable to this class of electric dc motor which is increasingly common for driving small to medium size robots and mechanisms.</p><p>The controller in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> calls for a fixed position step increment of the leg actuator at each maximum leg spring compression. The ensuing additional leg spring compression injects energy into the system. The vertical oscillation stabilizes around an operating point, where the losses during a complete cycle are balanced by the added energy. The stability of this approach has been investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Since the ground force against the leg actuator at maximum compression is approximately 500 N, a position step is an impractical strategy with low power electric actuators. Instead, we adopted a new open loop controller which specifies a scaled version of the maximum torquespeed curve of our motor (2), with in the first quadrant (stance). This strategy is exactly implementable, applies thrust continuously during the entire stance phase and greatly reduces the required peak power. For our experiments we chose Nm where Nm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Speed Control</head><p>Forward speed is controlled by strategically servoing the toe touchdown position with respect to the hip around the neutral point where is the forward velocity and is the previous stance time <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The resulting controller is where is an empirically tuned gain and is the desired running speed. Since our robot runs on a treadmill, the actual and desired robot velocities, are replaced with the actual and desired robot velocites with respect to the treadmill, , and we add an integral position error term , to keep the robot near the center of the treadmill (3)</p><p>The first planar experiments, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, were performed with zero treadmill speed. This data validates the successful overall system design, comprising the mechanical design of the body and hip actuation as well as the vertical hopping height controller. In addition, good position tracking performance is achieved via (3).</p><p>However, the true utility of this control law is for velocity tracking. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> presents experimental data for robot running on the treadmill. Once the desired vertical hopping height is achieved, the treadmill speed is increased to 1 m/s and then reduced back to zero. The lower curve presents the robot position relative to the treadmill center. The robot stays within 0.15 m of the desired position-a small error compared to the total 26 m distance traversed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Pitch Control</head><p>The hip actuator is used during stance to regulate the pitching motion of the robot body. Raibert used a PD controller to compute the torque of the hip actuator, necessary to keep the robot body steady and horizontal where is the desired hip angle, and are the hip angle and rate, respectively, and is an empirically tuned gain. This  controller remained unchanged for our experiments shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. The lower curve shows the cyclic oscillations of the robot body as the forward speed (upper curve) increases to 1 m/s. Despite the large variation in speed, the pitching oscillation of the robot body is kept within only 2.5 throughout the entire run. Control of body pitch during the stance phase is critical to stable running, since any nonzero pitch velocity will continue during flight and integrate to a potentially irrecoverable pitch error at the subsequent touchdown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. POWER AND ENERGY</head><p>The use of low power electric motors for actuation distinguishes the ARL Monopod from most other dynamically stable legged machines which use hydraulics. This low-power approach to actuation motivates a detailed energetic study of the motion of our robot. How much energy is used for robot locomotion? How is this energy related to running speed? The answers to these questions should provide insights useful to further improving the energetic performance of the robot. Moreover, much of what is learned here about how this particular robot uses energy may be more generally applied  First, we will investigate the mechanical power and energy delivered to the system by the leg and hip motors. This "shaft power" is the mechanical output of the motor, the product of motor torque and shaft speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> and is related to the input electrical power via the combined motor-gear efficiency. Output power is a conventional measure of vehicle performance and can be easily be computed from our available data. In addition, the results and insights are not dependent on any specific type of actuator.</p><p>We integrate (4) to calculate the energy added to the system by each of the motors as <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> where for the stance phase, and for the flight phase. The mean mechanical power delivered during a step can then be computed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> Since the three control algorithms are decoupled (vertical motion and pitch control during stance, foot placement for velocity control during flight), the energetic cost of each control action is available for individual scrutiny. Such an analysis provides valuable insights into where energy is used most effectively and where energy can be saved. Equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) was applied to data obtained during a run with a top speed of 1.2 m/s to generate the energy output values plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> and summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref>. The seven steps shown represent typical data for steady running.</p><p>The leg motor maintains the vertical motion during stance by compressing the leg spring. The energetic cost is given in the top field in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> by the dashed curves, and amounts to a total of 13 J. During flight, the dashed curve in the middle field represents the energy involved in back-driving the leg actuator for the next stance phase. With 12 J, almost as much energy is used here to back-drive the actuator as to maintain the vertical motion! This is due to the large rotational energy stored in the combined inertia of the motor and ball screw at the end of the stance phase. Moreover, the peak power, indicated by the slope of the energy curve, is higher during flight, W compared to W during stance. However, its nominal level is lower-less than 50 Wduring most of the flight phase. Clearly, energy could be saved if a ballscrew with lower inertia could be used, and it would be back-driven slowly to exploit the compressed spring's force for this purpose. The latter strategy would drastically reduce the peak power requirements.</p><p>The hip motor controls the body pitch during stance. The energetic cost is shown by the solid curve in the upper field of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> and accounts for approximately 5 J at 1.2 m/s. During flight, the hip motor controls forward speed via the foot placement algorithm at the lion share of the energetic cost of 20 J! Since there is no compliance in series with the hip motor, it has to provide the entire energy for the leg swing motion. In the process its power output peaks at 400 W, then decreases in the flat region as touchdown approaches. Again, peak power requirements can be reduced considerable by commanding a smooth trajectory, as opposed to the set point from the foot placement algorithm. More importantly, the most drastic energy savings could come from adding a compliance in series with the hip actuator, such that during steady state operation, most of the 20 J expended by the hip actuator could be saved. Since this energetic cost increases with speed, so would the energy savings.</p><p>The mean mechanical power output of both motors was computed using (6) for 13 experimental runs-a total of 1306 steps. The resulting values of mean power are plotted against running speed in the upper field of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> and form the basis for the specific resistance calculation below. Each point in the plot represents a single step while the solid line shows the least squares linear fit to the data. The dashed lines suggest upper and lower bounds for mean power output and enclose 98% of the data points. It is evident from the data that mean power increases with running speed. The reason for this is that the foot placement algorithm increases the leg angle setpoint with increasing running speed and therefore the overall amplitude of leg oscillation. At zero speed, only the hopping height controller is active and accounts for all the power shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>. The increase of mean power from 58 W at zero running speed to m s J/0.4 s 125 W is almost entirely due to the hip motor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SPECIFIC RESISTANCE</head><p>To evaluate the energetic performance of the ARL Monopod, it is interesting to compare it to other machines. A fair measure for comparison should include not only the cost of locomotion in terms of output power but also the mass moved and the velocity attained. Such a measure, the specific resistance was proposed in 1950 by Gabrielli and von Kármán <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. It is defined as the ratio of power output, and the product of maximum speed, and vehicle weight and can be used to compare vehicles regardless of size, speed or configuration. By plotting against speed Gabrielli and von Kármán compared the energetic performance of land, air and sea vehicles as well as biological systems on the same scale. We will be using the more general measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> which allows us to scrutinize the energetics of the ARL Monopod over a whole range of velocities. We can now evaluate its energetic performance from the power output data in the upper field of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>. The resulting specific resistance is presented in the lower field as a function of running speed. Even though the mean power increases with speed, decreases steadily. The decrease of with speed suggests that the robot uses energy more efficiently the faster it runs. This trend can be understood by considering the power used to maintain the vertical motion. This power is an almost speed independent and constant "overhead cost." It exists even at zero speed, where the specific resistance tends toward infinity. As the running speed increases, the power also increases but the change is small compared to the overall power output so that decreases. At 1.2 m/s the leg motor power accounts for half the overall energetic cost and the specific resistance reaches its lowest value of This value can be computed from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">W kg m s m s</formula><p>Values of at lower speeds may be reduced by specifying a lower hopping height, which was kept constant in these experiments to maintain a steady step duration. In order to put the computed specific resistance in perspective, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> shows selected land vehicles on a log-log scale. Some of today's legged machines (static walkers as well as dynamic walkers) appear prominently in the upper left hand corner far from the Gabrielli and von Kármán limiting line (GvK line)-a practical limit to vehicle performance based on 1950 data. Hirose's PV II <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> is a 10 kg quadruped with pantograph legs; Big Muskie <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> is a 12 200 000 kg coal mining dragline; The OSU Hexapod <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is a 130 kg, sixlegged static walker; Papantoniou <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> built a planar electrically actuated monopod which uses a gait termed "compliant walk" to move in the plane with a top speed of 0.3 m/s; The Active Suspension Vehicle (ASV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> was built at Ohio State University after the OSU hexapod. The six-legged ASV is a 2700 kg power autonomous static walker capable of moving over rough terrain and carrying a 230 kg pay load; Hirose's Helios II <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> has four independently articulated and controlled tracks; The 1350 kg hydraulic GE Quadruped <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> was built in 1968 and relied entirely on to control each of its limbs via force reflective teleoperation; Raibert's hydraulic quadruped <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> weighs only 25 kg and is capable of trotting, pacing, and bounding; McGeer's "gravity walker" <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> appears as much as three orders of magnitude below the other legged machines. This unpowered 3.5 kg mechanism walks down an inclined plane driven entirely by gravity. Notwithstanding McGeer's unpowered device, our ARL Monopod with m s currently has the lowest specific resistance among the actively powered (and controlled) legged vehicles surveyed. For a more in-depth discussion and detailed description of the individual robots see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Since legged machines are proposed as an alternative to conventional wheeled vehicles, their performance must be compared against these vehicles. The data includes "offroad vehicles" <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, "1950 Cars" <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and "1994 Cars" from specifications published by selected auto manufacturers. The results range from for a Maclaren F1 down to for a Volkswagen Eurovan Diesel. A complete table of source data for the individual cars is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Although legged machines are studied as an alternative to wheeled systems, it is instructive to compare machine locomotion with human locomotion. The upper and lower curves for walking and running are from Cavagna <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and Margaria <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, respectively. The data for human cycling is from Pugh <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. It is noteworthy that the cycling data for relates more closely to that for cars than for humans. This suggests that the type of motion is more important than the power source in determining the specific resistance and implies that for each type of locomotion there is an optimal performance regardless of the type of prime mover.</p><p>It is important to realize that while we have taken every effort to accumulate the most accurate data possible for each vehicle, the results are still not clear cut. The difficulty arises from the inability of to account for the different methods of computing output power for each type of vehicle. For cars, the quoted maximum power does not usually correspond to operation at maximum speed but rather at maximum acceleration. Some of the other vehicles have short term power storage devices such as a hydraulic accumulator or a flywheel which lower the mean power consumption while supplying peak power requirements. Moreover, conventional vehicles carry their power sources on board while most legged machines do not. There is a great advantage to not having to move the extra mass of a power source at top speed. Also, the additional mass of this power source is not included in the vehicle mass and is not revealed by the value of Many vehicles have parasitic power losses which do not contribute directly to locomotion but drain the available power and increase All these issues conspire to reduce the quantitative analysis portrayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> to something more qualitative. In short, while the values of have been computed from the best available data, does not tell the entire energetic story; one should be wary of drawing sweeping conclusions from the data. Nevertheless, specific resistance remains a standard parameter for comparing energetic performance and is used by many authors to evaluate the performance of legged vehicles.</p><p>To summarize, it is clear that legged vehicles have a long way to go before they successfully compete with conventional off-road vehicles or biological systems on the basis of specific resistance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>Experiments with the ARL Monopod have shown that electric actuation for dynamically stable legged robots is feasible despite severe power limitations. This is possible by approaching the task as a system design problem, where the mechanical design and the controller design are closely coupled. This effort has resulted in the fastest electrically actuated legged robots with the best energetic performance, as measured by specific resistance, among all powered legged machines. Moreover, the energetic performance of the machine can be improved considerably, motivated by our experimental results and energetic analysis. For example, a promising strategy for minimizing energy cost involves implementing passive running with a hip compliance as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and continued in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In this fashion, much of the hip swing motion, which consumes 40% of the total energy at our current top speed, can be provided by the natural oscillation of a spring-mass system. Our work suggests that a focussed effort toward energy minimization will lead to fully autonomous, electrically actuated, dynamically balanced legged robots in the near future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
