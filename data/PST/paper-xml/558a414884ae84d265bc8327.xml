<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>LIND deconvolution is a subject that has raised an B increasing interest during the last decade, and in particular multichannel deconvolution, based on high-order statistics (HOS) [7], [ll], <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>, or second-order statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>.</p><p>In fact, contrary to the scalar case <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, [IO], deviation from Gaussianity is not always necessary for the multichannel problem to be solvable. The drawback of these approaches is that there are always restrictions concerning the noise. It is requested either to be negligible, Gaussian, or isotropic (spatial whiteness) or to have a known spatial covariance. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, a new class of criteria, called contrasts, was proposed that allows the treatment of noisy multichannel observations for the purpose of blind source separation in the presence of N sources. The advantages in using contrasts is that they are valid in presence of noise, regardless of its Gaussian character.</p><p>In addition, as will be pointed out subsequently, some contrasts are asymptotically insensitive to Gaussian noise, contrary to previously described criteria [ 11, [2] that require a prior standardization. In a full-length paper (in preparation), it will also be shown how a particular contrast is able also to handle the case of Gaussian sources. The corresponding numerical algorithms are not given in this paper for reasons of space and are postponed to a full paper.</p></div>

The case where the number of sources is smaller than N can also be addressed in a similar fashion.</p><p>Manuscript received November 9, 1995.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="111.">CONTRAST CRITERIA</head><p>The optimization criteria that we are interested in are inspired by those proposed by Donoho; in his remarkable article <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, he actually gave the definition of trivial filters and contrast functionals in the scalar case, even if they were not so named. In this letter, these definitions and properties are extended to the multichannel case by using the tools devised in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> in the multichannel instantaneous case. Dejinition 3.1: A matrix sequence { A ( k ) } is referred to as trivial if and only if for every index i, there exist a single pair of indexes ( j . k ) such that A X J ( k ) # 0.</p><p>A trivial filter is thus formed of a pure delay affecting each component followed by a permutation. Dejinition 3.2: A function T, mapping the probability density of a process y(i) E 'FLFt.P to a positive real number, denoted .OO 0 1996 IEEE T(y), is said to be a probabilistic discriminating contrast, or contrast in short, over (7'; X), if it meets the three following requirements.</p><p>C l ) Y is scale invariant; that is, T(Ay) = T(y), VJY E ;Ft.

We refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for further justifications.</p><p>Let us now give two examples of contrast functions that can be utilized for the purpose of blind multichannel equalization. Denote the set of invertible filters satisfying condition Fn, n E {l, a}, and 7 ' ' the set of processes stationary up to order T , having at most one null marginal cumulant of order r (at lag zero). In addition, denote C(,),y3 the cumulant of order r of the scalar variable yJ. Then we have the following.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">I is a contrast over ( P r .
