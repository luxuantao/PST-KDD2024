<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Objectives: To conduct a review of reviews on the impacts and costs of telemedicine services. Methods: A review of systematic reviews of telemedicine interventions was conducted. Interventions included all e-health interventions, information and communication technologies for communication in health care, Internet based interventions for diagnosis and treatments, and social care if important part of health care and in collaboration with health care for patients with chronic conditions were considered relevant. Each potentially relevant systematic review was assessed in full text by one member of an external expert team, using a revised check list from EPOC (Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group) to assess quality. Qualitative analysis of the included reviews was informed by principles of realist review.</p><p>Results: In total 1593 titles/abstracts were identified. Following quality assessment, the review included 80 heterogeneous systematic reviews. Twenty-one reviews concluded that telemedicine is effective, 18 found that evidence is promising but incomplete and others that evidence is limited and inconsistent. Emerging themes are the particularly problematic nature of economic analyses of telemedicine, the benefits of telemedicine for patients, and telemedicine as complex and ongoing collaborative achievements in unpredictable processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>The emergence of new topic areas in this dynamic field is notable and reviewers are starting to explore new questions beyond those of clinical and cost-effectiveness.</p><p>Reviewers point to a continuing need for larger studies of telemedicine as controlled interventions, and more focus on patients' perspectives, economic analyses and on telemedicine innovations as complex processes and ongoing collaborative achievements. Formative assessments are emerging as an area of interest.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Previous reviews of telemedicine have concluded that irrefutable evidence regarding the positive impact of telemedicine on clinical outcomes still eludes us. One review <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> of more than 150 articles concluded that potential effectiveness could only be attributed to teleradiology, telepsychiatry, transmission of echocardiographic images and consultations between primary and secondary health providers. Another systematic review <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> that assessed more than 1300 papers making claims about telemedicine outcomes found only 46 publications that actually studied at least some clinical outcomes. A review that analyzed the suitability of telemedicine as an alternative to face-to-face care <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> concluded that establishing systems for patient care using telecommunications technologies is feasible; however, the studies provided inconclusive results regarding clinical benefits and outcomes. A report on peer-reviewed literature for telemedicine services that substituted face-to-face services with ICT-based services at home and in offices or hospitals <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> identified 97 articles that met the inclusion criteria for analysis. The authors concluded that telemedicine is being used even if the use is not supported by high quality evidence. Reviews on cost outcomes have fared similarly. A study focused on cost-effectiveness interventions concluded that there is no good evidence that telemedicine is or is not a cost-effective means for delivering healthcare <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>The quality of studies is a recurrent concern in these reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. There is also a debate about appropriate research methodologies. For example, economic analysis of telemedicine has not yet met accepted standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>; there is a relative lack of exploration of the socio-economic impact of telemedicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>; evidence on factors promoting uptake of telemedicine is lacking <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>; there is relatively undeveloped use, at the time, of qualitative methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>; many studies have not been well-designed <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>; and, considering perceived difficulties of building a robust evidence base for recent innovations, researchers have argued that simulation modelling needs further development <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>The lack of consensus raises questions about the quality of research evidence in terms not only of the data collected and analysed, but also in terms of the approaches to evaluation, that is, the underlying methodologies used, which may not be capable of addressing the questions to which different stakeholders seek answers. Others have noted that evaluation traditions do not sufficiently collaborate to cross borders and that a common language for evaluation is missing <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>This paper reports on research funded under EU SMART 2008/0064, which sought to review the evidence on the effectiveness of telemedicine with particular reference to both outcomes and methodologies for evaluation. This paper focuses mainly on the evidence about effectiveness, and assesses the range of conclusions drawn by reviewers about the effectiveness of telemedicine and the gaps in the evidence base. A companion paper focuses on the methodological issues and recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Objectives</head><p>The objective of the work was to conduct a review of reviews on the impacts and costs of telemedicine services and consider qualitative and quantitative results, with the purpose of synthesizing evidence to date on the effectiveness of telemedicine. The key questions addressed were firstly, how are telemedicine services defined and described in terms of participants, interventions, comparisons and outcome measures; secondly, what are the reported effects of telemedicine: thirdly which methodologies were used to produce knowledge about telemedicine in studies included; fourthly, what are the strengths and weaknesses of these methodologies, including HTA methodologies; and finally what are the knowledge gaps and what methodologies can be recommended for future research? The present paper addresses the first two of these questions, and identifies assessments of the evidence base provided within the reviews and knowledge gaps in terms of outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methods</head><p>An initial search identified systematic reviews of telemedicine published from 1998. A systematic review was defined as an overview with an explicit question and a method section with a clear description of the search strategy and the methods used to produce the systematic review. The review should also report and analyse empirical data. In addition, reviews which described or summarised methods used in assessing telemedicine were included. Because of the large number of reviews retrieved, a decision was taken to include only reviews published from 2005 and onwards in the final review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Inclusion criteria</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">Population/participants</head><p>Systematic reviews on patients and consumers, health professionals and family caregivers, regardless of diagnoses or conditions, were included in the searches for systematic reviews.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">Interventions</head><p>All e-health interventions, information and communication technologies (ICT) for communication in health care, Internet based interventions for diagnosis and treatments, and social care if an important part of health care and in collaboration with health care for patients with chronic conditions were considered relevant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.">Comparisons</head><p>Reviews of studies comparing telemedicine to standard care or to another type of care, as well as reviews of studies comparing different e-health solutions were included.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.4.">Outcomes</head><p>Only reviews reporting relevant outcomes were included, specified as health related outcomes (morbidity, mortality, quality of life, patient' satisfaction), process outcomes (quality of care, professional practice, adherence to recommended practice, professional satisfaction) and costs or resource use. Systematic reviews reporting emerging issues, such as an unexpected finding or important new insights were also included.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.5.">Languages</head><p>No articles were excluded based on language, although the main focus of the project was telemedicine in Europe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Exclusion criteria</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Design</head><p>Reviews considered not systematic, including commentaries and editorials, were excluded. Systematic reviews with major limitations (low quality reviews) according to a revised checklist for systematic reviews from EPOC (Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group) were excluded.</p><p>If the same authors had produced several publications of the same review, the most updated and/or the full report of the review was selected, and other versions excluded. Dissertations, symposium proceedings, and irretrievable documents were excluded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Participants</head><p>Studies with participants considered not relevant for the review, for instance studies on use of ICT on people outside health care were excluded. Animal studies were excluded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Interventions considered not relevant for the review</head><p>Other exclusions were studies on interventions considered not relevant for the review, such as studies on Internet and other ICT media used for information seeking; quality of information on the Internet; Internet based education of students and health professionals, including use of games; medical technology in clinical practice in general, i.e. medical and surgical examinations and treatments based on computer technologies, except when used as remote diagnosis and treatment (telehealth); ordinary use of electronic patient records; use of telephone (including cell phones) only; e-health as only a very limited part of an intervention; use of Internet for surveys and research; online prescriptions; mass media interventions and veterinary medicine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4.">Outcomes</head><p>Articles without relevant outcomes, i.e. not on the list of outcomes specified above under inclusion criteria, were excluded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Information sources</head><p>Literature searches of the following databases: ACM Digital Library (ACM -The Association for Computing Machinery), British Nursing Index, Cochrane library (including Cochrane database of systematic reviews (CDSR), Database of reviews of effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA), CSA, Ovid Medline, Embase, Health Services/Technology Assessment Text (HSTAT), International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA), PsycInfo, Pubmed, Telemedicine Information Exchange (TIE), Web of Science.</p><p>The main search was performed in February 2009, and an updated search was performed in July 2009.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Search</head><p>The search strategies are available on the website: (to be inserted).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Study selection</head><p>Based on the criteria for inclusion and exclusion, AGE and SF independently screened the lists of titles/abstracts identified through searches for systematic reviews. Any discrepancies were solved by discussion with the third member of the team, AB. The potentially relevant systematic reviews were retrieved in full text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Data collection process</head><p>Data collection was carried out online using a data extraction form. Each potentially relevant systematic review was assessed in full text by one member of an expert panel of reviewers. A revised check list from EPOC (Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group) was used to assess the quality of the systematic reviews. The quality domains assessed according to this checklist were methods used to identify, include and critically appraise the studies in the review, methods used to analyse the findings and an overall assessment of the quality of the review. The review team (AGE, AB and SF) subsequently checked review reports for agreement regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.">Data items</head><p>Data on type of participants, interventions and outcomes included in the reviews were collected. Other data items were: geographical coverage of review, time frame of included studies, range of data collection methods used in studies included in the reviews, disciplines/areas covered and methodological traditions included in the review. The reviewers were also asked to indicate emerging issues identified by the authors of the reviews.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.8.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality of systematic reviews and risk of bias in individual studies</head><p>The members of the expert team assessed the quality of the systematic reviews, including questions regarding the degree to which the systematic reviewers had assessed risk of bias in individual studies.</p><p>Systematic reviews with major limitations were excluded. We assessed the methodological quality of studies in the field of telemedicine based on the review authors' assessments of risk of bias in the primary studies they had included.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.9.">Summary measures and synthesis of results</head><p>The authors analysed the data collected by the members of the expert team. Due to the expected heterogeneity of studies, regarding participants, interventions, outcomes and study designs, a quantitative summary measure of the results was not planned. We did a qualitative and narrative summary of the results of the systematic reviews. The results of the literature review were presented and discussed in two workshops intending to validate results. In the first workshop different user groups took part and in the second workshop methodology experts participated. The analysis was inspired by principles of realist review <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, considered appropriate for complex interventions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results</head><p>We identified 1593 records through the searches and excluded 1419 following screening. We retrieved 174 potentially relevant articles in full text. We excluded 94 of these based on the pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. The qualitative synthesis below relate to 73 of the 80 included articles.</p><p>The results of the 80 systematic reviews included are summarised in seven tables in Appendix 1. Tables one through six list populations, interventions, outcomes, results and conclusions for the reviews cited in this paper, according to the headlines presented in the discussion below. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_19">7</ref> list the seven included reviews not cited in this paper.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Telemedicine is effective</head><p>Twenty reviews (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) concluded that telemedicine works and has positive effects. These include therapeutic effects, increased efficiencies in the health services, and technical usability.</p><p>Types of interventions that were found to be therapeutically effective include online psychological interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>; programmes for chronic heart failure that include remote monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>; home telemonitoring of respiratory conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>; web and computer-based smoking cessation programmes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>; telehealth approaches to secondary prevention of coronary heart disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>; telepsychiatry <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>; virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) for anxiety disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>; robot-aided therapy of the proximal upper limb <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>; internet and computer-based cognitive behavioural therapy for the treatment of anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>; home telehealth for diabetes, heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>; and internet based physical activity interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. A review comparing telepsychiatry and face-to-face work <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> found no differences between the two, and suggested that telepsychiatry will increase in use, particularly where it is more practical.</p><p>Interventions that are effective in reducing health service use include vital signs monitoring at home with telephone follow-up by nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>; computerised asthma patient education programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>; and home monitoring of diabetes patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>Technical effectiveness and reliability are reported in respect of remote interpretation of patient data <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>; smart home technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>; and home monitoring of heart failure patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>One review concluded that home based ICT interventions in general give comprehensive positive outcomes for chronic disease management, despite only identifying a small number of heterogeneous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Telemedicine is promising</head><p>Nineteen reviews (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>) were less confident about the effectiveness of telemedicine, suggesting that it is promising, or has potential, but that more research is required before it is possible to draw firm conclusions. In some cases, in which the same conditions and interventions are discussed, these more tentative conclusions must temper those of authors who find conclusive evidence.</p><p>One review <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> for example found internet-delivered CBT to be a 'promising' and 'complementary' development, but did not provide the endorsements that others <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> did for CBT for the more specific conditions of anxiety and depression. Similarly psychotherapy using remote communication technologies was seen as promising <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, but still requiring more evidence.</p><p>Areas in which review authors agreed that telemedicine shows therapeutic promise, but still requires further research, include virtual reality in stroke rehabilitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>; improving symptoms and behaviour associated with and knowledge about specific mental disorders and related conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>; diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref>; weight loss intervention and possibly weight loss maintenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>; and alcohol abuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>.</p><p>Other authors found promise in terms of health service utilisation. One review <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> for example suggested that asynchronous telehealth developments could result in shorter waiting times, fewer unnecessary referrals, high levels of patient and provider satisfaction, and equivalent (or better) diagnostic accuracy. Another <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> found that home telehealth has a positive impact on the use of many health services as well as glycaemic control of patients with diabetes.</p><p>Positive patient experiences were highlighted as promising in relation to home telemonitoring for respiratory conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. There is potential for using Internet/web-based services for cancer patients in rural areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, and telemonitoring can empower patients with chronic conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p><p>Promising impacts on service delivery were identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref> in use of electronic decision support systems and telemedicine consultations promise to support improved delivery of tPA in patients with stroke (a treatment which requires to be administered within 3 h) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. Computer reminders to professionals at the point of care show 'small to modest improvements' in professional behaviour, but studies are heterogeneous and interventions complex, making these difficult to understand <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Evidence is limited and inconsistent</head><p>Twenty-two reviews (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref>) however concluded that the evidence for the effectiveness of telemedicine is still limited and inconsistent, across a wide range of fields.</p><p>In terms of therapeutic effectiveness, there is some limited evidence regarding telemonitoring for heart failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>; despite reviewers suggesting that electronic transfer of selfmonitored results has been found to be feasible and acceptable in diabetes care, they find only weak evidence for improvements in HbA1c or other aspects of diabetes management <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>; others found only weak evidence of benefit relating to informatics applications in asthma care <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>; and no evidence of improvement in clinical outcomes following teleconsultation and video-conferences in diabetes care <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</p><p>Frequently, these reviewers call for further research, notably in the form of RCTs. Examples include calls relating to web-based alcohol cessation interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>; and virtual reality in stroke therapy, despite this being found <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> to be 'potentially exciting and safe'. More work on telemonitoring in heart failure is called for <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>; on e-therapy for mental health problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>; on smart home technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>; and on technological support for carers of people with dementia <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Others <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> underlined that lack of evidence does not imply lack of effectiveness, and that in many cases interventions are simply 'unproven'. Caution is also urged by reviewers <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> who identified small numbers of heterogeneous studies in relation to chronic disease management. One review <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> found it impossible to draw any significant conclusions about the impact of interventions to promote ICT use by health care personnel.</p><p>Several reviewers found that research has been somewhat narrowly focused and suggested further research which takes a broader perspective or a different one. They suggested that telemedicine researchers have not yet asked all the important questions, or conducted research in appropriate ways. For example, in the cases of dermatology, wound care and ophthalmology, it was argued that evaluation has explored ICT-based asynchronous services for efficacy, but outcomes or access issues have not been considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. In a similar vein, although most of the studies of smart homes found technical feasibility, there remain certain topics that require further research, notably, 'technical, ethical, legal, clinical, economical and organisational implications and challenges' <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Others <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, whilst seeing significant potential for teleoncology, especially in rural areas, suggested that local studies may be needed to confirm this. A further contribution to the debates about CBT (see above), found that whilst it appears to be effective for panic disorders, social phobia and depression, its effects on obsessive-compulsive disorder and anxiety and depression combined remain insufficiently clear <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Causal pathways in HbA1c decline in diabetes care remain unclear, and this conclusion can be linked with the variations in programme designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Whilst smoking cessation programmes appear to be effective across a range of studies, nevertheless the mechanisms of action are not well understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>.</p><p>Telemedicine is a dynamic field, and new studies and new systematic reviews are rapidly being published. As telemedicine extends into new clinical areas, it is unsurprising that reviewers give renewed accounts of limited evidence. Some examples of new areas from our review include little research on health promotion provided through the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>; a Cochrane review that found no studies of smart homes that met their inclusion criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>; a review of studies on spiritual care that found little systematic research in this area <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>; and a review concluding that formative evaluation is needed for remote monitoring in hypertension <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Economic analysis</head><p>An important emerging issue from our review is the lack of knowledge and understanding of the costs of telemedicine (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">4</ref>). Several reviewers suggested that telemedicine seemed to be cost-effective, but few draw firm conclusions. One review found that 91% of the studies showed telehomecare to be costeffective, in that it reduced use of hospitals, improved patient compliance, satisfaction and quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. This was the clearest conclusion, with others being much more cautious: telemedicine was found to be cost-effective for chronic disease management, but the authors cautioned that studies were few and heterogeneous <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. A comparison of the costs of telemonitoring and usual care for heart failure patients found that telemonitoring could reduce travel time and hospital admissions, whilst noting that benefits are likely to be realised in the long term <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. Others found home telehealth for chronic conditions to be cost saving, though underlining that studies were generally of low quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. One review found remote interpretation in medical encounters to be more expensive than its alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Other reviewers did not find good evidence about costeffectiveness; the cost-effectiveness of home telecare for older people and people with chronic conditions is uncertain <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>; there is a lack of consistent results regarding costs of synchronous telehealth in primary care <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>; there is little evidence for the economic viability of home respiratory monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>; the cost-effectiveness of IT in diabetes care is undetermined <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>; one review was able to identify only one study of the costs of CBT, with significant weaknesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>, with another finding little evidence in the same area <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>.</p><p>A particular limitation identified in terms of costs concerns the wider social and organisational costs of telemedicine. One review found that a societal perspective on costs has not yet been developed for home telehealth <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> and another highlighted the need to consider not only costs to health services of interventions, but also costs to service users and their social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Is telemedicine good for patients?</head><p>A second emerging issue concerns patient satisfaction with telemedicine, and indications that telemedicine may alter the relationships between patients and health professionals (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">5</ref>).</p><p>One review found that health service users with ICT used in support, education and virtual consultation feel more confident and empowered, with better knowledge and improved health outcomes, as well as experiencing better nurse-patient relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. The reviewers call for more research on the mechanisms for these changes. Generally there is evidence of high patient satisfaction ratings for telerehabilitation, but reviewers argue that more process research, case studies and qualitative studies are needed to improve our understanding of these outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. Interactive health communication applications (IHCAs) for people with chronic disease appear to give benefit in terms of improved support, better knowledge and improved health outcomes, but the authors asked for more larger studies to be conducted <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>.</p><p>Others found no consistent results regarding user experiences, though suggested that access can be improved <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. Alongside development of technologies which aim to benefit patients and citizens as well as professionals, we need research on the impacts of technologies for these groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. An example is that information websites relating to dementia are geared more to carers than to people with dementia themselves, and that the websites do not usually offer personalised information <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.">Asking new questions</head><p>We have already noted the emergence of new topic areas in this dynamic and complex field. The focus on patient benefits however indicates a more basic development, namely that reviewers are starting to explore new questions beyond those of clinical and cost-effectiveness. Our review produced two key examples (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">6</ref>). Firstly, a review that identified gender differences in computer-mediated communications relating to online support groups for people with cancer cautioned that studies are limited and heterogeneous <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. Nevertheless, the authors suggested that this issue needs to be considered by those designing interventions of this kind. This implies a consideration that telemedicine is an ongoing intervention where users influence its development and hence that effectiveness of outcome is a complex collaborative achievement. Secondly, a review focusing on stroke thrombolysis service configurations, their potential impact and ways of recording data to inform which configuration could be most suitable for a particular situation, highlighted the need to consider a wider range of service delivery issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>. Similarly, it was argued that in post-stroke patients, the consideration of caregivers' mental health and high levels of patient satisfaction should be an integral element of studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>. Furthermore, some of the papers included in the review explored issues which can inform the future development of telemedicine, that is, they provide formative assessments. Examples include a review of 104 definitions of telemedicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref> which, in identifying four broad types of definitions, suggested how stakeholder interests can alter perceptions of priorities in telemedicine interventions, such that some may focus on delivering healthcare over a distance and others on the potential of technology per se; and work arguing that clinical and technical guidelines can inform the future development of telemedicine and facilitate evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">Reflections on the methodology of our study</head><p>Our study is a review of systematic reviews. There are some inherent weaknesses in this approach. In general we have to rely on the information in the included reviews. The quality of the reviews may vary; the reviews may have done a poor job in specifying their inclusion and exclusion criteria, the searches may not be comprehensive, the review authors may not have assessed or extracted data from the primary studies adequately, nor analysed and synthesised the findings across the studies properly. But even using high quality reviews, we necessarily lose information and details that we can only find if we go back to the primary studies.</p><p>Although we did a thorough job in developing the search strategy and identified a vast amount of reviews on the effects of telemedicine, we might have missed relevant systematic reviews.</p><p>Some of the included reviews are probably outdated. Studies that are published after the search date in the reviews are not included. Ideally we could have supplemented the review with more recent primary studies not included in the reviews, but we did not have the resources to do this.</p><p>We did not check whether reviews included the same references. Several reviews have studied similar or overlapping topics, and have at least partially included the same studies. It may therefore be that evidence is counted twice, or that different interpretations of effectiveness are given by review authors. We have not analysed the degree to which there are discrepancies in the analyses of similar studies, nor the reasons for different interpretations of the same findings, for instance did we not analyse the heterogeneity of the results among the reviews based on the quality of the reviews.</p><p>The data collection and assessment of each included review was accomplished by one external expert, while two is considered to be optimal in order to reduce risk of bias. We did not train the data extractors, and we did not pilot the data extraction form. The experts were not completely consistent in their judgments. This limitation was partly due to the resources and organisation of the project, in that two workshops were held, intending to validate results. In addition, the review team made a quality check of the reviews by comparing the reported data with information in the full text papers. Any unclear themes were discussed in the team to reach consensus.</p><p>We have limited information regarding effect sizes and the strength of evidence for the outcomes that we have studied.</p><p>We have however demonstrated that it is possible to make such a large overview in quite a short time, involving both methodology and content experts. We have used systematic methods in the literature searches and the assessment of the reviews, and we have excluded reviews of low methodological quality.</p><p>In combining rigorous and systematic methods with a pragmatic approach we have produced a relevant and rich overview of the field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary points "What was already known on this topic"</head><p>• Evidence regarding the effectiveness of telemedicine is patchy and incomplete. • The quality of much of the research conducted is poor.</p><p>"What this study added to our knowledge"</p><p>• The evidence base is accumulating robust knowledge about the effectiveness of telemedicine. • As the field is rapidly evolving however, new knowledge is constantly needed. • Continuing areas of weakness but also of great interest include economic analyses, understandings of patient perspectives, of effectiveness and outcomes as complex and ongoing collaborative achievements, and formative assessments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.">Conclusions</head><p>Despite large number of studies and systematic reviews on the effects of telemedicine, high quality evidence to inform policy decisions on how best to use telemedicine in health care is still lacking. Large studies with rigorous designs are needed to get better evidence on the effects of telemedicine interventions on health, satisfaction with care and costs. As the field is rapidly evolving, different kinds of knowledge are also in demand, e.g. a stronger focus on economic analyses of telemedicine, on patients' perspectives and on the understanding of telemedicine as complex development processes, and effectiveness and outcome as ongoing collaborative achievements. Hence formative assessments are also pointed out as an area of weakness and interest. Home telemonitoring of respiratory conditions results in early identification of deteriorations in patient condition and symptom control. Positive patient attitude and receptiveness of this approach are promising. However, evidence on the magnitude of clinical and structural effects remains preliminary, with variations in study approaches and an absence of robust study designs and formal evaluations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Worldwide Web and computer-based programmes</head><p>Behavioural Twenty-two studies included (RCTs). In a random-effects meta-analysis of all 22 trials, the intervention had a significant effect on smoking cessation. Similar findings were observed in nine trials using a Web-based intervention,(and in 13 trials using a computer-based intervention Subgroup analyses revealed similar findings for different levels of methodological rigor, stand-alone versus supplemental interventions, type of abstinence rates employed, and duration of follow-up period, but not for adolescent populations.</p><p>The meta-analysis of RCTs indicates that there is sufficient clinical evidence to support the use of Web-and computer-based smoking cessation programs for adult smokers.       VR is a potentially exciting and safe tool for stroke rehabilitation but its evidence base is too limited by design and power issues to permit a definitive assessment of its value. Thus, while the findings of this review are generally positive, the level of evidence is still weak to moderate, in terms of research quality. Further study in the form of rigorous controlled studies is warranted.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Not stated Remote monitoring</head><p>Cost/economic, Feasibility/pilot, Health, Organisational Fifty-six papers included. Many of the identified papers on telemonitoring of heartfFailure (HF) patients demonstrate at least some benefit. There is a general trend towards improvement associated with the use of most modalities. However inconsistent evidence between trials for the same modality and difference between modalities make a definitive conclusion difficult. Evidence of benefit from video consultation alone is lacking. The majority of papers reported trials that are non-randomised and many papers had small sample sizes.</p><p>This study reviewed studies conducted in HF telemonitoring, to describe the nature of the modality, the methods and the results. Telemonitoring appeared to be an acceptable method for monitoring HF patients. Controlled, randomized studies directly comparing different modalities and evaluating their success and feasibility when used as routine clinical care are now required.  There is limited scientific evidence indicating that computer-based CBT has favourable, short-term effects on symptoms in the treatment of panic disorder, social phobia, and depression. The scientific evidence is insufficient to assess the effects of treatment on obsessive-compulsive disorder and mixed anxiety/depression. The scientific evidence is insufficient to assess the cost-effectiveness of the method.       Although it is difficult to draw conclusions from this small sample of studies, the trend suggests that in post-stroke patients, telehealth led to improvements in caregivers' mental health and high levels of patient satisfaction. There was minimal evidence regarding the impact on resource utilization. The review concludes that telepsychiatry should be implemented in Québec and provides detailed clinical and technical guidelines for implementation. They add that taking into account human and organizational aspects plays a part in ensuring the success of this type of activity; that legal and ethical aspects must also be considered; and that a detailed economic analysis should be carried out prior to any large investment in telepsychiatry. Finally, implementation of psychiatry should be subjected to rigorous downstream assessment in order to improve management and performance. The review concludes that telerehabilitation should be implemented in Québec and provides detailed clinical and technical guidelines for implementation. They add that taking into account human and organizational aspects plays a part in ensuring the success of this type of activity; that legal and ethical aspects must also be considered; and that a detailed economic analysis should be carried out prior to any large investment in telerehabilitation. Finally, implementation of telerehabilitation should be subjected to rigorous downstream assessment in order to improve management and performance.  The widespread use of the term eHealth suggests that it is an important concept, and that there is a tacit understanding of its meaning. This compendium of proposed definitions may improve communication among the many individuals and organizations that use the term. The findings show that the situation is complex and confusing, but that recommendations can be made.</p><p>The study was not considered as an end in itself, but rather the beginning of a continuing process of telehealth evaluation and research in Canada and elsewhere. That is, the ongoing quest for identification of a small number of appropriate outcome indicators (as well as their related outcome measures and outcome tools), their consistent description and their consistent application in future evaluations. This initiative suggests that the importance of evaluation and of consistent use of indicators is understood.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 737 2.
