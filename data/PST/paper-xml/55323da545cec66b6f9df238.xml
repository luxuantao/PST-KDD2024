<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Future fifth generation (5G) cellular networks are being developed to satisfy dramatically increasing data traffic among mobile devices with the emergence of various high-speed multimedia applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the evolution of cellular networks from 1G to 4G from the aspects of implemented key technologies and the most supported applications. A new generation emerges about every 10 years to significantly improve the transmission rate and support more applications. 5G cellular networks are expected to have much higher network capacity and provide multi-gigabits-per-second data rate for each user to support multimedia applications with stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements. For example, uncompressed video streaming requires a mandatory data rate of 1.78/3.56 Gb/s. These newly emerging bandwidth-intensive applications create unprecedented challenges for wireless service providers to overcome a global bandwidth shortage <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication is a very promising solution for future 5G cellular networks. An mmWave communication system has very large bandwidth (multiple gigahertz), which can be translated directly to much higher data rates and overwhelming capacity. Multi-gigabits-per-second transmission at mmWave band has been realized in both indoor (e.g., wireless personal area networks) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and outdoor (e.g., wireless mesh networks) systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The availability of mmWave spectrum and recent advances in RF integrated circuit (RFIC) design motivate industrial interest in leveraging mmWave communication for future 5G cellular networks. MmWave 5G cellular networks are expected to have the main characteristics of highly directional antennas at both wireless devices and base stations, lower link outage probability, extremely high data rate in the widest coverage area, and higher aggregate capacity for many simultaneous users. As a replacement of copper/fiber infrastructure, mmWave mesh networks can be used as a wireless backbone for 5G to provide rapid deployment and mesh-like connectivity.</p><p>Generally, device-to-device (D2D) communications provide the connection between two wireless devices either directly or by hopping. D2D communications can be established via the base stations in traditional cellular networks. Specifically, one wireless device needs to communicate with the base station; then the base station conveys the data to another wireless device directly or via backbone networks. Motivated by the increasingly high-rate local services, such as distributing large files among the wireless devices in the same cell, local D2D communications have recently been studied as an underlay to Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) 4G cellular networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. It can significantly enhance the network capacity by establishing a path between two wireless devices in the same cell without an infrastructure of a base station. In mmWave 5G cellular networks, local D2D communications can be formed to offload cellular communications, thus supporting more simultaneous users. Meanwhile, global D2D communications can be formed with multihop wireless transmissions via base stations between two wireless devices associated with different cells. Taking advantage of mmWave propagation characteristics and the use of directional antennas, a resource sharing scheme supporting non-interfering concurrent links is proposed to share network resources among local D2D communications and global D2D communications.</p><p>In this article, we focus on building D2D communications over mmWave 5G cellular networks. We discuss the mmWave propagation characteristics and the corresponding challenges to enable D2D communications. The future 5G cellular network architecture and MAC structure are described. A resource sharing scheme to allocate time slots to concurrent D2D links to increase network capacity is proposed. We then conclude the article with a summary and a brief discussion of future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MMWAVE D2D COMMUNICATIONS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MMWAVE PROPAGATION</head><p>MmWave communication (with wavelength on the order of millimeters), including the frequency band from 30-300 GHz, has several fundamental propagation features <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. First, the propagation loss is much higher than that in the microwave band (e.g., 28 dB higher at 60 GHz than at 2.4 GHz) since the free space propagation loss is proportional to the square of the carrier frequency. A high-gain directional antenna is favored to compensate for the tremendous propagation loss and reduce the shadowing effect. Second, the short wavelengths of mmWave bands result in difficulties in diffracting around obstacles. Lineof-sight (LOS) transmissions can easily be blocked by the obstacles. Since non-LOS (NLOS) transmissions in mmWave channels suffer from significant attenuation and a shortage of multipaths, link outage can happen if an LOS link is blocked. Third, mmWave signals have difficulties penetrating through solid materials (e.g., at 40 GHz, 178 dB attenuation for brick wall and over 20 dB attenuation for a painted board). The limited penetration capability could confine outdoor mmWave signals to streets and other outdoor structures, although some signal power might reach inside the buildings through glass windows and wood doors. These propagation characteristics lead to challenges to achieve seamless coverage and reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D2D COMMUNICATIONS</head><p>Enabling D2D communications to handle local traffic can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, where D2D connections are used for relaying rather than improving the spectrum utilization efficiency. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the traffic loads of the coexisting cellular and ad hoc networks are considered to be independent. Recently, D2D communications used in 4G cellular networks focus on local D2D connections as an underlay to cellular connections. The local D2D communications can reuse the cellular resources to increase spectral efficiency, which has promoted much work in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>In mmWave 5G cellular networks, two kinds of D2D communications can be enabled: local D2D communications and global D2D communications. Local D2D communications build the path between two wireless devices associated with the same base station, either directly or by relays if the LOS link between them is blocked. They facilitate the discovery of geographically close devices and reduce the communication cost between these devices. Global D2D communications connect two wireless devices associated with different base stations by hopping via the backbone networks. They include device-to-basestation (D2B) communications and base-stationto-base-station (B2B) communications. In contrast with 4G cellular networks where communications between base stations are performed via fiber links, mmWave communication with a highly directional antenna provides wireless connections with high data rate for B2B communications in mmWave 5G cellular networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D2D IN MMWAVE 5G</head><p>As described earlier, D2D communications are expected to be an essential feature of mmWave 5G cellular networks, to improve network capacity and build connections between two wireless devices. Due to the directional antenna and high propagation loss, mmWave communication has relatively low multi-user interference (MUI), which can support simultaneous communications. By allowing multiple concurrent D2D links, the network capacity can be further improved.</p><p>In mmWave 5G cellular networks, D2D communications may face two kinds of potential interference within each cell: interference among different local D2D communications (if there are multiple local D2D communications) and interference between local D2D communications and D2B/B2B communications. Most of the existing works on D2D communications focus on the design of optimized resource sharing algorithms by managing the interferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the performance of frequency reuse among D2D links is analyzed with dynamic data arrival settings to obtain average queue length, mean throughput, average packet delay, and packet dropping probability. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, the system aims to optimize the throughput over the shared resources while fulfilling prioritized cellular service constraints. The performance of the D2D underlay system is evaluated in both a single-cell scenario and the Manhattan grid environment. It considers resource sharing between one cellular connection and one local D2D connection.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, previous works on resource sharing for D2D communications consider the mutual interference of omnidirectional antennas. Taking advantage of high propagation loss and the use of directional antennas, more D2D links can be supported in each cell in mmWave 5G networks to further enhance network capacity and improve spectrum efficiency. A new resource sharing scheme considering directional interference is necessary in mmWave 5G cellular networks to enable multiple D2D communications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NETWORK ARCHITECTURE</head><p>It is expected that the current 4G cellular networks can provide seamless coverage and reliable communications because of the lower frequency band. For smooth and cost-efficient transition from 4G to 5G, 5G cellular networks use the hybrid 4G+mmWave system structure shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> to achieve seamless coverage and high rate in most coverage areas. The management information and low-rate applications (e.g., voice, text, and web browser) are transmitted in 4G networks, while the mmWave bands are available for high-rate multimedia applications.</p><p>The 5G cellular networks consist of 4G base stations, mmWave base stations, and mobile devices. In 4G networks, the whole geographical area is partitioned into cells, each of which is covered by one or more 4G base stations. MmWave transmission/reception is based on high directional antennas, which can greatly reduce the mutual interference between mmWave base stations. It has been proved and demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> that for an outdoor environment, the interference among mmWave concurrent links are negligible, and directional mmWave communication links can be considered as pseudo-wired. Therefore, mmWave base stations do not need to be deployed in cells. In this article, dense mesh networks are adopted for the mmWave backbone with grid topology deployment to provide high rates and aggregate capacity. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, each wireless device has the communication modes of both 4G operation and mmWave operation, and supports fast mode transition between them. Two devices can communicate with each other in the same mode. This article focuses on enabling D2D communications at mmWave band for 5G networks. Therefore, in the following parts of the article, without special indications, the base station refers to the mmWave base station. All wireless devices and mmWave base stations are equipped with electronically steerable directional antennas for mmWave communication. All wireless devices and 4G base stations have omnidirectional antennas for 4G communications. It is assumed that with mmWave beamforming technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, each transmission pair can determine the best transmission/reception beam patterns for data transmission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL</head><p>Several works on directional mmWave MAC for networks with low user mobility (e.g., WLAN or WPAN) have appeared in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. Cross-layer modeling and design approaches are presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> to account for the problems of directionality and blockage. In the proposed MAC protocol, an intermediate node is randomly selected as the relay if the LOS link between the source and the destination is not available. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, an exclusive region (ER)-based resource management scheme is proposed to exploit the spatial reuse, and the optimal ER sizes are derived. The main challenge in mmWave MAC design is how to use the spectrum efficiently to achieve higher capacity considering mmWave propagation features while providing reliable high-rate connections.</p><p>MmWave 5G cellular networks support multimedia applications with stringent QoS requirements. To provide guaranteed performance, time-division multiple access (TDMA) is adopted for mmWave channel access in 5G networks with the superframe shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Each base For each local communication (including local D2D and D2B), the transmitter polls the receiver to check connectivity. Each receiver has to respond within a fixed interval, that is, a poll inter frame space (PIFS), with a poll response message if the connection is not blocked. The absence of a poll response at the receiver indicates the link blockage and triggers multihop transmission to bypass the obstacles by intelligently selecting a relay within the wireless devices under the control of the base station. Relay selection has great impact on its flow throughput and interference to other links operating at the same time. There are many existing schemes to determine relay selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Since the main focus of this article is to enable D2D communications, we simplify the relay selection by ran-domly picking up a node that is close to the direct path of the source and destination with LOS transmissions available to both. The link budget is used to ensure the link reliability over the coverage range. After the transmitter receives the polling response message, it starts to send packets to the receiver. Then the receiver acknowledges the successful packet reception with an ACK message. For transmissions among mmWave base stations, it is assumed that the path can be determined by routing protocol without the involvement of a blocked link in the path.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESOURCE SHARING</head><p>From the above discussions, resource sharing is the essential problem in enabling concurrent D2D communications in mmWave 5G cellular networks. This section presents the resource sharing modes, formulates the general resource sharing problem in directional mmWave 5G networks, and proposes an efficient algorithm to obtain the resource sharing solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESOURCE SHARING MODES</head><p>The local D2D and D2B/B2B links share the resources in mmWave 5G cellular networks. The resource sharing decisions are made by the base station. Generally, there are two resource sharing modes in the network: • Non-orthogonal sharing (NOS) mode: Local D2D links and D2B/B2B links reuse the same resource, causing interference with each other. The base station coordinates the usage of resources (e.g., transmission power and time slot) for both kinds of links. • Orthogonal sharing (OS) mode: Local D2D links use part of the resources while the other resources are allocated to D2B/B2B links. Thus, there is no interference between them, which simplifies the resource sharing.</p><p>Although orthogonal sharing mode can make resource sharing simple, non-orthogonal sharing can result in better resource utilization efficiency with proper sharing schemes. In this article, the non-orthogonal sharing mode is adopted for multiple concurrent links under the control of the base station. The use of directional antenna and high propagation loss can result in relatively lower mutual interference or even no interference by properly selecting the concurrent links formed by geographically distributed wireless devices.</p><p>Some of the existing work on resource sharing of D2D communications consider the scenario of one local D2D and one D2B link to simplify the interference <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Concurrent transmissions are also enabled in WLAN/WPAN networks to exploit spatial reuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr">15]</ref>. These papers consider D2D connections as local communications within the network operated by a network controller. The resource sharing scheme can be either distributively determined by the wireless devices themselves or centrally operated by the base station. As the mmWave 5G cellular networks are centralized in nature, the resource sharing scheme in this article is determined by the base station considering mutual interference among D2B and local D2D connections.  How to share the resources among D2D and D2B/B2B links to achieve optimal system throughput is an important and challenging issue.</p><p>The resource sharing determines a set of active links for each time slot in the superframe. Total data transmitted in the whole superframe is used as the objective function to achieve the best resource sharing while satisfying the transmission requests of each link. A variable X i,j = 0 or 1 indicates if link i is active in the jth time slot. Total data transmitted in the whole superframe can be expressed as the function of |X i,j | L×M with each rate estimated by Shannon capacity formula. M denotes the number of time slots in each superframe, and L is the number of collected transmission requests.</p><p>The above optimization problem is a nonlinear integer programming problem. One possible approach is to relax the integer variables into continuous ones, and use optimization tools to solve the approximated problem. However, the approximated problem is still difficult to solve, since its objective function is not necessarily concave. The complexity of the above problem increases exponentially with the number of concurrent links and number of time slots. In this article, a heuristic resource sharing scheme is proposed to assign a set of active links for each time slot effectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESOURCE SHARING SCHEME DESIGN</head><p>The complexity of achieving the best resource sharing comes from the possible mutual interference of directional antennas. To simplify the problem and obtain an efficient resource sharing scheme, only non-interfering links are allocated to each time slot to share the resources. The concurrent transmission condition is that two links can operate simultaneously without interference if and only if any transmitter is outside the beamwidth of the other receiver or does not direct its beam to the other receiver if it is within the beamwidth of the other receiver. We apply an ideal "flat-top" model for directional antennas, that is, unit gain within the beamwidth and zero gain outside the beamwidth.</p><p>The details of the proposed resource sharing scheme are as follows. By a polling process, if an LOS link is blocked, a relay is selected to build a multihop path. At the beginning of each superframe, all the transmission requests are collected by 4G networks. Transmission requests would be forwarded to mmWave base stations if they require high data rate. The mmWave base station makes the resource sharing decisions for each superframe (i.e., a specific set of active links for each time slot) and sends the decisions to all the involved wireless devices via reliable 4G networks. It is assumed that all the wireless devices and base stations are synchronized.</p><p>Since the concurrent links rely on LOS transmission, and we allow non-interfering links to operate concurrently, the wireless channel can be modeled by the free space Friis transmission equation. The instantaneous transmission rate can be estimated by the Shannon capacity formula. Each transmission request indicates a minimum average throughput to support multimedia applications. Thus, the number of time slots in each superframe for each transmission request can be predetermined. We randomly sort the transmission links in a specific sequence. A transmission request r i from the ith link needs n(i) slots. The base station sequentially checks if the ith link can operate concurrently with all the existing links in the same time slot according to the concurrent transmission condition. Note that two links having the same node cannot operate simultaneously due to the half-duplex constraint of wireless communications. If a link does not interfere with all existing links, this link is set to be active in the current time slot. After traversing all the links, the active link set for the current time slot is obtained. This active link set is used for the following time slots until at least one link's throughput requirement is satisfied. If a link's required number of time slots has been satisfied, it should be set inactive, and it is not necessary to check the concurrent transmission condition of this link in the following time slots. The above procedure is repeated until all the time slots have been traversed. If a link's request is not satisfied in the current superframe, it will be re-sent in the next superframe to share the resources with other links.</p><p>Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> show the performance of the proposed resource sharing scheme. There are 40 transmission requests received in the base station. All the wireless devices are randomly distributed in a 20 m × 20 m square area. The transmission power is 0.1 mW, and the background noise level is 134 dBm/MHz. The antenna beamwidth is 45°f or both mobile devices and mmWave base stations. The performance of the proposed resource sharing scheme is compared to two other schemes, traditional cellular and random selection. The traditional cellular scheme does not have local D2D communications, while the random selection scheme just randomly selects several links to share the resource. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, the proposed resource sharing scheme significantly outperforms the other two schemes in terms of the number of supported flows by effectively exploiting the spatial reuse opportunities. The proposed resource sharing scheme is very useful, especially for a dense network in the urban area. Network capacity for mmWave 5G networks is an essential issue in the deployment of mmWave base stations. This article considers concurrent transmissions to improve local network capacity. The proposed resource sharing scheme uses multihop transmission with relays to deal with link blockage. The blockage model defined in the IEEE 802.11ad channel model document is adopted. In mmWave 5G cellular networks, both the obstacles and the mobility of mobile devices can cause link outage if LOS transmission is blocked. Network connectivity is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> with various numbers of transmission requests in the network. A relaying mechanism can reduce the link outage probability by replacing a blocked link with an alternative path with two links. The relaying mechanism to keep network connectivity is effective for users with low mobility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH</head><p>In this article, we have discussed the suitability of mmWave band for 5G cellular networks. We have also proposed a resource sharing scheme for concurrent D2D communications in mmWave 5G cellular networks that can significantly improve network capacity while keeping network connectivity well. The article should be useful for future research on enabling D2D communications in mmWave 5G cellular networks.</p><p>To achieve high transmission rate and aggregate capacity, mmWave base stations may be densely deployed, especially for urban areas. Thus, mobile users may have to hand off frequently between mmWave base stations. Fast neighbor discovery is required in the handoff procedure for mobile users to find nearby base stations and switch to the base station with better link quality. Although directional antennas offer many advantages on improving spatial reuse and network capacity, there are challenges (e.g., deafness problem) in neighbor discovery. In our future work, we will study neighbor discovery for frequent handoffs with directional antennas in mmWave 5G cellular networks.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
