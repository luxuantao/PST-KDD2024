<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Arrays of identical limit-cycle oscillators have been used to model a wide variety of patternforming systems, such as neural networks, convecting fluids, laser arrays, and coupled biochemical oscillators. These systems are known to exhibit rich collective behavior, from synchrony and traveling waves to spatiotemporal chaos and incoherence. Recently, Kuramoto and his colleagues reported a strange new mode of organization-here called the chimera state-in which coherence and incoherence exist side by side in the same system of oscillators. Such states have never been seen in systems with either local or global coupling; they are apparently peculiar to the intermediate case of nonlocal coupling. Here we give an exact solution for the chimera state, for a one-dimensional ring of phase oscillators coupled nonlocally by a cosine kernel. The analysis reveals that the chimera is born in a continuous bifurcation from a spatially modulated drift state, and dies in a saddle-node collision with an unstable version of itself.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION A. The chimera state</head><p>A fascinating spatiotemporal pattern was reported recently by Kuramoto, Battogtokh and Shima <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. While studying arrays of identical limit-cycle oscillators that are coupled nonlocally, they found that for certain choices of parameters and initial conditions, the array would split into two domains: one composed of coherent, phase-locked oscillators, coexisting with another composed of incoherent, drifting oscillators. The coexistence of locking and drift was robust. It occurred in both one and two spatial dimensions, and for various kinds of oscillators, including the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model, complex Ginzburg-Landau equations, phase oscillators, and an idealized model of biochemical oscillators.</p><p>It's important to appreciate how unexpected this coexistence state was. Nothing like it had ever been seen before, at least not in an array of identical oscillators. Normally, identical oscillators settle into one of a few basic patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. The simplest is synchrony, with all oscillators moving in unison, executing identical motions at all times. Another common pattern is wave propagation, typically in the form of solitary waves in one dimension, spiral waves in two dimensions, and scroll waves in three dimensions. The common feature in these cases is that all the oscillators are locked in frequency, with a fixed phase difference between them. At the opposite end of the spectrum is incoherence, where the phases of all the oscillators drift quasiperiodically with respect to each other, and the system shows no spatial structure whatsoever. And finally, one sometimes sees more complex patterns, including modulated structures, spatiotemporal chaos, intermittency and so on.</p><p>What was so odd about the coexistence state is that two of these patterns (locking and incoherence) were present in the same system, simultaneously. This combination of states couldn't be ascribed to the simplest mechanism of pattern formation-a supercritical instability of the spatially uniform oscillation-because it can occur even if the uniform state is linearly stable, as indeed it was for the parameter values used by Kuramoto and his colleagues. Furthermore, it has nothing to do with the classic partially locked/partially incoherent states that occur in populations of non-identical oscillators with distributed natural frequencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. There, the splitting of the population stems from the inhomogeneity of the oscillators themselves; the desynchronized oscillators are the intrinsically fastest and slowest ones in the tails of the distribution. In contrast, for the system studied by Kuramoto et al., there is no distribution of frequencies. All the oscillators are the same, and yet they still break apart into two groups of utterly different character.</p><p>Because the coexistence state involves two seemingly incompatible forms of dynamical behavior, we will henceforth refer to it as "the chimera state," inspired by the mythological creature composed of a lion's head, a goat's body, and a serpent's tail. Today the word chimera is used more generally to indicate something made up of incongruous parts, or something that seems wildly improbable or fantastical.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1</ref> shows a realization of the chimera state in the simplest setting, a one-dimensional ring of phase oscillators <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. The governing equation is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∂φ ∂t = ω - 1 0 G (x -x ′ ) sin [φ(x, t) -φ(x ′ , t) + α] dx ′<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where φ(x, t) is the phase of the oscillator at position x at time t. The space variable x runs from 0 to 1 with periodic boundary conditions, and should be regarded as an angle on a circle (mod 1). The frequency ω plays no role in the dynamics, in the sense that one can set ω = 0 without loss of generality by redefining φ → φ + ωt, without otherwise changing the form of equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. The kernel G(x -x ′ ) provides nonlocal coupling between the oscillators. It is assumed to be even, non-negative, decreasing with the separation |x-x ′ | along the ring, and normalized to have unit integral. Specifically, Kuramoto and Battogtokh <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> used an exponential kernel G(x -x ′ ) ∝ exp (-κ|x -x ′ |). Then, for parameter values α = 1.457 and κ = 4 and suitable initial conditions (to be discussed in detail in Section III), the system evolves to the chimera state shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1</ref>.</p><p>In this snapshot of the instantaneous phases, two distinct regions are conspicuous. The oscillators near x = 0 (and equivalently, x = 1) are phase-locked. All of them move with the same constant frequency; in a frame rotating at this frequency, they would all look frozen. The smoothness and flatness of the graph of φ(x) in this region indicates that these oscillators are coherent as well, i.e., they are nearly in phase.</p><p>Meanwhile, the scattered oscillators in the middle of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1</ref> are drifting, both with respect to each other and with respect to the locked oscillators. Their motion is strongly nonuniform.</p><p>They slow down when they pass near the locked pack-which is why the dots appear more densely clumped at this phase-and then speed up as they lap it. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Puzzles</head><p>When we first learned about the chimera state by reading Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, we were amazed by it. How could such a thing even be possible?</p><p>In fact, a little thought showed that it was provably impossible in two special cases that had been studied previously:</p><p>• Global coupling: Chimera states can't occur for Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) with G(x) ≡ 1 and any choice of 0 ≤ α &lt; π/2, because a Lyapunov function exists for this case, demonstrating that almost all solutions are attracted to the in-phase oscillation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</p><p>• Sine coupling: If α = 0, corresponding to a pure sine coupling in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>), chimera states are impossible for any even kernel G of any range. This follows because Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) becomes a gradient system in the frame rotating at frequency ω. Hence all attractors must be fixed points, corresponding to phase-locked solutions in the original frame, thus ruling out the possibility of coexisting drift.</p><p>So the coexistence phenomenon must somehow rely on a conspiracy between α = 0 and the non-global nature of the coupling. But how, exactly?</p><p>And for that matter, is the chimera state born as soon as α = 0, or at some value of α bounded away from zero? In dynamical simulations like that shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1</ref>, stable chimera states are observed only when α is close to, but slightly less than, π/2. Does that mean that these states don't exist for smaller α, or is just that their basins of attraction shrink as α decreases?</p><p>Furthermore, what is the genealogy of the chimera state, in the sense of bifurcation theory? Is it born out of the vacuum, as a pair of stable and unstable versions of itself?</p><p>Or does it emerge when some more familiar attractor loses stability? For instance, does it bifurcate off the fully incoherent state, in which oscillators are uniformly scattered and drifting around the circle at every x? That seems unlikely, since the phase pattern shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> looks pretty far from total incoherence; even its drifting oscillators show some clumping in phase. So maybe the chimera state branches off the uniform in-phase state?</p><p>But how can it, given that the in-phase state is linearly stable for all |α| &lt; π 2 ? Motivated by these puzzles, we have tried to understand where the chimera state comes from and to pinpoint the conditions that allow it to exist. A brief report of our findings appeared in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Broader significance</head><p>Aside from the questions it raises, we believe the chimera state is also more broadly significant for nonlinear science, for two reasons.</p><p>First, it exemplifies the surprises that lurk in nonlocally coupled systems. As Kuramoto and his colleagues have pointed out <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, nonlocal coupling is a relatively dark corner of nonlinear science in general, and nonlinear oscillator theory in particular.</p><p>Most previous work on coupled oscillators has focused on local coupling, where the interactions are assumed to be solely between nearest neighbors, or global coupling, where each oscillator interacts equally strongly with all the others. The intermediate case of nonlocal coupling is natural to explore next, and has already revealed some interesting new forms of dynamical behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</p><p>From a more applied perspective, nonlocal coupling is important to investigate because it arises in diverse systems throughout physics, chemistry, and biology. Examples include Josephson junction arrays <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, chemical oscillators <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, epidemiological models of disease spread <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and the neural networks underlying the patterns on mollusc shells <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, localized neural "bump" states <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, and ocular dominance stripes in the visual cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</p><p>Second, the chimera state is by no means an oddity restricted to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>). On the contrary, it was first seen in simulations of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with nonlocal coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, a fundamental model in the study of pattern formation. That equation in turn can be systematically derived from a wide class of reaction-diffusion equations, under particular assumptions on the local kinetics and diffusion strength that render the effective coupling nonlocal <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Under an additional assumption that the coupling is also sufficiently weak (in a precise sense), Shima and Kuramoto <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> show that the original reaction-diffusion system can be further reduced to a phase equation of the universal form</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∂φ ∂t = ω -dr ′ G (r -r ′ ) sin [φ(r) -φ(r ′ ) + α]</formula><p>where r labels the position of the oscillators and the kernel G decays exponentially with distance: G(rr ′ ) ∝ exp (-κ|rr ′ |) . But this is just Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>), if the space is onedimensional. So there is good reason to expect that the coexistence phenomenon will have some generality.</p><p>For example, in two dimensions, the coexistence of locked and drifting oscillators manifests itself as an unprecedented kind of spiral wave: one without a phase singularity at its center <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. Instead, the oscillators in the core are found to be completely desynchronized from each other and from the uniform rotation of the spiral arms. In effect, the core oscillators mimic a phase singularity by being incoherent. A better understanding of the one-dimensional case might shed light on this remarkable new form of pattern formation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SUMMARY OF PRIOR RESULTS</head><p>We begin by reviewing the results of Kuramoto and Battogtokh <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. After uncovering the chimera state in their simulations of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>), they were able to explain much of its structure analytically. Their elegant approach is a generalization of Kuramoto's self-consistency argument for globally coupled oscillators <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</p><p>In this approach, one first transforms (1) by seeking a rotating reference frame in which the dynamics become as simple as possible. Let Ω denote the angular frequency of this rotating frame (to be determined later, in the course of solving the problem), and let θ = φ -Ωt denote the phase of an oscillator relative to this frame. Next, introduce a complex order parameter Re iΘ that depends on space and time:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">R(x, t)e iΘ(x,t) = 1 0 G (x -x ′ ) e iθ(x ′ ,t) dx ′ .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>To see what this order parameter means intuitively, note that the integral on the right hand side of (2) performs a running average of e iθ over a window centered at x, with a width determined by the width of the kernel G. Thus 0 ≤ R(x, r) ≤ 1 can be viewed as a measure of the local phase coherence at x, and Θ(x, t) represents the local average phase. These two average quantities provide macroscopic proxies for the overall state of the continuum of oscillators.</p><p>The real virtue of introducing the order parameter, however, is that we can now rewrite the governing equation (1) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">∂θ ∂t = ω -Ω -R sin [θ -Θ + α] ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>which makes it look as if the oscillators have decoupled, though of course they are still interacting through R and Θ, to which they each contribute through <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. This observation suggests that the problem can be attacked by the self-consistency arguments of mean-field theory, even though it is not globally coupled. Now comes the key step. Suppose we restrict attention to stationary solutions, in which R and Θ depend on space but not on time. Now the equations truly do decouple, in the following sense. One can easily solve for the motion of the oscillator at each x, subject to the assumed time-independent values of R(x) and Θ(x). The oscillators with R(x) ≥ |ω -Ω| asymptotically approach a stable fixed point θ * , defined implicitly by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ω -Ω = R(x) sin [θ * -Θ(x) + α]<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The fact that they approach a fixed point in the rotating frame implies that they are phase-locked at frequency Ω in the original frame. On the other hand, the oscillators with R(x) &lt; |ω -Ω| drift around the phase circle monotonically. To be consistent with the assumed stationarity of the solution, these oscillators must distribute themselves according to an invariant probability density ρ(θ). (To ease the notation here and elsewhere, we have suppressed the dependence on x whenever it's clear from context.) And for the density to be invariant, the probability of finding an oscillator near a given value of θ must be inversely proportional to the velocity there. From (3), this condition becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ρ(θ) = (ω -Ω) 2 -R 2 2π|ω -Ω -R sin(θ -Θ + α)|<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where the normalization constant has been chosen such that π -π ρ(θ)dθ = 1. The resulting motions of both the locked and drifting oscillators must be consistent with the assumed time-independent values for R(x) and Θ(x). To calculate the contribution that the locked oscillators make to the order parameter (2), observe that</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">sin(θ * -Θ + α) = ω -Ω R cos(θ * -Θ + α) = ± R 2 -(ω -Ω) 2 R<label>(6)</label></formula><p>for any fixed point of (3). One can check that the stable fixed point of (3) corresponds to the plus sign in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Hence</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">exp [i(θ * -Θ + α)] = R 2 -(ω -Ω) 2 + i(ω -Ω) R<label>(7)</label></formula><p>which implies that the locked oscillators contribute</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">dx ′ G(x -x ′ ) exp [iθ * (x ′ )] = e -iα dx ′ G(x -x ′ ) exp [iΘ(x ′ )] R 2 -(ω -Ω) 2 + i(ω -Ω) R<label>(8)</label></formula><p>to the order parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Here the integral is taken over the portion of the domain where</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">R(x ′ ) ≥ |ω -Ω|.</formula><p>Next, to calculate the contribution from the drifting oscillators, Kuramoto and Battogtokh <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> replace exp [iθ(x ′ )] in (2) with its statistical average π -π exp(iθ)ρ(θ)dθ. Using (5) and contour integration, they obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">π -π exp(iθ)ρ(θ)dθ = i R ω -Ω -(ω -Ω) 2 -R 2 .</formula><p>Therefore the contribution of the drifting oscillators to the order parameter is</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">dx ′ G(x-x ′ ) π -π exp(iθ)ρ(θ)dθ = ie -iα dx ′ G(x-x ′ ) exp [iΘ(x ′ )] ω -Ω -(ω -Ω) 2 -R 2 (x ′ ) R(x ′ )</formula><p>where now the integral is over the complementary portion of the domain where R(x ′ ) &lt; |ω -Ω|.</p><p>Notice something curious: the integrand on the right hand side of the drifting contribution is exactly the same as that found earlier in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">8</ref>) for the locked contribution; only their domains differ. (This coincidence is not mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.) To see that the two expressions agree, note that</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">R 2 -(ω -Ω) 2 + i(ω -Ω) = i ω -Ω -(ω -Ω) 2 -R 2</formula><p>as long as we choose the branch corresponding to the "+i" square root of a negative number.</p><p>Hence the two contributions can be combined into a single integral, yielding a slightly more compact version of the self-consistency equation derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">R(x) exp [iΘ(x)] = ie -iα 1 0 G(x -x ′ ) exp [iΘ(x ′ )] ω -Ω -(ω -Ω) 2 -R 2 (x ′ ) R(x ′ ) dx ′ .</formula><p>To ease the notation a bit more, let</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">β = π 2 -α ∆ = ω -Ω .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Then the self-consistency equation becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">R(x)e iΘ(x) = e iβ 1 0 G(x -x ′ )e iΘ(x ′ ) ∆ -∆ 2 -R 2 (x ′ ) R(x ′ ) dx ′ .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">10</ref>) is to be solved for three unknowns-the real-valued functions R(x) and Θ(x) and the real number ∆-in terms of the assumed choices of β and the kernel G(x).</p><p>Notice that although ω itself is arbitrary up to a constant, and hence so is Ω, their difference ω-Ω is physically meaningful; it is determined by the condition that the long-term dynamics become stationary in the frame rotating at frequency Ω.</p><p>Initially, we couldn't see how to solve the self-consistency equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">10</ref>) numerically.</p><p>We wrote to Kuramoto for advice, and he described an iterative scheme to determine the functions R(x) and Θ(x), based on initial guesses obtained from the dynamical simulations.</p><p>The idea behind the scheme is that the current estimates of R(x) and Θ(x) can be entered into the right hand side of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, and used to generate the new estimates appearing on the left hand side.</p><p>Still, that leaves open the question of how to determine ∆. We seem to have only two equations (given by the real and imaginary parts of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">10</ref>)) for three unknowns.</p><p>Fortunately, a third equation can be imposed to close the system. Because ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">10</ref>) is left unchanged by any rigid rotation Θ(x) → Θ(x) + Θ 0 , we can specify the value of Θ(x) at any point x we like; this freedom is tantamount to choosing an origin in the rotating frame. A natural choice would be to demand Θ(0) = 0, but as we'll see in Section IV, another choice turns out to be more convenient.</p><p>Kuramoto and Battogtokh <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> confirm that the self-consistency approach works: their results from numerical integration of the dynamical equations (1) match those obtained by solving the self-consistency equation (10) iteratively.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> shows the chimera state along with the graphs of R(x) and Θ(x) for the parameters used in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1</ref>. The curves in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>(b) and 3(c) are periodic and reflection-symmetric.</p><p>In fact, they resemble cosine waves, which made us wonder whether <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> might have a simple closed-form solution, perhaps in some perturbative limit as a parameter tends to zero. To see where such a limit might come into play, we hoped to first replicate the simulations of Kuramoto and Battogtokh <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> and then to explore parameter space more widely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. A FIRST ROUND OF SIMULATIONS</head><p>Unfortunately, we couldn't find the chimera state in our early simulations of Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. No matter how we started the system, it always converged to the in-phase state. In the report that announced the chimera state, Kuramoto <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> does not give precise details of the initial condition he used. He describes it as a "suitable single-humped initial phase pattern" [10, p. 219] which we incorrectly took to mean something like φ(x, 0) = a + b cos x or e -a cos x . Eventually, we asked Kuramoto for help (again!), and he kindly explained what he meant.</p><p>(He also sent us his paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> with Battogtokh, where the description of the initial condition is more explicit.) At each x, a uniform random number φ(x, 0) is chosen within some interval whose width varies with x in a single-humped fashion. Specifically, the width is narrowest near x = 0 (mod 1), meaning that the oscillators are most nearly in phase there, initially. As x increases toward the diametrically opposite point of the domain at x = 1 2 , the phases are scattered progressively over larger and larger regions on the phase circle (meaning the oscillators are placed more and more incoherently there, initially). The effect of this procedure is to give the system a jump-start, by placing it in a partially coherent/partially incoherent state to begin with.</p><p>To be more precise, Kuramoto used a random distribution with a Gaussian envelope: φ(x, 0) = 6 exp -30 x -1 2 2 r(x), where r(x) is a uniform random number on the interval</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">-1 2 ≤ r ≤ 1 2 .</formula><p>For the parameters used in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, this initial condition indeed evolves to the chimera state reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</p><p>Then we ran simulations to see how far this state could be continued by decreasing α, knowing that it would have to disappear or lose stability somewhere before α = 0. To track its fate along the way, we also computed several statistics:</p><p>1. the spatial average of R(x), given by R = 1 0 R(x)dx;</p><p>2. the amplitude of R(x), defined as R amp = R max -R min ;</p><p>3. f drift , the fraction of the spatial domain occupied by drifting oscillators;</p><p>4. the difference ∆ = ω -Ω between the nominal frequency of individual oscillators and their collective frequency when locked; and 5. ∆ max , the largest value of the time-averaged drift velocity relative to the rotating frame. This quantity measures the average speed of the fastest drifting oscillator. From</p><p>(3), it can be calculated as max</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">x |∆(x)| = max x | ∆ 2 -R 2 (x)|</formula><p>, where the maximum is taken only over the drifting oscillators.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> shows how f drift varies when κ is held constant but α is changed smoothly. We generated similar graphs for each of the statistics mentioned above, and all showed a jump to the uniform synchronized state as α decreased below some critical value α c . From these results it appeared that when κ = 4.0, the chimera state ceased to exist somewhere around α c ≈ 1.37. The transition seemed to be discontinuous, which suggested that α c couldn't be calculated by a naive perturbation expansion. If it was to be calculable at all, something more subtle would be required.</p><p>The next step was to investigate how these results vary with κ. Recall that the kernel in (1) is G(x) = C exp(-κ|x|), so 1/κ sets a characteristic length scale. Roughly speaking, it is the distance over which the nonlocal coupling is substantial. So the limit κ → 0 + corresponds to global coupling G(x) ≡ 1. This can also be checked directly, noting that the normalization constant for the exponential kernel on the circle is given by C = κ 2 (1-e -κ/2 ) -1 . Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> shows a rough contour plot of R amp in the (α, κ) parameter plane. Crude as this plot is, its message is still clear. The stable chimera state evidently lives in a wedge in parameter space, bounded on one side by the line α = π 2 and on the other by a curve α = α c (κ) that is nearly a straight line. By its very shape, the picture directs our attention to the corner of the wedge, to the simultaneous limit as α → π 2 from below and κ → 0 from above. Apparently something crucial happens in that corner-the chimera state is born there. And so this is where perturbation theory should be conducted. To check that the wedge of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> was not an artifact of the exponential kernel assumed above, we also calculated the corresponding contour plots for the cosine kernel</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">G(x) = 1 2π (1 + A cos x) ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where 0 ≤ A ≤ 1. Here the spatial domain has been redefined to -π ≤ x ≤ π for convenience, and to bring out its ring geometry and the reflection symmetry of the chimera state. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> confirms that the cosine kernel gives a similar chimera state to that for the exponential kernel used above, while Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> demonstrates that the wedge in parameter space is preserved as well. All that is reassuring, because as it happens, the cosine kernel also has the pleasant property that it allows the self-consistency equation to be solved analytically.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CLUES BASED ON NUMERICS</head><p>Before we plunge into the details of solving equations ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_33">22</ref>) simultaneously, let's pause to remember what we're trying to do.</p><p>We want to understand where the chimera state lives in parameter space and how it bifurcates. Guided by the simulations of Section III, we expect that ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> should have chimera solutions throughout the wedge-shaped region of parameter space shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>.</p><p>Assuming that's true, we hope that these solutions will continue all the way down to the corner (α, A) = ( π 2 , 0), corresponding to (β, A) = (0, 0), where might be able to analyze them with perturbation theory.</p><p>Our strategy, then, is to start by finding one solution to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>, by any means possible, for parameter values anywhere in the wedge. Having found this solution, we can use it as a base point for a numerical continuation method. Then we proceed to dive into the corner, following a straight line through parameter space between the base point and the corner.</p><p>In this way we convert the problem to a one-parameter study of the solutions of ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.</p><p>Sufficiently close to the corner, we expect that the solutions will display some sort of scaling behavior with respect to the parameter. That scaling will then suggest clues about the right ansatz for a subsequent perturbation calculation.</p><p>So first we have to come up with a chimera solution to ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_33">22</ref>). It's not just a matter of plugging the equations into a standard root-finding package. The trouble is that these equations also have other solutions that we're less interested in, and we don't want the numerical root-finding scheme to converge to them instead.</p><p>In particular, the in-phase solution, where all the oscillators are locked at the same phase and none of them are drifting, has a large basin of attraction that competes with that of the chimera state. To see what values of a, c, and ∆ correspond to the in-phase state, note that when φ(x, t) = φ(x ′ , t) for all x and x ′ , Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) implies φ(x, t) = φ 0 + (ω -sin α)t. Hence R = 1 and therefore c = 1 and a = 0. And because Ω = ω -sin α = ω -cos β, we have ∆ = ω -Ω = cos β. Thus (a, c, ∆) in-phase = (0, 1, cos β) .</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">)<label>23</label></formula><p>It's easy to check that this satisfies ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_33">22</ref>) for all values of A and β.</p><p>To reduce the chance that the root-finder will converge onto this in-phase state, we need to concoct an initial guess that's very close to a genuine chimera state. To find one, we numerically integrated Eq.

The frequency difference ∆ was obtained directly from the simulation, by setting ω = 0 and then computing ∆ = ω -Ω = -Ω, where Ω is observable as the collective frequency of the locked oscillators.</p><p>In this way we estimated a = 0.156 -0.072i, c = 0.591, ∆ = 0.720 for the stable chimera state at parameter values A = 0.99, β = 0.081. We fed this starting guess into the Matlab root-finding and numerical continuation program MatCont <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and found rapid convergence to a = 0.162 -0.051i, c = 0.588, ∆ = 0.723. From there, we could continue the solution in either A or β or some combination, as we saw fit.</p><p>This approach enabled us to track the chimera state throughout parameter space, until it disappeared along a critical curve corresponding to the boundary of the wedge shown earlier. The results of this calculation are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>. As expected, the boundary of the region is nearly a straight line, and it extends down to the origin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. PERTURBATION THEORY</head><p>The next step is to look for scaling laws to guide our perturbation calculations.

In our simulations, we only see the upper branch of this curve, suggesting that this corresponds to the stable version of the chimera state. The reciprocal of the critical β 1 is about 4.5, which is the slope of the dashed line shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>, in excellent agreement with the boundary of the wedge found numerically. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Birth and Death of the Chimera State</head><p>Although the parametric dependence of f drift seems to be conveniently expressed with respect to β 1 , that representation conceals a lot. Several dynamically distinct states of the system are invisible because they are all squeezed onto a single point (β 1 , f drift ) = (0, 1), as we'll see below. It's much more revealing to use δ instead of β 1 .</p><p>Therefore, we now examine the system in the set of coordinates shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>, with u plotted vertically and δ horizontally. This picture is a compendium of all the stationary states of the system-the stable and unstable chimera, along with other states that we haven't mentioned yet, which we call uniform drift, modulated drift, and homoclinic locked states. The virtue of this representation is that it allows us to see each bifurcation that occurs as the chimera state comes into existence and later disappears. Beginning at the origin and moving counterclockwise around the kidney-bean shaped cycle, we have:</p><p>1. Homoclinic locked state: u = δ = 0. Here, all the oscillators are locked in phase, and hence frozen in the rotating frame. Accordingly, the average frequency ∆(x) of the oscillators vanishes for all x, as shown in the inset. But one can show that this state is not linearly stable. In fact, the exact, non-perturbative counterpart of this state is the in-phase locked state <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> at the critical parameter value β = 0, where this state undergoes a homoclinic saddle-node bifurcation.</p><p>2. Spatially uniform drift: For u = 0 and small δ &gt; 0, the system has a stationary state in which all the oscillators drift in a way that varies strongly in time but remains uniform in x. The order parameter R(x) is independent of x and close to 1, meaning that the oscillators are nearly in phase for nearly all of the time. An individual oscillator executes a jerky motion around its phase circle, lingering near θ = 0 and then whipping around the rest of the phase circle back to this point. The associated plot of ∆(x) is flat because of the uniformity in x.</p><p>In terms of the perturbative variables used in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>, this state appears on the line u = 0 with δ &gt; 0. Then (31) shows that v = 0 as well; hence a = 0, to O (ǫ 2 ). So <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> implies that R(x) must be real and constant and (18) implies that Θ(x) = 0.</p><p>Equation (29) tells us that such a state is possible only if β 1 = 0, which suggests that one can find an exact, non-perturbative version of the uniform drift state when β = 0.</p><p>Indeed, seeking a solution of the self-consistency equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">12</ref>) with β = 0, Θ(x) = 0, and constant R(x), one finds</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">R 2 = ∆ - √ ∆ 2 -R 2 since the kernel G is normalized.</formula><p>Hence, along this line β = 0, Θ(x) = 0, and R(x</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">) = R = √ 2∆ -1.</formula><p>3. Onset of spatial structure: At the lower right corner of the kidney bean, the function f (u, δ) -u (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>) becomes tangent at the origin, introducing a new branch of solutions with Θ = 0 and β = 0 but with the coherence R varying spatially. This is the birth of spatial structure in the system. It happens for δ = 1 8 . The non-perturbative generalization of this result is ∆ = 2/(2 + A). (See Appendix A.) 4. Modulated drift: Along the first curved branch, all oscillators continue to drift, but now there is spatial structure in the R(x) curve, leading to a modulated pattern of average velocities (see inset). However, the average angle Θ(x) is still identically 0. 5. Chimera birth: At the point where u = δ, the first locked oscillators are born. For the first time, v and β 1 become nonzero (see Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_41">29</ref>),(31)). Until this point, all of the states have been confined to the vertical axis of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>; now we finally we move off the wall. The curve of average velocities ∆(x) touches the x-axis at a single point. Meanwhile, the system develops spatial structure in its average phase: Θ(x) is no longer identically zero. This bifurcation can be shown to occur at δ = 16/(9π 2 ), by evaluating the integral in (30) with u = δ ; also, see Appendix B for an exact calculation of the chimera state at birth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Stable chimera:</head><p>Along the top of the kidney bean, the chimera state is dynamically stable. After its birth from the spatially modulated drift state, it gradually develops an increasing fraction of locked oscillators as we move in the counterclockwise direction. Locked oscillators correspond to the zero part of the ∆(x) curve (they appear motionless because the reference frame was chosen to co-rotate with them). 7. Saddle-node bifurcation: As we continue to move counterclockwise, the value of β 1 grows (along with the fraction of locked oscillators), and reaches its maximum at the point where the stable chimera ceases to exist. The disappearance is a result of a saddle-node bifurcation-a collision with an unstable chimera state-and occurs when about 44% of the system is drifting. 8. Unstable chimera: Along the unstable dashed branch, the fraction of locked oscillators continues to grow. But the value of β 1 now begins to decrease, indicating a movement back towards the wall in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>. The system returns to its original state when all oscillators become locked, with δ = u = β 1 = 0 and R=1.</p><p>Taking a step back, we can see an interesting message of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>. The stable and unstable chimera states are continuously connected though the branches of drifting states, shown in solid red and dotted green lines. If we had used the β 1 representation instead (as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref>), both of these connecting branches would have shrivelled down to a point. The two kinds of chimera states would seem disconnected in a way that they really aren't.</p></div>

That solution also shed light on the bifurcations which create and destroy the chimera.</p><p>In retrospect, it's not surprising that a cosine kernel would make the self-consistency equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> as tractable as possible, because the right hand side of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">10</ref>) is a convolution integral, and trigonometric functions behave nicely under convolution. For this reason, it should be straightforward to extend the calculations to include more harmonics in G. Using the same argument as in Section IV, one can see that the exact solution for the order parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> will have the same number of harmonics as G has. This approach would then give a systematic way to solve the self-consistency equation for any kernel representable as a finite Fourier cosine series. By taking more and more terms, this approach also gives a way to approximate results for any even kernel, as long as it is representable by a Fourier series.</p><p>Unfortunately, the trick of choosing a special kernel may not work as well in two (or three) spatial dimensions. That could limit the applicability to two-dimensional chimeras, such as the novel spiral waves computed numerically in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Nevertheless, the idea of seeking a tractable kernel that can simplify the problem may itself be useful.</p><p>Another caveat is that, despite its usefulness as a mathematical tool, the perturbative approach adopted here does not give a rigorous understanding of the bifurcations in the original problem. One would like to understand the bifurcation scenarios for all values of the coupling parameter A, which essentially measures how far the nonlocal coupling deviates from strictly global coupling. In Appendices A and B, we show two results along these lines.</p><p>One interesting aspect of the perturbative approach is that it draws our attention to the special parameter values A = 0, β = 0 (or equivalently α = π/2). Here the system has global cosine coupling and is known to be completely integrable <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. So in a sense, what we have done in this paper is perturb off this extremely degenerate system, which raises the question of whether other, unforeseen attractors might also lurk nearby, for different choices of initial conditions.</p><p>The surprising nature of the chimera state makes us wonder if it could be created artificially in a laboratory experiment, or possibly even occur naturally in some system.</p><p>As a first attempt to judge whether this might be possible, we tried to integrate the phase equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) with slightly nonuniform frequencies ω i , to mimic the inhomogeneities that would occur in any real system, and to test whether the chimera is an artifact of assuming identical oscillators. We added a uniform random variable r ∈ [-B, B] to the native frequency ω for each oscillator, and we found the chimera state persisted, as long as B was not too large-less than about 4% of ∆ (the frequency difference between the locked oscillators' Ω and the mean natural frequency ω). This estimate should be conservative when compared with a presumably more realistic Gaussian random distribution of ω i .</p><p>There are several possibilities for experimental systems where the distinctive effects of nonlocal coupling, including the chimera state, might be observed. Laser arrays seem to be good candidates. In some cases, such as semiconductor arrays with evanescent coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>, they are governed by equations similar to (1), though these are usually approximated as nearest-neighbor. Likewise, phase equations of this form arise in the description of coupled electronic phase-locked loops, and superconducting arrays of Josephson junctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, an idealized model of biochemical oscillators, coupled by a diffusible substance that they all produce, can give rise to an effectively nonlocal coupling and chimera states; indeed, this was the motivating example that led Kuramoto and his colleagues to their discovery.</p><p>Whether or not the chimera state turns out to experimentally realizable, it is fascinating in its own right, as a strange new mechanism for pattern formation in spatially extended nonlinear systems. Its existence underscores how much still remains to be discovered, even in what would seem to be the simplest possible model of pattern formation: a one-dimensional collection of identical oscillators. requires that the determinant vanish. Setting the determinant equal to zero yields c = 0 or 2(c 2 -1) + A(c 2 + 1) = 0. Plugging in the value of c about which we're linearizing, c = √ 2∆ -1, and solving for ∆ finally gives the bifurcation condition</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">∆ c = 2 A + 2 . (<label>A6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_51">)</formula><p>To compare this with our earlier result from first-order perturbation theory, we express the perturbative variable δ at this critical point by using its definition from <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> above and the property in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. Since ∆ -c = δǫ 2 = δA 2 (ignoring higher order terms), we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">δ = ∆-c A 2 . So δ c = ∆ c -c A 2 = 1 A 2 2 A + 2 -2∆ c -1 = 1 A 2   2 A + 2 - 2 -A 2 + A   = 1 8 - 1 16 A + 5 128 A 2 - 5 256 A 3 + O A 4 ,<label>(A7)</label></formula><p>which agrees with our perturbative prediction that δ c = 1 8 in the limit that A → 0. a = sf 1 (s)</p><formula xml:id="formula_53">A = s f 1 (s) f 2 (s) ∆ = (1 + s)f 1 (s) . (B5)</formula><p>Since A is a control parameter of the original equations (the only free one after β has been chosen to be zero), it is desirable to reparametrize this solution in term of A. To do that, we invert A(s) in (B5) to obtain the following series expansion for s(A), s ∼ 16 9π Notice that this has exactly the form of the ansatz we postulated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, based on numerical experiments. As expected, it satisfies ∆ 1 = c 1 as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> and gives ∆ 2 -c 2 = 16/(9π 2 ).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIG. 1 :FIG. 2 :</head><label>12</label><figDesc>FIG. 1: Phase pattern for a typical chimera state.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX A: ONSET OF SPATIAL STRUCTURE</head><p>We now show that the birth of spatial structure can be calculated non-perturbatively. We have already seen in Section VI B that when β = 0, the system has an exact state of spatially uniform drift with constant coherence R(x) ≡ √ 2∆ -1 and average phase Θ(x) ≡ 0. For this special state, the modulation amplitude a = 0 and the mean level of the coherence</p><p>At the bifurcation that creates spatial variation in the coherence, the real part of a becomes nonzero; at leading order in perturbation theory, this bifurcation takes place at δ = 1 8 . Meanwhile, the imaginary part of a remains zero, which means that Θ(x) ≡ 0 still holds.</p><p>To generalize this result to the non-perturbative case, we seek conditions for a second branch of solutions to bifurcate off the uniform drift state. Since ∆ = (1 + c 2 )/2 for the drift state, we consider a slight perturbation</p><p>where η is a small deviation. Also, since a = 0 for the uniform drift state, we may take a itself as a small deviation.

Hence, the existence of a continuously bifurcating branch</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX B: BIRTH OF THE CHIMERA STATE</head><p>When β = 0, it is possible to calculate the chimera state exactly, at the moment of its birth from a spatially modulated drift state. Recall that all states of pure drift satisfy Θ(x) ≡ 0, and equivalently, that a has zero imaginary part. Hence we can seek solutions of the algebraic self-consistency equations with real values of a and c, for β = 0. At the onset of the chimera, the first locked oscillators are born. As suggested by Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, this occurs when the graph of R(x) intersects the horizontal line R = ∆ tangentially.</p><p>Therefore the bifurcation condition is ∆ = R max = c + a. Plugging this into ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>), and using Θ(x) ≡ 0 and β = 0, we find that the self-consistency equations become</p><p>and</p><p>Note that both of these expressions can be rewritten solely in terms of the ratio a/c, which suggests a neat way to solve them parametrically.</p><p>Set s = a/c and substitute into (B1) above, which becomes</p><p>So we can also write a = sc = sf 1 (s).</p><p>Similarly, the a equation ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) becomes:</p><p>All other quantities of interest can also be expressed in terms of s. For instance, we can now substitute a = sc = sf 1 (s) into (B4) and solve for A(s) = a/f 2 (s) = sf 1 (s)/f 2 (s).</p><p>Likewise, ∆ = c + a = (1 + s)f 1 (s). In summary, the incipient chimera state can be written exactly in parametric form, as follows:</p></div>			</div>
