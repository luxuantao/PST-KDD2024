<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We propose a new notion called hidden attribute-based signature, which is inspired by the recent developments in attribute-based cryptosystem. With this technique, users are able to sign messages with any subset of their attributes issued from an attribute center. In this notion, a signature attests not to the identity of the individual who endorsed a message, but instead to a claim regarding the attributes the underlying signer possesses. Users cannot forge signature with attributes which they have not been issued. Furthermore, signer remains anonymous without the fear of revocation, among all users with the attributes purported in the signature.</p><p>After formalizing the security model, we propose two constructions of hidden attributebased signature from pairings. The first construction supports a large universe of attributes and its security proof relies on the random oracle assumption, which can be removed in the second construction. Both constructions have proven to be secure under the standard computational Diffie-Hellman assumption.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Identity-based cryptosystem is a public key cryptosystem where the public key can be an arbitrary string such as an email address or a registration number, etc. The concept was proposed by Shamir <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> to simplify the key management procedures of the certificate-based public key infrastructures. A private key generator, which is believed to be a highly trusted third party, utilizes his master secret key to issue a private key to every identity who needs the private key of her own. To encrypt a message, the user only needs to know the identity of the receiver. Upon receiving the ciphertext, the receiver can decrypt and get the message with his private key. Fuzzy identity-based encryption (IBE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, as a related notion to identity-based cryptosystem, was proposed by Sahai and Waters. Before decryption, users need to get their attributes from an attribute center. In this system, the user with a private key for attribute identity x can decrypt a ciphertext encrypted with attribute set x 0 if and only if x and x 0 are within a certain distance of each other as judged by some metric. Recently, interest has grown in the attribute-based cryptosystem, which is an important application of fuzzy IBE. With this technique, a message can be encrypted to specified users possessing a certain set of attributes. For example, suppose a message is encrypted to attributes ''University A", ''Faculty", and ''Department of Computer Science" with the policy that any user possessing two of these attributes can decrypt. As a result, three kinds of users can decrypt, i.e., faculty in University A, faculty in department of computer science, or faculty of department of computer science in University A.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Related work 1.2.1. Attribute-based encryption</head><p>Inspired by the significant work of attribute-based encryption <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, many improvements and extensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> were presented in the open literature. Baek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> showed how to shorten the public parameters of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, but the scheme could only be proven to be secure in the random oracle model. Attribute-based encryption can be utilized to realize flexible and scalable access control systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. In order to get fine-grained access control, Goyal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> proposed the notion of key-policy attribute-based encryption. In this system, each private key is associated with a more flexible access structure that specifies which type of ciphertexts the key can decrypt. Instead of determining the decrypting policy in private key, Bethencourt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> formalized the notion of ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption and provided a construction. In ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption, the encryptor can specify an associated access structure such that only the users with attributes that satisfy this access structure can decrypt the ciphertext. Actually, the notion of ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption was first mentioned by Goyal et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Later, Chase <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> proposed a multi-authority attribute-based encryption scheme to reduce trust on attribute authority, where each authority issues only a part of the attributes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.2.">Attribute-based signature</head><p>Recently, there have been several attempts to construct attribute-based signatures. As a similar notion, fuzzy identitybased signature was proposed and formalized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, which allows a user with attribute identity x to sign with part of his attributes. The verifier can check if the signature is signed by some user with these attributes. To achieve the same goal as the fuzzy identity-based signature, the notion of attribute-based signature was given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. However, these kinds of signatures do not take the anonymity of the signer into account. Given the relation between the attribute-based cryptosystem and the identity-based cryptosystem, such kind of signature scheme could be trivial to construct by using the method given by Galindo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Another work on attribute-based signature was <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, in which they presented an attribute signature scheme that achieves signer's privacy. In this signature scheme, the user can generate a signature with a flexible number of attributes issued from the attribute center, while keeping the signer anonymous. However, the security can only be proved in a non-standard hardness assumption and the generic group model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.3.">Attribute-based group signature</head><p>Khader <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> proposed a notion called attribute-based group signature. It allows a verifier to request a signature from a member of a group who possesses certain attributes, and the signature can prove the ownership of certain attributes. When necessary, the identity of the signer could be revealed by a designated manager.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.4.">Hidden identity-based signature</head><p>Another related notion is hidden identity-based signature, which was proposed by Kiayias and Zhou <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. It is similar to group signature which can achieve revocable anonymity for group members, through an opening authority. In hidden identity-based signature, the group membership list is not published and the opening authority is independent of group manager for anonymity revocation, which is different from the ordinary group signature. In our hidden attribute-based signature, the user list is not public. However, in the proposed notion of hidden attribute-based signature, there is no opening authority who can reveal the hidden identity, that is, no anonymity revocation exists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.5.">Ring signature</head><p>Ring signature <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> allows the user to sign messages on behalf of a ''ring" of legitimate signers without revealing the signer's identity. Different from the group signature (for examples, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>), the ring signature has spontaneous group formation, in which there is no group manager to revoke the identity of the signer. Under the assumption that each user is previously associated with a public key, the signer can choose a group arbitrarily by simply collecting the public keys of all the ''ring" members, including his own. These diverse members can be totally unaware of being included in the group. Ring signature schemes can be used for whistle blowing and anonymous membership authentication <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> in order to keep the anonymity of the signer. Since ring signature was first formalized by Rivest et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, many practical ring signature schemes and their variants have been proposed, such as threshold ring signature <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, identity-based ring signature <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, ring signature with signer-admission <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and proxy ring signature <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The first efficient ring signature scheme based on standard assumptions without random oracles was proposed by Shacham and Waters <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In their ring signature scheme, it requires setup assumption and provides only computational anonymity.</p><p>A major feature of ring signature is that the user can generate a signature corresponding to ''something" that he does not know. For example, in identity-based ring signature, the signer with identity ID can give a signature that convinces the verifier that the signature either comes from ID or ID 0 . In the proposed hidden attribute-based signature, the private key of ID 0 is unknown and the signer can only generate a signature with respect to the attributes that he has. Another important difference is, for example, if there is only one CEO in a company who wants to issue a hidden attribute-based signature, his identity can only be hidden based on the ''condition" that there can be more than one (co-)CEO in a company. In ring signature, a CEO can choose to involve other non-CEOs in a signature to show that a certain document is possibly signed by a CEO. In the proposed hidden attribute-based signature, the CEO either gives a signature with the CEO's attribute, or chooses to hide this, which makes the signature have nothing to do with the attribute ''CEO". In the previous ring signatures, the signer and verifier know who is included in the signature. This is different with the proposed hidden attribute-based signatures.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Hidden attribute-based signature scheme</head><p>In this section, we formalize the definition and security model of hidden attribute-based signature. Then, we propose a construction with security proof under the given model. In the hidden attribute-based signature scheme, there is an attribute center to issue private keys to every user who requests them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Syntax</head><p>The hidden attribute-based signature scheme consists of four algorithms, namely, Setup, Extract, Sign, and Verify, which are defined as follows.</p><p>Setup The setup algorithm, on input 1 k , where k is the security parameter, outputs public parameter params and sk as the master secret key for the attribute center.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Extract</head><p>The private key extraction algorithm, on input attributes x and the master key sk, outputs a private key sk x . Sign The signing algorithm, to obtain a signature on a message m with respect to attributes x 0 # x, takes as input private key sk x for attributes x and outputs signature r. Verify The verification algorithm, given an alleged signature r for m with respect to attributes x 0 , and params, checks if it is a valid signature. If it is valid, outputs 1. Otherwise, outputs 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Security requirements</head><p>There are two security requirements for hidden attribute-based signatures, i.e., unforgeability and anonymity. Their definitions are described as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Unforgeability</head><p>The definition for unforgeability requires that no user can endorse a message with an attribute set x Ã if he does not have an attribute private key for x such that x Ã # x. That is, the signature satisfies unforgeability if it is existentially unforgeable against adaptive-attribute and chosen message attacks. The definition for unforgeability also implies its security against collusion attacks, in which a group of users try to combine their private keys and sign a message with some attributes they could not do individually. In this work, we consider a weaker security notion under selective-attribute attack. Specifically, the adversary should select the challenge attributes before setup. This attack model has also been used in many protocols such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. We propose the definition of unforgeability that is existentially unforgeable against selective-attribute and chosen message attacks (EUF-sA-CMA). Two oracles are provided to the adversary: (1) Private Key Extraction Oracle. Given an attribute set x, output corresponding private key sk x ; (2) Signing Oracle. Given a message m and x, output signature r. If the security is proved in the random oracle model, another oracle should also be provided to the adversary: (3) Random Oracle. Given m, output a random value r.</p><p>As explained, the challenge attributes are fixed for some predefined maximum number, for example, d. The formal definition of unforgeability is based on the following EUF-sA-CMA game involving a challenger C and an adversary F: At first, F outputs its challenge set of attributes jx Ã j 6 d for some predefined number d. Then, C chooses a sufficiently large security parameter 1 k and runs Setup. C retains private key sk and sends params generated from Setup to F. F can perform a polynomially bounded number of queries m; x, and ðm 0 ; x 0 Þ with jx 0 j 6 d to random oracle, private key extraction oracle and signing oracle, respectively. The restriction of the private key extraction query on x should satisfy x Ã Ü x. F outputs a signature r Ã on messages m Ã with respect to the set of attributes x Ã . We say that the adversary wins the game if r Ã is a valid signature on message m Ã with respect to x Ã , and ðm Ã ; x Ã Þ has not been queried to the signing oracle. The advantage Adv euf HAS;F ð1 k Þ of F is defined as the probability that it wins the game.</p><p>Definition 2 (Unforgeability). A forger Fðt; q K ; q S ; q H ; Þ-breaks a hidden attribute-based signature scheme if F runs in time at most t, and makes at most q K private key extraction queries, q S signature queries and q H hash queries, while Adv euf HAS;F ð1 k Þ is at least . A hidden attribute-based signature scheme is ðt; q K ; q S ; q H ; Þ-existentially unforgeable under selective-attribute and adaptive chosen message attacks if there exists no forger that can ðt; q K ; q S ; q H ; Þ-break it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Anonymity</head><p>For anonymity, we require that the signer must be anonymous among the users with the same attributes purported in the signature. Moreover, even the attribute center cannot reveal the signer's identity from the signature. The adversary can query signatures on messages with respect to certain attributes belonging to two attribute sets. As both attribute sets could generate a signature with the same attribute subset, the adversary has to guess which one signs the message, even if the adversary has the private key for both attribute sets. Its formal definition is based on the following game between a challenger C and an adversary F.</p><p>The challenger C chooses a sufficiently large security parameter 1 k and runs Setup to get a master key sk and public parameters params. C sends sk and params to F. With the private key sk; F can generate private keys and signatures by himself. F outputs a message m Ã , two attribute sets x Ã 1 ; x Ã 2 , and challenged attribute x Ã for signature query, where </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x Ã ¼ x Ã 1 \ x Ã 2 and, x Ã # x Ã such</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">r Ã ¼ Signðm Ã ; x Ã ; sk x Ã b</formula><p>Þ and provides r Ã to F. With r Ã , F guesses whether the signature is generated from x Ã 1 or x Ã 2 . Finally, F outputs a bit b 0 as his guess. We say F wins the game if b 0 ¼ b. Define Adv anony HAS;F ð1 k Þ to be the advantage over 1/2 of F in the above game. The master key of attribute center is also given to the adversary. This means that the signer's anonymity holds even to the attribute center. Definition 3 (Anonymity). A hidden attribute-based signature scheme satisfies the anonymity requirement if no F can win the above game with non-negligible advantage Adv</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">anony HAS;F ð1 k Þ.</formula><p>At first glance, it seems trivial to construct such a protocol just by preparing one private key for each signing set of attributes x 0 (Only preparing one private key for each attribute i 2 Z p , instead of a set of attributes x 0 , will not provide security against collusion attacks in which a group of users could combine their private keys and break the security requirement of unforgeability defined.). However, if the number of attributes in universe is ', we can calculate that the number of all the possible attribute subsets for signing is at least ' d . As a result, the attribute center has to publish at least ' d public keys.</p><p>Obviously, it cannot be realized in a polynomial time in case the universe of attributes are chosen from Z p . However, our construction requires only to publish 4 þ OðdÞ elements. The number ' d is huge even for small ' and d, for example, when the number of attributes is ' ¼ 50 and d ¼ 10, it will be approximately 10 10 , instead of ' þ OðdÞ in the second construction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Our hidden attribute-based signature construction</head><p>In our construction, the signer can efficiently generate a signature with part of his attributes. A predefined number d is given before the setup algorithm. The number d should be large enough for the practical applications because in our system, the user can sign a message with the number of attributes from 1 to d. To achieve this, the technique of dummy attributes was utilized, which was also used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. Some preliminaries on Lagrange interpolation are also given here before the construction. Recall that, given d points qð1Þ; qð2Þ; . . . ; qðdÞ on a d À 1 degree polynomial, Lagrange interpolation can be used to compute qðiÞ for any i 2 Z p . Let S be a d-element set.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>The notion of hidden attribute-based signature was initially proposed in this paper. The security definitions and models were also suggested and formalized. Unforgeability and anonymity are defined for the hidden attribute-based signature. More specifically, unforgeability requires that any user without certain attributes cannot generate signature with attributes that he does not have. Anonymity allows the signer to generate a signature with part of his attributes while being anonymous among all the users with the same attributes purported in the signature. Furthermore, we proposed two constructions of hidden attribute-based signature in this paper. The first construction supports a large universe of attributes and its security proof relies on the random oracle assumption, which is removed in the second construction. Both constructions are proven to be secure under the standard computational Diffie-Hellman assumption.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>by running algorithm Sign with the private key sk c x Ã b</figDesc></figure>
