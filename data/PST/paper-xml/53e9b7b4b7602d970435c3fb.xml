<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We propose a quality-of-service (QoS) driven power and rate adaptation scheme over wireless links in mobile wireless networks. Specifically, our proposed scheme aims at maximizing the system throughput subject to a given delay QoS constraint. First, we derive an optimal adaptation policy by integrating information theory with the concept of effective capacity for a block fading channel model. Our analyses reveal an important fact that there exists a fundamental tradeoff between throughput and QoS provisioning. In particular, when the QoS constraint becomes loose, the optimal power-control policy converges to the well-known water-filling scheme, where Shannon (ergodic) capacity can be achieved. On the other hand, when the QoS constraint gets stringent, the optimal policy converges to the total channel inversion scheme under which the system operates at a constant rate. Inspired by the above observations, we then consider a more practical scenario where variable-power adaptive modulation is employed over both block fading and Markov correlated fading channels. In both cases, we derive the associated power and rate adaptation policies. The obtained results suggest that the channel correlation has a significant impact on QoS-driven power and rate adaptations. The higher the correlation is, the faster the power-control policy converges to the total channel inversion when the QoS constraint becomes more stringent.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>diverse mobile users impose totally different and sometimes even conflicting delay QoS constraints, which impose great challenges to the design of future mobile wireless networks.</p><p>Unlike its wired counterparts, supporting diverse delay QoS in wireless environment is much more challenging since the wireless channel has a significant impact on network performance. In particular, a deterministic delay-bound QoS guarantee over wireless networks is practically infeasible due to the time-varying nature of fading channels. Alternatively, a more practical solution is to provide the statistical QoS guarantees <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, where we guarantee the given delay-bound with a small violation probability.</p><p>Furthermore, for wireless communications, the most scarce radio resources are power and spectral bandwidth <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. As a result, a great deal of research has been devoted to the techniques that can enhance the spectral efficiency of wireless systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The framework used to evaluate these techniques is mainly based on information theory, using the concept of Shannon capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Among a large number of promising schemes, power and rate adaptation has been widely considered as one of the key solutions to improve the spectral efficiency. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the authors showed that the optimal power and rate control policy which maximizes spectral efficiency is the so-called water-filling algorithm. The water-filling scheme assigns more power when the channel is in good condition and less power when the channel becomes worse. In the case that the channel quality is below a certain threshold, no information is transmitted. On the other hand, a different idea of power and rate adaptation is the scheme referred as total channel inversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, where the system assigns more power to combat with deep fading and less power for the good channel in order to maintain a constant signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), such that a constant rate service process can be obtained. Clearly, from the information-theoretic viewpoint, water-filling is better than total channel inversion since the former provides higher spectral efficiency. However, a natural question that follows is whether the former is also better than the latter in terms of QoS guarantees?</p><p>It is important to note that Shannon theory does not place any restrictions on complexity and delay <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Consequently, in order to answer the above question, it is necessary to take the QoS metrics into account when applying the prevalent information-theoretic results. Thanks to the dual concepts of effective bandwidth and effective capacity, we obtain a powerful approach to evaluate the statistical QoS performance from the networking perspective. The effective-bandwidth theory has been extensively studied in the early 90's with the emphasis on wired asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. This theory enables us to analyze network statistics such as queue distributions, buffer overflow probabilities, and delay-bound violation probabilities, which are important for statistical QoS guarantees. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, Wu and Negi proposed an interesting concept termed effective capacity, which turns out to be the dual of the effective bandwidth. The effectivecapacity approach is particularly convenient for analyzing the statistical QoS performance of wireless transmissions where the service process is driven by the time-varying wireless channel.</p><p>Integrating information theory with the effective capacity, in this paper we investigate the QoS-driven power and rate adaptation over wireless links in mobile wireless networks. The problem we are interested in is how to maximize the throughput subject to a given delay QoS constraint. We first focus on uncorrelated fading channels (also termed block fading or quasi-static fading channels) and investigate corresponding power and rate adaptation polices. Our analyses reveal an important fact that there exists a fundamental tradeoff between the throughput and the QoS provisioning. In particular, the higher throughput gain comes at the price of sacrificing more QoS provisioning, and vice versa. When the QoS constraint becomes loose, the optimal power-control law converges to the water-filling scheme, where Shannon (ergodic) capacity can be achieved. On the other hand, when the QoS constraint gets stringent, the optimal power-control law converges to the total channel inversion such that the system operates at a constant service rate. Motivated by the above observations, we then consider a more practical scenario where variablepower adaptive-modulation is applied over both uncorrelated and correlated fading channels. For simplicity, we use finitestate Markov chain (FSMC) to model the correlated channel processes. The FSMC-based channel model was previously proposed by Wang and Moayeri <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Then, this model has been extensively studied for both Rayleigh and Nakagami-m fading channel (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and references therein). For both block fading and FSMC-correlated fading channels, we derive the corresponding power and rate adaptation policies. Our obtained results suggest that channel correlation has a significant impact on QoS-driven power and rate allocations. The higher the correlation is, the faster the power-control policy converges to the total channel inversion as the QoS constraint becomes more stringent. Finally, we conduct simulations to verify that although the FSMC-based channel model is not perfectly accurate, the power-control law derived from it can be applied to the more general Jake's channel model <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, which has been widely used and extensively studied in literatures.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II de-scribes our system model. Sections III introduces the statistical QoS guarantees and the concept of effective capacity. Section IV develops the optimal power and rate adaptation scheme that can maximize the effective capacity. Section V applies the above analyses to a more practical adaptive modulationbased scheme. Section VI discusses the impact of channel correlation on the power and rate adaptations. Section VII conducts simulations to evaluate the validity of our proposed adaptive schemes on the more general Jake's channel model. The paper concludes with Section VIII.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL</head><p>The system model is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. We concentrate on the discrete-time system over a point-to-point wireless link between the transmitter and the receiver. Let us denote the system's total spectral bandwidth by B, the mean transmit power by P , and the power density of the complex additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) by N 0 /2 per dimension, respectively. First, the upper-protocol-layer packets are divided into frames at the datalink layer, which forms the "data source" as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. We assume that the frames have the same time duration, which is denoted by T f . The frames are stored at the transmit buffer and then split into bit-streams at the physical layer. Based on the QoS constraint and the channelstate information (CSI) fed back from the receiver, the adaptive modulation and power control are employed, respectively, at the transmitter. The reverse operations are executed at the receiver side. Finally, the frames are recovered at the "data sink" for further processing.</p><p>The discrete-time channel fading process is assumed to be stationary and ergodic, which is invariant within a frame's time-duration T f , but varies from one frame to another. Moreover, the wireless channel is flat-fading with its envelope following Nakagami-m distribution. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> The Nakagami-m channel model is very general and often best fits land-mobile and indoor-mobile multipath propagations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. As the parameter m varies, where m ∈ [1/2, +∞), the model spans a wide range of fading environments, including one-sided Gaussian fading channel (m = 1/2, the worst fading case), Rayleigh fading channel (m = 1), approximations of Rician and lognormal fading channels (m &gt; 1), and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel (m = ∞, no fading).</p><p>Denote the channel envelope process by {α[i], i = 1, 2, ...}, where i is the time index of the frame. If we use constant power assignment, then the instantaneous transmit power, denoted by P [i], is equal to P [i] = P . The instantaneous received SNR, denoted by γ[i], can be expressed as γ[i] = P α 2 [i]/(N 0 B), with its mean γ = P E{α 2 [i]}/(N 0 B), where E{•} denotes the expectation. The probability density function (pdf) of γ[i], denoted by p Γ (γ), can be expressed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p Γ (γ) = γ m-1 Γ(m) m γ m exp - m γ γ , γ ≥ 0<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where Γ(•) represents the Gamma function and m denotes the fading parameter of Nakagami-m distribution. Throughout this paper, we assume that the CSI is perfectly estimated at the receiver and reliably fed back to the transmitter without delay. The discussions of the imperfect CSI are not the focus of this paper. We also assume that the datalink-layer buffer size is infinite.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Concept of Statistical QoS Guarantees</head><p>During the early 90's, statistical QoS guarantees have been extensively studied in the contexts of effective bandwidth theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The literature on effective bandwidth is abundant. The readers are referred to Chang <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and Kelly et. al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for a comprehensive review.</p><p>Based on large deviation principle (LDP), Chang showed that <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, for a dynamic queueing system with stationary ergodic arrival and service processes, under sufficient conditions, the queue length process Q(t) converges in distribution to a random variable (r.v.) Q(∞) such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">-lim x→∞ log (Pr{Q(∞) &gt; x}) x = θ. (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>To be more specific, the above theorem states that the probability of the queue length exceeding a certain threshold x decays exponentially fast as the threshold x increases. Note that in (2), the parameter θ (θ &gt; 0) plays a critically important role for statistical QoS guarantees, which indicates the exponential decay rate of the QoS violation probabilities. A smaller θ corresponds to a slower decay rate, which implies that the system can only provide a looser QoS guarantee, while a larger θ leads to a faster decay rate, which means that a more stringent QoS requirement can be supported. In particular, when θ → 0, the system can tolerate an arbitrarily long delay, which corresponds to the scenario studied in information theory. On the other hand, when θ → ∞, the system cannot tolerate any delay, which corresponds to an extremely stringent delay-bound. Due to its close relationship with statistical QoS provisioning, θ is called the QoS exponent <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Based on the concept of QoS exponent, the effective bandwidth is defined as the minimum constant service rate required by a given arrival process for which the QoS exponent θ is fulfilled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Effective Capacity</head><p>Inspired by the effective bandwidth, Wu and Negi proposed effective capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, which is the dual of the original effective bandwidth. The effective capacity is defined as the maximum constant arrival rate that a given service process can support in order to guarantee a QoS requirement specified by θ. Analytically, the effective capacity can be formally defined as follows.</p><p>Let the sequence {R[i], i = 1, 2, ...} denote a discrete-time stationary and ergodic stochastic service process and S[t] t i=1 R[i] be the partial sum of the service process over time sequence of i = 1, 2, ..., t. Assume that the Gärtner-Ellis limit of S[t], expressed as Λ C (θ) = lim t→∞ (1/t) log E e θS [t]  exists and is a convex function differentiable for all real θ [7, pp. 921]. Then, the effective capacity of the service process, denoted by E C (θ), where θ &gt; 0, is defined as [12, eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">12</ref>)]</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">E C (θ) - Λ C (-θ) θ = -lim t→∞ 1 θt log E e -θS[t] . (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>When the sequence</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">{R[i], i = 1, 2, ...} is an uncorrelated process, it is clear that the effective capacity E C (θ) reduces to E C (θ) = - 1 θ log E e -θR[i] . (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>In this paper, our original problem is maximizing the throughput subject to a given delay QoS constraint. Notice that the effective capacity can be considered as the maximal throughput under the constraint of QoS exponent θ. Therefore, by interpreting θ as the QoS constraint in our original problem, we can formulate an equivalent new problem, which is to maximize the effective capacity for a given θ. In the following sections, we will focus on this new problem and design the corresponding resource allocation algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. OPTIMAL POWER AND RATE ADAPTATION FOR QOS GUARANTEES</head><p>Conventionally, the power-control law can be expressed as a function of the instantaneous SNR γ[i]. However, our power-adaptation policy, denoted by μ (θ, γ[i]), is a function of not only the instantaneous SNR γ[i], but also the QoS exponent θ. Applying the power adaptation, the instantaneous transmit power becomes P [i] = μ (θ, γ[i]) P . Note that the mean transmit power is upper-bounded by P . Therefore, the power-control law needs to satisfy the mean power constraint:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">∞ 0 μ(θ, γ)p Γ (γ)dγ ≤ 1, for all θ &gt; 0.<label>(5)</label></formula><p>In this section, we also make the following two assumptions: A1: We first assume that the channel is block fading. We make such an assumption due to the following reasons. First, the effective capacity expression (4) in uncorrelated case only depends on marginal statistics of a service process, which is much simpler than the general expression given by (3), where the higher order statistics of the service process are required. Second, we will show in Section VI that the resource allocation policy derived for block fading channel can be applied to correlated fading channel with a certain modifications.</p><p>A2: We further assume that given the instantaneous SNR γ[i] and the corresponding power-control law μ (θ, γ[i]), the adaptive modulation and coding scheme can achieve the instantaneous capacity. Thus, the instantaneous service rate R[i] of the frame i can be expressed as 2</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">R[i] = T f B log 2 1 + μ (θ, γ[i]) γ[i] . (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><p>In the following discussions, we omit the discrete time-index i for simplicity. Using ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">4</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">5</ref>), and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">6</ref>), we can formally formulate our maximization problem as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">E opt C (θ) = max μ(θ,γ): Ê ∞ 0 μ(θ,γ)pΓ(γ)dγ=1 - 1 θ • log ∞ 0 e -θT f B log 2 1+μ(θ,γ)γ p Γ (γ)dγ . (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>where E opt C (θ) denotes the maximum effective capacity achieved by the optimal policy. We derive the following theorem to characterize the optimal power and rate adaptation policy.</p><p>Theorem 1: The optimal power-control policy, denoted by μ opt (θ, γ), which maximizes the effective capacity given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, is determined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">μ opt (θ, γ) = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ 1 γ 1 β+1 0 γ β β+1 - 1 γ , γ ≥ γ 0 0, γ &lt; γ 0<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where we define β θT f B/log 2 as the normalized QoS exponent and γ 0 as the cutoff SNR threshold, which can be numerically obtained by meeting the mean power constraint:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">∞ γ0 ⎛ ⎝ 1 γ 1 β+1 0 γ β β+1 - 1 γ ⎞ ⎠ p Γ (γ)dγ = 1. (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>Proof: The proof is provided in Appendix I. Theorem 1 gives the optimal power-control policy which maximizes the effective capacity. We can observe from (8) that as θ → 0, the optimal policy μ opt (θ, γ) converges to</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">lim θ→0 μ opt (θ, γ) = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ 1 γ 0 - 1 γ , γ ≥ γ 0 0, γ&lt;γ 0<label>(10)</label></formula><p>which is just the water-filling formula in [6, eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">5</ref>)]. Thus, our QoS-driven power and rate adaptation scheme reduces to the water-filling algorithm when the system can tolerate an arbitrarily long delay, which is expected since water-filling is well-known the optimal power allocation strategy without delay constraint. On the other hand, as the QoS exponent θ → ∞, the cutoff threshold γ 0 → 0 (note that γ 0 = λ/β as detailed in Appendix I). Therefore, the system does not enter the outage state almost surely. The optimal power control μ opt (θ, γ) converges to</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">lim θ→∞ μ opt (θ, γ) = σ γ (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>where σ = (m -1)γ/m for m ≥ 1, which becomes the policy of the total channel inversion. Thus, for stringent delay 2 Note that in our model, the unit for the service rate R[i] and the effective capacity E C (θ) is "bits per frame". QoS constraints, the optimal power control becomes the total channel inversion. Note that if the fading parameter m &lt; 1, implying that the fading is severer than Rayleigh, then no total channel inversion scheme exists since the transmit power is not enough to totally invert the channel. In this case, the cutoff threshold γ 0 will converge to a small positive number as θ → ∞. Thus, the optimal power and rate adaptation policy becomes truncated channel inversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. It is also worth noting that the optimal power-adaptation policy μ opt (θ, γ) depends on frame duration T f and spectral bandwidth B through the parameter β, where a system with larger value of T f B can support more stringent QoS requirements. In all the following numerical solutions or simulation results, which are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> through Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>, we set the frame duration T f = 2 ms and the spectral bandwidth B = 10 5 Hz. The other system parameters are detailed respectively in each of these figures. Using (8), we plot the instantaneous power assignments of the optimal poweradaptation policy in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. We can observe from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> that for small θ, the power control assigns more power to the better channel and less power to the worse channel. In contrast, for large θ, the power control assigns less power to the better channel, but more power to the worse channel. As the QoS exponent θ varies between (0, ∞), reflecting different delay QoS constraints, the corresponding optimal power-adaptation policy swings between the water-filling and the total channel inversion schemes.</p><p>Given the optimal power and rate adaptation policy, we can derive the closed-form expression for the maximum effective capacity E opt C (θ) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">E opt C (θ) = - 1 θ log ∞ 0 e -β log 1+μopt(θ,γ)γ p Γ (γ)dγ = - 1 θ log mγ 0 γ β β+1 Γ m - β β + 1 , mγ 0 γ + γ m, m γ γ 0 -log Γ(m) . (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>where γ(•, •) and Γ(•, •) denote the lower and upper incomplete Gamma functions, respectively.    For comparison purposes, we also derive the closed-form expressions of the effective capacity for other commonly used power-control policies, including the water-filling scheme, the constant power approach, and the total channel inversion. Omitting the derivation details, we obtain the closed-form expressions of the the effective capacity for water-filling, denoted by E WF C (θ), as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">E WF C (θ) = - 1 θ log mγ 0 γ β Γ m -β, mγ 0 γ +γ m, m γ γ 0 -log Γ(m) ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>and the effective capacity for the constant power approach, denoted by E const C (θ), as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">E const C (θ) = - 1 θ log Γ(β -m) Γ(β) m γ m • 1 F 1 m; m -β + 1; m γ + Γ(m -β) Γ(m) • m γ β 1 F 1 β; β -m + 1; m γ (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">)</formula><p>respectively, where 1 F 1 (•; •; •) denotes the confluent Hypergeometric function <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Finally, the effective capacity of total channel inversion is simply a constant equal to</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">T f B log 2 (1 + σ).</formula><p>The normalized effective capacity (which is defined as the effective capacity divided by B and T f , and thus has the unit of "bits/sec/Hz") comparisons between different power and rate adaptation schemes are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>. As expected, our proposed optimal power and rate adaptation always achieves the maximum effective capacity among all control policies. The optimal scheme converges to the water-filling for small θ and to the total channel inversion for large θ (when the total channel inversion exists). Note that for one-sided Gaussian channel (m = 0.5) and Rayleigh channel (m = 1), even using the optimal policy, the effective capacity also converges to zero as the QoS exponent θ → ∞. However, this is the best that the power control can do to maximize the effective capacity. This implies that no matter how much power and spectral bandwidth resource are assigned and no matter how elegant coding/modulation is employed, if no other technique (e.g., diversity or multiplexing) helps to compensate for the fading effect, Nakagami-m channels with m ≤ 1 cannot support stringent delay QoS requirement when θ is large, which is also coincident with the fact that the zero-outage capacity of Rayleigh fading channel is zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. QOS-DRIVEN POWER AND RATE ADAPTATION FOR ADAPTIVE MQAM</head><p>Based on Shannon theory and the concept of effective capacity, Section IV discusses the resource allocation when using ideal channel codes. In this section, we study the scenario where the transmitter employs adaptive MQAM modulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Continuous Constellation MQAM</head><p>We first assume that there is no restriction on the constellation size of adaptive MQAM, which implies that the rate of the service process can be adapted continuously. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, Goldsmith and Chua showed that the continuous rate adaptive MQAM has a constant power loss as compared to the Shannon capacity, where the constant only depends on bit-error rate (BER) requirement. Specifically, for each given received SNR γ and power-control policy μ (θ, γ), the corresponding constellation size, denoted by M (γ), is determined by <ref type="bibr">[6, eq. (20)</ref>]</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">M (γ) = 1 + Kμ (θ, γ) γ (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_25">)</formula><p>where K is defined as K -1.5/ log(5BER), with BER denoting the required bit-error rate. Note that continuous rate MQAM is originally proposed to investigate the insight relationship between the Shannon capacity and the achievable spectral efficiency of MQAM modulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In practice, the constellation size M (γ) can only be selected from a finite discrete set, which will be detailed in Section V-B.</p><p>Using <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, the service rate of continuous rate MQAM, denoted by R M , can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">R M = T f B log 2 1 + Kμ (θ, γ) γ .

Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref> illustrates the normalized effective capacity comparisons between the Shannon theory-based upper-bound and the continuous rate adaptive MQAM. We can observe that as the BER requirement becomes more stringent, the effective capacities of both optimal and non-optimal schemes decrease accordingly. However, our proposed power and rate adaptations are always the optimal schemes in each group with the same BER requirement. Agreeing with our observations, the effective capacities of the optimal scheme converge to the water-filling for small θ and to the total channel inversion for large θ, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Discrete Constellation MQAM</head><p>The continuous rate assumption for the adaptive MQAM is not too practical. In this section, we relax this assumption by requesting that there be only N possible constellation sizes available. Specifically, we partition the entire SNR range by N non-overlapping consecutive intervals, resulting in N + 1 boundary points denoted by {Γ n } N n=0 , where Γ 0 &lt; Γ 1 &lt; • • • &lt; Γ N with Γ 0 = 0 and Γ N = ∞. Correspondingly, the adaptive modulation is selected to be in mode n if the SNR γ falls into the range Γ n ≤ γ &lt; Γ n+1 . The constellation used for the zero-th mode is M 0 = 0 and for the nth mode is M n -QAM, where M n = 2 n with n = 1, 2, ..., N -1. Thus, the spectral efficiency by using the nth mode is n bits/sec/Hz. The service rate of the nth mode, denoted by ν n , is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">ν n = T f Bn, for n = 0, 1, ..., N -1. (<label>19</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_32">)</formula><p>To find the optimal power and rate adaptation policy for discrete rate adaptive MQAM, we first need to know how to choose the boundary points {Γ n } N -1 n=1 to maximize the effective capacity. Substituting ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_28">17</ref>) into ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_24">15</ref>), we get</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">M (γ) = γ γ K 1 β+1 =⇒ γ = [M (γ)] β+1 γ K . (<label>20</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_34">)</formula><p>Although ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_33">20</ref>) is originally derived from continuous rate adaptive MQAM, it provides the guideline in choosing the boundaries for the discrete rate MQAM. Based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, we obtain the SNR boundaries {Γ n } N -1 n=1 for discrete rate MQAM as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">Γ n = M β+1 n γ * K (21)</formula><p>where γ * K denotes the new cutoff threshold for discrete rate MQAM. For each given γ * K , the boundaries {Γ n } N -1 n=1 are determined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. Then, the power-control policy is to retain a constant power for each mode n &gt; 0 such that the BER requirements are satisfied. Thus, we obtain the optimal policy for the nth mode, denoted by μ n opt (θ, γ), as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">μ n opt (θ, γ) = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ (M n -1) Kγ , 1 ≤ n ≤ N -1 0, n= 0. (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_37">)</formula><p>Let us further define M N ∞. Then, the cutoff threshold γ * K is determined by the mean power constraint</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">N -1 n=0 M β+1 n+1 γ * K M β+1 n γ * K μ n (θ, γ)p Γ (γ)dγ = 1 (23)</formula><p>which can be solved numerically. We can observe from ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>) that as θ → 0, the boundary selection policy becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">lim θ→0 Γ n = M n γ * K (24)</formula><p>which is same as the selection policy for the discrete rate water-filling algorithm [6, eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_46">29</ref>)]. On the other hand, as θ → ∞, the threshold γ * K vanishes to zero, making mode 0 infinitely small. At the same time, one of the other (N -1) modes dominates the entire SNR range. Again, the powercontrol policy converges to the total channel inversion in this case.</p><p>Using <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>, we plot the instantaneous power assignments of the optimal power-adaptation policy in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. We can observe from Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> that the power control curve has the zigzag shape due to the constellation constraint. However, the power control policy still varies between the discrete rate water-filling at small θ and the total channel inversion at large θ, which is consistent with that of the continuous rate MQAM.</p><p>Using (4), we derive the effective capacity under the optimal policy, denoted by E opt C (θ), as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">E opt C (θ) = - 1 θ log N -1 n=0 π n e -θνn (<label>25</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_41">)</formula><p>where ν n is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> and</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">π n = Γn+1 Γn p Γ (γ)dγ = 1 Γ(m) γ m, m γ Γ n+1 -γ m, m γ Γ n (26)</formula><p>with {Γ n } N n=0 given by ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>). Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> compares the normalized effective capacities between continuous rate MQAM and discrete rate MQAM using both the optimal and non-optimal policies. As shown by Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, the discrete rate MQAM under the optimal policy suffers from a certain loss in performance as compared to the continuous rate MQAM due to the discrete constellation constraint. However, such a performance loss is not significant. An interesting phenomenon is that the effective capacity of discrete rate water-filling is even larger than that of the continuous rate water-filling for large θ, which is because the service rate of discrete rate scheme has smaller variance than that of the continuous rate scheme, where a service process with smaller variance can support more stringent delay QoS requirement.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Effective Capacity for FSMC-Based Channel Process</head><p>We derive the above analytical results by using a block fading channel model. However, this model is not always valid. In most scenarios, it is more practical to consider the correlated wireless channel models. There exist a number of models characterizing the correlated channel fading processes. For instance, the Jake's model <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> has been widely accepted as an accurate modeling approach. Based on the Jake's model, the autocorrelation of the channel gain, denoted by A g (τ ), can be expressed as A g (τ ) = J 2 0 (2πf d τ ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, where J 0 (•) denotes the zero-th order Bessel function of the first kind and f d is the maximum Doppler frequency. However, if using the Jake's model in our systems, it is hard to derive the effective capacity expression from (3). Then, it is even harder to find the power and rate adaptation policies. Therefore, we apply FSMC to model the correlated service process for simplicity.</p><p>Integrating the FSMC model with our discrete rate adaptive MQAM, the state of FSMC corresponds to the mode of adaptive modulation. Let p i,j denote the transition probability from state i to state j. We assume a slow-fading channel model such that transition only happens between adjacent states <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Under this assumption, we have p ij = 0, if |i -j| &gt; 1, ∀i, j ∈ {0, 1, ..., N -1}. The adjacent transition probabilities can be approximated as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">p n,n+1 ≈ NΓ(Γn+1)T f πn , for n = 0, 1, ..., N -2, p n,n-1 ≈ NΓ(Γn)T f πn , for n = 1, 2, ..., N -1<label>(27)</label></formula><p>where {Γ n } N -1 n=0 and {π n } N -1 n=0 are given by ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>) and (26), respectively, and N Γ (γ) is the level-crossing rate (LCR) calculated at SNR value of γ, which is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_44">N Γ (γ) = √ 2πf d Γ(m) mγ γ m-1 2 exp - mγ γ .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Power and Rate Adaptation for FSMC-Based Channel Service Process</head><p>Although we employ the FSMC-model-based service process, it is still difficult to directly derive the power and rate adaptation policy to maximize the effective capacity described by (30). Fortunately, the wireless channel offers a unique feature that allows us to obtain the simple but near-optimal solution. We observe that the FSMC-modeled service process satisfy the properties described by the following proposition.</p><p>Proposition 2: If we denote the effective capacity functions of two FSMC-based service processes by E C1 (θ) and E C2 (θ), and they have the same marginal statistics, but differ in Doppler frequencies denoted by f d1 and f d2 , respectively, then the following equation holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">E C1 (θ) ≈ E C2 f d2 f d1 θ (31)</formula><p>Proof: The proof is provided in Appendix II. Remarks: Proposition 2 says that E C1 (θ) is approximately a horizontal-shifted version of E C2 (θ) along θ-axis (when θaxis uses the logarithmic scale), where the difference between these two functionals is 10 log 10 (f d2 /f d1 ) dB. Specifically, if</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">(f d2 /f d1 ) &gt; 1, then E C1 (θ) is a left-shifted version of E C2 (θ); otherwise, E C1 (θ) is a right-shifted version of E C2 (θ).</formula><p>It is well known that the Doppler frequency f d characterizes the time correlation of channel fading processes. The larger the Doppler frequency f d , the lower the correlation of the service process. When the Doppler frequency is large enough, the channel process can be approximately considered as uncorrelated, just like the block fading channel. For example, based on our system parameters and the standard Jake's channel model, the autocorrelation A g (T f ) passes through its first zero-point at the Doppler frequency of 191.25 Hz, which we denote by f Jake </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Doppler frequency f</head><formula xml:id="formula_50">d (f d f * d ), its effective capacity, denoted by E (f d ) C (θ), can be approximated as E (f d ) C (θ) ≈ E * C (κθ), where κ = f * d f d . (<label>32</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_51">)</formula><p>Likewise, for each power-adaptation policy μ(θ, γ) that is used for block fading channels, the new policy μ(κθ, γ) can be applied to the correlated channels with Doppler frequency f d . This policy generates a new effective-capacity functional, which is approximately a left-shifted version of the original one for the block fading channel, with a difference of 10 log 10 (κ) dB along θ-axis. Thus, given the optimal poweradaptation policy μ opt (θ, γ) for block fading channel, the optimal power-adaptation policy for correlated channel is approximately μ opt (κθ, γ). Note that κ &gt; 1 due to f d &lt; f * d in (32), as θ increases, the policy μ opt (κθ, γ) makes the powercontrol policy converge faster to the total channel inversion than the case under the block fading channel model. The higher the correlation is, the faster the power-control policy converges to the total channel inversion. Specifically, for our FSMC-based channel model with Doppler frequency f d , the policy of choosing the boundary points {Γ n } N -1 n=1 becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">Γ n = M κβ+1 n γ * K (κθ)<label>(33)</label></formula><p>where γ * K (κθ) denotes the cutoff threshold obtained by (21) at the QoS exponent of κθ.</p><p>Proposition 2 plays an important role in deriving the powercontrol policy for the correlated channel. Applying Proposition 2, we can simply shift the existing optimal power-control policy for 10 log 10 (κ) dB to obtain the new policies. However, since (31) given in Proposition 2 is only an approximation result, our obtained new power and rate adaptation policy is just a near-optimal solution. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> shows the normalized effective capacities of both block fading channel and FSMC-based correlated channel under different power-adaptation policies. The optimal policy μ opt (θ, γ) for the block fading channel is derived from Section V, which generates the highest effective-capacity curve as shown by the solid line in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>. Then, according to the analyses in this section, we apply the policy μ opt (κθ, γ) to the correlated channel, which numerically generates a group of effective-capacity curves as shown by a set of dashed lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>. These dashed lines are virtually "parallel to" the solid line of the original block fading channel effective capacity. This is consistent with Remarks on Proposition 2. However, if we apply the block fading channel policy μ opt (θ, γ) directly to the correlated channel, the resulting effective capacities decrease significantly, as shown by a group of dotted lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. SIMULATION RESULTS</head><p>Using FSMC-based channel model, we obtain the analytical expression for the effective-capacity and the near-optimal power and rate adaptation policies. However, it is important to verify that the policy derived from the FSMC model can also be applied to the more general scenarios, e.g., the Jake's model, without losing the performance satisfactions. Thus, in this section we simulate the Jake's channel process and compare its outcomes with the analytical results obtained in previous sections.</p><p>Applying the optimal power and rate adaptation policy given by (33), Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref> shows the normalized effective capacity comparisons between the Jake's channel model and the FSMC-based channel model. We can observe from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref> that for the block fading channel, the simulation results perfectly match with the numerical results. On the other hand, when considering the channel correlation, the outcomes from simulations and numerical solutions for these two models share the same trends but differ very slightly. Such a difference can be explained as follows. As stated in Section VI, due to the inaccuracy of the channel model, the Jake's model and the f Jake d = 191.25 Hz, respectively. Thus, for the same Doppler frequency f d , the resulting κ in (32) is different. Theoretically, the difference of the effective-capacity curves between these two models is 10 log 10 f FSMC d /f Jake d = 1.96 dB, which is consistent with the effective capacity difference observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>.</p><p>The above analyses described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref> verify that the power-adaptation policy derived by using the FSMC model can be well applied to the general Jake's channel model, where the system employs the discrete rate MQAM. In the following, we further show that the policy can also be applied to the general Jake's channel model where the system uses continuous rate transmission. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref> plots the normalized effective capacity of the constant-power approach, where we assume that the Shannon capacity can be achieved for each channel realization. For block fading channel, the simulated effective capacity agrees well with the analytical results. On the other hand, for the correlated fading channel, as the Doppler frequency f d increases, the effective capacity also increases, with the resulting effective-capacity curves roughly "parallel to" each other. This observation implies that the effective capacity of general channel process also follows the similar trends as described in Proposition 2. Therefore, for continuous rate transmissions, the near-optimal power and rate adaptation law also has the form similar to μ opt (κθ, γ) for a certain coefficient κ, where μ opt (θ, γ) is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we proposed and analyzed the QoS-driven power and rate control policies by applying the concept of effective capacity. Our analyses in block fading channel identified the key fact that there exists a fundamental tradeoff between spectral efficiency and QoS provisioning. Depending on the specific QoS requirements, the optimal power-adaptation policy dynamically changes between water-filling and channel inversion. For the more practical adaptive MQAM modulationbased systems, we also developed the corresponding optimal power and rate adaptation scheme. When taking the channel correlation into consideration, we proposed the simple, but There exists the close relationship between continuous-time FSMC and discrete-time FSMC. Under appropriate conditions, the discrete-time FSMC can be considered as the "samples" of the embedded continuous-time FSMC. Based on our system model, the sample interval is T f and the service rate ν n = ν n T f .</p><p>The relationship between transition probability matrix P of a discrete-time FSMC and generating matrix Q of a continuous-time FSMC can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_53">P(T f ) = e QT f = I + QT f + o(T 2 f )<label>(38)</label></formula><p>where we rewrite P by P(T f ) in (38) to emphasize that the sample interval is T f .
