<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that affects approximately 1% of the world's population (about 50 million people) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. An epileptic seizure is caused by an abnormal electrical discharge of the brain during which the neurons fire uncontrollably causing involuntary movements, convulsions and a change in awareness. When diagnosed properly, about 75% of the epilepsy cases can be effectively treated using current therapies, medications or surgical treatments.</p><p>Patients who require surgical treatments are usually admitted to an epilepsy unit in which they undergo long presurgical evaluations to determine the epileptogenic foci of the brain. During this period, bulks of multi-channel EEG recordings are acquired from these patients, which are visually inspected and scored by trained professionals for epileptic seizure detection. This information plays a crucial role in locating the epileptogenic foci of the brain and deciding on the areas of the brain to be removed during the surgery. The visual scoring of the EEG records by a human scorer is clearly a very time consuming and costly task considering the large number of epileptic patients admitted to the hospitals and the amount of data needs to be scored. Thus, a tremendous effort has been devoted by researchers from both medical and engineering backgrounds towards automatic detection of epileptic seizures in EEG.</p><p>Various techniques have been proposed in the literature for the detection of epileptic seizures in EEG using the auto-correlation function <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, frequency domain analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, wavelet analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and nonlinear methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Most of the seizure detection schemes consist of two stages. In the first stage, features are extracted from the raw EEG data using time domain, frequency domain or timefrequency domain methods. Since the EEG is nonstationary in general, it is most appropriate to use time-frequency domain methods like the wavelet transform (WT) as means for feature extraction. WT does not impose the quasi-stationarity assumption on the data such as the time and frequency domain methods do. It provides both time and frequency views of a signal simultaneously, which makes it possible to accurately capture and localize transient features in the data like the epileptic spikes.</p><p>In the second stage of the seizure detection schemes, features extracted from the EEG are used for training classifiers that differentiate between normal and epileptic EEG. Various classifiers have been proposed including different kinds of artificial neural networks (NN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, artificial neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> and dynamic fuzzy NN <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Independent of the classifier being used, the classification performance is mostly dependent on the features that are being used to characterize the raw data. Therefore, optimal selection of the feature subset in an available feature set plays a very important role in the performance of any classifier.</p><p>In this study, features were extracted from the EEG data using the WT, which the studies in the literature demonstrated to be the most promising feature extraction method. Normal and epileptic EEG epochs were decomposed into various frequency bands through wavelet packet decomposition (WPD). The approximate entropy (ApEn) values of the wavelet coefficients at the various nodes of the decomposition tree were used as a feature set for training a learning vector quantization (LVQ)-based classifier. ApEn is a measure of the predictability or the regularity of a time series that have been applied to EEG in the literature for sleep analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, identification of the burst suppression patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and anesthetic depth monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. ApEn was not only shown to help understand EEG dynamics and underlying chaos in the brain, but was also effectively used in epileptic seizure detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>As a final step, the genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to reduce the number of features and find the optimal feature subset that maximizes the classification performance of the LVQ classifier. The GA is an adaptive heuristic search algorithm inspired by the laws of natural selection and genetics. The GA has not only a higher probability of locating the global optimum point in a complex optimization surface than the traditional techniques, but is also less sensitive to initial conditions. It has previously been applied to EEG analysis for various applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Clinical EEG recordings acquired from normal subjects and epileptic patients were used to test the validity of the proposed scheme. The results demonstrated that the classification performance of the LVQ classifier improved considerably when the GA-based optimal feature selection scheme was used. When the GA was employed, the classification accuracies for the normal and epileptic EEG were 94.3% and 98%, respectively. The corresponding accuracies dropped to 87% and 89% without the GA stage. In this study, the classification accuracy for the normal EEG is defined as 100 times the number of epochs correctly identified as normal by the classifier over the total number of normal EEG epochs. The classification accuracy for the epileptic EEG is defined similarly.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Wavelet packet analysis</head><p>WT provides a more flexible way of timefrequency representation of a signal by allowing the use of variable sized windows. In WT, long time windows are used to get a finer low-frequency resolution and short time windows are used to get high-frequency information. Thus, WT gives precise frequency information at low frequencies and precise time information at high frequencies. This makes the WT suitable for the analysis of irregular data patterns, such as impulses occurring at various time instances.</p><p>Wavelet packet analysis is a generalized form of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). In the wavelet packet analysis of a signal, first the signal is simultaneously passed through a series of low-pass (LP) and high-pass (HP) filters named as quadrature mirror filters. The cut-off frequency of these filters is one-fourth of the sampling frequency. The bandwidth of the filter outputs are half the bandwidth of the original signal, which allows for the downsampling of the output signals by two without loosing any information according to the Nyquist theorem. The downsampled signals from the LP and HP filters are referred to as first-level approximation (A) and detail (D) coefficients, respectively. To get the second-level approximation of approximation (AA), detail of approximation (DA), approximation of detail (AD) and detail of detail (DD) coefficients, the same procedure is repeated for the first-level A and D coefficients. At each level of the decomposition, frequency resolution is doubled through filtering while the time resolution is halved by downsampling operation. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates the third-level WPD of a signal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">GA</head><p>The GA is an adaptive heuristic search algorithm inspired by the laws of natural selection and genetics. The GA was first introduced to the literature in the early 1970s by Holland <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Traditional gradient-based optimization techniques search for an optimum point in a multi-dimensional optimization surface by iteratively refining a single solution. On the other hand, the GA operates on a collection of candidate solutions in parallel, which is one of its main strengths. Through this approach, the GA has a higher probability of locating the global optimum point than the traditional techniques, which are more likely to get stuck at a local optimum around the initial guess. The parallel approach of the GA also makes it less sensitive to initial conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>The GA starts with an initial population of individuals, each representing a possible solution to a given optimization problem and over successive generations evolves toward a set of more optimal or fit individuals. Individuals consist of a fixed length continuous or discrete strings (usually bit-strings) analogous to the chromosomes in a DNA. The evolution process is governed by three basic operations: selection, crossover and mutation. The selection process mimics the survival of the fittest in nature. Each individual or chromosome in the population is assigned a fitness value (based on a fitness function) according to how good a solution it is to the problem. Based on the fitness scores, the GA selects certain best individuals from the current population, called parents, and allows them to pass on their genes to the next generation. Crossover is an analogy to mating between individuals and lets two parents to exchange genes to form new individuals for the next generation called children. A portion of the new individuals is created through mutation, which involves random modification of a parent's genes and helps maintain diversity within the population. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> illustrates the crossover and mutation operations in a population in which each individual or a chromosome contains eight genes and the genes can take on a value of either 0 or 1. A more detailed review of the GA can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Clinical data</head><p>The EEG recordings studied were obtained from five normal subjects and five epileptic patients. The normal subjects were awake during the study and were asked to relax with their eyes open. The EEG data from these subjects were acquired through surface electrodes placed on the skull using the international 10-20 electrode placement scheme. Three different sets of intracranial EEG recordings were obtained from the five epileptic patients whom were undergoing presurgical evaluations. The first two sets were obtained during seizure free intervals (interictal) through electrodes placed both within the epileptogenic zone and opposite the epileptogenic zone of the brain. The last set was recorded within the epileptogenic zone when the patients were having seizure activity (ictal). A summary of the EEG recordings is provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. There were a total of 400 single channel EEG epochs (windows) in the data set out of which 300 were normal (including interictal EEG) and 100 were epileptic. Each epoch consisted of a 23.6 s long EEG recording. The recordings were collected using a 128-channel amplifier system and digitized at 173.61 Hz sampling rate and 12-bit A/D resolution.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Wavelet packet analysis and ApEn-based feature extraction</head><p>The EEG recordings were decomposed into various frequency bands through a fourth-level WPD. The decomposition filters are usually con-structed from the Haar or other sharp mother wavelets when the data has discontinuities. Smoother wavelets like the Daubechies (Db) are used, otherwise. Based on the analysis of the data, Db2 mother wavelet was used in the decomposition. Similar classification results can be obtained with other mother wavelets from the Db family. Secondlevel wavelet decomposition of a sample ictal EEG epoch is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> To get the third-and the fourth-level coefficients, the same decomposition procedure must be continued from the second level as explained in the preceding section.</p><p>ApEn value of the coefficients at each node of the decomposition structure was computed as a feature representing the regularity or the predictability of the coefficients at that node. The embedding dimension (m), vector comparison distance (r) and the time delay (t) parameters of the ApEn were set to 2, 0.15 times the standard deviation of the coefficients and 1, respectively, based on suggestions by Pincus <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. There are a total of 31 nodes in a fourth-level wavelet decomposition structure including the root (level 0). Thus, the feature set for a single epoch consisted of 31 features. The normal and epileptic EEG recordings consisted of 300 and 100 epochs, respectively. As a result, the feature matrices for the normal and the epileptic EEG were 31 Â 300 and 31 Â 100 in size, respectively. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">GA-based optimal feature set selection for classification</head><p>In this work, classification of normal and epileptic epochs for a given feature subset was realized using Kohonen's LVQ scheme. There were two main reasons why LVQ-based classifier was picked among others: its speed and comparable accuracy. The computational speed of LVQ in training as well as in classification is superior to NN. Yet, its classification accuracy has been demonstrated to be as high as any NN algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Fifty percent of the epochs from both normal and epileptic EEG were randomly selected to compose the training data set, which was used to train the LVQ clusters. The trained LVQ clusters were then tested using both the training and the complete data set.</p><p>Finding the optimum feature subset that maximizes the classification rates of normal and epileptic EEG is an almost impossible task unless a robust optimization scheme is used. The GA was used for searching the optimal feature subset. The population size was set to 20. Each individual consisted of 31 genes each of which representing a different node in the WPD structure. The genes were allowed to take either a 0 or 1 as a value. A value of 1 implied that the corresponding node would be included in the feature subset. The node would be excluded from the feature subset if its gene value was set to 0. The 20 individuals in the first generation were randomly generated. The fitness value of an individual or a chromosome was computed as</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTICLE IN PRESS</head><formula xml:id="formula_4">f ¼ e 1 þ e 2 2 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where e 1 and e 2 are the misclassification rates of the LVQ classifier in percentages for the normal and the epileptic EEG, respectively, based on the feature subset the chromosome is representing. The GA was set to minimize this fitness function. Two of the individuals (elites) in the current generation were quarantined to survive to the next generation without any modification to their genes. In each generation, 80% of the individuals in the population excluding the elites were created through the crossover operation. The remaining 20% were generated through mutation.</p><p>The algorithm was allowed to run for a maximum of 100 generations. The stop criteria for the algorithm were set such that the algorithm would halt if there were no improvements in the fitness values for 20 consecutive generations or for the last 5 min.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Results using wavelet packet analysis and ApEn</head><p>Fourth-level WPD was applied to both normal and epileptic EEG epochs. There are a total of 31 nodes in the wavelet decomposition structure. Around 400 ApEn (100 normal to 300 seizure) values were computed for each node. As an example, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> demonstrates the ApEn values computed for the DA coefficients at fifth node of the decomposition tree. This node corresponds to the frequency band from 21.7 to 43.4 Hz. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, the ApEn values for the epileptic EEG epochs are marked with diamonds whereas the ApEn values for the normal and interrictal EEG epochs acquired within the and opposite to epileptogenic zone of the brain are marked with 'x', '*' and '+', respectively. It was observed that the ApEn values for the epileptic epochs were lower compared with the values for the normal epochs including the interictal ones. This implies that epileptic EEG is more regular or predictable than the normal EEG within this analysis band.</p><p>To classify normal and epileptic epochs, two clusters were trained using all the available features based on an LVQ clustering scheme. The corresponding classification rates are provided in the first row of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Given the definition of classification accuracy in the first section, true negatives and true positives for the classifier correspond to classification accuracies for normal and epileptic EEG, respectively. False positives and false negatives correspond to misclassification rates for normal and epileptic EEG, respectively. Misclassification rate is simply equal to 100-classification accuracy. Normal and epileptic epochs in the training data set were classified accurately with 88.7% and 90%, respectively. The classification rates for the full data set were 87% and 89% for the normal and epileptic epochs, respectively. As a second test, a feature subset was randomly selected from the entire set, and LVQ algorithm was allowed to run for the new feature subset. This was repeated for 20 times and the average classification rates were computed. The resulting classification rates for this test are given in the second row of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. In the training data set, 90.5% and 87% of the normal and epileptic epochs were classified accurately, respectively. The classification rates for the full data set were 90.2% and 86.8% for the normal and epileptic epochs, respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.2.</head><p>Results after selecting the optimal feature set using the GA</p><p>The population size for the GA was chosen to be 20 and the algorithm was allowed to run for a maximum of 100 generations. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> depicts the value of the fitness function for the most and the least fit individuals along with the mean for the population as a function of the generation. The bars in the bottom and the top of the figure show the fitness scores of the best and worst individuals in the population as a function of generation. The line plots in the middle show the mean of the fitness scores for all the individuals in the population. It can be observed that, over successive generations the population evolved toward a set of more optimal or fit individuals (solutions). New generations of individuals, on average, contain more good genes than a typical solution in a previous generation. Convergence was achieved at the end of the 42 generation. The optimal feature subset found by the GA is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. The shaded nodes were the ones that contributed the optimal feature subset while the remaining nodes were the ones that were excluded from the set. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the    <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Most fit chromosome (opt. feature subset) found using the GA. Shaded nodes contributed the optimal feature subset while the remaining ones were excluded from the set. classification rates of the LVQ classifier trained with the GA found optimal feature subset. Normal and epileptic epochs in the training data set were classified accurately with 95.3% and 98%, respectively. The classification rates for the full data set were 94.3% and 98% for the normal and epileptic epochs, respectively. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> shows the number of epochs classified correctly along with the number of misclassified epochs for the normal and the epileptic EEG. As the results depict, all of the normal epochs misclassified as epileptic belong to the class of interictal EEG collected from the epileptogenic zone of the brain. This is not surprising since interictal EEG might also have spikes similar to ones observed during seizure activity, which makes the epochs look more like epileptic than normal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTICLE IN PRESS</head><p>Setting the GA parameters properly is very important for searching the optimal point in a complex optimization surface as in this case. Using selection alone based on the fitness scores without the crossover and mutation operators will tend to fill the population with copies of the best individual from the population and will have a negative effect on the convergence. Using selection and crossover operators without mutation will tend to cause the algorithm to converge on a good but sub-optimal solution. Using mutation alone is similar to a random search through the search space. On the other hand, using selection and mutation creates a parallel, noise-tolerant, hill-climbing algorithm. In this study, the crossover and the mutation rates were set to 80% and 20%, respectively. This implies that in each generation, 80% of the individuals in the population excluding the elites were created through the crossover operation and the remaining 20% were generated through mutation. The selection process was realized through setting the number of elites parameter to two. Mutation was necessary to assure that the algorithm would not just do a parallel hill climbing type of search starting from the initial solutions. Including mutation allowed for the random addition of new candidates throughout the search space. However, increasing the rate of mutation would increase the random behavior of the search and thus negatively affect the convergence. The GA parameter values used were found to be the optimal choice for the problem in hand.</p><p>Although the proposed technique was proven to be very reliable in classifying epileptic seizures, it has its limitations. The LVQ classifier needs to be trained before it can be used in an automated seizure detection application. In this training phase, a visual scorer must manually mark the EEG epochs as normal or epileptic. Based on the scores from the visual scorer, the LVQ classifier must be trained using the optimal features selected by the GA. The second limitation of the proposed technique is its slow computational speed because of ApEn computations. Although ApEn is a very powerful tool that extracts useful information from EEG, it is computationally very expensive. As a result, an automated seizure detection system can be implemented offline only using the new scheme.</p></div>

Fourth-level wavelet decomposition was applied to EEG acquired from normal subjects and epileptic patients.
