<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Accurate visualization and quantification of the human vasculature is an important prerequisite for a number of clinical procedures. Grading of stenoses is important in the diagnosis of the severity of vascular disease since it determines the treatment therapy. Interventional procedures such as the placement of a prosthesis in order to prevent aneurysm rupture or a bypass operation require an accurate insight into the three dimensional vessel architecture.</p><p>Both two-dimensional projection techniques, such as DSA, and three-dimensional modalities as X-ray rotational angiography, CTA and MRA are employed in clinical practice. Although CTA and MRA provide volumetric data, the common way of interpreting these images is by using a maximum intensity projection.</p><p>The main drawbacks of maximum intensity projections are the overlap of non-vascular structures and the fact that small vessels with low contrast are hardly visible. This has been a main limitation in time-of-flight MRA <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In contrast enhanced MRA <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> the delineation of these vessels is considerably improved, but other organs can be still projected over the arteries.</p><p>The purpose of this paper is to enhance vessel structures with the eventual goal of vessel segmentation. A vessel enhancement procedure as a preprocessing step for maximum intensity projection display will improve small vessel delineation and reduce organ overprojection. Segmentation of the vascular tree will facilitate volumetric display and will enable quantitative measurements of vascular morphology.</p><p>There are several approaches to vessel enhancement. Some of them work at a fixed scale and use (nonlinear) combinations of finite difference operators applied in a set of orientations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Orkisz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> presents a method that applies a median filter in the direction of the vessel. All these methods have shown problems to detect vessels over a large size range since they perform a fixed scale analysis. Moreover, to handle voxel anisotropy, these methods usually need to resample the dataset or to resource to 2 1  2 D processing (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>). Multi-scale approaches to vessel enhancement include "cores" <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, steerable filters <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>, and assessment of local orientation via eigenvalue analysis of the Hessian matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</p><p>The multiscale approach we discuss in this paper is inspired by the work of Sato et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and Lorenz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> who use the eigenvalues of the Hessian to determine locally the likelihood that a vessel is present. We modify their approach by considering all eigenvalues and giving the vesselness measure an intuitive, geometric interpretation. Examples on medical image data are included.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Method</head><p>In our approach we conceive vessel enhancement as a filtering process that searches for geometrical structures which can be regarded as tubular. Since vessels appear in different sizes it is important to introduce a measurement scale which varies within a certain range.</p><p>A common approach to analyze the local behavior of an image, L, is to consider its Taylor expansion in the neighborhood of a point x o ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">L(x o + δx o , s) ≈ L(x o , s) + δx T o ∇ o,s + δx T o H o,s δx o<label>(1)</label></formula><p>This expansion approximates the structure of the image up to second order. ∇ o,s and H o,s are the gradient vector and Hessian matrix of the image computed in x o at scale s. To calculate these differential operators of L in a well-posed fashion we use concepts of linear scale space theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. In this framework differentiation is defined as a convolution with derivatives of Gaussians:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∂ ∂x L(x, s) = s γ L(x) * ∂ ∂x G(x, s)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where the D-dimensional Gaussian is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">G(x, s) = 1 (2πs 2 ) D e -x 2 2s 2<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The parameter γ was introduced by Lindeberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> to define a family of normalized derivatives. This normalization is particularly important for a fair comparison of the response of differential operators at multiple scales. When no scale is preferred γ should be set to unity. Analyzing the second order information (Hessian) has an intuitive justification in the context of vessel detection. The second derivative of a Gaussian kernel at scale s generates a probe kernel that measures the contrast between the regions inside and outside the range (-s,s) in the direction of the derivative (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). This approach is the one followed in this work. The third term in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) gives the second order directional derivative,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">δx T o H o,s δx o = ( ∂ ∂δx o )( ∂ ∂δx o )L(x o , s)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The idea behind eigenvalue analysis of the Hessian is to extract the principal directions in which the local second order structure of the image can be decomposed. Since this directly gives the direction of smallest curvature (along the vessel) application of several filters in multiple orientations is avoided. This latter approach is computationally more expensive and requires a discretization of the orientation space. Let λ s,k denote the eigenvalue corresponding to the k-th normalized eigenvector ûs,k of the Hessian H o,s , all computed at scale s. From the definition of eigenvalues:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">H o,s ûs,k = λ s,k ûs,k<label>(5)</label></formula><p>and it follows that</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ûT s,k H o,s ûs,k = λ s,k<label>(6)</label></formula><p>By analyzing Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>) a nice geometric interpretation arises. The eigenvalue decomposition extracts three orthonormal directions which are invariant up to a scaling factor when mapped by the Hessian matrix. In particular, a spherical neighborhood centered at x o with radius 1, N xo , will be mapped by H o onto an ellipsoid whose axes are along the directions given by the eigenvectors of the Hessian and the corresponding axis' semi-lengths are the magnitudes of the respective eigenvalues. This ellipsoid locally describes the second order structure of the image (thus we coin it second order ellipsoid -figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1-</ref>) and can be used as an intuitive tool for the design of geometric similarity measures.</p><p>In the remainder of the paper λ k will be the eigenvalue with the k-th smallest magnitude (|λ 1 | ≤ |λ 2 | ≤ |λ 3 |). Under this assumption Table <ref type="table">1</ref> summarizes the relations that must hold between the eigenvalues of the Hessian for the detection of different structures. In particular, a pixel belonging to a vessel region will be signaled by λ 1 being small (ideally zero), and λ 2 and λ 3 of a large magnitude and equal sign (the sign is an indicator of brightness/darkness). The respective eigenvectors point out singular directions: û1 indicates the direction along the vessel (minimum intensity variation) and û2 and û3 form a base for the orthogonal plane. We are interested in "vesselness" measures suited for medical images. In MRA and CTA, vessels emerge as bright tubular structures in a darker environment. This prior information related to the imaging modality can be used as a consistency check to discard structures present in the dataset with a polarity different than the one sought. Accordingly, we shall look for structures whose λ 2 and λ 3 are both simultaneously negative.</p><p>To summarize, for an ideal tubular structure in a 3D image:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">|λ 1 | ≈ 0 (7) |λ 1 | ≪ |λ 2 | (8) λ 2 ≈ λ 3 (9)</formula><p>and the sign of λ 2 and λ 3 indicate its polarity. We emphasize that all three eigenvalues play an important role in the discrimination of the local orientation pattern. This will yield expressions that differ from the similarity measures proposed by Sato et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and Lorenz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> who only make use of two eigenvalues in their respective 3D line filters. In particular, Sato's approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> uses a different eigenvalue ordering scheme: they are sorted in increasing value (not absolute value), and only the two largest are considered in the line filter. This implies that dark and bright lines are not treated in a similar manner.</p><p>Our dissimilarity measure takes into account two geometric ratios based on the second order ellipsoid. The first ratio accounts for the deviation from a blob-like structure but cannot distinguish between a line-and a plate-like pattern:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">R B = Volume/(4π/3) (Largest Cross Section Area/π) 3/2 = |λ 1 | |λ 2 λ 3 |<label>(10)</label></formula><p>This ratio attains its maximum for a blob-like structure and is zero whenever λ 1 ≈ 0, or λ 1 and λ 2 tend to vanish (notice that λ 1 /λ 2 remains bounded even when the second eigenvalue is very small since its magnitude is always larger than the first).</p><p>The second ratio refers to the largest area cross section of the ellipsoid (in the plane orthogonal to û1 ) and accounts for the aspect ratio of the two largest second order derivatives. This ratio is essential for distinguishing between plate-like and line-like structures since only in the latter case it will be zero,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">R A = (Largest Cross Section Area)/π (Largest Axis Semi-length) 2 = |λ 2 | |λ 3 |<label>(11)</label></formula><p>The two geometric ratios we introduced so far are grey-level invariant (i.e., they remain constant under intensity re-scalings). This ensures that our measures only capture the geometric information of the image. However, in MRA and CTA images there is additional knowledge available: vessel structures are brighter than the background and occupy a (relatively) small volume of the whole dataset. If this information is not incorporated background pixels would produce an unpredictable filter response due to random noise fluctuations. However, a distinguishing property of background pixels is that the magnitude of the derivatives (and thus the eigenvalues) is small, at least for typical signal-to-noise ratios present in acquired datasets. To quantify this we propose the use of the norm of the Hessian. We use the Frobenius matrix norm since it has a simple expression in terms of the eigenvalues when the matrix is real and symmetric. Hence we define the following measure of "second order structureness",</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">S = H F = j≤D λ 2 j (12)</formula><p>where D is the dimension of the image. This measure will be low in the background where no structure is present and the eigenvalues are small for the lack of contrast. In regions with high contrast compared to the background, the norm will become larger since at least one of the eigenvalues will be large. We therefore propose the following combination of the components to define a vesselness function,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">V o (s) = 0 if λ 2 &gt; 0 or λ 3 &gt; 0, (1 -exp -RA 2 2α 2 ) exp -RB 2 2β 2 (1 -exp -S 2 2c 2 ) (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>where α, β and c are thresholds which control the sensitivity of the line filter to the measures R A , R B and S. The idea behind this expression is to map the features in Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">10</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) into probability-like estimates of vesselness according to different criteria. We combine the different criteria using their product to ensure that the response of the filter is maximal only if all three criteria are fulfilled. In all the results presented in this work α and β were fixed to 0.5. The value of the threshold c depends on the grey-scale range of the image and half the value of the maximum Hessian norm has proven to work in most cases. However, future research will be directed towards automating this threshold selection. We expect that this threshold can be fixed for a given application where images are routinely acquired according to a standard protocol. The vesselness measure in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">13</ref>) is analyzed at different scales, s. The response of the line filter will be maximum at a scale that approximately matches the size of the vessel to detect. We integrate the vesselness measure provided by the filter response at different scales to obtain a final estimate of vesselness:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">V o (γ) = max smin≤s≤smax V o (s, γ)<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where s min and s max are the maximum and minimum scales at which relevant structures are expected to be found. They can be chosen so that they will cover the range of vessel widths.</p><p>For 2D images we propose the following vesselness measure which follows from the same reasoning as in 3D,</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">V o (s) = 0 if λ 2 &gt; 0, exp -RB 2 2β 2 (1 -exp -S 2 2c 2 )<label>(15)</label></formula><p>Here, R B = λ 1 /λ 2 is the blobness measure in 2D and accounts for the eccentricity of the second order ellipse. Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">13</ref>) and (15) are given for bright curvilinear structures (MRA and CTA). For dark objects (as in DSA) the conditions (or the images) should be reversed. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">2D DSA images</head><p>In this section we show some results of vessel enhancement filtering in 2D DSA images. These images are obtained by acquiring an X-ray projection when intra-arterial contrast material is injected. A reference image is first acquired without contrast, which is subtracted from the image with contrast for background suppression. If no motion artifacts are present the subtracted images are of such good quality, that further processing is not desirable. We therefore only apply our enhancement filter to the contrast images directly, and use the subtracted images to be able to judge the performance of the vessel enhancement filter.</p><p>In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, a part of an image of the peripheral vasculature is shown, where performance of subtraction is usually quite good. Although contrast is not very high in the contrast images, the method detects most vessels, over a large size range. Notice however that some artifacts where introduced in regions where background fluctuations have line patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">3D MRA images</head><p>We have applied our method to three-dimensional aortoiliac MRA datasets, to show the potential of enhancement filtering to improve visualization of the vasculature. In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> (left) we show a maximum intensity projection which is applied directly to the greyscale data of an MRA dataset of the aortoiliac arteries. By determining the vesselness of the MRA image at multiple scales we obtain separate images depicting vessels of various widths. This is shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. Here we plotted maximum intensity projections of the vesselness at four scales. The rightmost image shows how we can combine these multiscale measurements by using a scale selection procedure (recall that we work with normalized derivatives), eventually yielding a display of both the small and large vessels. The figure also shows that small and large vessels can be distinguished, which can for example be used in artery/vein segmentation. Since the enhancement filtering does not give a high output at other structures, additional information can more easily be visualized. In the middle frame of figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> we show the maximum intensity projection which is obtained after vessel enhancement filtering. In the right frame a closest vessel projection is shown. In this case, it is possible to determine the order in depth of various vascular structures. The excellent noise and background suppression provided by the vesselness measure greatly facilitates the use  of a closest vessel projection. In order to compare the results of the vessel enhancement procedure with renderings obtained using a threshold on the original image, we show both renderings in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. We see that the original image has more background disturbance. However, the vessels tend to be narrower in the vessel enhancement image compared to the original dataset. This is due to the fact that at the boundaries of vessels the vesselness is not very high. The vessel enhancement filtering should be used in a subsequent segmentation procedure for obtaining quantitative measurements on the vasculature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>We have presented a method for vessel enhancement filtering which is based on local structure. To this end we examined the local second order ellipsoid. Since we use information about all axes of the second order ellipsoid (all eigenvalues), the approach is a generalization of other existing approaches on the use of second order information for line detection. Recently, Sato et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and Lorenz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> used eigenvalue analysis of the Hessian for vessel enhancement, but they did not use all eigenvalues simultaneously. We have shown the excellent noise and background suppression in a two clinical image modalities, underlying the potential of the approach.</p><p>It is important to realize that we do not obtain a segmentation of the vasculature. Only if an accurate model of the typical luminance in the perpendicular direction of the vessel is known, an estimate of the size of the vessel can be made based on the response of the filter over scales. However this is often not the case. For example, in MRI it is common to reduce the reconstruction time by restricting the number of lines in k-space (scan percentage) which accounts for a reduction of the effective Fourier spectrum of the measured signal. This technique can lead to ringing artifacts (overshoot) in high transition steps (for example, in vessels boundaries) thus violating simplified profile models (Gaussian/bar-like <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>). The vesselness measure can serve as a preprocessing step for segmentation of this type of images. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>3 Fig. 1 .</head><label>31</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
