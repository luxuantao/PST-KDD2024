<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Evolutionary algorithms are effective in solving static multiobjective optimization problems resulting in the emergence of a number of state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). Nevertheless, the interest in applying them to solve dynamic multiobjective optimization problems has only been tepid. Benchmark problems, appropriate performance metrics, as well as efficient algorithms are required to further the research in this field. One or more objectives may change with time in dynamic optimization problems. The optimization algorithm must be able to track the moving optima efficiently. A prediction model can learn the patterns from past experience and predict future changes. In this paper, a new dynamic MOEA using Kalman filter (KF) predictions in decision space is proposed to solve the aforementioned problems. The predictions help to guide the search toward the changed optima, thereby accelerating convergence. A scoring scheme is devised to hybridize the KF prediction with a random reinitialization method. Experimental results and performance comparisons with other state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of significantly improving the dynamic optimization performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>M ULTIOBJECTIVE optimization (MO) involves finding a set of tradeoff solutions by optimizing conflicting objectives simultaneously. Most real-world problems are multiobjective in nature. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) which evolve multiple solutions in a single run are good candidates to solve MO problems compared to classical methods such as gradient descent and simulated annealing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Various multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that exist are capable of attaining the MO goals of convergence and diversity with high efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Many-objective optimization is one of the recent topics that has gathered evolutionary computation researchers' attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In addition to multiobjectivity and many-objectivity, real-world optimization problems have various uncertainties <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and dynamics which need to be handled effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. These uncertainties and dynamics can occur in the form of fluctuating stock prices in financial markets, new jobs or breakdown of machines in a production line, and inflation of component costs in a design scenario <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Instances of dynamic problems in the literature are dynamic job shop scheduling <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, hydro thermal power scheduling <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, war resource allocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and unmanned aerial vehicle online path planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, to name a few.</p><p>While static MO and dynamic single-objective optimization problems are addressed using EAs, little attention was given to dynamic MO problems until recently. The objective functions, constraints, and decision variables may vary with time in dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs). EAs are useful in solving DMOPs as they are inspired by natural evolution which is a continuous process of adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Traditional EAs once converged, cannot adapt quickly to environmental changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Speed of convergence is considered an important issue in dynamic MO <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. An ideal dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (DMOEA) must possess fast convergence capabilities to track the varying optimum solutions effectively either through inherent design or by incorporating additional dynamic handling techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Changes in dynamic environments may exhibit some patterns that are predictable. Consequently, from the past optimum solutions, subsequent changes based on the patterns exhibited can be predicted. In this paper, a novel prediction mechanism using Kalman filter (KF) is proposed for solving DMOPs.</p><p>The number of state estimation and tracking applications in which KF has been applied cannot be overstated <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Genetic algorithms (GAs) have been traditionally used to tune the parameters of KF in a variety of applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. KF has also been used with EAs in noisy objective evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> in an MO context. Hybridization of GA and KF for optimization problems is not uncommon <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. A vision-based tracking robotic application in a dynamic singleobjective optimization context used GAs to search for the optimum together with KF to incorporate motion information <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>KF is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, containing noise, and other inaccuracies, and produces statistically optimal estimates of the underlying system state <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The algorithm works in a two-step process involving a prediction step and a measurement step. In the prediction step, the KF estimates the current state a priori. Once the subsequent measurement is obtained, the a priori estimates from the KF are updated to obtain the a posteriori estimates. The KF can run in real-time, thereby making it a good candidate for the prediction model in solving DMOPs. In the proposed algorithm, the linear discrete time KF <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> is applied to the whole population to direct the search for Pareto-optimal solutions (POS) in the decision space after a change has occurred. Although nonlinear formulations of the KF are available by means of the extended KF and unscented KF <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, the state-transition and observation matrices which are required in the prediction and update steps are formed by Jacobian (matrix containing partial derivatives of f with respect to x) of the nonlinear functions, which are not directly available to us. Though particle filters may give better results for nonlinear conditions, it would come at the price of large computational cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Thus, considering the optimal state estimation performance of KF in linear conditions and its low computational cost, we use the KF over other methods for predicting the Pareto-optimal sets in this paper.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II provides background on dynamic MO. Section III presents the proposed algorithm. The underlying MOEA, MOEA with Decomposition based on Differential Evolution (MOEA/D-DE), and the KF-based prediction method are also elaborated. Section IV describes the experiment results and performance comparisons. Section V provides the discussion and analysis. Section VI concludes this paper and potential future research directions are highlighted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. BACKGROUND</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Definitions</head><p>The DMOP can be formally defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">minimize x f(x, t) = f 1 (x, t), . . . , f m (x, t) T subject to x ∈ (1)</formula><p>where t represents the time index, x ∈ R n represents the decision vector, n is the number of decision variables, and ⊂ R n represents the decision space, which may also change with time in the presence of time-varying constraints. m is the number of objectives, R m is the objective space, and f (x, t) consists of m real-valued objective functions, each of which is continuous with respect to x over .</p><p>Based on whether the Pareto-optimal front (POF) or POS changes, the DMOP is classified into four types <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> (Table <ref type="table">I</ref>).</p><p>Few benchmark problems have been proposed recently such as Farina Deb Amato (FDA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and dMOP <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. The dynamics of the FDA and related test functions are governed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">t = 1 n t τ τ T (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>where τ is the generation counter, τ T is the number of generations for which t remains the same, and n t is the number of distinct steps in t. τ T determines the frequency of change and n t determines the severity of change in a problem. A smaller value of n t means larger change, whereas a smaller value of τ T means more frequent occurrence of changes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Related Work</head><p>Many methods have been proposed and investigated in the past, not restricted to evolutionary dynamic MO. The main approaches suggested include the following.</p><p>1) Diversity introduction after a change <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>2) Diversity maintenance throughout the run <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p><p>3) Memory approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. 4) Prediction approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. 5) Self-adaptive methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. 6) Multipopulation approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. The above approaches have been well investigated in evolutionary dynamic single-objective optimization, but only a few strategies have been proposed to solve DMOPs. Farina et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> proposed a direction-based hybrid algorithm based on evolutionary strategies and deterministic local search to increase the convergence speed by searching for nadir points, utopia points, and payoff matrix. This is followed by searching for uniformly distributed solutions between the utopia points. The optimization process is restarted when change is detected. Deb et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> extended the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) to evolutionary DMO by proposing to solve a hydro-thermal power scheduling problem. Ten percent of the population is reevaluated at the start of each generation to check for changes. Adaptation to dynamic environments is achieved either by following the random immigrants strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> or by hypermutation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>Orthogonal design methodology has been incorporated in dynamic orthogonal MOEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> to improve convergence. Dynamic queuing multiobjective optimizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> exploits past information by employing an autoregressive model to estimate the location of the changed Pareto-optimal set and the predicted individuals are used to seed the new population after a landscape change is detected. In contrast, changing dimension of objective space is also accounted for in the development of MO immune algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, where a novel algorithm suitable for DMO problems is proposed based on Pareto dominance and immune functions of the germinal center in the immune system. A new coevolutionary paradigm is proposed by Goh and Tan <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> that hybridizes competitive and cooperative mechanisms observed in nature to solve MO problems and to track the Pareto front in a dynamic environment. The aforementioned approach falls under the multipopulation category, wherein a number of subpopulations compete with each other to find the best solutions for their subcomponent. Finally, they cooperate to evolve for better solutions thereby enabling the algorithm to adapt and emerge better solutions in dynamic environments. DMOPs have also been solved by particle swarm optimization methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p><p>A few algorithms based on the prediction strategy seemed to have become increasingly popular. Koo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> proposed a prediction strategy, wherein a predictive gradient (predicted direction and magnitude of the next change) is estimated based on the history of previously discovered solutions using a weighted average approach. A new memory technique is introduced to exploit any periodicity in the dynamic problem. The importance of utilizing history information to guide future search is further highlighted by Aimin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> in their feedforward prediction strategy (FPS) and population prediction strategy (PPS) algorithm proposals. FPS uses a simple linear prediction model to predict the location of the individual for the next change. Four types of reinitialization procedures are experimented with FPS-random reinitialization, variation (perturbing the individuals by an amount estimated from previous changes), prediction, and a hybrid of the previous two methods. In PPS, an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) together with autoregressive time series forecasting technique is proposed. This algorithm uses the properties of DMOPs by modeling the changing Paretooptimal set as a center point and manifold. The movement of centers is learnt by maintaining a sequence of center points by the time series model and the previous two manifolds are used to estimate the subsequent manifold.</p><p>While research on dynamic single-objective optimization has been extensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, algorithms proposed to solve DMOPs are only a handful. Furthermore, usage of powerful prediction techniques to assist EAs in solving DMOPs has not been fully explored yet. Many of the prediction techniques require a training or learning time before which they can be used for tracking the changing POF/POS. KF can estimate the state of a process without any such learning time. It can predict from the start and correct itself based on subsequently made measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel DMOEA algorithm based on KF predictions in the decision space, which also extends our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> on KF-based DMOEA. Furthermore, while employing this prediction approach as the tracking technique, other approaches, such as diversity maintenance/introduction and memory, can also be used simultaneously to build more efficient algorithms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm With Decomposition Based on Differential Evolution</head><p>The prediction model of KF proposed is built on the structure of MOEA/D-DE <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. MOEA/D-DE has received significant attention due to its good optimization performance in solving continuous MO problems with relatively fast convergence and diverse spread. The algorithm decomposes a problem into several subproblems and simultaneously optimizes them using neighborhood relations. The neighborhood relations are defined based on the distances among their weight vectors. The decomposition is performed using classical approaches, such as the Tchebycheff approach or the weighted-sum approach. The Tchebycheff approach is used in this paper due to its simplicity and decent optimization performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Kalman Filter Prediction Model</head><p>The KF estimates a process by using a form of feedback control. The filter estimates the process state at some time and then obtains feedback in the form of (noisy) measurements. The discrete KF is employed in this paper. The equations for the discrete KF fall into two groups: 1) time update equations and 2) measurement update equations. The time update equations, which can be thought of as predictor equations, are responsible for projecting forward in time the current state and the error covariance estimates to obtain the a priori estimates for the next time step. The measurement equations can be thought of as corrector equations and are responsible for the feedback wherein they incorporate a new measurement into the a priori estimate to obtain an improved a posteriori estimate. IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS The linear discrete time KF is used to predict the location(s) of the Pareto-optimal set after a change is detected in the problem.

K is the KF gain.</p><p>As shown, the current estimates are made using only the previous predictions and the current observation. There are two variants of KFs designed for prediction, a 2-D KF (2by2KF) and a 3-D KF (3by3KF). In both the variants, the observation matrix is the identity matrix, since the decision variables can be directly measured from the EA. Furthermore, there are no control inputs in the system. The process and observation noise are Gaussian noise of zero mean and assumed variance. The corresponding covariance matrices Q and R can be calculated.</p><p>1) 2by2 Kalman Filter: The state vector is</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">X = x v T (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>where x is the vector for the decision variables and v is the vector of the first-order change in the decision variables. The state-transition model used is</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">A = 1 1 0 1 (11)</formula><p>and the covariance of state vectors is initialized as</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">P 0 = 1 0 0 1 . (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>In this case, the KF is a first-order linear model perturbed by Gaussian noise. The initial covariance P 0 suggests some uncertainty in the initial state vectors, which is adaptive and will be updated as time proceeds. Noise cannot be modeled exactly in this context and assumed to be a constant Gaussian noise. 2) 3by3 Kalman Filter: The state vector in this case is</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">X = x v a T (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>where x and v are the same as in 2by2KF and a is the vector of the second-order change in the decision variables. The statetransition model used is</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">A = ⎡ ⎣ 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 ⎤ ⎦<label>(14)</label></formula><p>and the covariance of state vectors is initialized as</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">P 0 = ⎡ ⎣ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ⎤ ⎦ . (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">)</formula><p>In this case, the KF is a second-order linear model perturbed by Gaussian noise. According to the state-transition model, the decision variables are updated by previous state and first-order rate of change only. The second-order vector a is controlled by the Gaussian noise and is only used to estimate the firstorder change term of the state vector, as can be deducted from the state-transition model. It is designed in this way to include more historical information but not greatly rely on it. Both the variants are discrete and linear KFs. Higher-order change is ignored in tradeoff for speed and computational resources.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Scoring Scheme</head><p>Since KF prediction makes the assumption of linear dynamic model of the system, it may cause some problems when the system violates the assumption. To circumvent such a situation, random reinitialization method (RND) is introduced into the algorithm. A SC is proposed to hybridize KF prediction and RND. The diagram illustrating the relationship of the SC with the proposed model is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>In order to allocate resources efficiently, the SC computes a score or proportion of using RND against KF prediction. A random number can then be generated and if it is smaller than this score, random reinitialization is used; otherwise, KF prediction is used. The procedure followed by the SC-based model is given in Algorithm 1 (see supplementary material).</p><p>To start with, the chance of producing one solution for the next generation is 50-50 between RND and KF prediction. The method used to produce each child solution is stored as an attribute of the individual. After a change is detected, the Euclidean distances from the solutions just before the change to the solutions after the previous change are computed and the average is taken. A smaller-than-average distance implies that the improvements made over generations by MOEA/D-DE are small. Therefore, the corresponding prediction method in use is likely to produce solutions closer to the POS in the current setting. The scores of both methods are recorded and normalized by the total number of solutions produced by each method. The overall score of random reinitialization to KF prediction is then calculated by dividing the reinitialization score to the sum of both scores.</p><p>The SC dynamically alters the probability of implementing either one of the methods, with the higher probability favoring the method that performs better in the previous prediction. It is to be noted that even if the random reinitialization model is used, the measurement update step of the KF model is still performed. This is to keep track of the changes in the system and update the model, in the case that the KF prediction model is used later for an individual.</p><p>The various steps of the proposed model to solve DMOP are shown in Algorithm 2 (see supplementary material) for clarity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Benchmark Problems</head><p>The proposed algorithm is tested on problems from three test benchmark suites-FDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, dMOP <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, and F <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. The FDA benchmark suite is commonly used in the performance evaluation of dynamic MO algorithms. It consists of five different problems pertaining to the different types of DMOP. Two of the problems (FDA3 and FDA5) have time varying density distribution of solutions along the Pareto front. The dMOP benchmark problems are an extension of the FDA benchmark suite to test further performance characteristics of dynamic MO algorithms such as learning that the POS/POF does not change. The problem suite proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> is very recent and consists of ten problems which are partly adopted from the above two benchmark suites. Nevertheless, they have also proposed six new test instances in which nonlinear linkages between the decision variables are considered and problems with sharp and irregular environments are also constructed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Parameter Settings</head><p>The proposed KF prediction model is implemented in MOEA/D-DE, which is referred as MOEA/D-KF for simplicity. The parameter settings for the experiments of the various test benchmark suites are tabulated in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>. The number of decision variables is set as 20 for all the test problems. FDA4, FDA5, and F8 are three-objective problems and are assigned a population size of 200 for better search capability, while the rest of the problems which are two-objective are assigned a population size of 100. The various parameters for MOEA/D-DE are implemented as guided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Ten detector individuals are utilized for change detection purpose.</p><p>An RND is implemented for baseline performance comparison of MOEA/D-KF. In this algorithm, instead of the KF prediction model, 20% of the population is randomly reinitialized after a change is detected.</p><p>The matrices of KF are initialized according to the description given in Section III-C. The Q and R diagonal matrices are with equal element values q and r, respectively, 0.04 and 0.01. These numbers are obtained by tuning the values of q and r for FDA1 resulting in best performance. The change frequency (τ T ) and severity (n t ) setting of the problems determine their difficulty. A reasonable setting of τ T = 30 and n t = 10 is used. Each algorithm is run 30 times for each test instance independently for 161 environmental changes in each run.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Performance Metrics</head><p>A number of metrics are in use for performance assessment of static MOEAs, which evaluate convergence and diversity quite effectively. These metrics have been modified for evaluating DMOEAs. The inverted generational distance (IGD) </p><formula xml:id="formula_23">)<label>17</label></formula><p>A lower value of IGD implies that the algorithm has better optimization performance. To obtain a low value of IGD, it can be seen from ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">17</ref>) that P t must be very close to POF t and cannot miss any part of POF t , thus measuring both convergence and diversity.</p><p>To adapt the IGD metric for dynamic MO <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, the average of the IGD values in some time steps over a run is taken as the performance metric, given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">MIGD = 1 |T| t∈T IGD P t * , P t (<label>18</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_25">)</formula><p>where T is a set of discrete time points (immediately before the change occurs) in a run and |T| is the cardinality of T. A lower value of the modified inverted generational distance (MIGD) metric would assist in evaluating the tracking ability, as the approximated Pareto front obtained from the algorithm with the changing POF is measured before every change. In total, 1000 and 2500 equidistant points along the POF, P t * , are chosen for computing the IGD metrics for bi-objective and tri-objective problems, respectively. Another performance metric that is proposed recently to evaluate the performance of MOEAs is the averaged Hausdorff distance proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Shortcomings of the previously widely used indicators, generational distance (GD) and IGD have been identified and a new indicator to measure the Hausdorff distance to the Pareto front is proposed from the corrected GD (GD p ) and IGD (IGD p ) metrics. The averaged Hausdorff distance p (X, Y) is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">p (X, Y) = max GD p (X, Y), IGD p (X, Y) = max ⎛ ⎝ 1 N N i=1 dist(x i , Y) p 1 /p , 1 M M i=1 dist(y i , X) p 1 /p ⎞ ⎠ (<label>19</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_27">)</formula><p>where X and Y are finite sets in the objective space <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. This metric is also modified similar to IGD to act as a performance metric for evaluating DMOEAs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Results</head><p>The statistical results of MIGD values for the various test benchmark problems are tabulated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref>.</p><p>The performance of the KF-based models are definitely much better than the performance of the simplistic RND method. This shows that the KF prediction model substantially enhances the MOEA adapted for dynamic optimization compared to the static MOEA with restart (partial) mechanism. Kalman3by3SC algorithm performs significantly better than the other KF-based models and RND in 6 out of the 13 problems. In FDA2 and dMOP1, the performance of the algorithms is comparable, as the POS remains the same. Thus, the RND and SC-based methods perform comparatively better in these type of problems. In general, SC-based method is better compared to standalone KF-based methods. The 3by3 variant in particular may be recommended, as second-order change is also taken into account, which may lead to better predictions. For more performance analysis on each problem, kindly refer to Sections V-A-C.</p><p>The KF prediction model predicts in the decision space and assists the EA in the tracking of the POS in dynamic environments. The prediction performance for the FDA1 problem is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref> (see supplementary material).</p><p>The left half of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref> (see supplementary material) depicts the objective space and the right half depicts the decision space. The POF in FDA1 problem remains fixed, while its Pareto-optimal set changes with time making it a type I DMOP <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. In the right half, the solid line represents the POS for the current time instant. In the following time instant, the POS would be shifted to the dotted line. The dotted and solid circles represent the current measurement and prediction estimate of the KF, respectively. It can be seen that the prediction estimate is quite close to the new POS, while the solutions obtained by MOEA/D-DE without the KF prediction method remain close to the previous POS. Furthermore, the MOEA/D's <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> weight vectors further assist the algorithm in getting a widely distributed set of solutions covering the entire front. Similar performance is observed in most of the other benchmark problems as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Performance Comparison With Other DMOEAs 1) Population Prediction Strategy:</head><p>The PPS formulated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> takes into consideration the properties of continuous DMOPs and is used to predict a whole population. The Pareto  set is divided into two parts: 1) a center point and 2) a manifold. A sequence of center points is maintained to predict the subsequent center, and the previous manifolds are used to estimate the subsequent manifold. The univariate autoregression model, a time series prediction method, is applied to forecast the next location of the center. The next manifold is obtained by studying the similarity between previous manifolds and estimating the variance which is subsequently used in solution generation. The source code for the PPS algorithm is obtained from <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> and the parameter settings are maintained in the simulations.</p><p>2) Dynamic NSGA-II: The original NSGA-II <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> is modified to handle DMOPs in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Ten percent of the population members are picked randomly from the parent population to act as change detector individuals similar to the change detection mechanism proposed in this paper. Two versions of dynamic NSGA-II are proposed. In the first version, DNSGA-II-A, a ζ % of the population is replaced with new random solutions whenever there is a change in the problem. In the second version, DNSGA-II-B, a ζ % of the population is replaced with mutated solutions of randomly chosen existing solutions, similar in principle to hypermutation-based GAs for single-objective optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. DNSGA-II-A is expected to perform better in problems undergoing a large change, while DNSGA-II-B may perform better in problems undergoing a small change. The source code of static NSGA-II is obtained from <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> and the two dynamic versions are implemented according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The ζ parameters for the two versions, which determine the portion of population reinitialized and the hypermutation rate for the second version, are tuned for the benchmark problems. The values used are ζ % of 20% and hypermutation rate η h of 0.5 which is much higher than the probability of mutation in normal use.</p><p>The statistical values of MIGD for the 3by3SC KF formulation in comparison with PPS, DNSGA-II-A, and DNSGA-II-B are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">IV</ref>.</p><p>Statistical test of T-test for independent samples is performed for the MIGD statistical values. The null hypothesis is that the proposed algorithm of Kalman prediction-based MOEA, MOEA/D-KF does not perform significantly better than the compared algorithms at the 95% significance level. However, the results tabulated show that the proposed algorithm performs significantly better than the compared algorithms in 7 out of the 13 benchmark problems.</p><p>The averaged Hausdorff distance statistics for the proposed algorithm, MOEA/D-KF with the Kalman third-order formulation, and the comparison strategies of RND and PPS are provided in Table <ref type="table">S1</ref> (see supplementary material). T-test is performed on these statistical values at the 95% significant level as well. It is observed that the MOEA/D-KF algorithm performs significantly better than the compared strategies in 9 out of the 13 problems. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. DISCUSSION</head><p>In this section, the results on various benchmark problems are elaborated and the analyses on parameter settings and influence of frequency of change are discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Results on FDA1-FDA5, dMOP1, and dMOP2</head><p>From Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">IV</ref> and<ref type="table">S1</ref> (see supplementary material), it is observed that the proposed KF prediction-based dynamic MOEA and MOEA/D-KF, performs significantly better than the other algorithms. MOEA/D-KF predicts the solution set much more efficiently than the second-best algorithm, PPS in almost all of the problems right from the beginning. PPS takes a significant amount of time (23 changes, which is the training time of the autoregressive filter prediction model in PPS) before providing reasonable results. This can be observed in the peaks in IGD values of PPS till just after 20 changes in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. The KF does not require any learning time and starts to provide reasonable predictions from the start of the run. The changing Pareto-optimal set of FDA1 and dMOP2 follows a sinusoidal pattern. The simple linear filter model, implemented as the prediction method in MOEA/D-KF, is able to provide reasonable performance except for those instants when the sinusoid changes direction and causes the IGD trend to follow patterns as shown in Figs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>and S2 (see supplementary material).</head><p>Both in FDA2 and in dMOP1, the optimal values of a number or all of the decision variables are observed to remain the same throughout a run. MOEA/D-KF and PPS produce stable results throughout the entire run where less fluctuations in IGD values are observed. FDA4 and FDA5 are threeobjective problems. The absolute values of MIGD obtained for FDA4 and FDA5 are slightly lower than those obtained for two-objective problems. In FDA3 and FDA5, the density of solutions along the Pareto front changes with time, thereby making the problems challenging. MOEA/D-KF has MOEA/D as the underlying MOEA, which produces an evenly distributed set of solutions throughout the evolution and tends to perform more consistently than PPS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Results on F5-F8</head><p>F5-F7 are type II DMOPs and have nonlinear linkages among the decision variables. It is observed that PPS performs significantly better than MOEA/D-KF. In spite of MOEA/D-KF's immediate results in the start, PPS is able to outperform MOEA/D-KF in later stages. It was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> that the underlying MOEA plays a significant role in the dynamic optimization performance of the algorithm. The underlying algorithm of PPS, regularity model-based multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, is an EDA which is able to learn linkages among decision variables. MOEA/D-KF's performance in problems with nonlinear linkages may be improved by hybridizing with state-of-the-art EDAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, wherein the superior optimization performance of decomposition-based approach in MOEA/D-DE and linkage learning in EDAs may be utilized simultaneously. The autoregressive time series used in PPS is able to provide more stable performance than the KF in MOEA/D-KF. F8 is a three-objective problem whose POF remains the same. For F8, MOEA/D-KF is able to outperform PPS throughout the 160 changes and the MIGD value obtained is significantly better (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">IV</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Results on F9 and F10</head><p>In all the previously discussed problems, the environment changes smoothly from one time instant to the next and the geometric shapes of two consecutive POFs/sets are similar to each other. Two more complicated problems, F9 and F10, are proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, to further test the performance of dynamic MOEAs. In F9, the Pareto set jumps from one area to another occasionally. The geometric shapes of consecutive POFs are completely different from each other in F10. The proposed strategy, MOEA/D-KF makes the assumption of a linear dynamical process in the KF formulation which is violated in F9. Therefore, it is not surprising that the performance of MOEA/D-KF is not on par with that of PPS. Nevertheless, it must be noted that the IGD values of PPS also follows a pattern similar to that of MOEA/D-KF, but are less affected by the jumps. In F10, MOEA/D-KF seems to perform better than PPS. This may be due to the fact that the KF does not make any assumptions about the shape of the Pareto fronts, while the PPS does so in the estimation of successive manifolds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Parameter Sensitivity</head><p>The model and parameters of KF may have a significant impact on MOEA/D-KF algorithm's performance. The linear dynamic model affects the tracking performance of the KF when there is a deviation from such an assumption. The Q and R matrices may have substantial effect on the prediction performance and thereby affecting the IGD values obtainable by MOEA/D-KF.</p><p>Q is defined as the process noise covariance matrix and quantitatively denotes the noise present in the "process" that the KF tries to estimate. Similarly, R is the measurement noise covariance matrix and denotes the amount of noise present in the "measurements" that are passed to the KF. The two matrices are assigned as diagonal matrices having diagonal element values of q and r, respectively. The results presented in Sections IV-D and IV-E are based on a single fixed pair of (q, r) = (0.04, 0.01) for all the test benchmark problems. In this section, the q and r values are varied from 0.01 to 0.1 in steps of 0.01, resulting in 100(10 × 10) combinations of values.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">V</ref> shows the lowest and highest MIGD values obtained by utilizing the 100 combinations of q and r values. Range of MIGD is given to demonstrate the impact of values on the performance. For less complicated problems, the range of MIGD is quite low. In these problems, the linear dynamical assumption of KF is not affected such as in FDA1, FDA2, dMOP1, and dMOP2. In the case of F9 and F10, the range of MIGD is substantially higher than those of the other problems. In F9, the Pareto set jumps from one area to another implying that the process is not as assumed by the KF model occasionally and therefore, subsequently causing fluctuations in performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Influence of Frequency of Change</head><p>Problem difficulty increases substantially with increase in the occurrence of change as the DMOEA has to frequently adapt the solutions to the moving optima. In this section, the frequency of change parameter is varied in steps of 10 and the box-plots of IGD values are obtained for MOEA/D-KF, PPS, and RND methods [Figs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> and S3 (see supplementary material)]. It is observed that the KF predictions result in better IGD values than the autoregressive filter predictions in PPS, even when the problem changes every ten generations.</p><p>RND and MOEA/D-KF have the same underlying MOEA and the difference is in the tracking mechanism. It is observed that the KF improves the performance of MOEA/D in most of the problems. In the case of complicated problems such as F5-F7, MOEA/D-KF's performance is comparable to that of PPS in spite of the advantage of EDA in PPS and is significantly better than that of RND. It is observed that in the case of the more complicated problems of F9 and F10, increasing the frequency of change has resulted in the KF-assisted MOEA/D outperforming the PPS strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>A novel DMOEA using KF predictions in the decision space is proposed. It is built on the MOEA/D framework and the linear discrete time KF is used to estimate the subsequent optimal values of decision variables. Change detection is performed through sentry particles and an SC is devised to hybridize the KF with the RND. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm shows significantly improved performances over a number of test benchmark problems. However, there is still scope for improvement of the dynamic optimization performance of the proposed methodology by combining with local search, diversity maintenance, direction-guided search, and other strategies, to name a few.</p><p>In future, it is aimed to explore the usage of the above mentioned strategies as well as considering the development of other novel prediction methods for solving DMOPs using EAs. In addition, it is also planned to implement the prediction methods in other multiobjective frameworks to evaluate the influence of the underlying framework in the prediction method.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
