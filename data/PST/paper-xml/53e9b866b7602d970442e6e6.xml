<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.0">Introduction</head><p>A number of proposals have been made i n order to compatibly add mobile IP nodes t o existing fixed node IP networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref> . This paper examines one of the schemes that has the least compatibility problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> with existing fixed-node IP networks . The schemes tha t have compatibility problems are based o n various uses of IP options <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref> . Since thes e options are not always dealt with properly i n the hosts and routers of the existing network , these schemes may not work properly with th e existing installed base of networks .</p><p>The compatible scheme, which is referre d to here as the Columbia scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, is base d on IP-in-IP encapsulation (tunneling) whic h allows it to avoid the problems related to I P options. This scheme works efficiently fo r small campus environments and intra-campus mobility. However, it reverts to highly suboptimal routes in case of inter-campu s mobility, as described below . This paper examines ways in which this scheme can b e extended to provide more optimal routes i n case of inter-campus mobility, which i s redefined here to mean wide-area mobility .</p><p>Essentially, our scheme is inspired by an d related to hierarchical fixed node routing, a s defined in OSPF <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> . A major differenc e between our scheme and hierarchical scheme s employed for fixed-node routing (such a s OSPF) is that mobility route update information is not flooded on unnecessary routes. Mobility route update information i s back-propagated on active communicatio n paths. This serves to minimize the load on the network due to control information . A two - level tunneling scheme is employed in order t o deliver IP packets to the wide-area mobile host . By envisioning special mobility suppor t functionality in routing entities at th e boundaries of the hierarchy, much mor e efficient routes are achieved to wide-are a mobile hosts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Brief Overview and Problems o f the Columbia Schem e</head><p>A brief overview of the Columbia schem e is provided here . Special routers, terme d Mobility Support Routers (or MSRs) manag e the tracking of mobile nodes and provide fo r the delivery of IP packets to these mobil e nodes . Mobile nodes reside on special I P "subnets", such that packets intended for tha t subnet end up being routed through an MSR . (MSRs advertise themselves as being directl y attached to this special "subnet") .</p><p>When an MSR receives a packet for a mobile node whose location it does not know , it multicasts out a WHO_HAS request to al l MSRs in its campus . (The term "campus" is no t well defined from a routing perspective . By default, it is the set of MSRs that cooperate in a certain manner.) A mobile node is alway s attached directly through one of the MSRs in the network. When this MSR receives the WHO_HAS request, it responds with a n I_HAVB packet, stating in effect that it i s serving that MH . The requesting MSR upo n learning of the present location of the MH encapsulates IP packets intended for the M H within IP packets intended for the respondin g MSR. This MSR then decapsulates the packet s and directly delivers them to MH, since it i s directly attached to the MH . This is in case th e MH is still within its home campus .</p><p>In case of inter-campus mobility (called a POPUP scenario), a specially designated MS R in the MH's home area serves to captur e packets intended for that MH . All packets intended for that MH from other campuses an d even from the campus where the MH i s presently in, are routed through the designate d MSR. This can lead to highly sub-optima l routes .</p><p>As an example, say a Stationary Host (SH ) wishes to send IP packets to an MH which has roamed to a subnet one-hop away from this SH . Also, say the MH's home campus is across th e country . Packets intended for this MH will be sent to the MH's home campus and tunnele d back across the country to the campus where the MH is . This results in two cross-country packet traversals, where the ideal route is just one-hop in length and does not require using a wide-area link.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.0">Hierarchical Mobile Routing an d Tunnelin g</head><p>The scheme proposed here define s campuses and routing in terms of concept s employed by hierarchical fixed-node routin g protocols like OSPF . We define "campus" here to be synonymous with an OSPF routin g "area" . This serves to limit the scope of a WHO_HAS query to a single OSPF routin g area. (Since OSPF is an intra-domain routin g protocol, this paper examines intra-domai n mobility only . It may be possible to extend the concepts presented in this paper in order to cover inter-domain mobility, but this is no t attempted here . )</p><p>We define a special form of router, terme d a Mobility Support Border Router (MSBR) . An MSBR is essentially the same as an OSPF Are a Border Router (BR) with extra functionality i n order to support tracking and delivery function s for inter-area mobility scenarios . This is a departure from the attempt in the Columbi a scheme to not require special functionalit y from routers . Changing the existin g infrastructure is (rightfully) considered a prohibitive task so schemes that can be phase d in without requiring large-scale changes i n existing routers are considered more deployable .</p><p>Any scheme that requires special functionality in all existing routers wil l probably be impossible to phase in, considerin g the large number of routers in existing IP networks. However, we consider specia l functionality for mobile units to be present onl y in special routers, those which presently serv e the BR function in OSPF . There is a much smaller number of routers that serve the B R function as compared to the total number o f routers in an Autonomous System (AS) . Th e number of routers serving the BR role scale s with the number of areas in an AS, whereas th e number of routers scales with the number of cables in the network . Thus requiring specia l functionality in BR routers is not considered a prohibitive task, since there will always be a much smaller number of these than the tota l number of routers in an AS .</p><p>To summarize, the existing set of Columbi a Mobile-IP protocols that perform intra-campu s routing serve the role of intra-area routing i n the scheme described in this paper . A campu s has been redefined to mean a routing area .W e now consider the case of mobile IP routing i n case of inter-area mobility .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.0">Various Inter-Area Mobilit y Scenarios</head><p>When an MH moves out of it's home area , the MSBRs belonging to the home area ar e notified of the MH's new location . The exac t mechanism for performing this notification i s deferred until later in this paper (Section 4) . Also, the MSBRs of the new area and th e MSBR of the last area the MH was in, are informed of the presence of this MH in th e new area . Again, the exact mechanism of ho w this is accomplished is deferred until later i n this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Home Area to New Are a</head><p>We examine here the path for a packe t originating from an SH located in the MH' s home area to the inter-area MH's new location . The packet will be captured by one of th e MSRs in the MH's home area . This wil l attempt to locate an MSR serving the MH, by multicasting a WHO_HAS request . Thi s WHO_HAS request will be answered by on e of the MSBRs of the home area . The hom e area MSBR closest to the new area wil l respond with an OTHER_HAS response, i n effect saying that another MSR is serving the MH . The address that will be delivered in thi s OTHER_HAS request is going to be that of th e MSBR of the MH's new area . The reason for not directly giving the address of the MS R presently serving the MH will be given shortly . This will result in a tunnel between th e requesting MSR and the MSBR of the ne w area . The MSBR of the new area will the n perform a local search for the MH, by doing a local WHO_HAS in case this information i s not in the MSBR's cache . In effect the remote MSBR is acting the role of an MSR in its area . When the MSR serving the MH responds with an I_HAVE, a tunnel will be establishe d between it and the remote MSR . This situatio n is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> . The reason why the address of the ne w area MSBR was given instead of the new are a MSR is that this greatly facilitates mobility i n the new area . If the MH continues to move i n the new area, then all that is needed are loca l (intra-area) transfers of control information . The new area MSBR can continue to re-tunne l the packets to the new MSRs as appropriate . There is no need to perform an update acros s the Backbone (possibly over a wide-area link ) in order to inform the MSR in the M-I's hom e area . This greatly reduces the overhead o f maintaining up-to-date mobility relate d routing information in the AS .</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">SUMMARY SH Closest New Area New Area MH MSR MSBR MS R</formula><p>The hierarchical aspect of the scheme i s now clear. A first level entity (the local MSR ) picks up the packet and does a local search. The local search is answered by a local second leve l entity, the home area MSBR . The packets are sent to a remote second level entity, the ne w area MSBR . The remote second level entity then does a search in the new area an d eventually sends the packet to the remote firs t level entity, the new area MSR . This is entirely analogous to how fixed-node routing i s performed within the AS, except for how th e routing information is disseminated . In this case, areas other than the home area and th e new area were not involved in updating / receiving control traffic .</p><p>In IS-IS <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> terminology, (the OSI intradomain routing protocol) the MSRs would b e labelled Level-1 MSISs and the MSBRs woul d be labelled Level-2 MSISs . MSIS stands for Mobility Support Intermediate System .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Other Area to New Are a</head><p>We now look at packets originating in a n area other than the mobile's home area . Thi s packet will be naturally routed towards th e MH's home area, since there isn't any information available, at least initially, to stat e otherwise . As the packet reaches the MH's home area, it will be intercepted by one of th e MSBRs of that area . Since these know of th e present area of the MH, the capturing MSB R will tunnel the packet to the MSBR of th e MH's new area .This limits the maximu m suboptimality of the route that the initia l packet traverses to be that of twice th e diameter of the routing Backbone . Thi s situation is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUMMAR Y</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SH</head><p>Home New Area New Area Mi l Area MSBR MSBR MSR  Use of a selective REDIRECT has the desirable effect of not flooding the Backbone with unnecessary traffic . For example, if a n MH has moved from San Francisco to Bosto n and a node in London wishes to reach it, onl y the London MSBR is informed of the curren t location . MSBRs in other parts of the (possibl y global) AS are not gratuitously informed . If there is no node in, say Tokyo, that wishes t o reach this MH, no control traffic to MSBRs i n Tokyo is necessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">New Area to New Area</head><p>In case the originator of the packet is in the same area as the MH, the packet will onc e again be naturally routed towards the hom e area of the MH. However, in order to reach th e MH's home area, the packet will have to pas s through one of the MSBRs of the new area . This MSBR knows that the MH is in fac t present locally and so will tunnel to the MS R serving the MH. In this case the MSBR serves as a sort of packet "reflector" . Doing thi s doesn't result in ideal routing, but can avoi d highly sub-optimal routing because th e maximal sub-optimality is equal to twice th e diameter of an area and not twice the diameter of the AS, as would be the case if such a scheme was not employed .If areas ar e designed properly, then this can avoi d unnecessary packet traversals across wide-are a links.This situation is in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> . Since ther e is only one second-level routing entit y involved (the new area MSBR) there is onl y one tunnel in this case. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.0">Updating Mobile Host Routes i n the Autonomous System</head><p>Here is a more detailed look at the sort of control information that is necessary in orde r to route packets to an inter-area mobile node .</p><p>When an MSR realizes that the MH that i s just connecting to it is from another area tha n the MSR, it needs to inform the MSBRs of the home area and last visited area of the MH' s present area . This can be done by either having a directory listing of the MSBRs of each area , or by sending an update notification to a special server in each area, which would the n multicast to each MSBR in its area . There ar e probably other ways of doing this as well. This requires that an MSR understand the I P addresses that belong to its own area . This can be done by static configuration in case th e MSR is not a "real" router (in the sense o f participating in the routing algorithm).</p><p>What happens when the MH moves ye t again out of the new area to another area? Th e MH will inform the new MSR as part of th e connection attempt of the last MSR it wa s connected to . When the new MSR learns tha t the last MSR address belongs to a differen t area than its own, it will inform the MSI3Rs o f the last area, the present area as well as th e MSBRs of the MH's home area . If the last are a MSBR continues to receive traffic for that MH, it will tell the MSR at the other end of Tunne l 1 to flush its cache of this tunnel route . It wil l not attempt to tell the MSR of the present area of the MH, as the last area MSBR may be ou t of date. The home area MSBRs are alway s informed of inter-area moves and so they are a more reliable source of up-to-date informatio n on the MHs belonging to them .</p><p>Informing the Tunnel 1 MSR is easy, sinc e all that is necessary is for the last area MSB R to "reverse" Tunnel 1, to learn the source o f the packets into Tunnel 1 . It can then send a control packet (say FLUSI-I_ROUTE) so that the MSR can perform another WHO_HAS an d learn of the MHs present location . This situation is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> . In case the other end of Tunnel 1 is an MSBR (as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), it can be similarl y updated with a FLUSH_ROU'1'E packet . Then, it can again route towards the MH home are a and be notified via a REDIRECT of the presen t location of the MH by the home area MSBR.</p><p>It is assumed that retransmits at th e transport layer will trigger the learning of th e correct new location, even if some of th e packets reaching old areas are dropped . The last area MSBR may tunnel the packet to on e of the MH's home area MSBRs, but this is no t guaranteed to succeed because of possibl e temporary inconsistencies in the mobile hos t routes distributed in the AS .</p><p>Another factor to consider is that there are , in general, going to be multiple MSBRs to a given area. When the home area MSBRs are informed of the present area of an MH an d then have to send in the address of an MSB R in a OTHER_HAS or REDIRECT packet, the y will send the address of the MSBR that i s closest to the entity that is being update d (either a home area MSR or an other are a MSBR) . Since the MSBRs participate in the routing algorithm of the Backbone and thu s have a complete map of the Backbone, thi s should always be possible for a home are a MSBR to do .</p><p>Also, having a complete map of th e Backbone enables an MSBR to learn of th e other area MSBRs IP address (required i n Section 3 .2) even though the source address of the IP packets does not indicate the I P addresses of the MSBRs of the source area . This is done by computing the reverse path o f the IP packet until it reaches an MSBR . Thi s also explains why it is not possible for th e MSBR function to reside in routing entitie s that are not part of the Backbone . Only a n OSPF BR has the topological information tha t is required to compute the point wher e REDIRECT packets are to be sent to . A router not participating in the Backbone routin g algorithm simply does not know how t o reverse the path to compute the address of the MSBR of the IP packet's source area .</p><p>What happens when only some of the area s have MSBR functionality and not others? Thi s can be learned by the routers through a specia l " MSBR" bit in the routing protocol . Suc h areas cannot then participate in optimize d mobility related routes . These will then revert to the suboptimal routes of the origina l Columbia scheme .</p><p>Even though the entire discussion show s SH-to-MH paths, MH-to-MH communicatio n can be derived from this, since an MH wil l hand the packet to an MSR and from here th e SH-to-MH algorithm can be employed .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Rebuilding State after MSB R crash</head><p>An MSBR crash can erase all th e information about which MHs are where . There is no need to keep this state informatio n in stable storage, since a crash can render thi s state information out-of-date and henc e useless . For example, an inter-area MH whic h was in area X when the MSBR crashed may b e in area Y by the time the MSBR comes up . In this case saving the pointer to area X doesn' t help, because the MH may have visited severa l areas between X and Y, and so even area X MSBRs will not know where the MH is . What is needed is some way to build up the curren t state of the world, when an MSBR comes u p after a crash or reboot .</p><p>An MSBR needs to know two types o f information . The out-of-area MHs that are present in the MSBR's area and the MSB R home area MHs that are in other (remote ) areas . An MSBR therefore needs to perfor m two sets of queries. The first one is to ask al l the local MSRs about out-of-area MH s attached to them . We will call this the "Level-1 Inter-Area MH query" . The second is t o inquire of all the other-area MSBRs abou t MHs that belong to this MSBR's home area . We will call this the "Level-2 Inter-Area M H query" . If the other-area MSBR has MH s belonging to the querying MSBR, it wil l respond with a list of these MHs . A rebooting MSBR should respond to a Level-2 query onl y after it has received information correspondin g to its Level-1 query.</p><p>In the (very likely) case where there i s another MSBR in the same area as th e rebooting MSBR, it can proactively give th e necessary inter-area MH state update to th e rebooting MSBR, when it detects this event . This will serve to avoid the overhead of th e Level-1 and Level-2 inter-area MH queries .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.0">Efficiency Analysi s</head><p>If we denote the difference between th e optimal route and the actual route traversed a s the "path stretch", then the worst case pat h stretch in this scheme is the maximum of twic e the diameter of the Backbone (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) o r twice the diameter of an area (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) . The worst case path stretch of the Columbi a scheme is twice the diameter of the AS .</p><p>The average path stretch in this scheme i s even better, because at least for other area and home area to new area situations, the pat h becomes quite close to optimal (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> an d Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) . Clearly, this scheme is a bi g improvement in terms of worst case an d average case path stretch .</p><p>The worst routing in our scheme i s achieved for new area to new area situation s (although this is still better than what would b e achieved by the unmodified Columbi a scheme) . The new area to new area situatio n can possibly be further improved if the virtual subnet corresponding to the MH is "broughtup" in the new area, whenever an MH whic h has that subnet address arrives in the new area . This would enable the new area MSRs t o capture packets for that MH and then send it to the correct new area MSR by following th e local (intra-area) algorithm . However, they would also capture packets intended for MHs (or SHs) that are not in the new area. In this case, the new area MSB R closest to the MH's home area would have th e responsibility of performing a "proxy " I_HAVE to the WHO_HAS request for out-ofarea MHs (or SHs) . Since the new area MSBRs know exactly which MH's are in the new area, they can detect when to perform this proxy I_HAVE . Upon receiving the dat a packets the new area MSBR would send th e packets towards the MH home area, using th e standard IP inter-area routing mechanisms .</p><p>The efficiency of the new area to new are a routes would therefore be the same as that o f the intra-area (home to home) mobile routes .</p><p>There is a trade-off here in the amount of network bandwidth used by the control traffic in bringing up the new virtual subnet and the network bandwidth wasted because of suboptimal new area to new area data packe t routing . If there is a minimal amount of ne w area to new area data traffic, then taking thi s step would not be justified . However, if there is a large amount of data traffic originating i n the new area for the MH, then the savings i n overall bandwidth consumption due to the su m of the control and data traffic may well justif y taking this step.</p><p>It should be emphasized that this virtua l subnet "bring-up" would only be for th e purposes of mobile routing . The new area wil l not dynamically include ranges of IP addresse s for the purpose of identifying that area . Specifically, only the mobile's home are a would need to list that subnet number as part of the range of IP addresses that belong to it . In other words, the effect of the virtual subne t bring-up would have to be contained in th e new area . This could be done by the MSBR s not propagating this information beyond th e area to which they belong .</p><p>Another aspect of efficiency is the storag e requirement of the tunnel routes at an MSBR . These storage requirements scale with th e number of external inter-area mobile node s present in the MSBR's own area plus th e number of inter-area mobile nodes that hav e that area as their home area . MSBRs are not required to know about all the inter-are a mobile nodes of the entire AS . Selective updates thus have the benefit of reducing both the bandwidth utilization of the network due t o control traffic and the storage requirements of tunnel routes at MSBRs .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.0">Conclusion s</head><p>We have presented the broad outline of a scheme that has the advantages of tunnelin g (better handling by existing hosts and routers) , with the scalability of a hierarchical scheme . We introduced a special entity called a n MSBR that serves as the second level of th e mobile routing and tracking hierarchy . We use path-reversal techniques in order to updat e active communication paths, thereby servin g to minimize expensive wide-area traffic due to mobility related control information . Specifically, flooding is not employed in orde r to disseminate mobility related routin g information . Furthermore, by doin g hierarchical two-level tunneling an d communication between MSBRs and MSRs , we optimize the bulk of the routes taken b y data packets by avoiding unnecessary use o f wide-area (or Backbone) communicatio n links .</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 : Home Area to New AreaThe final result is that there are now two tunnels concatenated back-to-back .
