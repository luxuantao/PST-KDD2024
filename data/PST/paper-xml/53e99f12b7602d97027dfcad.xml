<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Ellipse fitting is one of the classic problems of pattern recognition and has been subject to considerable attention in the past ten years for its many application. Several techniques for fitting ellipses are based on mapping sets of points to the parameter space (notably the Hough transform).</p><p>In this paper we are concerned with the more fundamental problem of least squares (LSQ) fitting of ellipses to scattered data. Previous methods achieved ellipse fitting by using generic conic fitters that perform poorly, often yielding hyperbolic fits with noisy data, or by employing iterative rpethods, which are computationally expensive.</p><p>In this paper we presents and demonstrate the first ellipse-specific direct least squares fitting method that has the following desirable features: i) always yields elliptical fits ii) has low-eccentricity bias, and iii) is robust to noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">THE LSQ ELLIPSE FITTING PROBLEM</head><p>Let us represent a generic conic as the zero set of an implicit second order polynomial:</p><p>where a = [ a b c d e f ] and x = [x2 xy y2 J: y 1 IT.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F(a, xi) = d is called the "algebraic distance" of a point xi to the conic F(a,x) = 0.</formula><p>One way of fitting a conic is to minimise the algebraic distance over the set of N data points in the least squares sense, that is f N Linear conic fitting methods have been investigated that used linear constraints that slightly bias conic fitting towards elliptical solutions. In particular <ref type="bibr">Rosin [8]</ref> and Gander [4] investigated the constraint a + c = 1 and Rosin 171 f = 1.</p><p>In a seminal work, Bookstein 1 1 1 showed that if a quadratic constraint is set on the parameters (e.g., to avoid the trivial solution a = 0 6 ) the minimisation ( 2 ) can be solved by the rank-deficient generalised eigenvalue system:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">DTDa = Sa = XCa (3)</formula><p>where D = [XI x2 . . x,IT is called design mn,atrix, S = DTD is called scatter matrix and C is the matrix that expresses the constraint.</p><p>A simple constraint is llall = 1 but Bookestein used the algebraic invariant constraint u2 + $b' + c2 = 1; <ref type="bibr">Sampson [lo]</ref> presented an iterative improvement to Bookstein method that replaces the algebraic distance (1) with a better approximation to the geometric distance, which was adapted by <ref type="bibr">Taubin [ll]</ref> to turn the problem again into a generalised eigen-system like ( 3 ) . Despite the amount of work, direct specific ellipse fitting, however, was left unsolved. If ellipses fitting was needed, one had to rely either on generic conic fitting or on iterative methods such as <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Recently Rosin [9]</ref> re-iterated this problem by stating that ellipse-specific fitting is essentially a non-linear problem and iterative methods must be employed for this purpose. In the following we show that this is no longer true.</p><p>Let us consider a different quadratic constraint that corresponds to the well known quadratic algebraic invariant of a conic 0 -2 0 0 0 r s 1 0 0 0 0 1 -2 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</formula><p>(4) This constraint was first introduced in [3] and it was shown to yield always elliptical solutions; the brief jus- tification given was that because of the immateriality of the scale of a, the inequality (4) can, w.l.o.g., turned into aTCa = -1 and hence the minimisation (2) subject to the constraint (4) can again be formulated like in (3).</p><p>In the following, we give theoretical account of the method by demonstrating its key feature of ellipse specificity, i.e. that it gives always one and only one elliptical solution. But before that, we need to state two Lemmas that will naturally lead to an uniqueness theorem.</p><p>Let S E !Rnxn and C E !Rnx, be symmetric matrices, with S positive definite. Let us define the spectrum a(S) as the set of eigenvalues of S and let a(S, C) analogously be the set of generalised eigenvalues of (5). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof:</head><p>Let the inertia i ( S ) be defined as the set of signs of o(C), and let z(S,C) analogously be the inertia of a(S,C). Then, the lemma is equivalent to proving that i(S,C) = i(C). As S is positive definite, it may be decomposed as Q2 for symmetric Q, allowing us to write (5) as Q2u = XCu. Now, substituting v = Qu and pre-multiplying by Q-l gives v = AQ-lCQ-lv so that a(S,C) = D ( Q -~C Q -~) -~ and thus i(S,C) = i(Q-lCQ-l). F'rom Sylvester's Law of Inertia <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> we have that for any symmetric S and nonsingular X, i ( S ) = i ( X T S X ) . Therefore, substitut-</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ing X = XT = Q-l we have i(C) = i(Q-lCQ-l) = i(S,C). 0 Lemma 2 If(&amp;, ai) is a solutron of the eigen-system</formula><p>(3): we have: sign()\,) = szgn(arCa,).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof:</head><p>By pre-multiplying by a? both sides of (3) we have arSa, = XiaTCa;. Since S is positive-definite, a?Sa, &gt; 0 and therefore A; and the scalar aTCa, must have the same sign. CII Now we can state the following uniqueness theorem: Theorem 1</p><p>T h e solutions t o the conic fitting probl e m given by the generalised eigen-system (3) su,bject to the constraint (4) include one and only one elliptical solution corresponding t o the single negative gen,eralised eigenvalue of (3). T h e solution is also inual-iant t o rotation and translation of the data points?</p><p>Proof:</p><p>Since the non-zero eigenvalues of C are a(C) = { -2 , 1, 2 }, from Lemma 1 we have that a(S, C) has one and only one negative eigenvalue A, &lt; 0, associated with a solution ai; then, by applying Lemma 2, the constraint a'Cai = b2 -4ac is negative and therefore ai is a set of coefficients representing an ellipse. The constraint ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) is a conic invariant to Euclidean transformations and so is the solution (see PI) 0 Theorem 1 does not state anything about the quality of the unique elliptical solution, since classical opti- misation theory states that it might not be the global minimum of (2) under our non-positive definite inequality constraint. However, the physical solution (the actual ellipse) does not change under linear scaling of the coefficients and therefore it can be easily shown that the minimisation with the inequality constraint (4) can be equivalently turned t o a minimisation with an equality constraint aTCa = -1. By doing so, as illustrated in <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, we can say that: Corollary 1 T h e unique elliptical solution i s the one that minrimises (2) subject t o the constraint aTCa = -1.</p><p>A more practical interpretation of this corollary is that the unique elliptical solution is a local minimiser of the Rayleigh quotient aTSa and thus the solution can also be seen as the best east squares ellipse under a re-normalisation of the coeficients by b2 -4ac. Although experimental evidence would suggest that this statement could be valid, a formal demonstration is currently not known to the authors. This implicit normalisation turns singular for b2 -4ac = 0 and, following the observations in [7], we can say that the minimisation tends to "pull" the solution away from singularities; in our case the singularity is a parabola and SO the unique elliptical solution tends to be biased towards low eccentricity, which explains many of the following results, such as those in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>First, let us now have a glimpse at what this ellipsespecificity means. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>-left shows the three eigensolutions yielded by the Booltstein algorithm on a small set of hand-input points; the best LSQ fit is a hyperbola and the (incidentally) elliptical one is extremely poor. With the proposed ellipse-specific algorithm, the only solution satisfying the constraint is the best LSQ elliptical solution, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>-right.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows three experiments designed after [lo] that consist of the same parabolic data but with different realizations of added isotropic Gaussian noise (g = 10% of data spread). In his paper, Sampson refined the poor initial fitting obtained with Booltstein algorithm using an iterative Kalman filter to minimise his approximate geometrical distance <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>. The final results were ellipses with low eccentricity that are qualitatively similar t o those produced by our ellipse-specific direct method (solid lines) but at the same computational cost of producing Sampson's initial estimate.</p><p>The low-eccentricity bias of our method discussed in Section. 3 is most evident in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> when comparing the results to other methods, namely Bookstein (dotted), Taubin (dash-dots) and Gander (dashed); these results are not surprising, since those methods are nonellipse specific whereas the one presented here is.</p><p>Let us now qualitatively illustrate the robustness of the ellipse-specific method as compared to Gander's and Taubin's. A number of experiments have been carried out, of which here we present a couple, shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. They have been conducted by adding isotropic Gaussian noise to a synthetic elliptical arc; note that in both sets each column has the s a m e set of points. More quantitative results can be found in <ref type="bibr">[a]</ref> and are not reported here for reasons of space.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the performance with respect to increasing noise level (see [3] for more experiments).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>: Low-eccentricity bias of the ellipse-specific method when fitting to noisy parabolic data. Encoding is Bookstein: dotted; Gander: dashed; Taubin: dashdot; Ellipse-specific: solid.</p><p>The standard deviation of the noise varies from 3% in the leftmost column to 20% of data spread in the rightmost column; the noise has been set to relatively high level because the performance of the three algorithm is substantially the same at low noise level of precise elliptical data. The top row shows the results for the method proposed here. Although, as expected, the fitted ellipses shrink with increasing levels of high noise (as a limit the elliptical arc will look like a noisy line), it can be noticed that the ellipse dimension decreases smoothly with the increase of noise level: this is an indication of well-behaved fitting. This shrinking phenomenon is evident also with the other two methods but presents itself more erratically: in the case of Taubin's algorithm, the fitted ellipses are on average somewhat closer to the original one [3], but they are rather unpredictable and its ellipse non-specificity, as it happens in the Gander's case, sometimes yields unbounded hyperbolic fits.</p><p>The second set, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, is concerned with assessing stability to different realizations of noise with the same variance (U = 0.1). (It is very desirable that an algorithm's performance be affected only by the noise level, and not by a particular realization of the noise). This and similar experiments (see [2, 31) showed that our method has a remarkably greater stability to noise with respect to Gander's and Taubin's.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper we have presented an ellipse least squares fitting method which for is specific to ellipses and direct at the same time; other previous method were either not ellipse-specific or iterative.</p><p>We argue that our method is possibly the best tradeoff between speed and accuracy for ellipse fitting and its uniqueness property makes it also extremely robust to  noise and usable in many applications, especially in industrial vision. In order for other researchers to quickly assess the validity of the method, Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> gives a Matlab implementation of the proposed algorithm and an interactive JAVA demonstration is available at http:// vision. dai. ed. ac. uk/maurizp/ElliFitDemo/demo.html.</p><p>In the near future, a method for correcting the bias to the noise for incomplete elliptical arcs will be explored that is inspired by <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. Moreover, the proposed ellipse-specific method could be used to produce excellent initial estimates for iterative methods, thus significantly increasing their speed; we are currently investigating this possibility.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Lemma 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>T h e signs of the generalised eigenvalues of su = x c u ( 5 ) are the s a m e as those of the matrix C , u,p t o permutation of th.e indices.</figDesc></figure>
