<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The goal of this paper is to improve cross-lingual language understanding (XLU), by carefully studying the effects of training unsupervised crosslingual representations at a very large scale. We present XLM-R a transformer-based multilingual masked language model pre-trained on text in 100 languages, which obtains state-of-the-art performance on cross-lingual classification, sequence labeling and question answering.</p><p>Multilingual masked language models (MLM) like mBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Devlin et al., 2018)</ref> and XLM (Lample and <ref type="bibr">Conneau, 2019)</ref> have pushed the stateof-the-art on cross-lingual understanding tasks by jointly pretraining large Transformer models <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref> on many languages. These models allow for effective cross-lingual transfer, as seen in a number of benchmarks including cross-lingual natural language inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bowman et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Williams et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Conneau et al., 2018)</ref>, question answering <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Rajpurkar et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lewis et al., 2019)</ref>, and named entity recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Pires et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wu and Dredze, 2019)</ref>. However, all of these studies pre-train on Wikipedia, which provides a relatively limited scale especially for lower resource languages.</p><p>In this paper, we first present a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs and limitations of multilingual language models at scale, inspired by recent monolingual scaling efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Liu et al., 2019)</ref>. We measure the trade-off between high-resource and low-resource languages and the impact of language sampling and vocabulary size. The experiments expose a trade-off as we scale the number of languages for a fixed model capacity: more languages leads to better cross-lingual performance on low-resource languages up until a point, after which the overall performance on monolingual and cross-lingual benchmarks degrades. We refer to this tradeoff as the curse of multilinguality, and show that it can be alleviated by simply increasing model capacity. We argue, however, that this remains an important limitation for future XLU systems which may aim to improve performance with more modest computational budgets.</p><p>Our best model XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R) outperforms mBERT on cross-lingual classification by up to 23% accuracy on low-resource languages. It outperforms the previous state of the art by 5.1% average accuracy on XNLI, 2.42% average F1-score on Named Entity Recognition, and 9.1% average F1-score on cross-lingual Question Answering. We also evaluate monolingual fine tuning on the GLUE and XNLI benchmarks, where XLM-R obtains results competitive with state-of-the-art monolingual models, including RoBERTa <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Liu et al., 2019)</ref>. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that it is possible to have a single large model for all languages, without sacrificing per-language performance. We will make our code, models and data publicly available, with the hope that this will help research in multilingual NLP and low-resource language understanding.</p></div>

(2018)</ref> and Lample and Conneau (2019) introduced mBERT and XLM -masked language models trained on multiple languages, without any cross-lingual supervision. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lample and Conneau (2019)</ref> propose translation language modeling (TLM) as a way to leverage parallel data and obtain a new state of the art on the cross-lingual natural language inference (XNLI) benchmark <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Conneau et al., 2018)</ref>. They further show strong improvements on unsupervised machine translation and pretraining for sequence generation. <ref type="bibr">Wu et al. (2019)</ref> shows that monolingual BERT representations are similar across languages, explaining in part the natural emergence of multilinguality in bottleneck architectures. Separately, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Pires et al. (2019)</ref> demonstrated the effectiveness of multilingual models like mBERT on sequence labeling tasks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Huang et al.

However, all of this work was at a relatively modest scale, in terms of the amount of training data, as compared to our approach.</p><p>The benefits of scaling language model pretraining by increasing the size of the model as well as the training data has been extensively studied in the literature. For the monolingual case, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Jozefowicz et al. (2016)</ref> show how large-scale LSTM models can obtain much stronger performance on language modeling benchmarks when trained on billions of tokens. GPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Radford et al., 2018)</ref> also highlights the importance of scaling the amount of data and RoBERTa <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Liu et al., 2019)</ref> shows that training BERT longer on more data leads to significant boost in performance. Inspired by RoBERTa, we show that mBERT and XLM are undertuned, and that simple improvements in the learning procedure of unsupervised MLM leads to much better performance. We train on cleaned CommonCrawls <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Wenzek et al., 2019)</ref>, which increase the amount of data for low-resource languages by two orders of magnitude on average.

They uncover the high and low resource trade-off and the problem of capacity dilution <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Johnson et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tan et al., 2019)</ref>. The work most similar to ours is <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arivazhagan et al. (2019)</ref>, which trains a single model in 103 languages on over 25 billion parallel sentences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Siddhant et al. (2019)</ref> further analyze the representations obtained by the encoder of a massively multilingual machine translation system and show that it obtains similar results to mBERT on cross-lingual NLI.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Model and Data</head><p>In this section, we present the training objective, languages, and data we use.

We sample batches from different languages using the same sampling distribution as <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lample and Conneau (2019)</ref>, but with α = 0.3. Unlike Lample and Conneau (2019), we do not use language embeddings, which allows our model to better deal with code-switching. We use a large vocabulary size of 250K with a full softmax and train two different models: XLM-R Base (L = 12, H = 768, A = 12, 270M params) and XLM-R (L = 24, H = 1024, A = 16, 550M params). For all of our ablation studies, we use a BERT Base architecture with a vocabulary of 150K tokens. Appendix B goes into more details about the architecture of the different models referenced in this paper.</p><p>Scaling to a hundred languages. XLM-R is trained on 100 languages; we provide a full list of languages and associated statistics in Appendix A.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> specifies the iso codes of 88 languages that are shared across XLM-R and XLM-100, the model from <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lample and Conneau (2019)</ref> trained on Wikipedia text in 100 languages.</p><p>Compared to previous work, we replace some languages with more commonly used ones such as romanized Hindi and traditional Chinese. In our ablation studies, we always include the 7 languages for which we have classification and sequence labeling evaluation benchmarks: English, French, German, Russian, Chinese, Swahili and Urdu. We chose this set as it covers a suitable range of language families and includes low-resource languages such as Swahili and Urdu. We also consider larger sets of 15, 30, 60 and all 100 languages. When reporting results on high-resource and lowresource, we refer to the average of English and French results, and the average of Swahili and Urdu results respectively.</p><p>Scaling the Amount of Training Data. Following Wenzek et al. ( <ref type="formula">2019</ref>)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> , we build a clean Com-monCrawl Corpus in 100 languages. We use an internal language identification model in combination with the one from fastText <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Joulin et al., 2017)</ref>. We train language models in each language and use it to filter documents as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wenzek et al. (2019)</ref>. We consider one CommonCrawl dump for English and twelve dumps for all other languages, which significantly increases dataset sizes, especially for low-resource languages like Burmese and Swahili.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the difference in size between the Wikipedia Corpus used by mBERT and XLM-100, and the CommonCrawl Corpus we use. As we show in Section 5.3, monolingual Wikipedia corpora are too small to enable unsupervised representation learning. Based on our experiments, we found that a few hundred MiB of text data is usually a minimal size for learning a BERT model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation</head><p>We consider four evaluation benchmarks. For crosslingual understanding, we use cross-lingual natural language inference, named entity recognition, and question answering. We use the GLUE benchmark to evaluate the English performance of XLM-R and compare it to other state-of-the-art models.</p><p>Cross-lingual Natural Language Inference (XNLI). The XNLI dataset comes with groundtruth dev and test sets in 15 languages, and a ground-truth English training set. The training set has been machine-translated to the remaining 14 languages, providing synthetic training data for these languages as well. We evaluate our model on cross-lingual transfer from English to other lan-guages. We also consider three machine translation baselines: (i) translate-test: dev and test sets are machine-translated to English and a single English model is used (ii) translate-train (per-language): the English training set is machine-translated to each language and we fine-tune a multiligual model on each training set (iii) translate-train-all (multi-language): we fine-tune a multilingual model on the concatenation of all training sets from translate-train. For the translations, we use the official data provided by the XNLI project.</p><p>Named Entity Recognition. For NER, we consider the <ref type="bibr">CoNLL-2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Sang, 2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">CoNLL-2003 (Tjong Kim Sang and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">De Meulder, 2003)</ref> datasets in English, Dutch, Spanish and German. We fine-tune multilingual models either (1) on the English set to evaluate cross-lingual transfer, (2) on each set to evaluate per-language performance, or (3) on all sets to evaluate multilingual learning. We report the F1 score, and compare to baselines from <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lample et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akbik et al. (2018)</ref>.</p><p>Cross-lingual Question Answering. We use the MLQA benchmark from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lewis et al. (2019)</ref>, which extends the English SQuAD benchmark to Spanish, German, Arabic, Hindi, Vietnamese and Chinese. We report the F1 score as well as the exact match (EM) score for cross-lingual transfer from English. GLUE Benchmark. Finally, we evaluate the English performance of our model on the GLUE benchmark <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Wang et al., 2018)</ref> which gathers multiple classification tasks, such as MNLI <ref type="bibr">(Williams et al., 2017)</ref>, SST-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Socher et al., 2013)</ref>, or QNLI <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Rajpurkar et al., 2018)</ref>. We use BERT Large and RoBERTa as baselines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Analysis and Results</head><p>In this section, we perform a comprehensive analysis of multilingual masked language models. We conduct most of the analysis on XNLI, which we found to be representative of our findings on other tasks. We then present the results of XLM-R on cross-lingual understanding and GLUE. Finally, we compare multilingual and monolingual models, and present results on low-resource languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Improving and Understanding Multilingual Masked Language Models</head><p>Much of the work done on understanding the crosslingual effectiveness of mBERT or XLM <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Pires et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wu and Dredze, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lewis et al., 2019)</ref> has focused on analyzing the performance of fixed pretrained models on downstream tasks. In this section, we present a comprehensive study of different factors that are important to pretraining large scale multilingual models. We highlight the trade-offs and limitations of these models as we scale to one hundred languages.</p><p>Transfer-dilution Trade-off and Curse of Multilinguality. Model capacity (i.e. the number of parameters in the model) is constrained due to practical considerations such as memory and speed during training and inference. For a fixed sized model, the per-language capacity decreases as we increase the number of languages. While low-resource language performance can be improved by adding similar higher-resource languages during pretraining, the overall downstream performance suffers from this capacity dilution <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arivazhagan et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Positive transfer and capacity dilution have to be traded off against each other. We illustrate this trade-off in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, which shows XNLI performance vs the number of languages the model is pretrained on. Initially, as we go from 7 to 15 languages, the model is able to take advantage of positive transfer which improves performance, especially on low resource languages. Beyond this point the curse of multilinguality kicks in and degrades performance across all languages. Specifically, the overall XNLI accuracy decreases from 71.8% to 67.7% as we go from XLM-7 to XLM-100. The same trend can be observed for models trained on the larger CommonCrawl Corpus.</p><p>The issue is even more prominent when the capacity of the model is small. To show this, we pretrain models on Wikipedia Data in 7, 30 and 100 languages. As we add more languages, we make the Transformer wider by increasing the hidden size from 768 to 960 to 1152. In Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>, we show that the added capacity allows XLM-30 to be on par with XLM-7, thus overcoming the curse of multilinguality. The added capacity for XLM-100, however, is not enough and it still lags behind due to higher vocabulary dilution (recall from Section 3 that we used a fixed vocabulary size of 150K for all models).   vocabulary, and the rate at which we sample training examples from each language. We study the effect of sampling on the performance of highresource (English and French) and low-resource (Swahili and Urdu) languages for an XLM-100 model trained on Wikipedia (we observe a similar trend for the construction of the subword vocab). Specifically, we investigate the impact of varying the α parameter which controls the exponential smoothing of the language sampling rate. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lample and Conneau (2019)</ref>, we use a sampling rate proportional to the number of sentences in each corpus. Models trained with higher values of α see batches of high-resource languages more often. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows that the higher the value of α, the better the performance on high-resource languages, and vice-versa. When considering overall performance, we found 0.3 to be an optimal value for α, and use this for XLM-R.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High-resource vs</head><p>Importance of Capacity and Vocabulary. In previous sections and in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>, we showed the importance of scaling the model size as we increase the number of languages. Similar to the overall model size, we argue that scaling the size of the shared vocabulary (the vocabulary capacity) can improve the performance of multilingual models on downstream tasks. To illustrate this effect, we train XLM-100 models on Wikipedia data with different vocabulary sizes. We keep the overall number of parameters constant by adjusting the width of the transformer. Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows that even with a fixed capacity, we observe a 2.8% increase in XNLI average accuracy as we increase the vocabulary size from 32K to 256K. This suggests that multilingual models can benefit from allocating a higher proportion of the total number of parameters to the embedding layer even though this reduces the size of the Transformer. For simplicity and given the softmax computational constraints, we use a vocabulary of 250k for XLM-R.</p><p>We further illustrate the importance of this parameter, by training three models with the same transformer architecture (BERT Base ) but with different vocabulary sizes: 128K, 256K and 512K. We observe more than 3% gains in overall accuracy on XNLI by simply increasing the vocab size from 128k to 512k.</p><p>Larger-scale Datasets and Training. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the CommonCrawl Corpus that we collected has significantly more monolingual data than the previously used Wikipedia corpora. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows that for the same BERT Base architecture, all models trained on CommonCrawl obtain significantly better performance.</p><p>Apart from scaling the training data, Liu et al. ( <ref type="formula">2019</ref>) also showed the benefits of training MLMs longer. In our experiments, we observed similar effects of large-scale training, such as increasing batch size (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">7</ref>) and training time, on model performance. Specifically, we found that using validation perplexity as a stopping criterion for pretraining caused the multilingual MLM in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lample and Conneau (2019)</ref> to be under-tuned. In our experience, performance on downstream tasks continues to improve even after validation perplexity has plateaued. Combining this observation with our implementation of the unsupervised XLM-MLM objective, we were able to improve the performance of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lample and Conneau (2019)</ref> from 71.3% to more than 75% average accuracy on XNLI, which was on par with their supervised translation language modeling (TLM) objective. Based on these results, and given our focus on unsupervised learning, we decided to not use the supervised TLM objective for training our models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simplifying Multilingual Tokenization with</head><p>Sentence Piece. The different language-specific tokenization tools used by mBERT and XLM-100 make these models more difficult to use on raw text. Instead, we train a Sentence Piece model (SPM) and apply it directly on raw text data for all languages. We did not observe any loss in performance for models trained with SPM when compared to models trained with language-specific preprocessing and byte-pair encoding (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">7</ref>) and hence use SPM for XLM-R.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Cross-lingual Understanding Results</head><p>Based on these results, we adapt the setting of Lample and <ref type="bibr">Conneau (2019)</ref> and use a large Transformer model with 24 layers and 1024 hidden states, with a 250k vocabulary. We use the multilingual MLM loss and train our XLM-R model for 1.5 Million updates on five-hundred 32GB Nvidia V100 GPUs with a batch size of 8192. We leverage the SPM-preprocessed text data from Common-Crawl in 100 languages and sample languages with α = 0.3. In this section, we show that it out-performs all previous techniques on cross-lingual benchmarks while getting performance on par with RoBERTa on the GLUE benchmark.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XNLI.</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> shows XNLI results and adds some additional details: (i) the number of models the approach induces (#M), (ii) the data on which the model was trained (D), and (iii) the number of languages the model was pretrained on (#lg). As we show in our results, these parameters significantly impact performance. Column #M specifies whether model selection was done separately on the dev set of each language (N models), or on the joint dev set of all the languages (single model). We observe a 0.6 decrease in overall accuracy when we go from N models to a single model -going from 71.3 to 70.7. We encourage the community to adopt this setting. For cross-lingual transfer, while this approach is not fully zero-shot transfer, we argue that in real applications, a small amount of supervised data is often available for validation in each language.</p><p>XLM-R sets a new state of the art on XNLI. On cross-lingual transfer, XLM-R obtains 80.9% accuracy, outperforming the XLM-100 and mBERT open-source models by 10.2% and 14.6% average accuracy. On the Swahili and Urdu lowresource languages, XLM-R outperforms XLM-100 by 15.7% and 11.4%, and mBERT by 23.5% and 15.8%. While XLM-R handles 100 languages, we also show that it outperforms the former state of the art Unicoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Huang et al., 2019)</ref> and XLM (MLM+TLM), which handle only 15 languages, by 5.5% and 5.8% average accuracy respectively. Using the multilingual training of translate-train-all, XLM-R further improves performance and reaches 83.6% accuracy, a new overall state of the art for XNLI, outperforming Unicoder by 5.1%. Multilingual training is similar to practical applications where training sets are available in various languages for the same task. In the case of XNLI, datasets have been translated, and translate-trainall can be seen as some form of cross-lingual data augmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Singh et al., 2019)</ref>, similar to backtranslation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Xie et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Named Entity Recognition.

XLM-R obtains F1 and accuracy scores of 70.7% and 52.7% while the previous state of the art was 61.6% and 43.5%. XLM-R also outperforms mBERT by 13.0% F1-score and 11.1% accuracy. It even outperforms BERT-Large on English, confirming its strong monolingual performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Multilingual versus Monolingual</head><p>In this section, we present results of multilingual XLM models against monolingual BERT models.</p><p>GLUE: XLM-R versus RoBERTa. Our goal is to obtain a multilingual model with strong performance on both, cross-lingual understanding tasks as well as natural language understanding tasks for each language. To that end, we evaluate XLM-R on the GLUE benchmark. We show in XNLI: XLM versus BERT. A recurrent criticism against multilingual models is that they obtain worse performance than their monolingual counterparts. In addition to the comparison of XLM-R and RoBERTa, we provide the first comprehensive study to assess this claim on the XNLI benchmark. We extend our comparison between multilingual XLM models and monolingual BERT models on 7 languages and compare performance in Table 5. We train 14 monolingual BERT models on Wikipedia and CommonCrawl (capped at 60 GiB), and two XLM-7 models. We increase the vocabulary size of the multilingual model for a better comparison. We found that multilingual models can outperform their monolingual BERT counterparts. Specifically, in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>, we show that for cross-lingual transfer, monolingual baselines outperform XLM-7 for both Wikipedia and CC by 1.6% and 1.3% average accuracy. However, by making use of multilingual training (translate-trainall) and leveraging training sets coming from multiple languages, XLM-7 can outperform the BERT models: our XLM-7 trained on CC obtains 80.0% average accuracy on the 7 languages, while the average performance of BERT models trained on CC is 77.5%. This is a surprising result that shows that the capacity of multilingual models to leverage training data coming from multiple languages for a particular task can overcome the capacity dilution problem to obtain better overall performance. We compare the performance of monolingual models (BERT) versus multilingual models (XLM) on seven languages, using a BERT-BASE architecture. We choose a vocabulary size of 40k and 150k for monolingual and multilingual models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Representation Learning for Low-resource Languages</head><p>We observed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> that pretraining on Wikipedia for Swahili and Urdu performed similarly to a randomly initialized model; most likely due to the small size of the data for these languages.</p><p>On the other hand, pretraining on CC improved performance by up to 10 points. This confirms our assumption that mBERT and XLM-100 rely heavily on cross-lingual transfer but do not model the low-resource languages as well as XLM-R. Specifically, in the translate-train-all setting, we observe that the biggest gains for XLM models trained on CC, compared to their Wikipedia counterparts, are on low-resource languages; 7% and 4.8% improvement on Swahili and Urdu respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this work, we introduced XLM-R, our new state of the art multilingual masked language model trained on 2.5 TB of newly created clean Com-monCrawl data in 100 languages. We show that it provides strong gains over previous multilingual models like mBERT and XLM on classification, sequence labeling and question answering. We exposed the limitations of multilingual MLMs, in particular by uncovering the high-resource versus low-resource trade-off, the curse of multilinguality and the importance of key hyperparameters. We also expose the surprising effectiveness of multilingual models over monolingual models, and show strong improvements on low-resource languages.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Low-resource Trade-off.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ISO code Language</head><p>Tokens (M) Size (GiB) ISO code Language Tokens (M) Size (GiB) Table 6: Languages and statistics of the CC-100 corpus. We report the list of 100 languages and include the number of tokens (Millions) and the size of the data (in GiB) for each language. Note that we also include romanized variants of some non latin languages such as Bengali, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B Model Architectures and Sizes</head><p>As we showed in section 5, capacity is an important parameter for learning strong cross-lingual representations. In the table below, we list multiple monolingual and multilingual models used by the research community and summarize their architectures and total number of parameters.   <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arivazhagan et al. (2019)</ref> on massively multilingual neural machine translation (mmNMT), and T5 numbers are from <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Raffel et al. (2019)</ref>. While XLM-R is among the largest models partly due to its large embedding layer, it has a similar number of parameters than XLM-100, and remains significantly smaller that recently introduced Transformer models for multilingual MT and transfer learning. While this table gives more hindsight on the difference of capacity of each model, note it does not highlight other critical differences between the models.</p></div>			</div>
