Second, the constraint of piecewise smoothness between singularities requires that the placement of a Hence, the geometric estimates of an interval containing a singularity are still prone to error. In seeking a solution shock must not cause orientation or curvature discontinu-ities at either endpoint of the interval in which it is placed. This can be enforced by extrapolating the interpolations from the neighboring intervals and placing the singularity at the point of their intersection. In such a strategy, the interpolating curve on one side of the shock is obtained solely from the neighboring interval on that side. This is logical since the very idea of placing the shock is to institute a break in the curve. Examples illustrating this strategy are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> (right column). The resulting shocks, which are marked by crosses, appear to be intuitive. Observe also that for smooth data, no shocks are placed, and the interpolation agrees with the unmodified ENO interpolation (Fig. <ref type="figure">4 (top)</ref>).</p><p>In summary, when the ENO interpolation gives rise to discontinuous measures of orientation or curvature, the option of placing a single shock is considered. We should mention that an exception arises when the boundary continuations do not intersect. In such cases, since placing a single shock is not an option and interpolation signals two discontinuities, we make both discontinuities explicit (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Note that while this rarely occurs in our applications, we have included this possibility in our algorithm for completeness. Having modified the ENO to explicitly place shocks, we are now in a position to extend our approach to one for 2D data.</p></div>

It would seem that these results should also apply to 2D data, since a shape's boundary can be locally represented as a function in some (local) coordinate system. Alternatively, the x and y coordinates of the boundary points can each be interpreted as functions of the arc length parameter s ˜, each of which can be interpolated as a 1D function. Unfortunately, however, both approaches face significant difficulties. First, in both cases, the boundary points are not ordered. Such ordering is itself the result of tracing the boundary.

Thus, we are faced with somewhat of a interpolation (bottom). The latter technique preserves discontinuities, ''chicken-and-egg'' problem: order and arc length can be such as those which lie along the threads of the bolt, providing subpixel obtained from accurate subpixel interpolation, but subestimates of useful quantities such as the thread pitch. pixel interpolation requires order and arc length! <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref> The solution, we propose, revolves around a two-stage interpolation scheme to: (i) obtain unordered sample points of the boundary with subpixel accuracy and then order them, and (ii) interpolate between these points in 2D, using a geometric generalization of the 1D ENO scheme. Both stages exploit geometric continuity; the first in the direction orthogonal to level curves and the second in the direction 4.1. First Stage: Subpixel Samples sequentially, each time appending a new boundary point to the end of an existing list of points.

The essential idea is to the circular arc fit with lower curvature. A third-order (Euler spiral) interpolation is constructed by adding yet use fits that are not dependent on the choice of a coordinate system, but rather depend only on the geometry of the another sample point, choosing the one which results in a lower curvature variation. In general, for higher order underlying curve. Recall that in first-order ENO interpolation using polynomials, all derivatives of the interpolant, interpolations, the sample point added is the one which provides the lower coefficient for the highest order term with the exception of the first derivative, are set to 0. This gives first-order interpolation in linear form, f (x) ϭ (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">5</ref> In this paper, we have limited ourselves to the use of second-order (circular arc) interpolants, primarily a 1 x ϩ a 0 .
