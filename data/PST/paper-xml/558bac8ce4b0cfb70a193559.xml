			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A major challenge in electroencephalogram (EEG)based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is the inherent nonstationarities in the EEG data. Variations of the signal properties from intra and inter sessions often lead to deteriorated BCI performances, as features extracted by methods such as common spatial patterns (CSP) are not invariant against the changes. To extract features that are robust and invariant, this paper proposes a novel spatial filtering algorithm called Kullback-Leibler (KL) CSP. The CSP algorithm only considers the discrimination between the means of the classes, but does not consider withinclass scatters information. In contrast, the proposed KLCSP algorithm simultaneously maximizes the discrimination between the class means, and minimizes the within-class dissimilarities measured by a loss function based on the KL divergence. The performance of the proposed KLCSP algorithm is compared against two existing algorithms, CSP and stationary CSP (sCSP), using the publicly available BCI competition III dataset IVa and a large dataset from stroke patients performing neuro-rehabilitation. The results show that the proposed KLCSP algorithm significantly outperforms both the CSP and the sCSP algorithms, in terms of classification accuracy, by reducing within-class variations. This results in more compact and separable features.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Furthermore, BCI has been used as a rehabilitation tool in restoring motor functions of patients with moderate to severe stroke impairments <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In such a system, BCI could guide brain plasticity by demanding close attention to a motor task or by requiring the activation or deactivation of specific brain signals.</p><p>In the majority of current BCI systems, the brain signals are measured by electroencephalogram (EEG), due to its low cost and high time resolution compared to other modalities, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), etc., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. However, a major challenge in EEG-based BCI research is the inherent nonstationarity in the recorded signals. Variations of the signal properties from intra and inter sessions can be caused by changes of task involvement and attention, fatigue, changes in placement or impedance of the electrodes, or by artifacts, such as swallowing or blinking, among other reasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Variations in the EEG signal can lead to deteriorated BCI performances as most machine learning algorithms implicitly assume stationary data <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Recently, several algorithms have been proposed to ameliorate the nonstationary effects in BCI applications. These approaches can be divided into two main groups, namely, the approaches adapting the model to the changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and the approaches making the model robust and invariant against the changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>The research studies on the former group showed that the BCI performance can be improved even by using simple adaptive methods, such as bias adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Some studies chose adapting the classifier <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, while some focused on the feature extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, or the operational frequency bands <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. One promising approach is covariate shift adaptation providing unsupervised adaptation to shifts in the feature distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Another work proposed adaptive classifiers based on the expectation-maximization method <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In addition, some recent studies successfully used techniques for co-adaptive learning of user and machine <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Most of the algorithms in the latter group focused on extracting invariant features by regularizing the common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. For example, the invariant common spatial patterns (iCSP) algorithm used extra measurements, such as electrooculogram (EOG) or electromyogram (EMG) to improve the CSP features to be invariant against muscular or ocular artifacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Stationary CSP (sCSP) is another algorithm, which regularized CSP by penalizing the variations between covariance matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. There are also some works that improved the model by extracting the stationary part of the EEG signal before applying the CSP algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Despite various studies and recent advances, dealing with nonstationary changes in EEG-based BCIs has remained a challenging issue. This paper belongs to the latter group aiming to extract BCI features that are robust and invariant against the nonstationarities. For this purpose, we optimize the CSP spatial filters by minimizing the dissimilarities and variations in the train data. The CSP algorithm is a feature extraction method that computes spatial filters maximizing the discrimination of the two classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Despite the widespread use and the efficiency of CSP, its performance may be distorted by intrinsic variations in the signal properties. CSP only considers the separation of the means of the two classes, while the within-class scatter information is completely ignored. Since the EEG signals are nonstationary, there may be high trial-to-trial variations within a class that result in large scatters around the means in the feature space.</p><p>Motivated by this issue, this paper proposes a novel spatial filtering algorithm by defining a new criterion that simultaneously maximizes the discrimination between the class means, and minimizes the within-class dissimilarities. Since a Kullback-Leibler (KL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> based term is defined to measure the within-class dissimilarities, the proposed algorithm is called KLCSP. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed KLCSP algorithm, two datasets are used: the publicly available dataset IVa from BCI competition III <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and a large dataset, including 132 sessions collected from stroke patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The KLCSP results are compared with the results obtained using the CSP and the sCSP algorithms, and some quantitative analysis and visualization techniques are provided to better understand the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the CSP algorithm and its extension, the proposed KLCSP algorithm, in detail. The applied datasets and the performed experiments are explained in Section III. Section IV presents the experimental results, followed by discussions in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. METHODOLOGY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Common Spatial Patterns</head><p>For classification of motor imagery tasks, spatial filters are widely used to find meaningful patterns from the noisy EEG data. Among different spatial filtering algorithms, CSP is so far the most commonly used algorithm in EEG-based BCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. It linearly transforms the band-pass filtered EEG data to a spatially filtered space, such that the variance of one class is maximized while the variance of the other class is minimized.</p><p>Since band-passed EEG measurements have approximately zero means, the normalized covariance matrix can be estimated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= XX T trace(XX T ) (1)</formula><p>where X ∈ R C×S denotes a single-trial EEG with C and S being the number of the channels and the measurement samples, respectively, T denotes the transpose operator, and trace (X) gives the sum of the diagonal elements of X.</p><p>The CSP algorithm projects X to spatially filtered Z as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Z = WX (2)</formula><p>where the rows of the projection matrix W are the spatial filters. W is generally computed by simultaneous diagonalization of the average covariance matrices from the both classes. This is equivalent to solving the eigenvalue decomposition problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">1 W T = 2 W T (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where 1 and 2 are, respectively, the average covariance matrices of each class; and is the diagonal matrix that contains the eigenvalues of -1 2 1 . Since the eigenvalues in indicate the ratio of the variances under the two conditions, the first and the last m rows of W, corresponding to the m largest and the m smallest eigenvalues, are generally used as the most discriminative filters. Subsequently, the variances of the spatially filtered EEG data (possibly after a normalization and a log-transformation) are used as the features <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>The CSP algorithm, in computing the projection matrix W, can be formulated as an optimization problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> given by min</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">w i i=m i=1 w i 2 w T i + i=2m i=m+1 w i 1 w T i Subject to: w i ( 1 + 2 )w T i = 1 i = {1, 2, . . . , 2m} w i ( 1 + 2 )w T j = 0 i, j = {1, 2, . . . , 2m} i = j (4)</formula><p>where the unknown weights w i ∈ R 1×C , i = {1, . . . , 2m}, respectively, indicate the first and the last m rows of the CSP projection matrix. Formulating the CSP algorithm as a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem in (4) enables us to penalize the within-class dissimilarities in CSP by adding a penalty term (see Section II-B).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Minimizing Within-Class Dissimilarities in CSP Filters</head><p>The CSP filters are learned using the average covariance matrices. Hence, they actually model the discrimination of the average powers (means) of the two classes. However, the large discrimination between the class means does not guarantee to have compact features with small scatters around the means. Since the EEG signals are nonstationary, there may be high trial-to-trial variations within a class resulting in deteriorated BCI performances.</p><p>This issue motivates to modify the CSP algorithm such that simultaneously the discrimination between the class means is maximized, and the within-class dissimilarities are minimized. For this purpose, first, the variations and dissimilarities between the trials of each class require to be measured. A natural choice for a dissimilarity metric is one that compares the probability distribution functions. A common possible choice, used in this paper, is the KL divergence or relative entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Given two probability distributions, P 1 (i ) and P 2 (i ) (taken as reference), the KL divergence is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">D(P 1 (i )|P 2 (i )) = i P 1 (i ) ln P 1 (i ) P 2 (i ) . (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>The KL divergence provides a nonnegative measure, which is zero if and only if P 1 = P 2 . As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, the KL divergence evaluates the dissimilarity between two distributions via the logarithm of their ratio weighted by the occurrence probability. This means that KL is not a sort of punctual difference between two distributions but rather a probability divergence.</p><p>In this paper, it is assumed that the nonstationarities exist only in the first two moments of the single-trial EEG (i.e., mean and covariance) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Following this assumption, to measure the within-class dissimilarities of the EEG data, we split the training trials of each class into a number of consecutive epochs, and then we measure the dissimilarities between the distributions of each epoch and the average trials from the same class using the first two moments. The average distribution of a group of band-pass filtered EEG trials can be defined by a zero mean and a covariance matrix computed from averaging the covariance matrices over the multiple EEG trials. Based on the maximum entropy principle, the most prudent model for modeling the distribution of the EEG trials that is consistent with zero mean and a covariance matrix is Gaussian <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>The KL divergence between multivariate Gaussian distributions, N 0 (μ 0 , 0 ) and N 1 (μ 1 , 1 ), has a closed-form expression</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">D(N 0 |N 1 ) = 0.5 (μ 1 -μ 0 ) T -1 1 (μ 1 -μ 0 ) + trace( -1<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">0 ) -ln det( 0 ) det( 1 ) -d (6)</formula><p>where det and d denote the determinant function and the dimensionality of the data, respectively. So D(N(0, t ω )|N(0, ω )) measures the dissimilarity of the distribution of the t th epoch in class ω from the average distribution in class ω, where t ω and ω , respectively, denote the average covariance matrices of the t th epoch and the whole data belonging to class ω. Subsequently, minimizing the average within-class dissimilarities of the spatially filtered data is equivalent to minimizing the loss function</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">L w 1 w 2 ... w 2m = L(w) = 1 2 2 ω=1 1 N ω N ω t =1 φ(w, t ω , ω ) = 1 2 2 ω=1 1 N ω N ω t =1</formula><p>D(N(0, w t ω w T )|N(0, w ω w T )) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> where w= w 1 w 2 ... w 2m is a matrix containing the first and the last m spatial filters, and N ω denotes the number of epochs belonging to class ω (i.e., similar to the loss function proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>).</p><p>Adding the proposed loss function <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> to the CSP optimization function (4) results in spatial filters that simultaneously maximize the between-classes distance of the powers (i.e., variances), and minimize the within-class dissimilarities of the powers. Hence, the following optimization problem is proposed to obtain the optimized spatial filters:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">min w i (1-r) i=m i=1 w i C 2 w T i + i=2m i=m+1 w i C 1 w T i + r L w 1 w 2 ... w 2m</formula><p>Subject to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">w i (C 1 + C 2 )w T i = 1 i = {1, 2, . . . , 2m} w i (C 1 + C 2 )w T j = 0 i, j = {1, 2, . . . , 2m} i = j (8)</formula><p>where r (0 ≤ r ≤ 1) is a regularization parameter to control the discrimination between and the similarity within the training classes. Each epoch contains ν consecutive trials from the same class. In this paper, the best subject-specific r and ν values are selected from small predefined sets by crossvalidation. Since the new KL divergence-based term is used, we abbreviate the proposed algorithm as KLCSP.</p><p>The proposed KLCSP algorithm is a nonlinear optimization problem, and due to the equality constraints it is a nonconvex optimization problem. There are several numerical optimization methods, such as augmented Lagrangian or sequential quadratic programming (SQP) that can be applied to find local minima of this problem. In this paper, the fmincon solver available in MATLAB based on SQP method was used <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. It is noted that all the 2m KLCSP filters are computed simultaneously. In addition, the spatial filters obtained from the CSP algorithm were used as the initial point. The motivation behind using the CSP filters for initialization is that when the regularization part is removed from the proposed cost function, the CSP filters are the global solution. Thus, starting from the CSP filters, the solver searches for filters improving the cost function compared to the CSP filters. Our experimental results on two datasets (see Section IV) also confirmed that although the KLCSP filters obtained from this initialization may not be the global solution, they significantly outperformed the CSP filters in terms of the classification accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. KLCSP Versus sCSP</head><p>The sCSP algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> is another extension of the CSP algorithm proposed to make the CSP filters robust against the within-class variations and nonstationarities. In the sCSP algorithm, the dissimilarities between the average EEG trials and each epoch are measured by subtracting their covariance matrices. Then, to make the resultant difference matrix positive and subsequently usable in the Rayleigh quotation, the signs of its negative eigenvalues are flipped. As mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the proposed approximation is an upper bound for the initial nonflipped difference matrix, making the sCSP optimization directly solvable as a generalized eigenvalue problem. However, since the flipped difference matrices are different from the nonflipped ones, the sCSP algorithm may not lead to the optimal filters.</p><p>In contrast, the proposed KLCSP algorithm measures the nonstationarities based on the KL divergence that has a known interpretation for measuring the dissimilarities between two distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. It does not impose any approximations in measuring the dissimilarities ignoring the manifold structure of the covariance matrices. In addition, the constraints in the proposed KLCSP optimization function lead to diagonal covariance matrices in both the classes. Therefore, unlike sCSP, the projected signals by the obtained KLCSP filters are uncorrelated in both the classes. The proposed KLCSP algorithm considers the correlation between the projected signals to achieve a better discrimination. However, the KLCSP algorithm requires solving a nonconvex optimization problem yielding solutions that may be sub-optimal.</p><p>In Section III, these algorithms are compared in terms of the classification accuracy, and the advantages and disadvantages of them will be further discussed in Section V.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. EXPERIMENTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Data Description</head><p>In this paper, the EEG data from two datasets were used. These two datasets are described as follows.</p><p>1) Dataset IVa from BCI Competition III <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>: This publicly available dataset comprised EEG data from five healthy subjects recorded using 118 channels. During the recording sessions, the subjects were instructed to perform one of two motor imagery tasks: right hand or foot. 280 trials were available for each subject, whereby 168, 224, 84, 56, and 28 trials formed the training sets for subjects aa, al, av, aw, and ay, respectively. Subsequently, the remaining trials formed the test sets. Using this dataset, the performance of the proposed KLCSP algorithm can be evaluated against different sizes of training data recorded from a large number of channels.</p><p>2) Neuro-Rehabilitation Dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>: This large dataset comprised a total of 132 sessions EEG data recorded from 11 hemiparetic stroke patients. Each patient underwent 12 motor imagery-based BCI with robotic feedback neuro-rehabilitation sessions recorded over one month (refer NCT00955838 in ClinicalTrials.gov) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The EEG data were acquired using 25 channels. The experimental paradigm is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In each repeat, the patient was first prepared with a visual cue for 2 s, then a "go" cue would instruct the patient to perform motor imagery of the impaired hand. If the voluntary motor intent was detected within the 4 s action period, the strapped MIT-Manus robot would assist the patient in moving the impaired limb toward the goal. Finally, the patient was asked to rest for 6 s. There was a total of 160 repeats in each session (1 repeat means a complete run from preparation cue to the rest stage). There was a dedicated calibration phase before the rehabilitation phase to train the online classifier.</p><p>In this paper, the classification problem involved distinguishing between the motor imagery stage and the rest stage. Therefore, each session comprised 160 motor imagery actions of the affected hand and 160 rest conditions. In this paper, the first 160 single-trials of each session were considered as the training set, and the second 160 single-trials were considered as the test set. Since variability and diversity in the rest class are more pronounced than motor imagery classes, this dataset is a proper choice to investigate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Data Processing</head><p>The performance of the proposed KLCSP algorithm was evaluated on the abovementioned datasets, and compared with the CSP and the sCSP algorithms. For each dataset, the EEG data from 0.5 to 2.5 s after the visual cue were used whereby the selected time segment was used by the winner of the BCI competition IV dataset IIa <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. In this paper, a single bandpass filter from 8 to 30 Hz was used for filtering the EEG data, since this single frequency band includes the range of frequencies that are mainly involved in performing motor imagery. The filtering was performed using a fifth-order Butterworth filter. Thereafter, the spatially filtered signals were obtained using the first and the last two spatial filters of (s/KL)CSP, m = 2. Finally, the variances of the spatially filtered signals were applied as the inputs of the LDA classifier. Note that, in this paper, we did not reject any trials or electrodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EVALUATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Selecting the Parameters in KLCSP</head><p>In the proposed KLCSP algorithm, two parameters are required to be optimally selected, namely, the regularization parameter r and the number of trials in each epoch ν. In this paper, the best subject-specific r and ν were selected from the sets of r ∈ {0.1, 0.2, . . . , 0.9} and ν ∈ {1, 5, 10}, respectively, where the five-fold cross-validation was performed for the different values of r and ν on the train data and the ones resulting in the minimum error were chosen. After choosing the best subject-specific r and ν, the KLCSP filters were trained using the whole train data, and then evaluated on the test data.</p><p>To consider the changes over the time, in all the experiments, each epoch was constructed by a set of consecutive trials from the same class. In addition, there was no overlap between the epochs. Following this issue, during the fivefold cross-validation, after randomly selecting the evaluation trials, the remaining trials were ordered based on the time that they were recorded, and then each epoch was constructed using the ν consecutive trials from the same class. It is noted that by selecting different numbers of trials in each epoch, nonstationarities and variations in different time-scales are taken into account. Considering a small number of trials in each epoch results in focusing on trial-by-trial changes, such as muscular artifacts, while increasing the number of trials shifts the focus into slower changes, such as variations of task involvement or fatigue.</p><p>To have a fair comparison, the same procedure as described above was applied to find the best subject-specific parameters of the sCSP algorithm (i.e., the regularization parameter and the number of trials in each epoch). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Performance Comparison</head><p>In the first experiment, we compared the proposed KLCSP algorithm with the standard CSP and the sCSP algorithms using the dataset IVa from BCI competition III. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> presents the classification accuracies on the test data obtained by CSP, sCSP, and KLCSP. The results showed that the proposed KLCSP algorithm outperformed the CSP and the sCSP algorithms by an average of 4.14% and 0.77%, respectively.</p><p>In the second experiment, we evaluated the proposed KLCSP algorithm using the neuro-rehabilitation dataset. This large dataset was recorded over 132 sessions from 11 stroke patients. The first half of each session was considered as the training set, and the second half was considered as the test set. Table II reports the average classification accuracies of the test sets from the neuro-rehabilitation dataset obtained by CSP, sCSP, and the proposed KLCSP algorithm. The results showed that the proposed KLCSP algorithm yielded the mean (median) accuracy of 73.43% (72.50%), whereas the CSP and the sCSP algorithms yielded the mean (median) accuracies of 68.69% (67.81%), and 69.86% (68.75%), respectively. Interestingly, for some patients, the average improvements achieved by the KLCSP algorithm are substantial (e.g., P034 by 8.9 and 7.4% average improvement against the corresponding CSP and sCSP results, respectively).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> depicts scatter plots of the classification accuracies obtained from the neuro-rehabilitation dataset. The first two sub-figures from the left side, respectively, compare the classification results of the sCSP and the proposed KLCSP algorithms against the CSP results. The classification results obtained using the proposed KLCSP algorithm and the sCSP algorithm are then compared in the last sub-figure. Each plotted point on the sub-figures indicates the classification accuracy obtained from one of the 132 sessions. The classification accuracies of the sessions belonging to a same patient were plotted with a same color and mark. As the classification accuracies were plotted, the points above the diagonal line mean the algorithm of the y-axis performed better than the one of the x-axis.</p><p>The results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> showed that the sCSP and the proposed KLCSP algorithms, respectively, outperformed the CSP algorithm in 95 and 112 sessions over the total 132 sessions, and for the rest of the sessions, the CSP results were only slightly better than the results obtained by sCSP and KLCSP. Interestingly, the last sub-figure showed that in 103 over 132 sessions, the proposed KLCSP algorithm outperformed the sCSP algorithm. With a closer look at the KLCSP results, it is realized that the biggest improvements were achieved by those subjects with CSP performances less than 75%. Collecting all the results of the two aforementioned datasets and dividing them to three groups based on their CSP error rates, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">III</ref> investigates the performance of KLCSP and sCSP on the different BCI users. The first three rows of this table compare the average(median) classification accuracies of the different groups obtained by CSP, sCSP, and the proposed KLCSP filters, respectively. Finally, the last three rows show the statistical wilcoxon signed-rank test results between CSP, sCSP, and KLCSP in the different groups. The results showed that the sCSP algorithm improved the classification accuracy of the subjects with moderate and poor CSP performances, although the improvements were not statistically significant. In contrast, the proposed KLCSP algorithm improved the results of all the groups of the subjects, including those with poor, moderate, and high CSP performances, and interestingly the improvements for the subjects with moderate or poor CSP performances were statistically significant. Comparing the sCSP and KLCSP results also revealed that for the subjects with poor CSP performances the proposed KLCSP algorithm significantly outperformed the sCSP algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Impact of KLCSP on Subjects With Different Qualities</head><p>To better understand the impact of the KLCSP algorithm on different subjects, each part of the KLCSP cost function, given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, was quantified for the dataset IVa from BCI competition III. The proposed KLCSP cost function comprises two parts. The first part, i=m i=1 w i C 2 w T i + i=2m i=m+1 w i C 1 w T i , is inversely related to the discrimination between the mean powers of the two classes. Thus, in this paper,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">( i=m i=1 w i C 2 w T i + i=2m i=m+1 w i C 1 w T i ) -1</formula><p>is referred to as the between-classes distance. The second part, L([</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">w 1 ... w 2m</formula><p>]) defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, is directly related to the variations within the classes, and referred to as the within-class dissimilarities. In discrimination of the samples around the decision boundary, the amount of the within-class dissimilarities as well as the separation of the mean powers of the two classes is crucial.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">IV</ref> presents the percentage changes of the betweenclasses distances and the within-class dissimilarities when the CSP filters were replaced by KLCSP filters, for the train sets of the dataset IVa. In this table, the qualities of the subjects  The qualities of the subjects were defined based on the CSP error rates. Dist. and diss. denote distance and dissimilarities, respectively.</p><p>were defined based on their CSP error rates (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>). To compute the aforementioned variables, the number of trials in each epoch was set to 1. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">IV</ref> showed that the KLCSP algorithms were more valuable for subjects with poor initial CSP performances (e.g., aa, av), since compared to the CSP filters the KLCSP filters substantially reduced the within-class dissimilarities of these subjects, while the between-class distances were slightly decreased. The reason could be the fact that users with poor CSP performances often have noisy and nonstationary signals; thus CSP may fail to produce stable and discriminative signals.</p><p>In contrast, KLCSP can alleviate the destructive effects of nonstationary and artifact-corrupted trials resulting in a better discrimination of the two classes. On the other hand, the subjects who performed well with CSP filters benefited less from applying the KLCSP filters, as the KLCSP filters only slightly reduced their within-class dissimilarities (e.g., aa). This makes sense, since these subjects have already wellseparated and stable signals using the standard CSP filters. So there is no room to improve by KLCSP.</p><p>Comparing the results in Tables I and IV may raise a question regarding the subject av. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">IV</ref> showed that the KLCSP filters reduced the within-class dissimilarities of the train data for the subject av to one fifth of the CSP's amount, while the between-class distance was slightly decreased. Thus, one may expect to see a big improvement in the test classification accuracy of this subject using the KLCSP filters. However, KLCSP yielded only an improvement of 3.06%. Although 3% improvement is still remarkable in BCI applications, there is a need to investigate why KLCSP could not get more than 69.9% test accuracy for this subject despite substantial improvement of the discrimination in the train data. One possible reason may be some nonstationarities in the test data that could not be captured from the train data (e.g., changing the strategy of performing the mental tasks in the test session, among others). As a result, since KLCSP only uses the train data, it would not be able to truly deal with such nonstationarities. This issue will be investigated more in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Toward Understanding the Merits of KLCSP</head><p>In the previous sections, we showed quantitative evidences indicating the proposed KLCSP can significantly improve the classification accuracy in EEG-based BCIs. In this section, we provide more analysis and visualizations to better understand the nature and the impact of our proposed algorithm on nonstationary changes in the EEG signals and the feature space.</p><p>The analysis was conducted with two sessions selected from the neuro-rehabilitation dataset, since they achieved two of the largest improvements in terms of the classification accuracy. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">V</ref> provides more details about the selected sessions, including the patient's code, the session number (as 12 sessions were recorded from each patient, it can be from 1 to 12), the test classification accuracies obtained by CSP and the proposed KLCSP algorithm, the regularization value r and the number of trials in each epoch ν selected by five-fold cross-validation on the train data.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the distance between the power of each trial and the average power of the corresponding class in the train sets after filtering by the best CSP and KLCSP filters. Since the EEG signals are centered, the power of each trial is equivalent to the variance of that trial. So in this part, the EEG data were filtered using the best CSP and KLCSP filters (the best filters were defined by the fisher score of the corresponding features in the train set), and the powers of the filtered signals were calculated. High trial-to-trial variations can yield high variations between the powers. On the other side, decreasing the dissimilarities can be interpreted by decreasing the distance between the powers. Therefore, this figure gives us an insight about the variabilities within each class after CSP and KLCSP filtering. Based on Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, shorter distances between the powers of the trials and the average power of the corresponding class indicate more similarities. From Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, specifically the y-axes, one can easily recognize higher dissimilarities and variations within the rest class as compared with the motor imagery class. In the neurorehabilitation dataset, since the rest class was a "no-command" state that the patients were allowed to do almost any other mental tasks than the impaired hand motor imagery, this class has high variations. Apart from this issue, as can be seen, the distances between the powers of the trials and the average power in the KLCSP filtered trials are mostly smaller than the CSP ones. With a closer look, we can see that the proposed KLCSP algorithm was able to efficiently damp most of the big variations (those trials with large deviation from the mean power), such as trials 3, 62, and 63 in the hand motor imagery class of Patient P007, or trials 3, 11, and 34 in the rest class of Patient P037.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the train and the test features obtained by CSP and the proposed KLCSP filters. It is noted that for the ease in visualization only two features which had the highest fisher scores in the train data were plotted. Moreover, the features were plotted after the normalization. The blue crosses and red squares denote the features of the hand motor imagery and the rest class, respectively. The black line represents the LDA hyperplane obtained by the train data. Comparing the distributions of the train features extracted from CSP and the proposed KLCSP algorithm clearly reveals that the KLCSP features were more compact and thus more separable. Furthermore, transferring from the train to the test in CSP caused big shifts as well as big changes in the shape of the feature distributions. In contrast, the differences between the feature distributions of the train and the test sessions in KLCSP were almost limited to small shifts. This shows that most of the nonstationary changes in the test data of this patient could be successfully captured by the proposed KLCSP filters, that may be due to a constant topography between the train and the test nonstationarities.</p><p>To better explain the performance differences between the CSP and the KLCSP algorithms, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> compares some examples of the spatial filters. In general, this figure showed that the CSP filters presented large weights in several unexpected locations from the neurophysiological point of view. For P007 and P037, although the CSP filters captured the relevant patterns, i.e., dipole-like activations over the left motor cortex, they were still affected by some nonstationarities and artifacts in some irrelevant channels. For aa, the CSP filter failed to capture the foot motor imagery pattern, as it was adversely affected by artifacts in the electrodes F3, F8, and FT8. On the contrary, the proposed KLCSP algorithm penalized the nonstationarities and the artifact-corrupted channels, and extracted filters that are neurophysiologically more relevant, with strong weights over the relevant motor cortex areas and smooth weights over the other areas.</p><p>Artifacts, such blinking and other muscle movements, produce voltage changes with much higher amplitude than the endogenous brain activity. Thus, artifact-corrupted trials usually have excessive dominant powers in some channels, resulting in CSP filters with big spatial weights for those channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> (see the aas CSP filter in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> as an example). However, in the KLCSP algorithm, the distribution of an artifact-corrupted trial is compared with the distribution of the average EEG trials from the same class using the proposed loss function <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. Since there are big differences between the powers of the affected channels in these two distributions, the KLCSP algorithm attenuates the spatial weights of those channels to minimize the loss function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. DISCUSSION</head><p>The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed KLCSP algorithm. The experimental results showed that the proposed KLCSP optimization with the CSP filters as the initial point yielded spatial filters outperforming the sCSP algorithm, although the obtained KLCSP filters were not guaranteed to be the global solution. In particular, the KLCSP results of the subjects who had poor CSP performances (i.e., CSP error rate more than 30%) were significantly better than the corresponding sCSP results. Moreover, compared to the dataset IVa, the performance difference between KLCSP and sCSP in the neuro-rehabilitation dataset was more salient. This can be due to the fact that the neuro-rehabilitation dataset was more contaminated by noise, nonstationarities, and artifact-corrupted trials. All these results suggest that the proposed penalty term in the KLCSP algorithm could be more successful in capturing the nonstationarities and variations. However, it must be noted that the sCSP algorithm is computationally more efficient than the proposed KLCSP algorithm.</p><p>Regarding the computational complexity, the most time consuming part of the proposed KLCSP algorithm is related to finding the optimization parameters, r and ν, by crossvalidation. However, this time can be substantially reduced using parallel computing. Moreover, in the lack of time, one can suffice to use a fixed value for the parameter r (i.e., number of trials in each epoch). In our experiments, in 47% of the cases, 5 was selected as the r value, while in 28% and 25% of the cases 10 and 1 were selected, respectively. Averagely, fixing the r value to 5 yielded the classification results around 0.8% less accurate than the classification results of using cross-validation in selecting r . So if it is required to reduce the computation time, using five trials in each epoch are recommended. The other fact is that when the number of channels is increased, the KLCSP algorithm requires more time to find the optimal filters. Nevertheless, using less than 30 channels and fixing the number of trials in each epoch to five, our experiments showed that it is truly possible to compute the KLCSP filters in a few minutes break between the calibration and feedback phases.</p><p>The KLCSP algorithm requires estimating the single-trial covariance matrices as well as the average covariance matrices. One question can be about the estimation of the single-trial covariance matrices. Since the EEG signals are contaminated by noise and artifacts, the sample-based covariance estimation can be adversely affected. Some algorithms, such as smoothing algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, may help to get a better estimation of the single-trial covariance matrix in some cases. However, they increase the computation time and may need some other recordings. Furthermore, the KLCSP algorithm inherently aims to detect such changes in the data by comparing the covariance matrices of each trial/epoch with the average covariance matrix of the corresponding class, and learn spatial filters that are robust against the existing variations in the train data. Nevertheless, some preprocessing algorithms, such as selecting subject-specific frequency bands or time segments can increase the quality of the trials resulting in a better general performance for KLCSP.</p><p>The other issue is that the average covariance matrix for each class can also be distorted by noisy and artifact-corrupted trials. As a result, in the CSP algorithm, the distorted estimation of the covariance matrices may lead to poor spatial filters. As our experimental results showed, the proposed KLCSP algorithm automatically tries to reduce the destructive effects by enforcing the spatial filters to be less sensitive to artifacts and within-class variations, although the average covariance matrices may not be properly estimated. By the way, it is possible to combine KLCSP with the regularized covariance estimations to take the advantages of both the algorithms. We evaluated some of such algorithms on some randomly selected subjects, i.e., a KLCSP with diagonal loading <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> or a KLCSP with minimum covariance determinant estimate <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, among others. Unfortunately, none of them yielded classification accuracies noticeably higher than the corresponding KLCSP results. Thus, the KLCSP algorithm with a single regularization can be preferable. It is simpler and computationally more efficient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper proposed a novel spatial filtering algorithm for the EEG-based BCIs, called KLCSP, to extract features that are robust and invariant against the nonstationarities inherent in the EEG signals. This was achieved by defining a new criterion, that maximizes the discrimination between the classes while minimizes the within-class dissimilarities. Thus, a loss function was defined to measure the within-class dissimilarities based on the KL divergence, and it was imposed in the CSP optimization function.</p><p>The experimental results on five healthy subjects from the publicly available BCI competition III dataset IVa as well as 11 stroke patients performing neuro-rehabilitation in a total of 132 sessions demonstrated that the proposed KLCSP algorithm significantly outperformed the CSP and the sCSP algorithms by an average of 4.7% and 3.5%, respectively ( p &lt; 0.01). The results also showed that the KLCSP improvements were particularly more significant for the subjects with poor CSP performances.</p><p>The quantitative visualization showed that the KLCSP filtered signals had less within-class variations compared to the CSP ones. Moreover, plotting the feature distributions confirmed that the KLCSP features were more compact and more separable, and the trained model using the proposed KLCSP algorithm was able to effectively capture the nonstationarities learned from the train data. In addition, comparing the spatial filters showed that the KLCSP filters were neurophysiologically more relevant, with strong weights over the relevant motor cortex areas and smooth weights over the other areas.</p><p>We would like to emphasize that the proposed algorithm does not require any additional recordings, and it is completely data-driven. The proposed algorithm only uses the train data to make the features robust and invariant against nonstationarities and variations rather than adapting to nonstationarities happening over the test sessions. Nevertheless, online adaptation algorithms may further enhance the proposed algorithm against unseen changes happening in the test data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
