When 1  beta , the discontinuity limits the possible trial vectors generated by reducing the number of mutants by half. Sufficient diversity is required to prevent the stagnate condition in DE. In stagnate condition, the solution falls into local optima and DE can no longer be in a position to explore an improved solution. By considering random values of beta , more possibilities to the vector differentials can be obtained <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, which increases the number of potential trial vectors. In this paper, the beta values are randomized between 0.2 and 0.8, as the values less than 0.4 and greater than 1 are considered mostly ineffective <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p></div>

The investigations are conducted on functions F2, F11, F16 and F17 which are unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions. When solving these functions F2, F11, F16 and F17, increasing the population size up to 30 can enhance the diversity of the algorithm and can, therefore, lead to better results as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.

From Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, there is no significant difference in results. DE as a local search operator is not sensitive to the initial values of these parameters, which is an advantage of DE.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Hybrid SCA-DE</head><p>The hybridizing SCA with DE (Hybrid SCA-DE) is introduced in details in this section. In SCA, the way an algorithm moves towards the next position is based on random and adaptive variables; therefore, a satisfactory solution cannot always be found every time. To overcome this disadvantage, some genetic reproduction mechanisms have been added to SCA approach. For some cases, SCA is capable of making full use of the population knowledge and has proven good performance on some benchmark functions. However, sometimes, SCA may not lead to optimal solutions to complex problems. To further enhance the exploitation of SCA, a more focused differential evolution algorithm is incorporated into the SCA to form a new Hybrid SCA-DE algorithm. The mutation and crossover operators are used to generate a new position for SCA. For a minimum problem, if the newly generated solution has a smaller fitness, it will be in place of the old one. In other words, it can be considered as a solution to the next generation.</p><p>In Hybrid SCA-DE, a standard SCA algorithm is utilized to search globally for the purpose of making most solutions move toward a more promising area. After the exploration stage, DE algorithm is utilized to search locally with a small step to get the final best solution. Based on the mainframe of Hybrid SCA-DE, the SCA emphasizes the diversification at the beginning of the search with a big step to explore the search space extensively and evade trapping into local optima, while later DE algorithm focuses on the intensification and lets the individuals move toward the best solution at the later stage of the optimization process. Also, this method can cope with both global and local search effectively.</p><p>Initially, it evaluates the fitness of each vector and in obtaining the best solution (destination position) which is assigned to SCA as the position of the destination point in Eqs. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. DE is used as an intermediate algorithm to improve the worst results obtained using SCA between iterations. Over a series of iterations, the position of every individual in the SCA is updated using Eqs. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>). Then we update to new positions using Eqs. ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, respectively. Once the series of iterations is completed, it returns the best solution of the function.</p></div>

These benchmark functions (shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref>) can be categorized into three groups: Unimodal, Multimodal high-dimensional, and fixed dimension (low-dimensional) multimodal benchmark functions.</p><p>Hybrid SCA-DE, SCA, PSO, DE and TLBO algorithms have several parameters that need to be initialized before running. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">2</ref> shows the initial values of the basic parameters for these algorithms. For Hybrid SCA-DE, the parameters taken are the combination of parameters from both SCA and DE.</p><p>The Hybrid SCA-DE algorithm and other algorithms (SCA, PSO, DE, and TLBO) are simulated thirty times on each of the twenty-three benchmark functions for comparison. The experimental results comprising several statistical parameters, such as average, standard deviation, median and worst of the best-so-far solution in the last iteration are reported. The results of the algorithms on all test functions are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">3</ref> for dimension D=10 and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4</ref> for D=30 for functions F1-F13. To verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, the same maximum number of iterations and population sizes are taken for the proposed and the existing algorithms (SCA, PSO, DE, and TLBO) to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The outcomes are averaged over thirty independent runs, and the best outcomes are shown in bold type in the Tables.</p><p>The unimodal functions have no local solution and there is only one global solution. Consequently, they are used to examine heuristic optimization algorithms in terms of convergence rate. Functions</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">F F 7 1 </formula><p>are unimodal functions, and the results for these unimodal functions are shown in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">3</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4</ref>. As can be seen in this tables, the Hybrid SCA-DE outperforms the other algorithms on five out of seven for D=10 and six out of seven for D=30 for the unimodal benchmark functions in terms of the mean, standard deviation, median, and worst value of the results. Therefore, this is evidence that the proposed algorithm has high performance in finding the global solution of unimodal benchmark functions.</p><p>For multimodal functions</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">F F 13 8 </formula><p>with many local minima, the final results are more important because of this function can reflect the algorithm's ability to escape from poor local optima and obtain the near-global optimum. We have tested the experiments on</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">F F 13 8 </formula><p>where the number of local minima increases exponentially as long as the dimension of the function increases. As the results of mean, standard deviation, median, and the worst value is shown in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">3</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4</ref> the Hybrid SCA-DE performs better than the other algorithms on four out of six multimodal high-dimensional benchmark functions for D=10 and 30.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">3</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4</ref> through Figs. 9(a) and Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>(b), it can be said that Hybrid SCA-DE is efficient at evading local minima with a good convergence rate for multimodal functions. Therefore, it can be stated that the Hybrid SCA-DE can balance exploration and exploitation properly for solving challenging problems.</p><p>Comparing algorithms based on mean, standard deviation, median, and worst value over 30 independent runs does not compare each of the runs. Therefore, it is still possible that the superiority occurs by chance despite its low probability in 30 runs. In order to compare the results of each run and decide on the significance of the results, the Wilcoxon statistical test was performed at 5% significance level and the p-values are reported in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>. For the statistical test, the best algorithm in each test function is chosen and compared with other algorithms independently. For example, if the best algorithm is Hybrid SCA-DE, a pairwise comparison is made between Hybrid SCA-DE/SCA, Hybrid SCA-DE/PSO, Hybrid SCA-DE/TLBO, and so on. Note that since the best algorithm cannot be compared with itself, N/A has been written for the best algorithm in each function which stands for Not Applicable.</p><p>As per the results in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>, p-values are much less than 0.05 for the Hybrid SCA-DE, which demonstrates that the superiority of this algorithm is statistically significant. For function F20, the Hybrid SCA-DE algorithm provides p-value greater than 0.05. This shows that the Hybrid SCA-DE algorithm is not significantly better on this function. Overall, these results show that Hybrid SCA-DE can outperform other algorithms in the literature. According to the NFL theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, therefore, it has the potential to solve problems (of the types tested) that cannot be solved efficiently by other algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Sensitivity Analysis of Parameters</head><p>To investigate the impact of population size on the performance of SCA-DE, we have performed the experiment with 30 independent runs with 10 increment in the population size as given in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. The investigations are conducted on functions F1, F4, F18 and F23 which are unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions. When solving these functions F1, F4, F18 and F23, increasing the population size the performance of SCA-DE is almost constant as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">11</ref>. To balance the computational burden and the algorithm performance, 30 population size is used in this paper.</p><p>For  <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. These investigations are conducted on functions F1, F6, F16 and F21. The mean values of 30 independent runs are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">12</ref>. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">12</ref>, there is no significant difference in results. Thus, by inheriting the merits of DE as a local search operator, SCA-DE is also not sensitive to the initial values of these parameters, which is an advantage of SCA-DE. This is just why DE as a local search operator is adopted in our framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Application of Hybrid SCA-DE for object tracking</head><p>Computer vision is an advanced field of science and technology that concentrates on methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding images. Computer vision, as a scientific discipline, is associated with the theory behind artificial systems which extracts the related information from images and also relates its theories and models in designing computer vision systems. Various forms of image data can be considered such as image segments from multiple cameras, video sequences, or complex data from the medical scanner. Many applications of computer vision include, video communication and compression, high-level video analysis, display technology, security and surveillance, traffic control, video editing, metrology, human-computer interfaces to medical imaging, navigation, and augmented reality <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. In object tracking problem, firstly a state vector is used for defining the characteristics of target motion (state model) which include position, speed, scale, etc., and then the observation information (observation model), such as visual characteristics including color, shape, texture, etc., is established. Visual tracking remains a challenging problem despite significant evolution and research, since many decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Optimization-based tracking system</head><p>Optimization is the process of selecting best solution from a number of available alternatives with or without constraints. In this case, the tracking of an object in video sequences, or the issue of tracking the target in every image frame can be inferred as an optimization problem. The similarity function or fitness function can be defined as the observation distance between the candidate and target. A target can be tracked by either maximizing or minimizing the similarity function in the candidate solution. Hence, tracking, as an optimization problem, can be accomplished using different optimization methods.</p><p>A general optimization-based tracking architecture has been designed to compare the performance of optimization-based trackers, which can also be applied to other optimizers.</p><p>Tracking framework using the proposed Hybrid SCA-DE algorithm is designed as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">13</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">13</ref> describes the architecture, wherein the process starts with a target being, chosen by the user, or detected by any distinct object detectors in the first frame. Then the state vector, which is defined in this work as 𝑋 = [𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑠], is initialized. Where, (𝑥, 𝑦) is the target's position in pixel coordinates and 𝑠 is a scale parameter that restrains the size of an object. After selection of target in first frame, the state vector is defined as 𝑋 0 = [𝑥 0 , 𝑦 0 , 1], where 𝑥 0 , 𝑦 0 is the target's initial location and 𝑠 = 1.0 specifies that there is no scale variation in the first frame.</p><p>New candidate state vectors are generated by using a dynamic model, after selecting a target and initializing the state vector. Dynamic model can be, constant velocity (CV) model, constant acceleration (CA) model, or random walk (RW) model. Assuming that the movement of the object is very little between the image frames, the random walk model is applied. An observation model is used to describe the correlation between the state of the object and its appearance. Choosing a good observation model is essential for any tracker, but a certain observation model cannot be chosen for all different tracking scenarios. In this work, search performance is considered as a priority and hence, a standard kernel-based spatial color histogram <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> is chosen as the observation model.</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">Let   c i n i ,... 1 </formula><p>be the normalized pixel locations of the target candidate, centered at c in the present frame.</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">  h h r y x ,</formula></div>

Whenever the optimizer is probed for the target location, it displays the frame which indicates the location of the target. This entire process continues till no more frames are left available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Experiments and discussions</head><p>To illustrate the efficiency of Hybrid SCA-DE, the proposed algorithm is compared with four other tracking algorithms including PF <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, SIFT <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and BA <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Same target model and motion model are used for fair comparison.</p><p>In Hybrid SCA-DE, several experiments have been carried out and it is concluded that the population size of 15-20 is sufficient for most of the tracking problems. Two performance criteria are considered for performance evaluation of the tracker. The criteria considered are, a number of targets lost (the overlap region between ground truth and the bounding box is &lt; 50%) and complexity of time (average time cost). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">14</ref> shows the performance of the tracker for different NP, which depicts that the tracking accuracy and time complexity is increased with NP. The optimum value of NP is considered to be 20 for all experiments, to maintain tracking accuracy and time complexity. Like in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, three termination conditions are used to terminate the optimization process which are given as follows:</p><p> The fitness of f worst (the worst solution) is good enough.</p><p> The f best (best solution) is also good enough and the Euclidean distance between the best and the lowest solution (d) is below a certain threshold.  In this work, a maximum number of iterations is 100 and when it is reached the algorithm terminates.</p><p>From <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, the first two conditions depend mostly on Bhattacharya coefficient (fitness function). It is observed from the experimental simulations that the target is present, if the area of Bhattacharya coefficient is greater than 0.6. In order to guarantee that all candidates are close together with the best candidate near the target, we set the values of , f worst , f best and d to be 0.6, 0.8 and 5, respectively, in above termination conditions for better accuracy.</p><p>For comparing the results, some videos are selected and used for evaluation as taken in <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. (Note: the tracking examples are available on the website http://visual-tracking.net). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">15</ref> shows some snapshots from given video clips. As seen from Table <ref type="table">6</ref> the targets in these examples are suffering from various challenging factors. Tracking result of Hybrid SCA-DE for David, Panda, Subway, Mountain Bike, Boy, Crossing, Car and Couple Video sequences are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">16</ref>, and experimental results depict that the Hybrid SCA-DE-based tracker is capable of tracking a random target in various challenging situations.</p><p>For evaluating the accuracy of trackers, by identifying the center of the tracked target in each frame visually, the videos have been manually labeled. Then, the Euclidean distance between the center estimated by the trackers and the true center is calculated and is used as accuracy measure. The results of the comparison are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">17</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">17</ref>, the pink, green, black, blue and red lines show the tracking accuracy of the PF, SIFT, PSO, BA and Hybrid SCA-DE for the tracking examples, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">17</ref> that the Hybrid SCA-DEbased tracker performs better in all challenging conditions. It is capable of successfully tracking the target during the whole tracking process.</p><p>In order to analyze the average time costs, the time complexity of the five trackers are calculated and the comparative results are shown in Table <ref type="table">7</ref>. As shown in Table <ref type="table">7</ref>, the Hybrid SCA-DE based tracker is capable of tracking faster compare to other four trackers on average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>During the past twenty years, nature-based algorithms which are inspired by the behavior or phenomena of nature have become a hotspot in the optimization computation. This paper proposes a new optimization algorithm called Hybrid SCA-DE for solving optimization problems and object tracking. This algorithm is tested using Twenty-three eminent test functions. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to that of the other existing algorithms in exploiting the optimum and it also has advantages in exploration. In future research, real-world functions can be used in order to determine whether the proposal provides good results in these cases with the parameters obtained in this study. In addition, the use of more dimensions up to 100, 500 or 1000 can also be studied. Also, this algorithm can be utilized for multi-objective functions. The performance measures show that the GOA-DE algorithm possesses a better capability to track an object as compared to other trackers. This work can be extended to track multiple targets and more cues will be added to track those targets.  <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) on the next position <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref> Sine and cosine functions with the dimension in [-2, 2] tolerate a solution to go beyond (outside the space among them) or around (inside the space among them) the destination <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p></div>

The major difference compared with functions due to their low dimensionalities and a smaller number of local minima. As the results of mean, standard deviation, median, and the worst value is shown in Table3the Hybrid SCA-DE performs better than the other algorithms on nine out of ten of the multimodal low-dimensional benchmark functions for D=10. Box plots of the result of a global minimum of the objective function for 30 independent runs which are computed by using the Hybrid SCA-DE, SCA, PSO, DE and TLBO for functions F1, F3, F13, and F23 are shown in Fig. 8. To confirm the convergence of the Hybrid SCA-DE algorithm, two metrics are employed:  Convergence rate  Average fitness of all search agents. Figs. 9(a), 9(b) show the convergence rate of the Hybrid SCA-DE, SCA, PSO, DE, and TLBO algorithms for functions F1 to F23. The fitness of the best solution in each iteration is saved and drawn as the convergence curves in Figs. 9(a) and 9(b). The descending trend is quite evident in the convergence curves of Hybrid SCA-DE on many of the test functions investigated. This strongly proves the ability of the Hybrid SCA-DE algorithm in obtaining a better approximation of the global optimum over the course of iterations. Figs.10 (a) and 10 (b) shows quantitative measure and average fitness of all search agents in each iteration. If an algorithm improves its solutions, obviously, the average of the fitness should be improved over the course of iterations. As the average fitness curves in Figs.10 (a) and 10 (b) suggest, the Hybrid SCA-DE algorithm shows degrading fitness on all of the test functions. Another fact worth mentioning here is the accelerated decrease in the average fitness curves, which indicates that the improvement of the candidate solutions becomes faster and better over the course of iterations. Figs. 9(a) and 9(b) show how the convergence rate of Hybrid SCA-DE in several cases is better than SCA, PSO, DE, and TLBO algorithms. As stated in Tables</figDesc></figure>
