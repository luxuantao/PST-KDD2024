<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, a novel resource allocation design is investigated for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enhanced heterogeneous networks (HetNets), where small cell base stations (SBSs) are capable of communicating with multiple small cell users (SCUs) via the NOMA protocol. With the aim of maximizing the sum rate of SCUs while taking the fairness issue into consideration, a joint problem of spectrum allocation and power control is formulated. Particularly, the spectrum allocation problem is modeled as a many-to-one matching game with peer effects. We propose a novel algorithm where the SBSs and resource blocks (RBs) interact to decide their desired allocation. The proposed algorithm is proved to converge to a two-sided exchange-stable matching. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of 'exploration' into the matching game for further improving the SCUs' sum rate. The power control of each SBS is formulated as a non-convex problem, where the sequential convex programming is adopted to iteratively update the power allocation result by solving the approximate convex problem. The obtained solution is proved to satisfy the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. We unveil that: 1) The proposed algorithm closely approaches the optimal solution within a limited number of iterations; 2) The 'exploration' action is capable of further enhancing the performance of the matching algorithm; and 3) The developed NOMA-enhanced HetNets achieve a higher SCUs' sum rate compared to the conventional OMA-based HetNets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>To meet the surging traffic demands for wireless services and the need for high data rates, cellular networks are trending strongly towards heterogeneity of cells with different transmit power, coverage range and cost of deployment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) is capable of achieving more spectrum-efficient communications by deploying small cells, i.e., picocells and femtocells, underlaid on the macrocells. Since the spectrum sharing among multi-tier cells causes both co-tier and cross-tier interference, efficient resource allocation and interference management become the fundamental research challenges for HetNets. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, a unified static framework was employed to study the interplay of user association and resource allocation in heterogeneous cellular networks. A novel solution that jointly associated the users to the access points (APs), and allocated the femtocell access points (FAPs) to the service providers (SPs) in an uplink OFDMA network J. Zhao, Y. Liu, K. K. Chai, A. Nallanathan, and Y. Chen are with Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom (email:{j.zhao, yuanwei.liu, michael.chai, arumugam.nallanathan, yue.chen}@qmul.ac.uk).</p><p>Z. Han is with University of Houston, Houton, Tx, USA (email: zhan2@uh.edu). was studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, with the aim of maximizing the total satisfaction of users. Considering the device-to-device (D2D)enabled multi-tier scenario, a polynomial time-complexity distributed solution approach for the heterogeneous cellular mobile communication systems was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Recently, the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique has attracted significant research interests for its potential to enhance spectrum efficiency by allowing multiple users simultaneous transmission in the same resource block (RB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. More specifically, the fundamental concept of NOMA is to facilitate the access of multiple users in an extra dimensionpower domain, via different power levels, which is different from conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) techniques. Regarding single carrier NOMA systems, considering users were randomly deployed in a disc, the performances of both outage probability and ergodic rate were investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The fairness issue of NOMA was investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for a multiple-user scenario under two different CSI assumptions. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, under the assumption of only statistical channel state information (CSI) known at the transmitter, the power allocation and decoding order selection problem were investigated for achieving optimal outage performance. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the problem of optimal power allocation when the transmitter only had the average CSI was studied in downlink NOMA systems. On the standpoint of energy aspects, a new cooperative NOMA transmission protocol was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, in which near NOMA users were regarded as energy harvesting user relays for forwarding messages to far NOMA users.</p><p>It is worth noting that besides power domain multiplexing gain brought by NOMA, multi-carrier systems are capable of providing additional degrees of freedom offered by multiuser diversity, which motivates researchers to work on multi-carrier NOMA systems. Some initial research contributions in terms of resource allocation have been done for NOMA multicarrier/cluster/subchannel scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the authors jointly investigated the power and subcarrier allocation problem in multi-carrier NOMA systems, where the BS worked in a full-duplex mode. Both the optimal performance with applying a monotonic optimization approach and the suboptimal performance with applying a low complexity iterative approach were demonstrated. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the subchannel assignment and power allocation are jointly optimized to maximize the weighted total sum-rate in the NOMA system, while taking account of the users' fairness. For maximizing the energy efficiency of the downlink multi-carrier NOMA systems, a low complexity suboptimal subchannel assignment and power proportional factors determination algorithm was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, by assuming two users were assigned in the same channel. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, under the assumption of knowing statistical CSI at the BS, a power-efficient resource allocation scheme was studied for MC-NOMA systems. Moreover, the proposed design in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> also investigated the successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding order according to different level of quality of service (QoS). For multiple-input and multipleoutput (MIMO) NOMA scenarios, the performance was studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> based on a clustered based MIMO-NOMA structure on the standpoint of investigating the fairness issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Motivation and Contributions</head><p>Inspired by the aforementioned potential benefits of NOMA and HetNets, it is natural to investigate the promising application of NOMA technology in HetNets for further spectrum efficiency improvement. Although there have been some works facilitating spatial reuse to improve spectrum efficiency in HetNets <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, to the best of our knowledge, the solutions for resource allocation problems in HetNets with NOMA in power domain have not been studied in the literature. Note that NOMA-enhanced HetNets design poses additional challenges in terms of interference management since it brings additional co-channel interference to the existing networks. As such, whether NOMA is capable of enhancing the performance of HetNets still remains unknown and investigating novel resource allocation design for intelligently managing and coordinating various types of interference is more than desired, which motivates us to develop this treatise. We focus on studying the joint spectrum and power allocation problem for NOMA-enhanced HetNets with the aim of maximizing the sum rate of small cell users (SCUs). Particularly, we consider the downlink scenario, where one macro base station (MBS) communicates with multiple macro cell users (MCUs) via the conventional OMA protocol, and each small base station (SBS) communicates with two NOMA SCUs.</p><p>To tackle the formulated problem, we decouple the spectrum and power allocation problems and provide a joint solution where the spectrum and power allocation are executed iteratively. For the spectrum allocation, we allow multiple SBSs to reuse the same RB occupied by a MCU to improve the resource utilization. We recognize that the spectrum allocation can be regarded as a many-to-one matching process between the SBSs and RBs, where the SBSs and RBs act as two sets of players and interact with each other to maximize the sum rate of SCUs. In addition, the SBSs have peer effects with the interdependencies among each other due to the co-channel interference. Therefore, to solve this problem, we adopt the matching theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, which provides mathematically tractable and low-complexity solutions for the combinatorial problem of matching players in two distinct sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. We then formulate the spectrum allocation problem as a many-toone matching problem with peer effects and propose efficient algorithms to solve the problem. The primary contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows.</p><p>1) We propose a new NOMA-enhanced HetNets model, in which NOMA technique is invoked in small cells for spectrum efficiency enhancement and user access improvement. Based on the proposed model, we formulate a joint spectrum allocation and power control problem with the aim of maximizing SCUs' sum rate while considering users' fairness issues. 2) We model the spectrum allocation for SBSs as a many-toone matching problem with peer effects. For solving the formulated problem, we first propose a swap-operation enabled matching algorithms (SOEMA-1) to match SBSs with RBs aiming at maximizing SCUs' sum rate. For further improving the performance of SOEMA-1, we introduce the concept of 'exploration' into the matching game and propose a novel algorithm SOEMA-2, where irrational swap decisions are enabled with a small probability to explore the potential matching states. 3) To solve the non-convex power control problem of each SBS, we invoke the sequential convex programming to iteratively update the power allocation vector by solving the approximate convex problem. We prove that the proposed algorithm is convergent and the solution satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. 4) We demonstrate that NOMA-enhanced HetNets is capable of significantly outperforming the conventional OMA based HetNets in terms of both the SCUs' sum rate and users' connectivity. Additionally, we also present that the performance of the matching algorithm can be further improved via the 'exploration' action.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. System Description</head><p>Consider a downlink K-tier HetNets model, where the first tier represents a single macro cell <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , and the other tiers represent the small cells such as pico cells and femto cells. The MBS provides the basic coverage, and SBSs are deployed in the coverage area of the MBS to enhance capability. The set of SBSs is represented by SBS = {1, ..., B}. The MBS serves a set of M MCUs, i.e., MCU = {1, ..., M }. There are M RBs, and each MCU occupies a RB. For the sake of simplicity, we use the same index of the RBs as the MCUs, and thus the set of RBs is represented by RB = {1, ..., M }. The macro cell and small cells reuse the same set of RBs, and thus we refer to the small cells as the underlay tier. In this paper, we assume that each SBS b occupies no more than one RB and serves two SCUs simultaneously via the NOMA protocol. This assumption is attributed to limit the co-channel interference and to lower the hardware complexity and processing delay 2 . The illustration of cellular layout is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we allow multiple SBSs to reuse the same RB to improve the spectrum efficiency. The maximum number of SBSs occupying the same RB is restricted to q max , which is applied to restrict co-channel interference. Since the spectrum sharing brings in both co-tier and cross-tier interference, efficient resource allocation is required for the NOMA-enhanced HetNets system. In our work, we assume that the user association to the MBS and SBSs are completed prior to the resource allocation 3 . We also assume that the MBS and SBSs have the full knowledge of channel state information (CSI), although achieving perfect CSI is difficult in practical scenarios. As a consequence, our analytical results may overestimate the performance of the network. Our future work will relax this idealized simplifying assumption with the aid of the results derived in this treatise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Channel Model</head><p>The NOMA based transmission requires to apply the superposition coding (SC) technique at the SBSs and SIC 4 technique 2 NOMA requires SIC at the receivers. A user performing SIC needs to demodulate and decode the signals transmitted to other receivers. Therefore, the hardware complexity and processing delay increases with the number of users multiplexed on the same RB. 3 We assume that users served by MBS and SBSs have already been scheduled. The issues of user scheduling is set aside for our future work. 4 It is assumed that perfect SIC is achieved at the receivers. In practical scenarios, proceeding perfect SIC may be a non-trivial task. Therefore, our work actually provides an upper bound in terms of the attainable data rates. NOMA systems exploit the power domain for multiple access, where different users are served at different power levels. For illustration, assume SCU j desires to decode and remove interference from the superposition signal of SCU k via SIC. The interference cancellation is successful if the SCU j's received SINR for the SCU k's signal is larger or equal to the received SINR of SCU k for its own signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>In this section, we first define the α-utility function for SCUs' data rates to guarantee the fairness among the SCUs served by each SBS. Then we formulate the SCUs' sum rate maximization problem via proper spectrum and power allocation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. SCUs' Fairness Based on α-Utility Function</head><p>Based on the SINR expressions of SCU k and j in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">4</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">5</ref>), the data rates of SCU k and j served by SBS b over RB m can be calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">R m b,k = λ m,b log 2   1 + f m b,k 2 p b a m b,k I k,k N + I k co + I k cr + σ 2    ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">R m b,j = λ m,b log 2   1 + f m b,j 2 p b a m b,j I j co + I j cr + σ 2    ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>respectively. For the SCUs served by the same SBS, the optimal power allocation is to allocate the total transmit power to the SCU with the best channel condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. To guarantee the rate fairness among the SCUs served by the same SBS, we adopt the α-proportional fairness, where the α-utility function of SCU k served by SBS b is defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> U</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">α R m b,k = ln R m b,k , if α = 1 (1 -α) -1 R m b,k 1-α , if 0 ≤ α &lt; 1.<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Based on the defined α-utility function, the α-fairness based sum rate of SBS b is expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">U α (R m b (λ, a)) = U α R m b,k + U α R m b,j .<label>(10)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Optimization Problem Formulation</head><p>For facilitating the presentation, we denote λ ∈ R M ×B , a ∈ R B×2 as the collections of optimization variables λ m,b , and a b,k , respectively. The system objective is to maximize the sum α utility of the SCUs with interference constraints for the MCUs satisfied, which can be expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">max λ,a B b=1 M m=1 U α (R m b (λ, a)),<label>(11a)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">s.t. B b=1 λ m,b p b |t b,m | 2 ≤ I thr m ∀m,<label>(11b)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">∆(λ) ≥ 0, ∀m, b,<label>(11c)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">λ m,b ∈ {0, 1} , ∀m, b,<label>(11d)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">m λ m,b ≤ 1, ∀b,<label>(11e)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_24">b λ m,b ≤ q max , ∀m,<label>(11f)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_25">a b,k ≥ 0, a b,j ≥ 0, ∀b,<label>(11g)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_26">a b,k + a b,j ≤ 1, ∀b.<label>(11h)</label></formula><p>With the constraint in (11b), the aggregated interference caused to the MCU m by the underlay transmitters reusing the same RB is restricted by a predefined threshold, i.e., I thr m . Constraint (11c) guarantees successful SIC at SCU j. Constraints (11d) and (11e) are imposed to guarantee that each SBS occupies no more than one RB. Constraint (11f) limits the maximum number of SBSs, i.e., q max , reusing each RB <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">5</ref> . Constraint (11g) is the non-negative transmit power constraint for the SBSs. Constraint (11h) gives the upper bound of the transmit power of the SBSs.</p><p>The formulated problem is a mixed combinatorial nonconvex problem due to the binary constraint for RB allocation in (11d) as well as the non-convex objective function. In general, there is no systematic and computational efficient approach to solve this problem optimally. As can be observed, the optimization problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> is coupled by the two problems of spectrum allocation and power control. To reduce the computational complexity, we decouple these two subproblems as the following. For any fixed power allocation, the spectrum allocation for SBSs is formulated as a manyto-one matching game <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> where the RBs and SBSs interact with each other to find the optimal matching. For the given spectrum allocation result, the power allocation problem for the SCUs is solved by applying the sequential convex programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. We then propose a joint algorithm where the spectrum allocation and power control are performed iteratively to find the joint resource allocation result.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. MANY-TO-ONE MATCHING FOR SPECTRUM ALLOCATION</head><p>In this section, we first consider the spectrum allocation problem for SBSs given fixed power allocation. More particularly, for any given feasible power allocation, the original problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> can be decomposed into the RB allocation problem for all the SBSs, which can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">max λ B b=1 M m=1 U α (R m b (λ)),<label>(12a)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_28">s.t. (11b) -(11f ).<label>(12b)</label></formula><p>For obtaining the global optimal solution of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_27">12</ref>), we need to fully search all the possible combinations of scheduling RBs to SBSs. Thus, even for a centralized algorithm, it is not feasible in practical systems to solve it. However, since λ is a binary variable, we formulate the RB allocation as a many-to-one matching problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Many-to-One Matching Problem Formulation</head><p>To proceed with formulating the matching problem, we first introduce some important definitions.. Definition 1. In the many-to-one matching model, a matching Φ is a function from the set RB ∪ SBS into the set of all subsets of RB ∪ SBS such that 1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">|Φ(b)| = 1, ∀b ∈ SBS; 2) |Φ(m)| ≤ q max , ∀m ∈ RB; 3) Φ(b) = m if and only if b ∈ Φ(m).</formula><p>For the conditions in the definition, condition 1) implies that each SBS can only be matched with one RB; condition 2) gives the quota q max of the maximum number of SBSs that can be matched to each RB; and condition 3) implies that if SBS b is matched with RB m, then RB m is also matched with SBS b.</p><p>Remark 1. The utility of SBS b is defined as the sum rate of all the serving SCUs minus its cost for occupying RB m, where the sum rate gain corresponds to the objective function in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> and the cost term is to restrict the interference to primary MCUs.</p><p>According to Remark 1, the utility function of SBS b is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">U b = K k=1 U α R m b,k -βp b |g b,m | 2 ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where β ∈ R + is the fixed coefficient with unit interference of SBS b bringing to the m-th MCU.</p><p>The utility of RB m is defined as the sum rate of the occupying SCUs, and thus the utility function of RB m can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">U m = B b=1 λ m,b K k=1 U α R m b,k .<label>(14)</label></formula><p>To start the matching process, both SBSs and RBs need to set up the preference lists with respect to their own interests. The preference list is a descending order list formed by each side of the players according to their preference to the other side of the players. For each SBS b, it forms a descending order preference list BLIST b according to its utilities over all the RBs. For example, if SBS b can achieve higher data rate over RB m compared to RB m', i.e., U b (m) &gt; U b (m ), we have m b m , which indicates that b prefers m to m . Since each RB can be matched with up to q max SBSs, each RB m forms a preference list RBLIST m over all the possible sets of SBSs with the descending order of its utility. That is, U m (S) &gt; U m (S ) ⇒ S m S , which refers that RB m prefers the set of SBS S to S .</p><p>Remark 2. The matching game formulated above is a manyto-one matching with peer effects.</p><p>Proof. As observed in (4), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_30">13</ref>), the utility of each SBS is affected by the co-tier interference from the SBSs occupying the same RB. In other words, the utility of each SBS depends not only on the RB it matches with, but also on which other SBSs match to the same RB. Therefore, the formulated game model is a many-to-one matching with peer effects.</p><p>Due to the existence of peer effects in this matching model, the preference lists of players change with the matching game proceeds, which is different from conventional matching games where players have fixed preference lists <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. There is a growing literature studying many-to-one matchings with peer effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. However, these research contributions have demonstrated that designing matching mechanisms is significantly more challenging when peer effects are considered. Motivated by the housing assignment problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, we propose an extended matching algorithm for the many-toone matching problem with peer effects in the following.</p><p>Remark 3. The formulated matching game is lack of the property of substitutability.</p><p>Proof. See Appendix A.</p><p>Due to the lack of substitutability, the traditional Gale Shapley (GS) Algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> do not apply to the formulated matching game any more. To better handle the interdependencies between the players' preferences, the swap operations between any two SBSs to exchange their matched RBs is enabled. We first define the concept of swap matching as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">Φ b b = {Φ \ {(b, Φ(b)), (b , Φ(b ))}} ∪ {(b, Φ(b )), (b , Φ(b))} ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where SBSs b and b switch places while keeping other SBSs and RBs' matchings unchanged.</p><p>Based on the concept of swap operations, the swap-blocking pair is defined as follows: Note that the above definition implies that if two SBSs want to switch between two RBs, the RBs involved must approve the swap. Condition 1) implies that the utilities of all the involved players should not be reduced after the swap operation. Condition 2) indicates that at least one of the players' utilities is increased after the swap operation. a</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Proposed Spectrum Allocation Algorithm</head><p>In this subsection, we first propose an initialization algorithm (IA) based on the GS algorithm to obtain the initial matching state <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. After the initialization, we proceed with swap operations among SBSs to further improve the performance.</p><p>1) Initialization Algorithm: In the initialization algorithm, SBSs and RBs first initialize their own preference lists. The list of all the SBSs that are not matched with any RB is denoted by UN MAT CH. In the matching process, each SBS proposes to its most preferred RB, then each RB accepts the most preferred SBS and rejects the others. This process continues until the set UN MAT CH goes empty. The details of the initialization algorithm are as shown in Algorithm 1.</p><p>2) Swap Operations Enabled Matching Algorithm: After the initialization of the matching state based on the IA, swap operations among SBSs are enabled to further improve the performance of the resource allocation algorithm. The details of the proposed swap operations enabled matching algorithm (SOEMA-1) is shown in Algorithm 2. SOEMA-1 is composed of three steps. Step 1 initializes the matching state based on the algorithm IA. Step 2 focuses on the the swap operations between SBSs. Each SBS keeps searching for all the other SBSs to check whether there exists a swap-blocking pair <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">6</ref> . The swap-matching process continues until there exists no swapblocking pair, and then the algorithm goes to step 3, i.e., the end of the algorithm. Note that to prevent cyclic swapping between SBS b and b , we set the flag SR b,b to record the time that b and b swap their allocated RBs. Each SBS b can at most swap with another SBS b twice, which prevents flip flop and ensures convergence.</p><p>3) Irrational Swap Matching Decisions: We observe that the final matching of the proposed algorithm SOEMA-1 is significantly affected by the initial matching state. Since the SBSs can swap only between their current matchings, a better matching state that can achieve higher sum rate may not be formed for ∀m ∈ RB do 8:</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">if b∈SBS λ m,b ≤ q max then 9:</formula><p>RB m keeps all the proposed SBSs; RB m keeps the most preferred q max SBSs, and rejects the others;  Remove m from the preference lists of SBSs that have sent proposals; Keep the current matching state; 12: end if 13: Repeat Step 2 until there is no swap-blocking pair. 14: -Step 3: End of the algorithm directly based on the current matching state. For example, if the current matching state is {{m, b}, {m , b }, {m , b }} and the optimal matching<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">7</ref> is {{m, b }, {m , b }, {m , b}}, the optimal matching can not be reached if (b, b ) (or (b , b )) is not a swap-blocking pair under the current matching state. Motivated to solve this issue, we introduce the concept of 'exploration' <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> to explore the space of matching states. Exploration enables a player to destabilize a state involving a dominated allocation, at the cost of a temporary loss in utility. In this case, we propose a novel exploration enabled matching algorithm (SOEMA-2), as shown in Algorithm 3. In SOEMA-2, the initialization step is the same as that in SOEMA-1. During the swap-matching process, if a pair of SBS (b, b ) forms a swap-blocking pair, the swap operation between b and b happens with probability 1. Otherwise, the swap operation between b and b happens with the probability through exploration. Note that 0 &lt; 1 is a small number that corresponds to the probability that a player makes an irrational decision. rand in Algorithm 3 is a random number generator, and t max is the maximum number of iterations. For each SBS b, it searches for another SBS b to check whether it is a swap-blocking pair; Keep the current matching state; </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Property Analysis</head><p>Given the proposed SOEMA-1 above, we present some important remarks on the properties in terms of stability, convergence, complexity and optimality.</p><p>1) Stability: As stated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, there is no longer a guarantee that a traditional "pairwise-stability" exists when players care about more than their own matching. If a stable matching does exist, it can be computationally difficult to obtain. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> focused on the two-sided exchange-stable matchings, which is defined as follows: Definition 3. A matching Φ is two-sided exchange-stable if there does not exist a swap-blocking pair.</p><p>The two-sided exchange stability is a distinct notion of stability compared to the traditional notion of stability of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, but one that is relevant to our situation where agents can compare notes with each other. Lemma 1. The final matching Φ * of SOEMA-1 is a two-sided exchange-stable matching.</p><p>Proof. See Appendix B.</p><p>2) Convergence: We prove the convergence of SOEMA-1 while the convergence of SOEMA-2 is usually not considered as it is constrained by the maximum number of iterations t max .</p><p>Theorem 1. SOEMA-1 converges to a two-sided exchange stable matching Φ * within limited number of iterations.</p><p>Proof. See Appendix C.</p><p>3) Complexity: The complexity of SOEMA-1 is composed of two main parts, i.e., the IA and the swap-matching phases. For the IA, the complexity of setting up the preference lists of SBSs and RBs is O(BM 2 ). For the swap-matching phase, the number of iterations cannot be given in a closed form. This is because it is uncertain that at which step the algorithm converges to a two-sided exchange stable matching. This is a common problem in most heuristic algorithms. We will analyze the number of total iterations for different numbers of SBSs and RBs in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, and more detailed analysis can be found in Section VI. Here, we give an upper bound of the complexity as follows:</p><p>Theorem 2. The complexity of SOEMA-1 is upper bounded by O(B 2 ).</p><p>Proof. Since we restrict that each SBS b can at most swap its allocated RB with another SBS b twice, the number of potential swap operations is upper bounded by 2 × B 2 . Therefore, the complexity of SOEMA-1 is upper bounded by O(B 2 ).</p><p>The complexity of SOEMA-2 is restricted by the maximum number of iterations t max . For traditional exhaustive search, the complexity increases exponentially with B and M , which is much higher than SOEMA-1 and SOEMA-2.</p><p>4) Optimality: We show below whether SOEMA-1 and SOEMA-2 can achieve the optimal solution. To give insights on the relationship between optimal and stable solutions, we first have the following proposition. Proposition 1. All local maxima of SCUs' sum α fairnessbased sum rate corresponds to a two-sided exchange stable matching.</p><p>Proof. Assume that the SCUs' sum α fairness-based data rate of matching Φ is a local maximum value. If Φ is not a stable matching, it indicates that there exists a swap-blocking pair that can further improve the sum α fairness-based data rate of SCUs. However, this is inconsistent with the assumption that Φ is local optimal, and hence we conclude that Φ is two-sided exchange stable.</p><p>However, not all two-sided exchange stable matchings obtained from SOEMA-1 are local maxima of SCUs' total α fairness-based data rate. The reason can be given in a simple example: SBS b does not approve a swap matching with b along with their current matched RBs m and m', due to the fact that its utility is not improved after the swap operation. However, m and m can benefit a lot via this swap operation, which further improves the sum of SCUs' α fairness-based data rates. Similarly, although SOEMA-2 allows to explore the space of matching states, it still can not guarantee the optimality of the final matching. Of course, we can force the swap operation to happen, but this will obtain a weaker stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, as stated in the following remark: Remark 4. In SOEMA-1 and SOEMA-2, a forced swap operation may improve SCUs' total sum rate compared to the approved swap operation, which results in one-sided exchange stability.</p></div>

Therefore, from <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>, we know that the value of U α (R m b ) increases after each iteration in SCPAA. Since the value of U α (R m b ) is upper bounded due to limited spectrum resources, there exists an iteration after which the sum rate stops increasing. SCPAA then converges to a final state and outputs the final power allocation result a * b .</p><p>Theorem 4.

Since * b is the optimal solution of the concave problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, a * b must satisfy the KKT conditions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. Actually, the problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_34">16</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_41">21</ref>) share the same constraints but have different objective functions with U α (R m b (a b )) and (U α ( Rm b,k ) + U α ( Rm b,j ), respectively.

Therefore, a * b also satisfies the KKT conditions of the problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</p><p>With the proposed subchannel allocation algorithms, i.e., IA, SOEMA-1, and SOEMA-2, and the power allocation algorithm, i.e., SCPAA, we then propose a joint spectrum allocation and power control algorithm (JSAPCA) to solve the SCUs' sum rate maximization problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, as shown Algorithm In the first step of initialization, each SBS randomly allocates power to SCUs satisfying the constraints in (11g) and (11h).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. NUMERICAL RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we investigate the performance of the proposed resource allocation algorithm through simulations. The adopted simulation parameters are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">II</ref>. For convenience, we refer to the JSAPCA with IA as JSAPCA-1, the JSAPCA with SOEMA-1 as JSAPCA-2, and the JSAPCA with SOEMA-2 as JSAPCA-3. The optimal performance which is obtained by the exhaustive search for both spectrum allocation and power control is given as the baseline. We compare JSAPCA-1, JSAPCA-2, and JSAPCA-3 in the NOMA-HetNets system to show differences among their performances. In addition, we also consider the performance of the traditional OMA-HetNets system where each SBS communicates with at most one SCU in a transmission interval. In order to have a fair comparison, the resource allocation result for the OMA-based HetNets is also obtained by utilizing JSAPCA-1, JSAPCA-2 and JSAPCA-3, respectively. The settings of the proposed algorithms and benchmarks are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">III</ref>.  Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> illustrates the convergence of the proposed algorithms, i.e., IA, SOEMA-1 and SOEMA-2, with different numbers of RBs M and SBSs B. It can be seen that IA and SOEMA both converge within a small number of iterations for different values of M and B. Besides, both IA and SOEMA need more iterations to converge with a larger number of RBs and SBSs. For example, when B = 7, M = 5, SOEMA and IA converge in less than 6 iterations on average. When B = 10, M = 5, SOEMA and IA converge to a stationary point at around 12 iterations. This is due to the fact that additional players participating in the matching game results in additional searching dimensions in the possible matching solutions. It is  also shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> that the proposed algorithm performs very close to the exhaustive searching based spectrum allocation.</p><p>In particular, for the case of B = 10, M = 5, SOEMA-2 gets around 93% of the sum rate of SCUs achieved by the exhaustive search. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">3</ref> depicts the SCUs' sum rate with number of iterations in JSAPCA-2, under the case of M = 5. In particular, JSAPCA-2 needs more iterations to converge when the number of SBSs B gets larger. For example, when B = 8, the number of iterations for convergence is 2 on average. In the case of B = 11, JSAPCA-2 converges to a stationary point after 4 iterations on average. This is due to the fact that more SBSs need to be coordinated, which causes the higher dependency between spectrum allocation and power control. We can also observe that, in the case of B = 11, JSAPCA-2 gets roughly 91.3% of the SCUs' sum rate achieve by the optimal solution. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">4</ref> plots the sum rate of SCUs versus different numbers of SBSs in the network, for M = 7 and q max = 2. As can be observed, the sum rate increases monotonically with the number of SBSs due to the exploitation of multi-user diversity gain. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">4</ref> also shows that JSAPCA-2 achieves a higher sum rate compared to JSAPCA-1 due to the involvement of the swap operations between the potential swap-blocking pairs. Besides, JSAPCA-3 further improves the performance of JSAPCA-2 because of the 'exploration' action to explore the space of matching states. Compared to the traditional OMA system, the NOMA-enhanced HetNets can achieve higher sum rate since it exploits not only the frequency domain but also the power domain for multiple access. In particularly, at the point of B = 18, M = 7, JSAPCA-2 achieves roughly a 10%, 49% and 55% higher sum rate than JSAPCA-1, JSAPCA-2 (OMA), and JSAPCA-1 (OMA), respectively.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">5</ref>, we investigate the number of scheduled SBSs versus the number of SBSs with M = 10 in the NOMA system in HetNets. Here, the number of scheduled SBSs is defined as the average number of simultaneously scheduled SBSs in a transmission interval. We observe that the number of scheduled SBSs increase monotonically with the total number of SBSs. However, the increasing trend becomes slower as the total   number of SBSs becomes larger. This is due to the fact that the SBSs causing server co-channel interference to others may not be allocated any RB for the maximization of SCUs' sum rate as well as the satisfaction of interference constraints of MCUs. Besides, the proposed algorithm is capable of accommodating more SBSs when the maximum number of allowed SBSs on each RB gets larger, since more SBSs have the opportunity to get access to the RBs. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> demonstrates the sum rate of SCUs versus different maximum numbers of SBSs allowed on each RB with the RBs' number of M = 5. One can observe that the with a fixed value of SBSs' number B, the sum rate of SCUs grows to a fixed value as the quota q max increases since all the SBSs have been matched after q max reaches B/M . In particular, for the case of B = 20, the SCUs' sum rate reaches a stable value when q max &gt; 4. For the case of B = 40, the sum rate keeps increasing because B/M &gt; 7. However, the growth rate gets smaller with larger value of q max due to the enhanced interference on each RB. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">7</ref> shows the resource allocation fairness versus the total number of SBSs in the network, for a fixed RB's number M = 10. To evaluate the fairness of the proposed algorithm, we adopt the Jain's fairness index <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> which can be calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">( B b=1 (R m b,k +R m b,j )) 2 2×B B b=1 (R m b,k 2 +R m b,j<label>2</label></formula><p>) . The value of Jain's fairness index is between the range of 0 and 1. The fairest resource allocation is obtained when the value equals to 1, which indicates that all users enjoy the same data rate. One can observe that the fairness index of the proposed algorithm decreases with the number of SBSs in the network. This is due to the fact that higher number of SBSs contributes to more severe competition on limited spectrum resources, and hence more SBSs with poor channel conditions may not be accessed to the network. This phenomenon is consistent with Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">5</ref> showing that the number of scheduled SBSs increases non-linearly with the total number of SBSs in the network. Besides, it is also worth noting that the proposed algorithm can achieve a higher fairness index when the maximum number of SBSs allowed on each RB, i.e., q max , gets larger. Actually, as q max increases, the proposed algorithm is capable of multiplexing more SBSs on each RB, which increases the utilization of multiuser diversity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, the spectrum allocation and power control problems in NOMA-enhanced HetNets were jointly studied, with the aim of maximizing the sum rate of SCUs while considering the fairness issues. By formulating the spectrum allocation problem as a many-to-one matching game with peer effects, a low-complexity algorithm based on the swap operations was proposed to enable SBSs and RBs to effectively interact with each other. In addition, the 'exploration' action was utilized to further improve the performance by exploring the space of matching states. It was proved mathematically that the matching algorithm converged to a two-sided stable state within limited number of iterations. For solving the power allocation problem, the sequential convex programming was adopted to approximate the non-convex problem to a convex one and update the power allocation result iteratively. How well the application of NOMA could improve the performance of HetNets was investigated, where it was shown via numerical  However, in the formulated game model, due to the existence of co-tier interference, the achievable rate of RB m with SBS b may change after b is unmatched with m, and therefore, b may not be in the preferred set any more, which is concluded that the formulated game model does not have the property of substitutability.</p></div>

The received signal at SCU k served by the b-th SBS, i.e., b ∈ {1, ..., B}, on the m-th RB is , x m are the symbols transmitted from the b-th SBS to its serving SCU k, i.e, SCU b,k , and from the MBS to the MCU m, respectively. f m b,k , h m,b,k , and g m b * ,b,k are the channel coefficients between SBS b and SCU b,k , that between the MBS and SCU b,k , and that between SBS b * and SCU b,k on RB m, respectively. p b and p m are the total transmit power of the SBS b and the transmit power from the MBS to the MCU m. respectively. λ = {λ m,b } represents the RB allocation indicator for SBSs, i.e., if SBS b occupies RB m, λ m,b = 1; otherwise, λ m,b = 0. λ b * ,b represents the presence of co-tier interference, i.e., if the SBS b and b * reuse the same RB, λ b * ,b = 1; otherwise, ζ m b,k is the additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) at SCU b,k with variance σ 2 .</figDesc></figure>

Note that the number of iterations of SOEMA-1 is limited since the number of players is limited and the system sum rate has an upper bound due to the limited spectrum resources. Therefore, there exists a swap operation after which no swapblocking pair can further improve the sum rate of SCUs. SOEMA-1 then converges to the final matching Φ * which is stable as proved in Lemma 1.</p></div>

Furthermore, as the α-fair utility function is strictly increasing and concave for any given α, their composition, U α Rm b,k is also a concave function of x b <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Since the objective function in (21a) is a summation of the concave terms of x b , it is straightforward to conclude that (21a) is also a concave function of x b .
