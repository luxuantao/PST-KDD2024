<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we introduce and study the use of dynamic slot allocation (DSA) in packet-switched space-division-multiple-access (SDMA) systems. In conventional SDMA, a smart antenna is used at the basestation to simultaneously communicate with multiple stations on the same frequency channel. When dynamic slot allocation is added, the basestation uses uplink channel measurements to intelligently construct future SDMA/TDMA frames. It is shown that under a simple minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint, the problem of performing optimal dynamic slot allocation is NP-complete.

INTRODUCTION</head><p>A SMART antenna is an adaptive array that dynamically modifies its radiation pattern in order to improve system performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Using adaptive beamforming, smart antennas can provide array gain, resilience to fading, and nulling of interfering signals. In the initial stages of system deployment, wireless coverage areas can be increased leading to a reduction in infrastructure costs. As loading increases, reduced co-channel interference permits an aggressive frequency re-use plan, which translates directly into improved capacity performance compared with conventional systems.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Researchers have recently considered the use of smart antennas in packet-switched systems. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, smart antennas were used to improve the uplink performance of a slotted ALOHA packet radio network. During packet reception, the basestation uses the smart antenna to enhance gain in the direction of a desired packet and attempts to minimize interference from other transmissions. As a result, the capacity of the system can be increased compared with conventional ALOHA due to a reduction in the effect of collisions.</p><p>The functionality described above can be improved upon in systems where the basestation uses time-division-duplexing (TDD). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> In TDD, the basestation can first measure the characteristics of the channel between itself and a station, then use this information as a basis for future communications using the smart antenna. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, a protocol was proposed which uses this technique to improve system performance in a harsh fading environment.</p><p>A multiple-beam adaptive antenna was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, in which several beam-modules each attempt to capture a different uplink packet transmission using the same process proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The capability of resolving multiple packets at the same time and frequency is referred to as space-division-multiple-access (SDMA). SDMA has the potential for providing large improvements in system capacity compared with single-beam systems and has been investigated by several authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, a media access control protocol was proposed based on a slot reservation mechanism combined with SDMA. The work reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> studies the capacity performance of Reservation-ALOHA protocols which support SDMA. The tradeoffs involved in operating the reservation channel in multibeam versus single-beam modes were assessed. The system described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> uses smart antennas in a packet radio network with slotted nonpersistent CSMA as the media access control protocol. Multibeam protocols are also described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, which use carrier-sensing as a mechanism for synchronizing smart antenna adaptation. In addition, signaling mechanisms are proposed for reducing the detrimental effects of hidden stations. It should be noted that an important practical concern in random access SDMA protocols is the complexity and latency of the dynamic packet acquisition process. Finally, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, smart antennas were proposed for use in indoor local area networks based on protocols derived from the IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN standard.</p><p>In this paper we introduce dynamic slot allocation (DSA) for packet-switched SDMA. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, we assume that the system is TDD and narrowband, and that the basestation can measure the spatial channel characteristics for a station when it is transmitting in the uplink direction. In dynamic slot allocation, the basestation then uses these spatial channel measurements to intelligently construct subsequent SDMA/TDMA frames.</p><p>The paper shows that when stations are assigned to SDMA/TDMA slots subject to a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint, maximizing the capacity of a frame is an NP-complete problem. Heuristic slot allocation algorithms are introduced which can increase SDMA/TDMA frame capacity compared with a random allocation of stations. The paper uses both theoretical results and measured data from an experimental testbed to characterize the performance of dynamic slot allocation. The experimental system operates at a carrier frequency of 1.86 GHz and uses an eight-element circular antenna array. Using the experimental data it is shown that DSA can significantly improve system capacity compared with no DSA in the indoor situations that were tested.</p><p>As noted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, dynamic slot allocation requires that the channel be essentially constant from the time that measurements are made until the SDMA/TDMA frame is transmitted. The time period over which the communication channel does not change significantly is referred to as channel coherence time <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. We also present testbed measurement data which show the effects of channel time coherence in the presence of pedestrian movement. Cases are included where different numbers of people are in motion in the vicinity of a transmitter, the receiver array, and in between. Using this data we assess the performance of the system when desired station measurements are not tracked precisely due to temporal variations in the channel. This and other results we have taken suggest that dynamic slot allocation is possible at the frequency considered, provided turnaround times are in the low-to-mid tens of milliseconds.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II briefly discusses smart antenna basestations and optimal SINR beamforming. Following this, in Section III we provide an overview of our experimental smart antenna testbed. In Section IV both theoretical and measured results are presented for static indoor SDMA/TDMA channel capacity. Slot allocation algorithms are proposed and characterized. The capacity results are given in Section IV-C. Section V presents measurements which were taken relating to channel coherence time in the presence of pedestrian mobility. Finally, in Section VI some concluding remarks are given.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SMART ANTENNA BASESTATION</head><p>In the system considered, the basestation utilizes a smart antenna array with elements, and communicates with a set of portable stations. The stations are much simpler in design and use single omnidirectional antennas. We will assume that the system considered uses time division duplexing (TDD). As discussed above, the basestation may be able to determine the correct beamforming for both transmission and reception after first measuring the vector channel response between a set of active stations and the array.</p><p>Under multiple beamforming SDMA operation, the basestation can attempt to transmit or receive up to packets si- multaneously by forming antenna beam patterns. This is accomplished by having parallel beamforming modules operating independently at the basestation. The basestation maintains a different set of weights in each beamforming module and each attempts to optimize that beam performance for one desired packet transmission. In the following discussion, we focus on the activities of a single beamforming module, and consider the system in the reverse-link (uplink) direction. A similar analysis can be done for the forward-link direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The system considered is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In the figure we show the details of a single beamforming module and the set of complex beamforming weights, , one for each antenna element.</p><p>In the following development we assume a narrowband indoor channel environment. This assumption corresponds to bit rates in the low megabits-per-second and less in typical indoor situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. When indoors, multipath fading effects may be very strong, but because the channel is narrowband, delay spread is small compared to symbol durations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. For this reason, intersymbol interference effects are small even though multipath fading may be heavy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>We also assume a time-invariant situation where the channel conditions are essentially constant from the time the channel is sampled until transmissions occur. In Section V testbed measurements are presented which support the validity of this assumption.</p><p>Under these conditions we can define the beamforming required to maximize the post-beamforming SINR for each desired signal. This material summarized below may be found in a number of sources. In particular the reader is referred to the books by Compton <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, Litva <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and Okamoto <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>The received basestation signal vector at time sample is defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> Here, each component of the signal vector is a complex number which gives the relative magnitude and phase of the received signal on antenna element at time .</p><p>We will now assume that there are stations transmitting simultaneously. For the beamforming module of interest, the received signal can be written as the superposition of the desired signal vector, , interfering signal vectors, for , and an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) vector, . In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> the first desired signal is shown as , corresponding to beamforming module 1. This can be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> The interfering and noise signals collectively form the undesired signal , so can also be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(3)</formula><p>If the signal transmitted by station is , and the channel is not varying with time, then the received signal can be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> where and are referred to as the station signature (or station code) vectors of desired station and the th interfering signal, respectively. Note that in general, the station signatures result from a superposition of multipath components. It should be noted that this formulation is general and includes many common propagation models as special cases. An example is independent Rayleigh fading, where the envelope of each channel vector component is drawn independently from a Rayleigh distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This case is considered in Section IV-C and is used to model a heavy indoor multipath environment. In Section IV-C we also give results for Rician fading, which is used to model situations which have a line-of-sight propagation component combined with local multipath components <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This type of propagation channel is also common in indoor situations.</p><p>We will assume that each transmitted signal has unit power and is uncorrelated with the other transmitted signals. The undesired signal covariance matrix is defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> where is the identity matrix, and is the mean noise power per element.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, it is shown that the mean SINR, after beamforming, is given by SINR <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> For the desired signal and this set of interferers, the SINR can be used to compute the average bit error rate associated with the beamforming given by the weight vector . As noted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, this is a function of the modulation scheme used.</p><p>The value of which maximizes ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) is <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> In the ensuing sections we use the optimal SINR beamforming defined above to evaluate the performance of the smart antenna basestation under a variety of different conditions. We will assume that for reliable operation, a desired packet transmission must be received with an SINR greater than a threshold denoted by SINR .</p><p>The spatial channel assumptions we consider range from classical Rayleigh and Rician models <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, to the use of indoor propagation data we collected using our experimental antenna. The conclusions drawn are valid for flat fading environments in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise. Indoors, this corresponds to systems operating at bit rates up into the low megabits-per-second <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Finally it should be noted that it may be possible to improve the performance of the system further via multiuser detection, that is, by performing joint beamforming across multiple beamforming modules. In this paper we will take a more conservative approach, and assume that such advanced processing is not used, and that packets are received using conventional beamforming. SNR is defined to be the mean signal power to mean noise power ratio at each antenna output before beamforming.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. SMART ANTENNA TESTBED</head><p>At the Communications Research Laboratory (CRL) we have constructed several smart antenna testbeds. The antenna used for the results in this paper is a circular array operating at 1.86 GHz. The array consists of eight vertical dipole antennas on a diameter of either 0.51 or 0.2 m. Note that the carrier wavelength at 1.86 GHz is approximately 16 cm. These two selections of spacing correspond to a diameter that is significantly above, and only slightly above, a single wavelength. In the smart antenna, eight coherent receivers feed a computer controlled data acquisition system. The antenna outputs for each element are downconverted and coherently demodulated. These outputs are then input to a data acquisition system. For the measurements used in this paper, the system was configured with an effective bandwidth such that the channel environment is narrowband.</p><p>A single CW transmitting source also using a vertical dipole antenna was used as the portable station transmitter. The array and transmit antennas were located 1.5 m above the floor. The array was used to measure station spatial signatures in various locations on the ground floor of the CRL building. It should be noted that this single source was used to obtain various channel soundings which are used later in this paper to assess the performance of multiple interfering transmitters. A floor plan of the pertinent area is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. In the ensuing discussion we will refer to this figure. For those interested, further details of the experimental setup are included in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. MULTIBEAM SDMA/TDMA CAPACITY AND SLOT ALLOCATION</head><p>In smart antenna basestations using TDD, the station signatures can be obtained by polling the active stations before actual user data is transmitted <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Once a set of station signatures is known, the basestation then generates a SDMA/TDMA frame so that transmission can proceed. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, we will assume that all of these activities occur well within the coherence time of the channel.</p><p>In this paper we focus on the efficiency of the SDMA/TDMA frame generation process. It is assumed that the number of active stations is given and denoted by the variable . There are many ways in which this set of stations arises. An example is where a number of stations are explicitly polled by the basestation prior to the slot allocation phase. Another example is where the station identities are updated on a continual basis, as in the case where talkspurt detection is used to transmit packetized voice.</p><p>Given a set of stations, a slot allocation algorithm generates a SDMA/TDMA frame consisting of time slots. We assume that each station is allocated a single slot in the generated frame, into which a fixed-length packet can be transmitted. The time slots and stations are indexed by the sets of integers and , respectively. Here, is a random variable which is dependent upon the particular stations chosen, and the slot allocation algorithm used. In this process, CS( ) is defined to be the set of stations that have been allocated to slot . If CS , for example, then Stations 1, 3, and 4 have been assigned to time slot 2. The output of the slot allocation process consists of the integer , and CS( ) for . The objective of the slot allocation process is to perform this allocation such that the length of the frame, , is minimized. This assignment is done under the constraint that the post-beamforming SINR from (6) [using the optimal beamforming weights from ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>)] exceeds the SINR threshold for each assigned packet. That is, if the SINR for packet is given by ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>), we must have that SINR SINR (8)</p><p>In our experiments we obtain the expected frame length for a given , by repeating the allocation many times under the same slot allocation algorithm. It can easily be seen that minimizing the expected frame length is the same as maximizing the frame capacity , defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> Note that the maximum number of stations per slot is bounded by the number of available beamforming modules, . is set to in this paper, which would normally be the maximum number of simultaneous transmissions possible. In this paper we are only interested in the frame capacity, so we will refer to simply as capacity from here on. In the definition of , we normalize this capacity to the data transmitted per slot period. For this reason, the transmission rate, and overhead such as guard bands, are included in the normalization.</p><p>We will assume that each packet transmission occupies a single TDMA time slot and that the objective is to schedule a single packet from each of the stations in the generated frame. Many variations of this problem are clearly possible where differing numbers of requests may be handled at once. In our case we normalize the units, so that a capacity of unity corresponds to an average of one successful transmission per slot. Varying the slot size does not therefore affect the results.</p><p>When operating indoors, multipath may be very strong and the station signatures may appear to have random components, which makes the allocation process difficult. In the following section, we show that the general problem of finding the optimal capacity subject to the above constraint is NP-complete. For this reason, in Section IV-B we propose several heuristic algorithms for performing dynamic slot allocation. The algorithms are motivated by those used in basic bin packing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Complexity of Dynamic Slot Allocation</head><p>In this section we show that the problem of optimal SINR slot allocation as defined in the previous section is NP-complete. The proof is accomplished by performing a reduction to the well-known "graph coloring" problem, i.e., that of finding the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph, such that no two vertices of the same color share an edge <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The proof gives a construction which shows that the optimal slot allocation solution can be used to solve this problem for any instance of the graph coloring problem.</p><p>We assume that the graph to be colored has vertices, , for and each vertex is associated with a portable station in the SDMA network. Here, the spatial signature of station is assigned a real-valued vector, denoted by . Station signature vectors are generated based on the edges in . The construction used is such that when two vertices and do not share an edge in , then their assigned spatial signatures are orthogonal, that is, . Here, the operator takes the dot product of its arguments. When the vertices share an edge, this product is nonzero.</p><p>The spatial signature vectors are generated from as follows. The signature vector for station contains three sections, namely, the Self or -section, the Coupling or -section, and the Normalization or -section. The -section is bits long and contains a single "1" in position . All other values are "0." The -section introduces nonorthogonality amongst the signature vectors as follows. This section consists of bits, where each bit corresponds to a unique selection of distinct pairs of vertices, and , for . If these two vertices share an edge in , then the corresponding bit in the vector is "1," otherwise it is set to "0." The -section is used to ensure that the norm of all the spatial signature vectors is the same. This is done by first finding the spatial signature with the maximum number of nonzero entries in the and sections. This corresponds to the graph vertex (or vertices) with the highest edge degree. The norms are equalized by adding enough "1" bits to each spatial signature vector so that all stations have the same number of nonzero entries. The -section thus consists of separate subsections, one for each vertex. The only nonzero subsection for signature is subsection which contains the number of "1" entries needed for the normalization.</p><p>As an example, consider a graph with vertices where edges exist only between and . The spatial signature constructions for this graph are as follows.</p><p>In this diagram, the sections introduced above are shown. When forming the "signature matrix" as shown, the -section is always a unit matrix. In this example the columns of the -section correspond to the unique pairwise selections of vertices, , and . The -section adds a single "1" to both and so that . It can be seen that this construction leaves and orthogonal, whereas is not orthogonal to the other two.</p><p>Using the above construction we can generate the appropriate spatial signatures for any graph coloring problem in polynomial time. We now consider the output SINR when optimal SINR beamforming is used for a given desired signal. Consider a set of stations that are assigned to the same SDMA/TDMA time slot. Without any loss in generality, we will consider a particular antenna beam and identify the desired station signature vector as . The optimal SINR, after beamforming, can be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> where we have assumed that there are interfering stations assigned to the slot in addition to the desired station. We have also assumed that the interfering stations are numbered from 1 to . In this expression, is the Gaussian noise power at the input to the beamforming module.</p><p>In general, the interferers will consist of orthogonal interferers and nonorthogonal interferers as discussed above, where . We will denote the set of nonorthogonal interfering station indices as . It can be seen from the form of the SINR that we can choose the appropriate terms in such that for all orthogonal interferers. This can be done without affecting the other terms in the SINR. As a result, we can write that (11) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> The second inequality follows from setting . When there is only a single nonorthogonal interferer, we denote its signature vector by as shown. It is clear that the SINR is a nonincreasing function of . We now define an orthogonal transformation , where . In this case <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> In view of the above construction we can choose the transformation such that . . . <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> In this case, since and are not orthogonal, the transformation will result in two nonzero entries in , i.e.</p><p>. . .</p><p>Without any loss in generality we have assumed that these occur in the first two positions and given by and as shown. We now have that <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> This expression is clearly maximized by choosing , which gives <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> This result shows that the optimal SINR obtained with one or more nonorthogonal interferers in a slot (i.e.,</p><p>) is strictly less than the optimum SINR which can be obtained with zero nonorthogonal interferers (i.e.,</p><p>). Accordingly, if we choose the required SINR for each station to satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> then only those stations which have orthogonal spatial signatures will be permitted to be assigned to the same slot. Thus by making this selection, an optimal slot allocation algorithm can only allocate stations with orthogonal spatial signatures to the same time slot. Stations which have nonorthogonal signatures must be assigned to separate time slots.</p><p>Finally, assume that a polynomial-time algorithm exists for finding the minimum length SDMA/TDMA frame. By the above construction, only sets of stations which are mutually orthogonal can be assigned to the same time slot. But a set of mutually orthogonal stations corresponds to a set of vertices in which are not connected by edges and thus they can be colored using the same color. Hence the minimal-length SDMA/TDMA frame defines a valid coloring of where each time slot defines a different color. Now assume that a coloring of is possible with a smaller number of colors than that given by the optimum slot allocation solution. that case we use that coloring of to place stations into an SDMA/TDMA frame with fewer time slots than the optimum solution, and by definition, only stations with orthogonal spatial codes would be assigned to the same slot. This contradicts the assumption that the original SDMA/TDMA slot allocation was minimal length. This shows the NP-completeness of the optimal slot allocation problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. SDMA/TDMA Slot Allocation Algorithms</head><p>In this section several dynamic slot allocation algorithms are proposed. The algorithms are described as follows in increasing order of complexity. In the algorithm descriptions, it is assumed that any station can always be accomodated with the required SINR when assigned to a slot by itself. This is not necessarily the case in practice, but in the results presented, this outage probability is negligible.</p><p>In the descriptions, the following definitions and variables are used to define the algorithms. Stations are numbered from the set . Each station is referred to by this ID. CS( ) is defined to be the set of stations currently allocated to slot . At the start of each algorithm this set is initialized to be empty for all . UA is defined to be the current set of unallocated stations. This set is initialized to contain all stations at the start of each algorithm. CsID is defined to be the current slot ID, and is used as a variable to hold the current station under consideration. Pseudocode descriptions for the algorithm are given after each algorithm is discussed.</p><p>Random SDMA/TDMA: The Random algorithm is very simple and works as follows. The reader is referred to the pseudocode description listed below.</p><p>The slot ID (CsID) is first initialized to 1. The algorithm then executes block 3-12 once for each station. The algorithm either adds the station under consideration to the current slot, or to the next slot by itself. First, the station is added to the current slot (line 4). The stations in the current slot are then tested to check that the SINR for each is above the desired threshold (line 5), i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. If not (block 6-10), the added station is removed from the current slot, the slot index is incremented (line 8), and the station in question is added to the next slot (line 9). If the SINR is sufficient for all stations in slot CsID (line 5), then the station in question is left in the current slot, and the algorithm continues with the next station in UA. In either case the station is allocated and thus removed from UA (line 11).</p><p>The problem with this method is that if two consecutive stations are incompatible, the algorithm will advance to the next slot even if an unallocated compatible station exists. However, the complexity of this algorithm is very low. Equal Norm SDMA/TDMA: Compared with the Random algorithm, in Equal Norm more sophisticated tests are used to assign a station to a slot. We first form the Compatibility Matrix, , using the station spatial codes as shown in line 1 below. The algorithm then initializes the slot ID (CsID) to 1 and begins with Station 1. This station is added to slot 1 (line 4). Block 6-24 then executes until all stations have been assigned. Stations are added to the current slot as follows. For each station in UA the algorithm finds the station in CS(CsID) to which it has minimum compatibility. This is done in line 9. The compatibility value is recorded in line 10. COMP( ) is a variable used to record the compatibility value for station . Line 12 then selects the station in UA with the largest of these compatibility values. This is the candidate station in the current slot. In line 14 this station is added to the slot. All of the station SINRs are then tested in line 15. If all SINRs are above the desired threshold, then this station is left assigned to the current slot. Otherwise the station is removed from that slot (line 17) and returned to UA (line 18). The slot index is then incremented (line 19) and a station is randomly selected from UA and assigned to the new slot (lines 20-22).</p><p>It can be seen that the th entry in is proportional to the ratio of the received powers of signals and . The physical interpretation of this algorithm is that it attempts to place stations with similar power levels in the same time slot. This is done to provide less opportunity for stronger interferers to corrupt weaker transmissions. First Fit SDMA/TDMA: The First Fit algorithm is similar to Random. In First Fit however, instead of advancing to the next slot whenever a station assignment is infeasible, all stations in UA are tried first. Block 3-17, shown below, is executed until all stations have been allocated. For a given time slot (i.e., CsID), block 5-15 checks every remaining station in UA to see if it can be added to the slot in question. In line 6 the station is temporarily added to the slot and tested for feasibility in line 7. If the assignment is feasible the station remains assigned to slot CsID and is removed from UA by line 13. Otherwise line 9 removes the station from this slot. In either case the loop continues by testing the next station in UA. Once all stations have been tested, CsID is incremented and the procedure repeats for the next time slot. Best Fit SDMA/TDMA: The Best Fit algorithm is the most sophisticated of the algorithms. We start by beginning with slot 1 (line 1). The algorithm selects stations for consideration in ascending order of received power at the basestation. This is shown in line 2 where we start with the station in UA with the lowest receive power. In lines 1-4 this station is assigned to slot 1. The 6-34 block then executes until all stations have been allocated. In each iteration of the block, the station in UA is found whose addition to the current slot would result in the largest minimum SINR for those stations in the slot in question. This station is found in the 9-21 block as follows. In line 10, a test station is temporarily added to the current slot, CsID. If all stations in CS(CsID) satisfy the minimum SINR constraint (line 11), then the SINRx variable records the minimum SINR of all stations allocated to slot CsID. In line 14 the algorithm then tests to see if this minimum SINR is the largest found so far. If so, then the SINR is recorded in the variable SINRmaxmin (line 16) and the new station is recorded in variable MaxminStn (line 17). The test in line 22 is used to determine if a feasible station has been found to add to the current slot, CsID. If so, the recorded station is added (lines 24-25). Otherwise there is no station that can be added to the current slot. In this case the slot ID is incremented (line 29) and the station with the lowest receive power is drawn from UA and added to the new slot. The above procedure is then repeated.  Note that sorting the station signatures in order of ascending power is beneficial since it helps prevent those with higher power from overpowering the others. Also, since lower power signals are competing with a relatively large amount of noise, it is best to allocate them at the start of the frame when there are more unallocated stations to test. Both Random and First Fit algorithms using power pre-sorting are also defined. In the following descriptions the differences between their unsorted versions are noted.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">1</formula><p>Random Sorted SDMA/TDMA: At the start of the algorithm, the stations in UA are sorted in order of ascending received power. The remaining algorithm is identical to Random SDMA/TDMA discussed above. In line of that description, stations drawn from UA in sorted order.</p><p>First Fit Sorted SDMA/TDMA: As in the Random Sorted case, the stations in UA are first sorted in order of ascending received power. The remaining algorithm is identical to First Fit SDMA/TDMA discussed above. In line 4 of that description, stations are drawn from UA in sorted order.</p><p>If , the approximate worst-case orders of complexity of the dynamic slot allocation algorithms is given in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. It can be seen that the algorithms fall into two groups. The most complex group consists of First Fit Sorted and Best Fit. For , over the range of stations considered, the computation required is at least an order of magnitude greater for these algorithms compared with the other group. In the element case, this difference increases about half an order of magnitude when the number of stations is large.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. SDMA/TDMA Capacity Results</head><p>In this section, results are presented which compare the performance of the slot allocation algorithms. For these results, a relatively conservative value of 10 dB was used for SINR . In the results presented, we show the mean capacity defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> versus , for the algorithms and various propagation situations. Each point shown on the graphs was obtained via simulation by randomly choosing a large number of station signature sets and performing the slot allocation as discussed in Section IV-B.</p><p>In Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, the channel between each station and basestation antenna element is assumed to have independent Rayleigh fading. This model may be considered a limiting case when a  large number of multipath components are uniform in all angles of arrival. For this reason it is often used to model the effects in a heavy indoor multipath environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In this case the components of each received station signature vector, , are independent complex Gaussian variates. In addition, the vectors are independent from station to station.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, we first show the case where the SNR is very high, i.e., 20 dB. In this low-noise case, the smart antenna can almost always accommodate eight packets per slot. Note that this is the theoretical maximum since our antenna has only eight elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The sawtooth drop of the curves is caused when a station is added that must be placed into a new slot by itself, and therefore there are not enough stations to fill the slot in question. Under these conditions, the antenna is doing such a good job there is very little value in performing dynamic slot allocation, and thus there is virtually no distinction between the algorithms. Note that in the limit as the SNR becomes infinite, the SDMA/TDMA capacity is given by , where is the ceiling operation which rounds its argument up to the next integer. This happens because each beamforming module can always null out 7 interferers, and yet achieve the required SINR for the desired station, since it does not have to combat random noise.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, a similar graph is shown for a much higher noise situation (6-dB SNR). It can now be seen that variations between the different algorithms become very significant, especially when a higher number of stations is considered. This is because the more sophisticated algorithms have more stations to consider, so they are better able to generate good slot assignments. In the example shown, the Best Fit algorithm has a capacity roughly 58% higher than the Random algorithm when 50 stations are considered. The trend in this figure is typical of other results that we have found. As the propagation conditions deteriorate, one expects increasing value in performing intelligent slot allocation, since the system performs less well under a random allocation of stations.</p><p>In the previous results, we have assumed that there is sufficient power control to compensate for any shadowing and path-loss effects. Under the independent Rayleigh fading assumption, the expected power at the basestation for each portable is the same. For fixed stations, it may be possible for the system to provide a more strict form of power control by having the station adjust its power through a feedback mechanism so that the power received from each station is identical. The affect of this is to scale the spatial signature of each station so that the power in each is equal. Mathematically, the station signature is mapped to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> By squaring the magnitude of this expression, it can be seen that the terms involving cancel, and thus the power in the new spatial signature, , is the same for all as we require. The result of applying this power control is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. Compared to the same scenario without strict power control depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, the Best Fit algorithm now performs about 10% better than the Random allocation algorithm. It can be seen from a comparison of the graphs that the value of dynamic slot allocation improves as power control becomes less ideal.</p><p>Finally, in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">II</ref> we show the capacity for three common propagation models using Random, First Fit, and Best Fit slot allocation. The propagation models include the Rayleigh, and Rician models, which we briefly discussed in Section II. We have also included results for line-of-sight propagation using the classical free-space path-loss model. This is referred to as LOS-only. In this case, signal power is attenuated by a factor proportional to the square of the transmitter/receiver separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The results in this table are listed in increasing value of capacity obtained, assuming and SNR 6 dB. We define the LOS factor for the Rician distribution as the percentage of mean power in the deterministic component. In this paper has been set to 0.80, which is a typical value for indoor radio channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. It is interesting to note from the table that the relative performance is dependent upon the slot allocation algorithm used. For example, with First Fit, the highest capacity is achieved under LOS-only, followed by Rician and Rayleigh. However, with Best Fit, the order is reversed. This is attributed in part, to the fact that Best Fit does a much better job of accommodating stations with a wider variety of power levels. It should be noted that in the Rayleigh case, although each station has the same transmit power, there is more variation in received power than in the other two cases. When this is not the case we generally find that the capacity increases as the deterministic LOS component diminishes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Measured Station Signature Data</head><p>SDMA/TDMA capacity was also calculated using measured station spatial signatures using our experimental antenna. A variety of measurements were made using several different experimental setups. They are discussed with the results presented below.</p><p>First, data was collected by placing the array at position A2 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Spatial signature data was then collected by moving the transmitter throughout Room E while collecting data from the array. These measurements are referred to as "no line-ofsight," i.e., no-LOS, since there was never a direct unobstructed line of sight between the array and the transmitter. Following this, we collected data throughout hallway B. In this case there is a direct line of sight path between the transmitter and the array (still positioned at A2). This case is therefore referred to as dominant-LOS.</p><p>In both these cases, the diameter of the array was 0.51 m and 1000 samples spaced 0.30 m apart were taken. The spatial signatures were then used as input data to the slot allocation algorithms described in Section IV-B. The results of this process are given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, where the capacity is plotted versus , as before. The SNR was set to 6 dB.</p><p>As in the theoretical models, it can be seen that there is significant potential for capacity improvement when a good slot allocation algorithm is used compared with Random slot allocation. In addition, the capacity of the no-LOS situation is higher than the dominant-LOS situation, in this case by about 4% for Random allocation. However, when Best Fit slot allocation is used, the capacity of the no-LOS situation is roughly 14% higher than Random. This trend was supported by other results that we obtained. Generally we find that when the level of multipath is higher, larger improvements in capacity (compared with Random allocation) are possible when good slot allocation algorithms are used.</p><p>The capacity obtained using our no-LOS experimental data was compared with that using the simulated independent Rayleigh fading model. This comparison is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> where both sets of data are plotted. It can be seen that the Rayleigh model capacity is about 37% higher under Random allocation. Under Best Fit, the difference is about the same. It is expected that in a very heavy multipath environment, the measured capacity performance would approach that of the Rayleigh model capacity, since the spatial signatures would be a superposition of many similar multipath terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Also, the spatial signatures in this case would decorrelate very quickly with distance due to the dominance of multipath over line-of-sight components. This corresponds closely to the independent Rayleigh modeling assumption. Even in our no-LOS case however, while there is significant multipath, it does not approach the Rayleigh model case. Despite the fact that our measurements do not approach this theoretical limiting case, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> does strongly demonstrate dynamic slot allocation can significantly improve capacity in a typical indoor setting. In Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> we plot the capacity, , versus for Random slot allocation using data collected in various rooms shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. For these results the array was positioned at location A3. The antenna diameter used was 0.20 m, so that the antenna element spacings were slightly greater than one-third the previous value. It is interesting to note that in our measurements, this lower antenna diameter has a significant negative impact on capacity. This is caused by the fact that the closer spacings result in a higher level of correlation between received signals at the smart antenna elements. This correlation leads to a reduction in capacity compared to the case where each spatial channel is uncorrelated. In Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> we have also plotted the Rayleigh model case. This is the upper curve in both graphs.</p><p>It can be seen that the capacity varies significantly from one room to the next. This is attributed both to the level of multipath present, and to the azimuth subtended at the array due to the positions of the different rooms. It is interesting to note that Room 111 is known by us to have strong levels of multipath, due to metal walls and a metal ceiling. For this reason we find that it has a high level of spatial capacity. It can also be seen that the theoretical capacity is significantly higher than that which was obtained using our measurements. As discussed previously, this is caused by interantenna element correlation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CHANNEL TIME VARIATION EFFECTS</head><p>A requirement for the use of dynamic slot allocation is that the channel remain relatively constant from the time that a station signature is measured until it is used. This is to ensure that the beamforming applied in the downlink direction be valid. As discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, channel time coherence is a measure of the time over which the channel remains essentially unchanged.</p><p>In this section we consider the effects of variations in the channel that were obtained from our testbed measurements. For these results, the desired station signature is first measured. Optimal SINR beamforming is then used to fix the antenna weights. We then consider changes in the SINR due to pedestrian motion in the channel. This was obtained by having various numbers of people moving through the channel while the measurements  were made. We will describe a set of experiments whose results are representative of a number that were performed.</p><p>In this set of experiments, the array was placed at location A2 and the transmitter at location B, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Both the transmitter and the array were stationary for the duration of the experiment. The diameter of the array was 0.51 m. Six different experiments were performed. At the start of each experiment, the transmitter was turned on and the data acquisition system was set to sample 500 spatial signatures from the receive array. These measurements were taken at 20-ms intervals. In the first experiment two people walked as quickly and as close as possible around the transmitter. In the second and third experiments, these two people moved in the same fashion in the vicinity of the array, and in the hallway between the transmitter and the array, respectively. In the last three experiments, the same procedures were repeated, except that in this case seven people were used. The intent of these experiments was to generate some pedestrian motion which might be typical of worse-case indoor movement in the channel. The results are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>.  In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>, the single station is active with no interferers at an input SNR of 10 dB at each antenna element. The required output SNR, after beamforming, is set to 10 dB in these curves. Consequently, at time 0, maximum ratio combining is being done which means that the gain in the presence of white noise is being maximized. The graph shows the increase in outage probability as the time lag increases for the various cases. It can be seen that motion near the array itself has a much stronger effect on channel coherence times. This is because with motion near the array, only some of the multipath components arriving to the array are disturbed, so the relative interelement signals change significantly. This is followed by motion near the transmitter and finally motion in the region between. Motion near the transmitter affects most of the multipath components similarly, so the relative interelement changes are less significant. Motion in between intercepts fewer components so the signature does not change as much. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> suggests that for worse-case pedestrian motion, outages approaching 1% may not occur until we reach time lags of 60 ms or more. Also, the curves suggest that provided human motion is prevented in the vicinity of the array itself, very little degradation in system performance may occur for much longer time intervals.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref> we show a similar set of curves where in this case we have one desired station and one interfering station transmitting simultaneously. For the desired signal we simulated an additional source assuming independent Rayleigh fading between this station and each array element <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Over the course of the experiment this received signal remained constant. However, for the interfering station we use the measured station signatures collected with the array. This situation can arise if the channel between the interfering station and the array varies, but the channel between the desired station and array is time invariant. For example, people could be walking around the interferers, but the desired user could be in an isolated corner of the building where there are no other people. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>, a large number of trials were made with randomly chosen desired station signatures.</p><p>The results show a much more heightened sensitivity to movement in the channel. In this case, degradation due to motion in the channel can be very significant even for time intervals well below 100 ms. This is caused by the fact that the beamforming places a very steep null on the interferer so that any change in its signature is strongly felt. For this reason, protocol design must carefully accommodate these effects. It is expected that much more degradation would result if the desired signal were experiencing fading at the same time. Multiple fading interferers would degrade system performance even more. Note that the results in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref> are not directly comparable because there are no interferers in the case of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>.</p><p>We have also considered performing slot allocation using a fixed SINR margin to accommodate the reductions in SINR which occur due to changes in the channel. Including a margin for this purpose will reduce the total capacity achieved but at the same time make the system more robust to changes. These results also show that for time periods in the low tens of milliseconds, there is very little change in the channel and such measures are not needed to obtain good performance. In the interests of brevity we have not included these results in this paper.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that the length of the frames which are generated by the basestation are very important, since a frame must clearly be transmitted within the channel coherence time. However, when using SDMA/TDMA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> indicates that the mean frame length, , is a factor, , smaller than would be the case without SDMA. This effect reduces the time taken for a frame to be transmitted, thus reducing the system's sensitivity to changes in the channel. As an example, even with 50 stations in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, the actual frame length is less than ten slots for the best algorithms. It should also be noted that as the system carrier frequency is increased, channel coherence times decrease proportionately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have introduced and studied the use of dynamic slot allocation in indoor wireless SDMA/TDMA. In the system considered, the basestation uses uplink channel measurements to intelligently construct future SDMA/TDMA frames. This approach is feasible in systems using time division duplexing, i.e., where uplink and downlink transmission occurs using the same frequency channel. Both theoretical propagation models and data collected from an experimental smart antenna array were used to characterize the performance of dynamic slot allocation. The experimental results were obtained using an eight-element circular antenna array operating at 1.86 GHz.</p><p>It was shown that the problem of performing optimal dynamic slot allocation under a minimum-SINR constraint is NP-complete. A number of slot allocation algorithms with varying complexity were also introduced. Using both the theoretical and experimental propagation data, it was demonstrated that dynamic slot allocation is capable of significantly increasing system capacity compared with a Random slot allocation. Our experimental data showed that the capacity performance is significantly lower than that predicted using an independent Rayleigh propagation model.</p><p>We also presented measurements taken relating to the channel time coherence in the presence of indoor pedestrian mobility. The effects of channel time coherence are important since the channel must remain relatively constant from the time spatial signatures are measured until they are used. Our results suggest that dynamic slot allocation is possible at the frequency considered, provided turnaround times are in the low-to-mid tens of milliseconds.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
