<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>3D modeling is increasingly common in the modern world, playing a prominent role in such diverse industries as motion pictures, video games, medical research, architecture, and industrial engineering. As the amount of 3D content grows, there is a corresponding need for practical information retrieval tools.</p><p>This paper discusses the largest, most rapidly growing, and most comprehensive 3D search engine on the internet, as well as the design choices and unique challenges that shaped its development. Owned and operated by Physna Inc., the Thangs.com ("Thangs") search engine (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) is both an internet-scale search engine and a content hosting site. Thangs allows users to: (1) upload their own models, and; (2) search for 3D content using either text, geometric similarity, or part-in-part search.</p><p>Thangs is a relatively new product, having been released to the general public in August 2020. As of April 2021, Thangs allows users to search through a database of roughly 13.5 million models, with a projection of 20 million models by fall of 2022. Many of these models are geared towards 3D printing and computer games, but Thangs also indexes an increasing number of engineering-oriented artifacts.</p><p>This paper covers the most pressing issues facing any viable, internet-scale, 3D search engine. Section 2 provides a very short background section on search engines and the importance of 3D modeling. Section 3 discusses challenges accompanying data collection, including file format types and legal risks associated with web scraping. Section 4 surveys relevant intellectual property law, while Section 5 deals with trustworthy computing issues-namely, privacy, security, and appropriate content. Section 6 covers some key challenges facing information retrieval schemes, as well as the importance of test datasets. Finally, Section 7 briefly mentions data lifecycle issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">BACKGROUND</head><p>The discipline of information retrieval focuses on representing, searching, and manipulating collections of useful information <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[5]</ref>. This paper is concerned with 3D information retrieval (i.e., shape retrieval), which has been identified as vital not only for digital archiving but also for improvements to manufacturing processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[7]</ref>. In fact, economists and historians have identified 3D modeling as a key component of the "fourth industrial revolution" <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[37]</ref>.</p><p>A growing body of research exists on the topic of 3D information retrieval. Among the most important search types are: (1) similarity search, also known as "3D shape search" ("3DSS") <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[8]</ref>, and; (2) partin-part ("PIP") search, also known as "part-in-whole" retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[21]</ref>. Many methods have been proposed for 3DSS, including wavelets <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[16]</ref>, locality-constrained sparse patch coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[14]</ref>, and convolutional neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[34]</ref>. The current paper, however, focuses not on algorithms but on the data management challenges that arise when building a 3D search engine at internet scale. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">CHALLENGES WITH DATA COLLECTION</head><p>Efficient and reliable acquisition of data is of paramount importance to any internet search engine. 3D models, however, are typically proprietary. Search engines are not only confronted by access control mechanisms (e.g., login requirements), but also a patchwork of regulatory constraints that limit both the acquisition and subsequent use of 3D model data.</p><p>Physna partitions the various sources of 3D models into three categories:</p><p>(1) public sites that provide open access (e.g., Thingiverse.com);</p><p>(2) proprietary sites, typically owned by distributors or original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), and;</p><p>(3) the "dark web" <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Physna's web crawler is configured to crawl public and proprietary repositories only. Websites follow a "long tail" distribution in terms of available models, making it costly to perform a thorough search.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">File Formats</head><p>A large number of file formats are available for 3D models <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[17]</ref>. For instance, models intended for use in 3D printing are often saved in the popular STL file format <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[28]</ref> that represents 3D objects as simple triangle meshes. Formats such as STEP or IGES present solid bodies with geometric primitives that preserve the intended shape to a higher degree of accuracy and are commonly used to exchange models between CAD platforms. File formats that support computeraided design ("CAD") tasks are based on proprietary constructive geometry data that preserves the design history of the model so that the geometry can be accurately rendered; an example of this is the SLDPRT file format used by SolidWorks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[15]</ref>. Diversity of file formats poses significant challenges for geometric search. Many techniques for shape similarity generally assume that a single data representation is utilized for the entire database. A search engine could solve this problem by supporting a small number of file formats. However, Thangs gives users the option of uploading their own models for either hosting or for use in 3DSS. Supporting a tiny number of file formats would be a major drawback in terms of usability and uptake.</p><p>In order to make the problem tractable Physna converts 3D model files into a (canonical) triangle mesh format using industrystandard libraries. This strategy has several drawbacks. First, file format conversion often results in a loss of information that can eliminate key details <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[18]</ref>. Second, the libraries used for file conversion evolve over time; different versions of a library may utilize different meshing algorithms or different levels of numerical precision. Third, a model can have different outputs depending on conversion parameters. Fourth, a model might be available in several different file formats, leading to potential duplication in the database layer if the converted versions are not identical. Fifth, tessellation of assemblies is often problematic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Versioning</head><p>Physna currently handles file format issues by maintaining version and provenance information for every 3D model in its various databases: the file format, file converter version number, ingestion history, and data source are all tracked explicitly in the database layer. The Thangs webcrawler also provides metadata such as acquisition/ingest timestamps. If a given 3D model is available on different websites (or through different file formats), the appropriate records are merged in the database to minimize duplication. Either hashing or geometric similarity is used to match files. Some versioning issues arise from the fact that many 3D models are in a state of evolution. For instance, digital sculptors often make refinements to existing models, releasing new versions as changes are made. Websites can also change URLs or filenames for models. Physna also provides versioning functionality to those users who use Thangs as a creator platform. Model versions are tracked on a model's landing page. There is also a workspace that provides users with a visualization of the differences between model versions. As of the time of writing, creators on Thangs are making significant use of this functionality (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Legal Restrictions</head><p>There are significant legal risks involved in acquiring 3D models by crawling the world-wide web. In the United States, web crawling is subject to a patchwork of laws <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">38]</ref>, including: (1) contract; (2) tort (e.g., trespass to chattels, tortious interference); (3) unfair competition; (4) privacy; (5) intellectual property (e.g., copyright, trade secret); (6) the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ("CFAA"); <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(7)</ref> the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"); (8) state anti-hacking statutes; (9) common law rights of publicity, and; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(10)</ref> the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act ("CISA"). Although the majority of these laws expose web crawlers to civil liability, some of them provide for criminal remedies as well.</p><p>Many internet-accessible 3D models are found on corporate websites that restrict access through "terms of use", "robots.txt" files, or login/password requirements. Accessing these websites without permission may result in liability. For instance, ?1030(a)(3) of the CFAA makes it a crime to intentionally access a computer either without authorization or beyond the scope of previously granted authority. In Van Buren v. United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[31]</ref> the Supreme Court provided guidance on the phrase "exceeding authorized access. " The 9th Circuit considered "without authorization" in HiQ v. LinkedIn</p><p>[6], concluding that sufficiently public data can be scraped without attracting liability under the CFAA.</p><p>Search engines should minimize their legal risks using a carefully chosen set of controls. The safest option in dealing with proprietary assets is to obtain consent from the owners; some companies are happy to allow scraping in exchange for increased traffic, while others will not give permission under any circumstances. However, securing consent is difficult for startups as there are thousands of OEMs and each agreement takes time to negotiate.</p><p>From experience, Physna recommends building up significant in-house expertise. In concert with comprehensive legal analysis, administrative and technical controls (e.g., domain blocking, rate limiting, monitoring of "robots.txt" files) should be introduced. Outside counsel may be used as a sanity check, but an evolving set of laws and target domains requires constant iteration; in-house legal expertise is likely essential for this reason alone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</head><p>Intellectual property ("IP") law can have an impact on search engines. This paper discusses copyright, trademark, and trade secret.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Copyright</head><p>Copyright law grants authors the ability to control the dissemination and use of their works for a limited time. Various requirements limit copyright's scope (e.g., the works must be original and fixed in a tangible medium). 3D models will generally meet these criteria, apart from edge cases where models are created in the absence of human participation. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>In general, a 3D search engine: (1) acquires 3D data together with accompanying metadata; (2) transforms the 3D data into a representation that supports some form of search, such as mesh fingerprints (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[36]</ref>) or locality-sensitive hash signatures (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[10]</ref>);</p><p>(3) extracts statistical information about the original or transformed data (e.g., histograms, bounding volumes, surface area), and; (4) displays representations of the original and/or transformed data to its users (e.g., preview images). As a result, a 3D search engine typically maintains a database that includes copies of original works, transformed works, statistical information, and metadata.</p><p>There are two main copyright issues that arise when multiple works are scraped from an internet-accessible collection <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[3]</ref>: (1) violations of copyright in the individual works, and; (2) violations of copyright in the entire collection. Copying a substantial amount of the collection can open up a web scraper to liability on the second front as well as the first. However, textual descriptions accompanying a 3D model are usually not protected (e.g., technical specifications that describe basic characteristics of an artifact).</p><p>Operators of 3D search engines can invoke the defence of 'fair use' (17 U.S. Code ?107). In Authors Guild v. Google [2], the Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit examined copyright claims in the context of Google Books. While the court agreed that Google had engaged in unauthorized digitization of books, the fact that the copying was "transformative" (i.e., done for the purpose of creating a search engine) made it a non-infringing fair use; nor was this result negated by the fact that Google was a commercial entity with a profit motive <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[26]</ref>.</p><p>While Authors Guild v. Google is precedent, it is worth noting that fair use is determined on a case-by-case basis in an open-ended and context-sensitive inquiry <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[9]</ref>. Operators of 3D search engines should retain experienced legal counsel to advise on fair use, improper appropriation, intermediate copying, and other issues. A "notice and take-down" policy must be imposed, and the search engine software must be designed so that content can be taken offline easily. Physna's back-end software teams have created a deletion pipeline that, given a model identifier, automates the takedown process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Trademark</head><p>3D search engine operators must also consider trademark issues, particularly if corporate logos or trademarked terms are scraped. Trademark infringement analysis is a specialized area of law with a large body of cases (e.g., [1]). In general, it is not enough for a plaintiff to show that their mark was used without authorization "in commerce"-rather, they must also show that the use was likely to cause confusion as to affiliation or origin, sponsorship, or approval. Thankfully the courts have considered trademark use in the context of search engines in RescueCom v. Google <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>. A 3D search engine should be able to avoid liability under trademark law with moderate due diligence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Trade Secret</head><p>Trade secret is typically not an issue if a search engine crawls pages that are explicitly made available to the public. However, there are at least two edge cases to be aware of: (1) where taking the entire content of a website's database of 3D models puts the scraper in a position to obtain trade secrets, and; (2) where the scraper bypasses access controls and obtains trade secret information. Physna's web scraping team has incorporated these issues into its processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING 5.1 Privacy</head><p>A fair number of privacy concerns arise from the fact that Thangs is dual purpose, allowing users to create accounts and to upload their own models. First, this design choice exposes Thangs to data protection statutes such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). Physna currently has rolled out numerous policies and administrative safeguards to demonstrate compliance with these sources of law.</p><p>Second, users who upload their own models can embed private information into the 3D model data and/or metadata (e.g., text description). For instance, a user could place personal information ("PI") into a 'description' field, or they could use a 3D extrusion utility to convert text containing PI into a 3D model. At present, Physna relies on users to report this type of misuse; in future, the back-end development team will implement automated checks for PI in the metadata.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Security</head><p>Thangs faces all of the typical security risks of an internet-accessible software application <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">33]</ref>, including denial of service and injection attacks. However, the dual purpose nature of the platform has resulted in a wider threat profile; Thangs has already experienced security incidents where malicious users have attempted to sabotage the platform. These experiences prompted Physna to implement improved security controls, including automated monitoring routines that attempt to detect when users engage in suspicious behavior.</p><p>Multimedia search engines also face unique security threats that are not discussed in the general security literature. Attackers with some knowledge of the information retrieval scheme may attempt to degrade performance by inserting altered or malicious assets. In the case of 3D models, research has already been performed on attacks using the STL file format <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[27]</ref>. Malicious actors with knowledge of a particular shape similarity algorithm, for instance, can upload data that degrades search performance. Attackers can also target existing models by downloading them, modifying them, and reuploading in bulk. Physna has implemented a variety of checks for suspicious model files, but many of these attacks are subtle and will require significant effort to detect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Inappropriate Content</head><p>Since Thangs allows direct uploads of models, users have an opportunity to submit textual or 3D data that does not meet community guidelines (e.g., obscene content). Detection of inappropriate text is much easier than detection of inappropriate 3D content. Thangs uses Google NLP and Vision to ensure that models with inappropriate content are not shown on the home page; users can also provide feedback through the 'report model' button in the user interface. Thangs allows content that is "not safe for work" ("NSFW"), but such content is not shown in trending results (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">INFORMATION RETRIEVAL 6.1 Search Variants</head><p>The Thangs search engine supports three types of search: (1) textbased search ("TBS"), where a user can search for models by metadata; (2) similarity search ("3DSS"), where a user can upload a 3D model and search for related models, and; (3) part-in-part ("PiP") search <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[21]</ref>, where the user can upload a 3D model and search for other models that contain it as a component.</p><p>TBS is straightforward and by far the most popular with typical users at over 80% of public search volume. 3DSS is the second most popular search type, but Thangs also displays pre-computed 3DSS results on a model's listing page (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>). At present, 3DSS uses a facet-based, local measurement approach. Finally, PiP is the most important type of search for Physna's enterprise customers.</p><p>Due to the fact that Thangs is both a model hosting site and search engine, search results are bifurcated into 'internal' (hosted) and 'external' (crawled) entries. Thangs also provides a set of filters for TBS so that users can refine their search results. For instance, users can search for models that: (1) are watertight; (2) have consistent normals; (3) are of a particular filetype, or; (4) come from a particular domain (e.g., thingiverse.com).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Shape Retrieval as a Bag-of-Words Model</head><p>Notions of similarity in 3D shape retrieval are necessarily as diverse as the shapes themselves. For example, depending on context, 3D shapes may be considered similar semantically if they represent similar conceptual subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[35]</ref>, stylistically if they bear visual resemblance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[12]</ref>, mechanically if they bear coupled or mated parts <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[21]</ref>, abstractly if they contain significant isometric subsurfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[13]</ref>, etc. One flexible framework encompassing multiple contextdependent notions of similarity is the "bag-of-words" approach to shape retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[5]</ref>, where each shape is considered a multiset of context specific geometric "words".</p><p>It is helpful to consider shape retrieval as analogous to more familiar text-based search engines. The bag-of-words model is a fruitful model used for machine learning of natural language <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[30]</ref>.</p><p>In this approach, a text is reduced to the multiset of its composite words. Two texts can then be compared by matching their constituent word count, or else the words and their counts are further used for classification or attribute creation for ingestion by further models. For example, the bags can be considered as linear combinations and embedded in a vector space (as in word2vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[20]</ref>) for metric clustering algorithms or spatial tree search algorithms, or particular word frequencies may be analysed to build classifiers (e.g., spam filtering) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[24]</ref>.</p><p>A major hurdle for building further models is that one can say the same thing in many ways. Nearly identical sentiments may have many different texts yielding different representations as bagsof-words. Techniques like word2vec made significant progress by parametrizing semantic relationships into a high dimensional vector space.</p><p>Naturally, bag-of-words models can be built from more abstract analogs of words. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">30]</ref> The technique is generally applicable for any category of objects composed of many discretizable subobjects from some finite collection. So 3D shapes generally can be considered analogously: the meaning contained in a shape comes from many smaller subshapes or geometric primitives (words) relatively positioned (syntax) into an entire model (text) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[11]</ref>. Just as with texts the many possible representations do not all generate the same bag-of-words unless some equivocation or notion of similarity is established between some of the primitives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Bag-of-Words Model Advantages</head><p>Bag-of-words models for shape retrieval have several advantages, including: (1) flexibility of similarity notion; (2) respecting subobject inclusions; (3) independence of word counts, which makes models flexibile to on-line changes, and; (4) natural parallelization. They can accommodate any notion of similarity, provided one can compute the relevant geometric words from the shapes.</p><p>The Thangs search engine makes use of geometric words which are both defined locally from subshapes, as well as global words encompassing the entire shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[36]</ref>. Local words are derived from local neighborhood measurements, one for each facet/triangle in the mesh (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>). Descriptive geometric words can be tailored to the relevant notion of similarity. Thangs search modes are distinguished by their choice of relevant geometric words.</p><p>Perhaps the most important property of bag-of-words models is that they respect subobject relationships-that is, if ? is a text which is a passage of some larger text ? , then all the words of ? are also in ? , so the bag of ? is a subset of the bag of ? . This property is critical for part-in-part search, as it ensures the subpart's bag is contained in the superpart's.</p><p>Bag-of-word models can be maintained with a great deal of online flexibility as well. While it is common for bag-of-words models to represent bags as vectors of word counts over a finite dimensional vector space with a fixed basis set of words <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[29]</ref>, the bags can also be viewed as sparse vectors over a dynamically defined vector space in which particular basis words can be added or removed. Since the bags are compared as counts over a basis, any particular basis elements can be added or removed without disruption to the larger representation. Similarly, the independence of the geometric words makes the search retrieval highly parallelizable. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Bag-of-Words Model Challenges</head><p>A number of major technical hurdles arise when a bag-of-words shape retrieval algorithm scales to the size of the Thangs search engine, related to both the quantity of the data involved in queries and limitations in geometric word descriptors.</p><p>Generic 3D shape data are in general heavy, and the Thangs search engine indexes a wide variety of models with a range of complexities and data sizes. Quite apart from the storage and transmission of such models, the number of local geometric words describing a model can grow linearly with data size; a query can be very complex, akin to a text search querying for all the passages from a full set of encyclopedias (though fortunately this can largely be computed concurrently). The Thangs search engine mitigates this computation by parallelization and by storing precomputed index data where possible.</p><p>Geometric words in particular are exposed to many additional sources of errors not found in text based models. Errors introduced by representation or file format conversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[18]</ref> are reflected in the computation of geometric words, which can become sensitive to such sources of numerical noise, particularly if geometric words are not continuous in shape parameters.</p><p>Care must be taken to deal with generic or highly common geometry as well. In general the frequency of geometric words is highly nonuniform, which can result in over-matching or poor quality matches. The Thangs search engine frequently encounters either: (1) generic or easily defined geometric primitives, or; (2) common computer-constructed geometry. For example, algorithmicallydesigned support structures for 3D printing are common (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>). Significant amounts of overlap in geometric words can result in a large family of seemingly unrelated models if left unchecked. There are several strategies that can be used to ameliorate the situation. For instance, overly generic geometric words can either be excluded from use in matching, or split into several geometric synonyms to further divide the set of shapes containing the word to more manageable bin populations. CAD models are another issues, as they typically exhibit high degrees of regularity when converted to a mesh representation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). They often have significant overlap in words, particularly when they are generated by the same CAD software.</p><p>This problem is most apparent when considering data at scale. Large databases of 3D models will invariably exhibit significant overlap in geometric words. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref> shows a histogram of triangle perimeter sizes for a database of 1 million 3D models. (The models are mostly sculpted, with a smaller number of CAD files). The overall distribution is gamma, showing significant degrees of overlap in the 0.5 to 1.0 range. Two randomly chosen bags of words are likely to have elements in common. This problem is not as pressing for the small (e.g., thousands of models) datasets used in research, but it becomes a major issue for the large-scale datasets that are used by internet-scale 3D search engines.   Another major issue facing mesh-based bag-of-words models is that meshes often contain malformed facets. For instance, marchingcubes approaches to tessellation will often yield extremely slim triangles whose local measurements (i.e., word representations) will be affected by numerical artifacts (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>). The Thangs search engine often encounters triangles whose local measurements (e.g., area, perimeter) have been rounded to 0. This can cause problems for some shape similarity algorithms, and also for quality/sanity checks built into an ingestion pipeline.</p><p>Ameliorating this issue is not trivial. One option is to alter an afflicted mesh by re-tessellating it. Another is to alter the vertices of offending triangles in order to provide non-zero local measurements. However, re-tessellation can result in a different bag-of words than the bag provided by the original input mesh; manipulation of malformed triangles can affect words/measurements for neighboring triangles, potentially losing features relevant to part-in-part search. A public search engine should make as few modifications to 3D content as possible in the interests of accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5">Test Datasets</head><p>As with any information retrieval or machine learning ("ML") system, robust training/test datasets ("TTDs") are essential for both initial development and for tracking changes (e.g., model drift) over time. Thangs is currently supported by datasets of two types: (1) wild type TTDs, which contain (labeled/categorized) real-world models taken from various sources, and; (2) generated TTDs, in which the models have been carefully generated to aid in the development of 3DSS and PiP algorithms.</p><p>Not only are TTDs essential for system development, but they are valuable intellectual property in their own right-in fact, they may be more valuable than patents. The size of Physna's TTDs varies, but on average they hold hundreds of thousands of models. Physna also performs end-to-end testing on databases with model counts in the millions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">THE DATA LIFE-CYCLE</head><p>The data lifecycle is one of the most difficult challenges facing Thangs. Creators and OEMs often remove models from the internet, either retiring them or replacing them with new versions. For instance, digital sculptors often upload "works in progress" to sites like Thangs or DeviantArt. A model listing page of the sort used by sculptors is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>.</p><p>Since 3D content is difficult and time consuming to acquire, maintaining a current search index is a significant challenge. Legal restrictions and bandwidth limitations impose significant limits on web crawling (e.g., in contrast to text-based search engines, it is not possible to perform frequent recrawls of sites). The Thangs engine maintains 'freshness' estimates in the database layer, and recrawls are attempted on a per-site schedule. Models that are no longer available to the public are taken offline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper has discussed the major data management challenges facing internet-scale 3D search engines, including model acquisition, diversity of file formats, shape retrieval, intellectual property, the legality of web crawling, and trustworthy computing. While some of these issues, such as privacy and security, are shared with other information systems, others are unique to this domain. The discussion contains some guidance on how Physna has approached some of these challenges, but a thorough treatment is well beyond a single paper.</p><p>Apart from ongoing work on improving 3D search methods there are numerous areas of research that directly impact the challenges mentioned above. First, researchers should continue to investigate the use of 3D model files as attack vectors. While this is largely a theoretical concern at present, if 3D search engines become highly visible they will inevitably attract attention from malicious actors. In particular, this type of attack may be appealing to competitors and other actors skilled at corporate espionage.</p><p>Second, further research on the detection of objectionable (e.g., obscene) shapes is sorely needed. There is some existing work that converts 3D objects to 2D images and then uses 2D imaging techniques to classify the results. However, from an organizational standpoint it would be useful to find techniques that operate within the 3D domain directly. In particular it is difficult for startups to develop and maintain multiple systems operating in parallel.</p><p>Third, relatively little work in the academic literature has addressed information retrieval for very large-scale 3D model collections (including means for indexing large numbers of bag-of-words representations). In contrast to the relatively small datasets found in the research literature, datasets for an internet-scale 3D search engine will contain tens or hundreds of millions of models. Certain issues become much more pressing when the size of the dataset is extremely large. For example, local neighborhood estimates start to overlap in datasets of this size, causing problems for some types of similarity search. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: A Screenshot of the landing page of the Thangs Search Engine</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="2,53.80,83.68,504.41,253.93" type="bitmap" /></figure>
