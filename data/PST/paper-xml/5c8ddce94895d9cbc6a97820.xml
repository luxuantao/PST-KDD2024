<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We investigate a lattice-structured LSTM model for Chinese NER, which encodes a sequence of input characters as well as all potential words that match a lexicon. Compared with character-based methods, our model explicitly leverages word and word sequence information. Compared with word-based methods, lattice LSTM does not suffer from segmentation errors. Gated recurrent cells allow our model to choose the most relevant characters and words from a sentence for better NER results. Experiments on various datasets show that lattice LSTM outperforms both word-based and character-based LSTM baselines, achieving the best results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>As a fundamental task in information extraction, named entity recognition (NER) has received constant research attention over the recent years. The task has traditionally been solved as a sequence labeling problem, where entity boundary and category labels are jointly predicted. The current stateof-the-art for English NER has been achieved by using LSTM-CRF models <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Lample et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ma and Hovy, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chiu and Nichols, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Liu et al., 2018)</ref> with character information being integrated into word representations.</p><p>Chinese NER is correlated with word segmentation. In particular, named entity boundaries are also word boundaries. One intuitive way of performing Chinese NER is to perform word segmentation first, before applying word sequence labeling. The segmentation → NER pipeline, however, can suffer the potential issue of error propagation, since NEs are an important source of OOV in segmentation, and incorrectly segmented entity boundaries lead to NER errors. This problem can be severe in the open domain since crossdomain word segmentation remains an unsolved problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Liu and Zhang, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Jiang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Liu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Qiu and Zhang, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Huang et al., 2017)</ref>. It has been shown that character-based methods outperform word-based methods for Chinese NER <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(He and Wang, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Liu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Li et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>One drawback of character-based NER, however, is that explicit word and word sequence information is not fully exploited, which can be potentially useful. To address this issue, we integrate latent word information into characterbased LSTM-CRF by representing lexicon words from the sentence using a lattice structure LSTM. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we construct a wordcharacter lattice by matching a sentence with a large automatically-obtained lexicon. As a result, word sequences such as "长江大桥 (Yangtze River Bridge)", "长江 (Yangtze River)" and "大 桥 (Bridge)" can be used to disambiguate potential relevant named entities in a context, such as the person name "江大桥 (Daqiao Jiang)".</p><p>Since there are an exponential number of wordcharacter paths in a lattice, we leverage a lattice LSTM structure for automatically controlling information flow from the beginning of the sentence to the end. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, gated cells are used to dynamically route information from Results show that our model significantly outperforms both character sequence labeling models and word sequence labeling models using LSTM-CRF, giving the best results over a variety of Chinese NER datasets across different domains. Our code and data are released at https:// github.com/jiesutd/LatticeLSTM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Our work is in line with existing methods using neural network for NER. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hammerton (2003)</ref> attempted to solve the problem using a unidirectional LSTM, which was among the first neural models for NER. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Collobert et al. (2011)</ref>  Character sequence labeling has been the dominant approach for Chinese NER <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chen et al., 2006b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lu et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dong et al., 2016)</ref>. There have been explicit discussions comparing statistical word-based and character-based methods for the task, showing that the latter is empirically a superior choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(He and Wang, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Liu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Li et al., 2014)</ref>. We find that with proper representation settings, the same conclusion holds for neural NER. On the other hand, lattice LSTM is a better choice compared with both word LSTM and character LSTM.</p><p>How to better leverage word information for Chinese NER has received continued research attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Gao et al., 2005)</ref>, where segmentation information has been used as soft features for NER <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Zhao and Kit, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Peng and Dredze, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">He and Sun, 2017a)</ref>, and joint segmentation and NER has been investigated using dual decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Xu et al., 2014)</ref>, multi-task learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Peng and Dredze, 2016)</ref>, etc. Our work is in line, focusing on neural representation learning. While the above methods can be affected by segmented training data and segmentation errors, our method does not require a word segmentor. The model is conceptually simpler by not considering multi-task settings.</p><p>External sources of information has been leveraged for NER. In particular, lexicon features have been widely used <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Collobert et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Passos et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Huang et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Luo et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rei (2017)</ref> uses a word-level language modeling objective to augment NER training, performing multi-task learning over large raw text. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Peters et al.

(2017b)</ref> exploit cross-domain and cross-lingual knowledge via multi-task learning. We leverage external data by pretraining word embedding lexicon over large automatically-segmented texts, while semisupervised techniques such as language modeling are orthogonal to and can also be used for our lattice LSTM model.</p><p>Lattice structured RNNs can be viewed as a natural extension of tree-structured RNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Tai et al., 2015)</ref> to DAGs. They have been used to model motion dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Sun et al., 2017)</ref>, dependencydiscourse DAGs <ref type="bibr">(Peng et al., 2017)</ref>, as well as speech tokenization lattice <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Sperber et al., 2017)</ref> and multi-granularity segmentation outputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Su et al., 2017)</ref> for NMT encoders. Compared with existing work, our lattice LSTM is different in both motivation and structure. For example, being designed for character-centric lattice-LSTM-CRF sequence labeling, it has recurrent cells but not hidden vectors for words. To our knowledge, we are the first to design a novel lattice LSTM representation for mixed characters and lexicon words, and the first to use a word-character lattice for segmentation-free Chinese NER.</p></div>

Formally, denote an input sentence as s = c 1 , c 2 , . . . , c m , where c j denotes the jth character. s can further be seen as a word sequence s = w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w n , where w i denotes the ith word in the sentence, obtained using a Chinese segmentor. We use t(i, k) to denote the index j for the kth character in the ith word in the sentence. Take the sentence in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for example. If the segmentation is "南京市 长江大桥", and indices are from 1, then t(2, 1) = 4 (长) and t(1, 3) = 3 (市).

As indicated in Section 2, we use automatically segmented large raw text for buinding D. Using w d b,e to denote such a subsequence that begins with character index b and ends with character index e, the segment w d 1,2 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> is "南 京 (Nanjing)" and w d 7,8 is "大桥 (Bridge)". Four types of vectors are involved in the model, namely input vectors, output hidden vectors, cell vectors and gate vectors.

During NER training, loss values back-propagate to the parameters 2 We experimented with alternative configurations on indexing word and character path links, finding that this configuration gives the best results in preliminary experiments. Single-character words are excluded; the final performance drops slightly after integrating single-character words.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Decoding and Training</head><p>A standard CRF layer is used on top of h 1 , h 2 , . . . , h τ , where τ is n for character-based and lattice-based models and m for word-based models.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Experimental Settings</head><p>Data. Four datasets are used in this paper, which include OntoNotes 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Weischedel et al., 2011)</ref>, MSRA <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Levow, 2006)</ref>  For more variety in test domains, we collected a resume dataset from Sina Finance<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">4</ref> , which consists of resumes of senior executives from listed companies in the Chinese stock market. We randomly selected 1027 resume summaries and manually annotated 8 types of named entities. Statistics of the dataset is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The inter-annotator agreement is 97.1%. We release this dataset as a resource for further research.</p><p>Segmentation. For the OntoNotes and MSRA datasets, gold-standard segmentation is available in the training sections. For OntoNotes, gold segmentation is also available for the development and test sections. On the other hand, no segmentation is available for the MSRA test sections, nor the Weibo / resume datasets. As a result, OntoNotes is leveraged for studying oracle situations where gold segmentation is given. We use the neural word segmentor of <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Yang et al. (2017a)</ref> to automatically segment the development and test sets for word-based NER. In particular, for the OntoNotes and MSRA datasets, we train the segmentor using gold segmentation on their respective training sets. For Weibo and resume, we take the best model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Yang et al. (2017a)</ref> off the shelf<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">5</ref> , which is trained using CTB 6.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Xue et al., 2005)</ref>. Word Embeddings. We pretrain word embeddings using word2vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref> over automatically segmented Chinese Giga-Word<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">6</ref> , obtaining 704.4k words in a final lexicon. In particular, the number of single-character, twocharacter and three-character words are 5.7k, 291.5k, 278.1k, respectively. The embedding lexicon is released alongside our code and models as a resource for further research. Word embeddings are fine-tuned during NER training. Character and character bigram embeddings are pretrained on Chinese Giga-Word using word2vec and finetuned at model training.</p><p>Hyper-parameter settings. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the values of hyper-parameters for our models, which as fixed according to previous work in the literature without grid-search adjustments for each individual dataset. In particular, the embedding sizes are set to 50 and the hidden size of LSTM models to 200. Dropout <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Srivastava et al., 2014)</ref> is applied to both word and character embeddings with a rate of 0.5. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is used for optimization, with an initial learning rate of 0.015 and a decay rate of 0.05.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Development Experiments</head><p>We compare various model configurations on the OntoNotes development set, in order to select the best settings for word-based and character-based NER models, and to learn the influence of lattice word information on character-based models.</p><p>Character-based NER. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, without using word segmentation, a characterbased LSTM-CRF model gives a development F1score of 62.47%. Adding character-bigram and softword representations as described in Section 3.1 increases the F1-score to 67.63% and 65.71%, respectively, demonstrating the usefulness of both sources of information. In addition, a combination of both gives a 69.64% F1-score, which is the best Word-based NER. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows a variety of different settings for word-based Chinese NER. With automatic segmentation, a word-based LSTM CRF baseline gives a 64.12% F1-score, which is higher compared to the character-based baseline. This demonstrates that both word information and character information are useful for Chinese NER. The two methods of using character LSTM to enrich word representations in Section 3.2, namely word+char LSTM and word+char , lead to similar improvements. A CNN representation of character sequences gives a slightly higher F1-score compared to LSTM character representations. On the other hand, further using character bigram information leads to increased F1-score over word+char LSTM, but decreased F1-score over word+char CNN. A possible reason is that CNN inherently captures character n-gram information. As a result, we use word+char+bichar LSTM for wordbased NER in the remaining experiments, which gives the best development results, and is structurally consistent with the state-of-the-art English NER models in the literature.</p><p>Lattice-based NER. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref> shows the F1score of character-based and lattice-based models against the number of training iterations. We include models that use concatenated character and character bigram embeddings, where bigrams can play a role in disambiguating characters. As can be seen from the figure, lattice word information is useful for improving character-based NER, improving the best development result from 62.5% to 71.6%. On the other hand, the bigram-enhanced lattice model does not lead to further improvements compared with the original lattice model.   This is likely because words are better sources of information for character disambiguation compared with bigrams, which are also ambiguous.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, the lattice LSTM-CRF model gives a development F1-score of 71.62%, which is significantly<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">7</ref> higher compared with both the word-based and character-based methods, despite that it does not use character bigrams or word segmentation information. The fact that it significantly outperforms char+softword shows the advantage of lattice word information as compared with segmentor word information.</p></div>

The OntoNotes test results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">8</ref> .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Discussion</head><p>F1 against sentence length. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows the F1-scores of the baseline models and lattice LSTM-CRF on the OntoNotes dataset. The character-based baseline gives relatively stable F1-scores over different sentence lengths, although the performances are relatively low. The word-based baseline gives substantially higher F1-scores over short sentences, but lower F1scores over long sentences, which can be because of lower segmentation accuracies over longer sentences. Both word+char+bichar and char+bichar+softword give better performances compared to their respective baselines, showing  F1 against sentence length. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">9</ref> shows a case study comparing char+bichar+softword, word+char+bichar and the lattice model. In the example, there is much ambiguity around the named entity "东莞台协 (Taiwan Association in Dongguan)". Word+char+bichar yields the entities "东 莞 (Dongguan)" and "台 (Taiwan)" given that "东 莞台协 (Taiwan Association in Dongguan)" is not in the segmentor output. Char+bichar+softword recognizes "东 莞 台 协 会 (Taiwan Association in Dongguan)", which is valid on its own, but leaves the phrase "长职务后" ungrammatical. In contrast, the lattice model detects the organization name correctly, thanks to the lattice words "东莞 (Dongguan)", "会长 (President)" and "职 务 (role)". There are also irrelevant words such as "台协会 (Taiwan Association)" and "下东 (noisy word)" in the lexicon, which did not affect NER results.</p><p>Note that both word+char+bichar and lattice use the same source of word information, namely the same pretrained word embedding lexicon. However, word+char+bichar first uses the lexicon in the segmentor, which imposes hard constrains (i.e. fixed words) to its subsequence use in NER. In contrast, lattice LSTM has the freedom of considering all lexicon words. Entities in lexicon. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">10</ref> shows the total number of entities and their respective match ratios in the lexicon. The error reductions (ER) of the final lattice model over the best character-based method (i.e. "+bichar+softword") are also shown. It can be seen that error reductions have a correlation between matched entities in the lexicon. In this respect, our automatic lexicon also played to some extent the role of a gazetteer <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ratinov and Roth, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chiu and Nichols, 2016)</ref>, but not fully since there is no explicit knowledge in the lexicon which tokens are entities. The ultimate disambiguation power still lies in the lattice encoder and supervised learning.</p><p>The quality of the lexicon may affect the accuracy of our NER model since noise words can potentially confuse NER. On the other hand, our lattice model can potentially learn to select more correct words during NER training. We leave the investigation of such influence to future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We empirically investigated a lattice LSTM-CRF representations for Chinese NER, finding that it gives consistently superior performance compared to word-based and character-based LSTM-CRF across different domains. The lattice method is fully independent of word segmentation, yet more effective in using word information thanks to the freedom of choosing lexicon words in a context for NER disambiguation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Word character lattice.</figDesc></figure>
