<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>N ATURE-inspired methods are playing a vital role to solve various real life problems which may be very difficult or sometimes impossible to solved using analytical methods. So far, numerous optimization algorithm inspired by genetics, nervous system, swarm intelligence, based on the behavior of birds, fishes, bees, ants, bats, frog, elephant, cats, wolf etc. have been suggested in the literature. These algorithms are applied to solve various complex power system optimization problems and are found to be very effective to search the global or near-global solutions. To enhance the working of such techniques, various improved or hybrid versions are also available in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>The recent advancements in small-sized and modulated power generation technologies has led to the large-scale deployment of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in distribution systems. However, initially, the existing distribution networks were not designed to accommodate high penetration of DERs. In order to alleviate the counterproductive effects of DER integrations, the DERs should be optimally accommodated in distribution systems, as non-optimal DER accommodation may provide counterproductive results. Alternatively, the Optimal DER Accommodation (ODERA) may provide enormous techno-economic and social benefits such as minimized power/energy loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, voltage deviation All authors are with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Malaviya National Institute of Technology (MNIT), Jaipur, India (email: nandiitk06@gmail.com, sonam ee@yahoo.com, mnit.anil@gmail.com, nikhil2007 mnit@yahoo.com, krn152001@yahoo.co.in) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, system average interruption duration <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, DER capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and GHG emission <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> while improving voltage stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, transient stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> etc. The optimal accommodation of DERs in distribution systems is a mixed-integer, non-linear and non-convex optimization problem generally, comprised of number, location, sizes and type of DERs.</p><p>Considering above discussed objectives of DER integration, ODERA problem becomes a multiobjective optimization problem in which two or more objectives are optimized. As the objectives may be conflicting, a precise multiobjective formulation is required. Many multiobjective formulations considering multiple objectives are converted into single objective problem by assigning weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> or multiplying them with a penalty function <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The commonly used techniques for multiobjective formulation may include weighted sum <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, goal programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, penalty function <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, epsilon-constrained <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> based approaches. These techniques have some limitations, such as the optimal solution of weighted sum approach depends on the selected weights, pre-specified goals have to be assigned in goal programming, a master and slave objectives are required to be specified in epsilon constrained approaches. However, some of the limitations of above discussed approaches are overcome by fuzzification <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, max-min approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and fuzzy-based goal programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> by bringing all the objectives at same scale and unit, but they may not have inherent mechanism to provide evenly distributed Pareto-front. A normal boundary intersection algorithm is adopted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> to obtain evenly distributed Pareto-front. However, the method independently determined the individual best values in beginning by ignoring the effect of other objectives. Therefore, a powerful Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) formulation approach may be beneficial to provide compromising solutions for multiobjective DER integration problems when all the objectives of different units and scales are equally important.</p><p>In 1981, Hwang and Yoon introduced a powerful MCDM approach known as Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The method is further improved in 1987 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and 1993 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> to overcome some of the shortcomings of earlier variant(s). The approach applies Euclidean geometry and modeled to minimize the Euclidean distance of each solution from its best solution set known as Positive Ideal Solution (PIS) while simultaneously maximizing it from the worst solution set known as Negative Ideal Solution (NIS). Therefore, the approach generates more evenly distributed Pareto-set as compared to the mentioned approaches. The approach can be effectively integrated with any modern heuristic optimization technique to select the most compromising solution in each iteration of the method. To the best of authors knowledge this is the first attempt to combine TOPSIS and EHO for Multiobjective DER accommodation problem of distribution systems.</p><p>Furthermore, to solve the formulated single or multiobjective problems of DER integration and management for distribution systems, numerous analytical and heuristic-based optimization methods have been suggested in literature. Some of these may be Loss Sensitivity Factor (LSF) based analytical methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, GA <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> differential evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, Simulated Annealing (SA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, Harmony Search (HS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> etc. It may be observed that the heuristic methods are capable to determine the global optimal solution but may require large computations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Whereas, the analytical methods provide quick solution but simplified assumptions have been made <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>In order to overcome some of the limitations of standard meta-heuristic methods, some sensitivity indices are also adopted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. However, such indices based methods select top few nodes while ignoring the less sensitive nodes in optimization process. Improved variants are also suggested in literature to overcome some of the issues such as improved PSO, GA <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Improved Analytical (IA) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, Non-Dominated Sorting GA (NSGA-II) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, improved CSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Quasi-oppositional TLBO (QOTLBO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> etc. Moreover, some hybrid methods are also proposed such as hybrid analytical and PSO method <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, hybrid GA/PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, hybrid ant and bee colony optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> etc.</p><p>Recently, a new nature-inspired method has been introduced namely Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO) algorithm inspired from the herding behavior of elephants. The algorithm is developed by Gai-Ge Wang et al. in 2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> which has good convergence characteristics and potential to find the optimal solution. The algorithm is able to explore much better optimal solution than the many other nature inspired algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. To the authors' knowledge, the applicability of this algorithm has not yet explored for engineering optimization problems. Therefore, the work is the first systematic investigation of the EHO for engineering optimization problems.</p><p>The paper introduces a newly developed nature-inspired method, EHO to solve real-life engineering problems. The method is inspired from the herding behavior of elephants. Some improvements are also suggested in the original algorithm particularly to solve the practical multiobjective optimization problem. In addition, a MCDM approach is integrated with the proposed EHO to choose most compromising solution among various intermediate solutions encountered in multiobjective real-life problems. This further improves the performance of the meta-heuristic technique. An emerging real life, mixed integer, non-linear, non-convex, multiobjective ODERA problem is formulated to determine the optimal sites and sizes of different types of DERs to maximize the overall benefits of utility and consumers. The multiobjective optimization problem is solved using the proposed method for small to large-scale standard test distribution systems of 33-bus, 118-bus and 880-bus. The simulation results obtained by proposed method are compared with that of the similar methods available in the literature and found that the proposed technique is providing most compromising solutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. MULTIOBJECTIVE PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>In this section, a multiobjective ODERA problem is formulated comprising of multiple and different DER technologies aiming to optimize multiple and equally important objectives. In practice, demand is varying with time and the ODERA determined under varying demand may not be optimal; therefore, planning is done on peak or nominal loading of the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Therefore, the proposed DER planning problem is formulated for specified nominal load demand of the system. The considered objective functions, constraints and TOPSIS approach are explained in following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Objective functions</head><p>In practice, distribution companies have to achieve more than one objective. Therefore, following three important objectives are considered for ODERA in distribution systems.</p><p>1) Minimization of Power Loss: Traditionally, in vertical integrated power systems, maximum power loss is occurred in distribution systems during power delivery that certainly affects the annual revenue of an utility. It may be the primary objective of utilities to deliver power at minimum losses. Therefore, power loss minimization is considered as one of the objectives, which may be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">min f 1 = N i=1 N j=1 α ij (P i P j +Q i Q j )+β ij (Q i P j -P i Q j ) (1)</formula><p>where,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">α ij =r ij cos(δ i -δ j )/V i V j , β ij =r ij sin(δ i -δ j )/V i V j ; Here, N , P i , Q i , r ij , V i ,</formula><p>and δ i are representing total number of nodes in the system, real &amp; reactive power injections at ith node, resistance of branch between node i &amp; j, voltage magnitude and angle of ith node respectively 2) Minimization of Node Voltage Deviation: The modern power consumer is becoming more concerned about the quality of supply voltage. The node voltage deviation is the measure of voltage quality appeared across the system nodes. Therefore, node voltage regulation is an essential duty of the utilities to provide regulated node voltage profile across the system. In the proposed optimal DER integration model, node voltage regulation is considered as one of the objective functions and that is expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">min f 2 = N i=1 (V i -1) 2 (2)</formula><p>3) Maximization of Voltage Stability Index: The minimization of node voltage deviation is not a sufficient measure to define the security level of distribution systems. Therefore, Voltage Stability Index (VSI) is also adopted as one of the objective functions to maximize the Voltage Stability Margin (VSM) of the system. VSI is a measure of the system security that defines the ability of a node to maintain its voltage profile within the acceptable limits over various heavy loading conditions. The objective of an utility is to keep the VSI value of all branches near to unity for the secure operation of power networks. The VSI of branch connecting node i &amp; j can be expressed as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">V SI ij = V 4 j -4(P i r ij + Q i x ij )V 2 j -4(P i x ij -Q i r ij ) 2 (3)</formula><p>where, x ij represents the impedance of the branch connecting node i &amp; j. In order to improve the VSM of complete system, VSI of a branch that has minimum VSI value among all the system branches need to be maximized. Therefore, the proposed objective function for maximization of VSM can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">max f 3 = min V SI ij ∀ i, j<label>(4)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Constraints</head><p>The objectives functions presented in (1), ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>) are subjected to the following constraints.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P i = V i N j=1 V j Y ij cos(θ ij + δ j -δ i ) ∀ i Q i = -V i N j=1 V j Y ij sin(θ ij + δ j -δ i ) ∀ i<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">S DERi ≤ S M ax DER ∀ i (6) N i=1 σ i S DERi ≤ S P eak ∀ i (7) V M in ≤ V i ≤ V M ax ∀ i<label>(8)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">I ij ≤ I M ax ij ∀ i, j<label>(9)</label></formula><p>The constraints expressed in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">9</ref>) are representing the nodal power balance, maximum installation size of single DER, maximum DER penetration limit of the system, node voltage limits and feeders thermal limit constraints respectively. Where,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Y ij , θ ij , I ij &amp; I M ax ij</formula><p>, S M ax DER , σ i , S P eak , V M in and V M ax are representing the element of Y-bus matrix, impedance angle, current &amp; maximum allowable current limit of branch connecting node i &amp; j, maximum possible size of DER that can be installed at a single node, binary decision variable for DER installation at node i, peak demand of the system, minimum and maximum specified limits of node voltages respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Multiobjective Formulation using TOPSIS Approach</head><p>A multiobjective problem can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">optimize [f 1 (x), f 2 (x), f 3 (x), . . . , f n2 (x)]<label>(10)</label></formula><p>subjected to: x C where, f j (x) : R n → R is jth objective function, j = 1, 2, . . . , n 2 , n 2 &gt; 1 and C is the feasible search space.</p><p>As discussed, the TOPSIS approach is adopted to formulate and solve the multiobjective ODERA problems for distribution systems. The approach is based on Euclidean geometry in which two reference points are used to select the best compromising solution known as PIS and NIS. Therefore, the chosen alternative solution should be at the least Euclidean distance from PIS and highest from NIS. In this way, the solutions may found to be concentrated around their individual best solution which improves the solution quality of real-life multiobjective optimization problems.</p><p>The essential steps of TOPSIS approach to find the most compromising solution for proposed multiobjective problem are as follows.</p><p>Step-I: A normalized decision matrix is prepared to convert all dimensional attributes into non-dimensional attributes. The elements of the matrix can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">r ij = f ij n1 i=1 f 2 ij ∀ i n 1 &amp; j n 2<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where, n 1 and f ij are the number of alternatives and the value of ith alternate of jth objective respectively.</p><p>Step-II: A weighted normalized decision matrix may be constructed to provide weights to the objectives if needed. The step may be skipped if all objectives are equally important. The elements of the matrix are expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">v ij = w j × r ij ∀ i n 1 &amp; j n 2 .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where, w j is the weight of jth objective and n2 j=1 w j = 1.</p><p>Step-III: In this step PIS and NIS are determined which keep the best and worst solution of each individual objective respectively as given below.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">P IS = {v + 1 , v + 2 , v + 3 , . . . , v + n2 }<label>(13)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">N IS = {v - 1 , v - 2 , v - 3 , . . . , v - n2 }<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">v + j = max v ij ∀ i; if objective represents a benefit min v ij ∀ i; if objective represents a cost v - j = max v ij ∀ i; if objective represents a cost min v ij ∀ i; if objective represents a benefit</formula><p>Step-IV: In this step, Euclidean distances, d j+ and d j-are calculated for each alternative from P IS and N IS respectively.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">d + i = n2 j=1 (v ij -v + j ) 2 &amp; d - i = n2 j=1 (v ij -v - j ) 2 (15)</formula><p>Step-V: By using the Euclidean distances calculated in previous step, the Relative Closeness Index (RCI) is calculated for each alternative as given below.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">C + i = d - i d + i + d - i<label>(16)</label></formula><p>The alternative with highest RCI value will be selected as the most compromising solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. IMPROVED ELEPHANT HERDING OPTIMIZATION</head><p>The EHO algorithm is a recently developed nature inspired method proposed by Gai-Ge Wang et al., in 2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The algorithm is inspired from the herding behavior of elephants. The elephant researchers discovered that female elephants are securing their babies from hungry predators by communicating through the ground with seismic waves generated from the foot stomping and low frequency rambling of elephants. The discovery shows that elephants may be able to sense these vibrations through their feet and interpret them as warning signals of a distant danger <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>In nature, elephant is also considered as a social animal and the herd consists of several clans of female elephants and their calves. Each clan moves under the influence of a matriarch or a leader elephant. The female elephant (FE) use to live with their family groups whereas the male elephant (ME) separated when they grow up and live in contact with their family group using low frequency vibrations as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The no. of elephants in each clan may assumed to be equal. The group of matriarch holds the best solution in the herd of elephants while the worse solution is decoded from the position of the group of male elephants. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Basic EHO</head><p>In this paper, the herding behavior of elephants is mathematically modeled and divided into various steps as suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> Step-1 (Position Update): In this step, position of each elephant in different clans except the matriarch and male elephant that holds the best and worse solution in each clan respectively is updated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Z new,cj,i = Z cj,i + α(Z best,cj,i -Z cj,i ) × r<label>(17)</label></formula><p>where, z cj,i and z new,cj,i are the present and new positions of ith elephant in the cjth clan, α is the scale factor set between 0 to 1, z best,cj,i is the best position of ith elephant in cjth clan, r is the random number between [0 1].</p><p>Step-3 (Position update of fittest elephant of each clan): The position of fittest elephant, i.e., matriarch, is updated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">Z new,cj,i = β × Z center,cj Z center,cj = n i=1 Z cj,i /n z (18)</formula><p>where, i is the individual elephant and n z is total number of elephants in each clan, β is a scale factor between [0 1].</p><p>Step-3 (Separating the worst elephant individual): Now, the worst elephants individual or male elephants will be separated from their family groups. This is implemented by modifying the worst solution as</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">Z worst,cj,i = Z min + (Z max -Z min + 1) × rand<label>(19)</label></formula><p>where, Z worst,cj,i is the worst or matured ith male elephant in cjth clan. Z max and Z min are the maximum and minimum allowable boundary limits for the clan elephants.</p><p>Step-4 (Convergence):</p><p>Step-1 to 4 are repeated till the convergence criteria is attained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Limitations of basic EHO and Suggested Improvements</head><p>In this section, the limitations of the basic EHO are discussed and based on these, some improvements are also suggested.</p><p>1) Observation-I: In standard EHO, the position of fittest elephant leading the clan is updated by following the mean position or average information received by all elephants of that clan only, as expressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. The expression works satisfactorily for the benchmark functions. But, when applied for real-life problems, the results are not satisfactory. It may be due to the fact that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> the position of the matriarch is updated by following the mean response of the respective clan. Moreover, β in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>, randomly chosen between [0, 1], may further affect the position of the solution. This may result in poor fit solution which deteriorates the mean of the clan. As a cumulative effect of the heard may not be able to find the global best solution.</p><p>2) Suggested Improvement-I: In order to overcome the above limitation, it is suggested to update the position of matriarch elephants around the current best position as</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">Z new,cj,i = Z best,cj,i + β × Z center,cj<label>(20)</label></formula><p>Here, Z best,cj,i , is current best position attained so far by the leader elephants of all clans. This improves the mean of each clan and thereby the ability to find the global best solution.</p><p>3) Observation-II: According to separating operator used in the basic method, the male or worst elephants have to leave the group when they grow up. Therefore, the newly generated baby elephants will attain the randomly chosen positions so as to maintain the constant number of elephants in each clan as expressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. However, it is observed that the elephants should keep their babies near the stronger females in order to protect them from hungry predators.</p><p>4) Suggested Improvement-II: In order to overcome the above limitation, it is suggested that the newly generated babies should be allocated the position near to stronger female. Therefore, the newly generated babies will occupy the position near to leader of the respective clan.The modified equation is expressed as Z worst,cj,i = Z f itnesscj <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> such that Z f itness,cj = µ × Z local,cj ; where, µ is a random proximity factor between [0.9-1.1] and Z local,cj is the local best position of the elephant of cjth clan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. ODERA USING PROPOSED IMPROVED AND MULTI-OBJECTIVE EHO (IMOEHO)</head><p>In this section, the implementation of proposed IMOEHO is discussed for ODERA in distribution systems. In order to solve the proposed ODERA problem using improved EHO, the herd of elephants has to be modeled into some set of mathematical equations as discussed in Section III. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the structure of a herd used in proposed algorithm that comprised of DER nodes and their corresponding capacities. The first half of the structure contains the DER nodes and second half contains the DER sizes which are used as the decision variables in the algorithm and analogous to the positions of elephants. Here, M represents the pre-specified number of DERs, which is assumed to be installed in a given distribution network. The of an individual is analogous to the number of clans EHO i.e. 2M . As discussed, the proposed DER accommodation model is a complex multiobjective problem, which generates numerous solutions thus may require a powerful MCDM approach to select the most compromising solution among numerous competitive solutions provided by the optimization method. Therefore, the TOPSIS approach, discussed in Section II is adopted here and effectively integrated with improved EHO to assist it at every step to select the most competitive solution. The essential steps of proposed hybrid approach are as follows.</p><p>Step-1: Initialize 'n 1 ' population of elephant herd randomly.</p><p>Step-2: Calculate the values of 'n 2 ' objective functions corresponding to each individual expressed in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and arrange these in a decision matrix D as given below.</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">D =      f 11 f 12 f 13 . . . f 1n2 f 21 f 22 f 23 . . . f 2n2 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . f n11 f n12 f n13 . . . f n1n2     <label>(22)</label></formula><p>Step-3: Apply the TOPSIS approach expressed in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">11</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">16</ref>) on decision matrix D and choose a most compromising solution and its corresponding DERs sites and sizes on the basis of calculated RCI values.

In order to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of proposed improved IMOEHO for multiobjective ODERA problem, it is implemented on three standard test distribution systems of 33-bus <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, 118-bus <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and 880-bus <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> radial distribution systems. To investigate the effect of different DER technologies, various test cases are framed and solved using proposed IMOEHO. In this work, DERs are not supposed to regulate the voltage of the system therefore these are considered as negative loads as suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Due to weakly meshed configuration of distribution networks, backward/forward sweep method is used for load flow calculations. The control parameters used in proposed IMOEHO for both the study systems are as follows: population size = 50, maximum iteration count, T max = 100, α=0.5 and β=0.1. The problem is formulated in MATLAB environment and simulated on Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-4150 CPU@3.50GHz with 4GB RAM. The simulation results and performance of proposed IMOEHO is compared and discussed with different optimization methods available in literature for different case studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Study System-1</head><p>In this study, the ODERA problem is formulated and solved for a benchmark 33-bus radial distribution system. It is a 12.66 kV system with nominal real and reactive power demand of 3.715 MW and 2.300 kVAr respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In order to compare the performance of proposed method with the well established optimization techniques in existing literature, the simulation results obtained are compared and analyzed for same cases, following test cases are investigated as suggested in the literature.</p><p>1) Three DERs Operated at Unity Power Factors (UPFs) [Case-I]: In this case, three DERs are selected to accommodate optimally in the system on three different nodes as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The simulation results obtained by the proposed approach are compared with different existing methods in literature and are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref>. The table contains optimal DER nodes and capacities along with the values of objective functions, DER penetration, percentage loss reduction and average CPU time. The comparison shows that the proposed method provides the most compromising solution for multiobjective ODERA problems at adequate DER penetration as compared to existing methods. The bold values in the table represent the most compromising solutions among compared methods. The approach provides slightly more power loss reduction as compared to methods presented <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. It has been observed that GA <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, hybrid GA/PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and TLBO <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> are unable to install the required amount of DER penetration to achieve the same goal. Whereas, the TLBO and QOTLBO of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> are installing higher amount of DER penetration as compared to proposed approach. Moreover, average CPU time is also less for proposed method.</p><p>2) Four DERs Operated at UPFs [Case-II]: In this case, four DERs are assumed to be installed in the system at four different sites as suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. All the DERs are assumed to be operated at UPF. The simulation results obtained by the algorithm are compared with the methods available in the literature for same case and summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref>. The comparison shows that the proposed method provides the most compromising solution as compared to GA, PSO, hybrid GA/PSO and IMOHS for the same case study at lesser DER penetration.</p><p>3) Three DERs Operated at 0.85 Lagging Power Factor (LPF) [Case-III]: In previous cases, DERs are not allowed to provide the reactive power support to the system in order to optimize the considered objectives. In this case, three DERs operated at 0.85 LPF are considered to be accommodated in the system to provide reactive power support in the system as suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The simulation results obtained for this case using proposed method and the techniques available in literature i.e. analytical, LSFSA and IA are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref>. The comparison shows that the proposed IMOEHO provides the most compromising solution for multiobjective ODERA problems as compared to the methods presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. It may be observed that the method provides slightly higher loss reduction while improving the node voltage profile and stability as compared to these methods. However, the existing methods are not able to install the adequate amount of DER penetration.</p><p>It may be observed that the case-III provides most compromising solution as compared to case-I &amp; II since DERs operated at LPF also provide the reactive power support to the system which improves the system performance significantly as compared to the UPF DERs. The voltage profile of the system is significantly improved for all cases with respect to the base case as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. However, the node voltages are near to unity in case-I and III. In case-II, the voltage regulation is slightly poor as lesser DER penetration is accommodated. In this case study, an 11 kV large-scale benchmark test system, 118-bus radial distribution system is adopted for ODERA. The nominal real and reactive power demand of the system are 22.71 MW and 17.04 MVAr respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. For the system, following cases are investigated as suggested in 1) Seven DERs Operated at UPF [Case-I]: In this case seven DERs operated at UPF are considered to optimally accommodate at seven different nodes in the system as suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The simulation results obtained by the proposed IMOEHO are compared with SA, TLBO and QOTLBO as presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">II</ref>. The comparison shows that the proposed IMOEHO provides the most compromising optimal solution for multi-criteria ODERA problems for the system. It may be observed that IMOEHO is significantly reduced the power loss with lesser DER penetration as compared the algorithm presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>2) Seven DERs operated at 0.85 LPF [Case-II]: As discussed in previous case study, the DERs operated at LPF improves the system performance more effectively as compared to the DERs operated at UPF. Therefore, seven DERs operated at 0.85 LPF are considered to optimally accommodate at different sites in the system as suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The simulation results obtained by proposed IMOEHO are summarized and compared with SA <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">II</ref>. The comparison shows that the proposed approach significantly reduces the power loss while improving the node voltage profile and voltage stability of the system. The voltage profile of the system for different cases is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. The figure shows that IMOEHO improved the node voltage profile significantly as compared to the base case. The case-II provides better node voltage regulation as compared to case-I due reactive power support of LPF based DERs. The case study considered a large-scale MV distribution system in order to examine the robust performance of proposed approach for large and complex systems. The system is comprised of 880 nodes, 7 feeder, 900 branches, 873 sectionalizing switches and 27 tie-lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The nominal real and reactive power demand of the system are 124.87 MW and 74.36 MVAr respectively along with the real and reactive power losses on nominal loading are 1496.44 kW and 1396.494 kVAr respectively as verified from <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. To the authors' knowledge, the optimal allocation of DERs is not yet achieved for this system in literature. Therefore, pre-specified number of DERs which assumed to be installed at different locations is not known. In order to identify the approximate optimal number of DERs, the number of DERs is varied from 10 to 25 for power loss minimization only and found that 15 DERs are providing most compromising solution. Therefore, 15 DERs of equal size are assumed to be installed in the system.</p><p>Fifteen DERs Operated at UPF [Case-I]: In this case, fifteen DERs operated at UPF are assumed to be installed at fifteen different nodes in the system. The simulation results obtained are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">III</ref> which shows that significant reduction is achieved in power loss and node voltage deviation while improving the voltage stability of the system as compared to the base case. It may be observed that the adequate DER penetration is obtain for large-scale system also. However, the CPU time is increased due to large number of nodes in the system. The comparison of results is not possible with the literature since, no ODERA problem has solved for the system.</p><p>2) Fifteen DERs Operated at 0.85 LPF [Case-II]: The reactive power support plays a crucial role in large distribution systems to provide a smooth Volt/VAr control operations. In order to investigate the role of reactive power support provided by DERs in the large-scale distribution systems, fifteen DERs operated at 0.85 LPF are considered to be deployed in the system. The simulation results of multiobjective ODERA  problem obtained for the study using IMOEHO are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">III</ref>. The simulations shows that the VAr support from the DERs is significantly improved the system performance in terms of reduction of power loss, node voltage deviation while improving the voltage stability of the system as compared to previous case. The voltage profiles of the system observed in the base case, case-I and case-II are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. The figure shows that the proposed approach is also proved to be promising to improve the node voltage profile of larger system. Besides, the reactive power support provided from DERs provides better voltage regulation as compared to UPF DGs.</p><p>From the simulation results and discussions, it may be observed that proposed IMOEHO is a powerful nature-inspired optimization technique to solve the complex real-life multiobjective optimization problems. The extensive simulations carried out on three different benchmark distribution systems from small to large scale, proved that the proposed IEHO is found to be very effective to solve complex DER optimization problems as compared to GA, PSO, hybrid GA/PSO, SA, TLBO, QOTLBO, IMOHS etc. Moreover, the effective integration of TOPSIS approach with IEHO provides inspiring results for multiobjective optimization problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Performance Analysis of Proposed IMOEHO</head><p>In this section, the performance of improved EHO and IMOEHO are compared and analyzed. It may be noted that the searching performance analysis of multiobjective methods is substantially more complex as compared to single objective methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Therefore, to illustrate the limitations of existing EHO and to validate the suggested improvements, a single objective problem has to be investigated separately, by ignoring the effect of TOPSIS approach. Later, the performance analysis of proposed approach is also carried out for multiobjective problem. 1) Performance Analysis of Improved EHO: In order to investigate the contributions of each improvement suggested in IEHO, the DER allocation problem is solved for power loss minimization only. For the purpose, study system-1 is reconsidered and a comparison of both best and mean convergence using EHO and proposed variants of IEHO is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>. It can be observed from the figure that in standard EHO, the herd of elephants is deceived the goal as can be clearly observed from the mean fitness. It may also be observed that when the suggested improvement-I only is applied, the herd is guided towards the global optima by continuously improving the mean fitness, as position of the best elephant is now updated by random walk near current best position. Similarly, when the suggested improvement-II only is applied, the fluctuations in the mean fitness are reduced. Since, the new calf, replacing the worst elephant, is now placed near leader of the respective clan. This may also be observed that these suggestions when applied individually are not capable to find the best solution as obtained by the proposed IEHO where both the improvements are simultaneously applied. Moreover, the results obtained after 50 independent trial runs of each of these algorithms are presented for study. For the sample results obtained, various statistical parameters such as best fitness, worst fitness, mean fitness, standard deviation (SD), mean distance from the best (MFB) and average CPU time are determined and presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">IV</ref>. MFB is a better indicator than coefficient of variation to judge the performance of swarm intelligence based algorithms like EHO. Smaller the value of these indices better will be the solution quality. The table shows that the each suggested improvement effectively enhances the performance of IEHO. In particular, mean fitness of the sampled results is found to be identical using IEHO-I and IEHO, but SD and MFB improved to satisfactory levels in IEHO by virtue of suggested improvement-II. Overall, the performance of IEHO is significantly enhanced than standard EHO algorithm at the cost of insignificant additional CPU time. 2) Performance Analysis of IMOEHO: As discussed that the searching performance analysis of multiobjective methods is different from the single objective problem solving methods. Therefore, in literature, various searching performance evaluating indices are suggested for multiobjective optimization techniques such as convergence matric, spacing matric (SP-matric), diversity matrix, relative convergence matrix (Cmatric), error ratio, generational distance etc. In this paper, SP-matric is adopted to analyze the performance of proposed method because it reveals the quality distribution of Pareto solution sets obtained by the algorithm. It is defined as the distance variance of each solution from its closest neighbor and expressed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>  Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> shows that the Pareto solutions generated by IMOEHO for all systems are more evenly distributed in very small region since the upper and lower boundaries of the box are very close to each other. The box plot validated that the proposed approach provides more evenly distributed Paretosolutions for larger systems which are generally difficult to obtain by standard algorithms. It is the attributes of TOPSIS approach which are responsible to distribute the solutions evenly. Therefore, it may be found that TOPSIS approach effectively selects the most compromising solution for multiobjective problems extracted by the improved variant of EHO as compared to GA, PSO, SA, hybrid GA/PSO and IMOHS etc. presented in the paper.</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">S = 1 n 1 -1 n1 i=1 ( d -d i ) 2<label>(23)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">d i = min</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, a new multiobjective optimization framework is developed for optimal DER allocation in distribution systems using TOPSIS approach. A new nature-inspired method, EHO, is introduced to optimize the formulated multiobjective ODERA problem. Some modifications are also suggested in the algorithm to overcome some of its limitations. In order to validate the effectiveness of proposed methods, it is applied on small to large-scale distribution systems and the obtained results are found to be better and most compromising when compared with other similar work available in the literature. Moreover, effect of proposed modifications in EHO is demonstrated by applying them separately on 33-bus system for power loss minimization. Finally, the quality of Pareto solutions obtained by IMOEHO are analysed, SP-matrices are calculated and multiobjective characteristics are discussed for all the case studies. The obtained results show that the proposed approach is found to be effective for optimizing real life complex multiobjective optimization problems.</p><p>The work reveals that the proposed approach have some inherent potential to solve multiobjective problems. Therefore, it may be implemented to solve other complex multiobjective problems and challenges encountered in industry practices.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>LOC- 1 Fig. 2 :</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Fig. 2: Individuals' structure used in proposed IMOEHO.</figDesc></figure>
