<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The process knowledge base is the key module in intelligent process design, it determines the intelligence degree of the design system and affects the quality of product design. However, traditional process knowledge base construction is non-automated, time consuming and requires much manual work, which is not sufficient to meet the demands of the modern manufacturing mode. Moreover, the knowledge base often adopts a single knowledge representation, and this may lead to ambiguity in the meaning of some knowledge, which will affect the quality of the process knowledge base. To overcome the above problems, an automatic construction framework for the process knowledge base in the field of machining based on knowledge graph (KG) is introduced. First, the knowledge is classified and annotated based on the function-behavior-states (FBS) design method. Second, a knowledge extraction framework based on BERT-BiLSTM-CRF is established to perform the automatic knowledge extraction of process text. Third, a knowledge representation method based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is established, forming three types of knowledge representation with the KG as the main, production rules and twodimensional data linked list as a supplement. In addition, to overcome the redundancy in the knowledge fusion stage, a hybrid algorithm based on an improved edit distance and attribute weighting is built. Finally, a prototype system is developed, and quality analysis is carried out. Compared with the F values of BiLSTM-CRF and CNN-BiLSTM-CRF, that of the proposed extraction method in the machining domain is increased by 7.35% and 3.87%, respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The process knowledge base is the core component of intelligent process design, and it determines the degree of intelligence of the design system and affects the quality of process reasoning. In the information age, the development of modern products is facing unprecedented challenges. For modern products in the machinery field and other industries, there is enormous pressure from the market in terms of demands for shorter lead time and stricter quality requirement <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In practice, this means that products of increasing complexity have to be developed in a shorter time frame <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. As an important part of the modern intelligent decision-making system for process, the process knowledge base is also a bridge connecting product design and product manufacturing in the modern manufacturing industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. It directly affects the organizational efficiency of production, the product cost and the production cycle of an enterprise by integrating the knowledge and experience of various interdisciplinary experts. In addition, by sharing, exchanging, and reusing design knowledge in a distributed resource environment, the process knowledge base can make full use of a great deal of the tacit knowledge of enterprises and can then configure and optimize the human and manufacturing resources of enterprises accordingly in order to minimize resource waste and time loss during engineering design <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Therefore, we think that in the intelligent manufacturing environment, the life cycle of manufactured products should not be calculated only in a narrow sense, and the construction time of the knowledge base should also be included in a broad product life cycle. For this reason, how to construct a high-quality process knowledge base in a shorter period of time is essential for achieving shorter cycle development and process design of complex products in modern manufacturing models.</p><p>However, the application of a knowledge base in product manufacturing is still considered a challenging task for the following reasons: On one hand, product manufacturing is one of the most timeconsuming and knowledge-intensive tasks across the modern product development process, which involves a series of decision-making activities. Most of these activities are highly dependent upon personal knowledge accumulated from the previous projects over a long period of time and enterprise equipment resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. Because format diversity and heterogeneity of manufacturing-related knowledge among different service providers (CATIA/UG/PROE), effective sharing and reuse of these knowledge become quite difficult. As a result, traditional construction of a knowledge base often need to be obtained by manual methods, which is time consuming and labor intensive, resulting in difficulty in meeting the requirements of automatic construction of knowledge base <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Studies have shown that to acquire supporting information from different sources, engineers spend approximately 40% of their time searching and reorganizing raw data <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Therefore, if the automated construction of the knowledge base cannot be completed, a lot of time will be spent in the preparation phase to manually create the knowledge base, which greatly increases the product manufacturing cycle. On the other hand, the knowledge applied to automatic process decision-making system is more complicated than other applications such as fault detection, and it is difficult for a single knowledge representation form (ontology, triples, etc.) to properly represent the existing design knowledge. The lack of formal representations of the existing design knowledge makes it extremely difficult for even experienced design engineers to trace past design routines. As a consequence, inefficient retrieval of the design knowledge (e.g., with respect to the format, type, and content), as well as incorrect interpretations (due to the specific domain), can lead to cost-and time-intensive iterations in product development, rendering the knowledge base ineffective for practical use <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Hence, in order to solve the above problems, the focus in this work is developing a framework for the knowledge based engineering system that supports the automated construction of a knowledge base and related design activities. The main contributions of this research are threefold. First, we propose an architecture for automatically constructing a knowledge base in the machining field. The novelty of this architecture is that it allows the automatic extraction of manufacturing knowledge from existing simulation models and process documents. Second, based on the function-behavior-states (FBS) design framework, various data and knowledge types in the machining field are summarized and discussed, and the knowledge representation method is judged by the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation algorithm. Finally, a knowledge extraction system based on the browser/server (B/S) architecture is developed, which not only performs feature/part process reasoning in the application but also supports process engineers in seamlessly integrating data topics in other Web environments; this system can assist with other manufacturing stages, technologies and application areas in product development.</p><p>The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 reviews the related work of knowledge base automatic construction technology. The overall construction methods and framework of a knowledge base for the machining field are introduced in Section 3. Section 4 focuses on the knowledge extraction model in the machining field. The choice of the knowledge representation scheme based on a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation algorithm is described in Section 5. Section 6 focuses on the elimination of redundancy in the knowledge base by improving the similarity judgement of the editing distance in the knowledge fusion stage. A prototype system is developed, and the application and extraction effects of the system are discussed in Section 7. Section 8 presents the conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related research</head><p>As the brain of a modern intelligent system, the knowledge base provides a large knowledge reserve and support for intelligent information processing. It has been widely used in the fields of medicine, finance and agriculture and has very broad prospects. In recent years, the automatic construction of a domain knowledge base has become a popular issue and has attracted many scholars to conduct research. This section mainly reviews related work on the automatic construction of a knowledge base: natural language processing, knowledge representation and the application of knowledge bases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Natural language processing</head><p>As an interdisciplinary research field, natural language processing (NLP) involves language and speech processing, human language technology, computational linguistics, and speech recognition and synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.With the advent of the information age and the rapid development of computing technology, NLP has played an important role in various applications, including dialogue agents and dialogue systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, machine translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, knowledge mining and reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and search engines <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Although NLP has made great progress in the general field, its application in the machining field still faces great challenges. Due to the complexity of mechanical proprietary entities and the difficulty of defining feature boundaries, the traditional knowledge base construction methods in the machining field have low accuracy, are time consuming and require much manual work, which completely fails to meet the requirements of automated construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Early research on NLP tended to focus on word processing (including representation and calculation). Regular expressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, finite state automata <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, sensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the N-gram model <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, part-of-speech tags <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the hidden Markov model <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and maximum entropy model <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> are the most widely used models for dealing with vocabulary-related issues. After better solutions were found for vocabulary processing, scholars carried out related research on grammar processing. For grammar processing, early researchers used common tools such as formal grammars and treebanks <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. With the deepening of research, probability models and formalisms based on attribute constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> have become more widely used. The current research on NLP focuses on semantic and pragmatic processing. First-order logic, semantic networks, concept dependency graphs, etc. are used to represent semantic information <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Recently, with the development of artificial intelligence technology, machine learning technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> and statistical learning technology have been introduced into NLP. Through a co-occurrence matrix and singular value decomposition, the vocabulary is transformed into a dense vector. Word2vec, developed by Google <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, was the earliest word vector representation. Through Continuous Bag-of-Words Model (CBOW) or Continuous Skip-gram Model (Skip-gram), words can be vectorized based on context <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. However, Word2vec considers only adjacent contexts. Although it can be established quickly and directly, its ability to differentiate semantically is limited. Because of this deficiency, GloVe <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> was proposed; it uses global vectors to represent words and can consider local and global information in vector training through global co-occurrence matrices. Although GloVe is more powerful than Word2vec, it is difficult to adapt it to different environments. To address this problem, researchers have proposed employing multiple long short-term memory (LSTM) stacked neural models to learn morphological features at different levels (ELMo) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. This method synthetically considers the needs of disambiguation, parts of speech and grammar. In addition, it can be easily extended to specific applications through pre-training and fine-tuning. However, due to the characteristics of LSTM, training the ELMo model is a sequential process. Therefore, the earlier contexts have a higher priority than the later contexts. Subsequently, the BERT model was proposed to learn morphemes from multiple attention nodes through a two-way encoder. The BERT model has been extensively validated and can be directly used to extract morpheme features from language texts through pre-training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Knowledge representation</head><p>Expert knowledge extracted from documents by text mining or recorded in expert interviews with experienced simulation engineers has to be formalized so that it can be provided in a knowledge base <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The purpose of exploring knowledge representations is to store knowledge in a computer-readable structured representation and express its meaning most appropriately. In addition, establishing an effective knowledge representation model to achieve sharing and integration between enterprises has always been the focus of knowledge management research in engineering design. The latest knowledge representation models can be classified as described below.</p><p>The research on knowledge representation models can be traced back to the 1990s. Early research mainly focused on function-based knowledge representation models. The most representative model is Gero's functional behavior structure (FBS) model, which describes the main components involved in engineering design activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The FBS model combines the three main components of design in order to effectively combine the design model with the knowledge of design experts. Similar models include the functional representation (FR) model and structural behavior function (SBF) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>, which have also attracted the application of many scholars <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Later, influenced by process-oriented thinking, scholars discovered that design knowledge can be described using components of the design process in the form of linked process models with associated data and information. For instance, design resources can be defined at different design stages according to different manufacturing targets and then associated with various types of production planning knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. However, for complex fields, especially the machining field, a process-oriented knowledge representation is difficult to expand and reuse, and its accuracy is often low, which makes it difficult to use in practical applications. Because of this deficiency, scholars have tried using object-oriented knowledge representations. A typical example is Modelica, which uses classes to define the data and behavior of objects. Then, the classes in Modelica use domains and equations to represent the solution result and the solution process, respectively. In this way, the rules, equations and documents in the database can be converted into multi-domain knowledge. Poorkiany et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> introduced an object diagram that integrates SolidWorks, Word, Excel and Wiki pages to capture, construct and access design principles during product and tool design. In addition, Grabowik et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> used object-oriented methods to express knowledge.</p><p>Recently, in Paulheim <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, ontology was defined as a clear specification of (shared) conceptualizations. It defines a general understanding of a domain in a machine-readable way. In addition to its machine-readable form, the benefit of ontology is a unique understanding of an explicit representation of knowledge, which is achieved through formal and semantic definitions of terms and axioms. Beside, due to its linguistic nature, ontology is particularly suitable for mapping knowledge obtained from natural language documents. On the basis of ontology, the knowledge graph proposed by Google becomes more promising, and it can encode the semantic information of knowledge entities in consideration of their physical connection strengths, dependencies and causality <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. This idea is used in the construction of various knowledge bases, such as DBpedia, YAGO, Freebase, Wikidata, Spark, Google's Knowledge Vault, Microsoft's Satori and Facebook's entity graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Overall, the knowledge graph provides a new way to represent knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Construction of knowledge base in the machining field</head><p>The above research has introduced two key technologies in the automatic construction of knowledge base: natural language processing and formal representation of knowledge. In order to more accurately realize the automatic construction framework of the knowledge base in the machining field, it is also necessary to explore and review the construction of the knowledge base in the knowledge based engineering (KBE) system by scholars. In the field of machining process, Shen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> adopted EXPRESS language to design the knowledge base and application framework of welding data task model in detail. The knowledge model includes information on accurate geometry, dimension and welding requirement, which is enough to support intelligent process planning in robot welding field. However, due to the lack of semantic description and consideration in EXPRESS model language, knowledge sharing and data exchange are still hindered to a certain extent. Wan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> uses ontology to build domain knowledge base, and proposesd a knowledge-based maintenance planning system. The system adopted Adaptation-Guided Retrieval (AGR), Case-based Reasoning (CBR) and semantic description as retrieval methods, which improved the effectiveness in managing structured and unstructured knowledge over traditional engineering data management systems. Nevertheless, it does not take into account the knowledge that are not or cannot be represented in this format, so it has limitations on the singular mapping in case retrieval. In addition, Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> proposed an ontology-based machining process knowledge representation model for a feature-based machining operation (such as turning or milling), thereby constructing a machining knowledge base. Eum et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> proposed an ontology-based process planning knowledge modeling method. This method utilizes relevant attributes to match the knowledge of features, machining methods, and machining capabilities, and it can perform knowledge-based selection of corresponding machining methods for multi-axis machining features. However, these studies are more focused on using limited methods to build knowledge bases, which lack a framework for automated construction of knowledge bases. With the development of ontology technology, Helgoson and Kalhori <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> proposed a conceptual knowledge model which includes an adoption of the methodology of knowledge acquisition (MOKA) and contains the activities as to identify, justify, capture, formalize, package, and activate for sharing and integration of knowledge in process planning to increase the level of efficiency, reliability, and productivity in process planning process. Liang <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> proposed a new AM OntoProc knowledge model based on MOKA, which could construct a process planning knowledge base in assisted additive manufacturing (AM). But, the system does not fully consider the manufacturing data exchange and semantic analysis in the knowledge model. In recent research based on the knowledge base in the KBE system, Sormaz <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> used a novel foundation ontologies (upper-level) to construct a manufacturing process planning knowledge base model, which can realize the interoperability with other upper-layer manufacturing ontology and the process planning design case of prism parts in the cloud manufacturing environment. Nevertheless, the knowledge type of the system is mainly based on the upper ontology and semantic rules, there is still room for research on the representation and complete semantic integration of process knowledge which is not suitable for ontology representation. In addition, with the deep research and successful application of knowledge graph technology in recent years, many scholars have constructed knowledge bases by using knowledge graphs. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> proposed an extraction method based on the semantic distance of subgraphs and constructed a knowledge base in the field of metal materials by using knowledge graphs. Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> proposed a knowledge graph-driven assembly process generation and evaluation method for complex components, which provides assembly decision-making support for the evaluation method of interference detection of assembly sequence based on point cloud assembly feature recognition. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> aimed to address the difficulty that process knowledge is difficult to reuse and share, and a knowledge base in the field of machining was constructed by using knowledge graphs to represent process knowledge in a unified way. Kertkidkachorn et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> proposed a rule-based and similarity-based method by using knowledge graphs in the T2KG framework to complete the construction of the knowledge base. Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> presented a unified knowledge graph-driven production resource allocation approach, which fully integrated the complex data of workshop resources and realized the rapid decision-making for resource allocation in the manufacturing field.</p><p>In summary, although these KBE systems have made many attempts to capture process planning knowledge in various domains, very few researches actually focused on developing an automated model for capturing process planning knowledge, which is independent of domains. Most of the literature utilizes limited and manually created ontology or knowledge graph structures to obtain, capture and formalize simulation knowledge, and an automatic framework for constructing a knowledge base to obtain target-oriented process knowledge in mechanical product design is lacking. In short, these developed systems do not automatically acquire knowledge from text-based documents. In addition, the knowledge representation form adopted by most systems is often single; that is, a knowledge representation form is used to express all process knowledge. However, regardless of whether knowledge graph technology based on triples or ontology technology, it cannot accurately and appropriately express every piece of knowledge. For example, considering "When turning the step shaft, in order to ensure rigid turning, the larger-diameter part should be turned first, and then the smaller-diameter part". In this textual knowledge resource, it is evident that the triple representation of the knowledge graph cannot accurately express this knowledge. Therefore, because of the deficiencies in the abovementioned research, this paper proposes a method of automatically constructing a knowledge base for the machining field. The innovation of this method is to allow the automatic extraction of manufacturing knowledge from existing process documents as well as to modify and expand text and data mining methods to automate knowledge acquisition. In addition, three knowledge representation methods are used to comprehensively judge the knowledge representation through the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation algorithm to realize the sharing and integration between enterprises in knowledge management and automatically construct the knowledge base in the machining field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Automatic construction framework for the machining knowledge base</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Classification of process knowledge</head><p>The classification of process knowledge directly affects the quality of the knowledge base. To ensure the rapid and accurate acquisition of different types of process knowledge in the process of automatic knowledge base construction, the process knowledge is divided into the following three categories according to the knowledge classification method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>:</p><p>(1) Rule-based process knowledge From the perspective of rule reasoning, rule-based knowledge is the basis of process planning. It is mainly derived from process design manuals, various engineering standards, expert experience and knowledge, and it is the set of correct knowledge that has been verified. At present, it mainly relies on manual summary. Examples include the selection rules of machining methods (face before the hole, first rough and then refined, etc.). This knowledge has important guiding significance for machining process decision-making.</p><p>(2) Same-property process template knowledge The same-property process template knowledge is based on the similarity of the set and process content, and it is generated by gathering and classifying the processing technology of typical parts, features and local structures. For example, for the end face of grey cast iron, if the machining accuracy is level 6 and the surface roughness is 6.3, then the recommended machining method is rough machining.</p><p>(3) Personalized process instance knowledge Personalized process instance knowledge is mainly based on objective facts and descriptive process knowledge generated by describing mechanical entities or enterprise equipment. For example, the maximum turning diameter of the C630 ordinary lathe is 630 mm, the maximum workpiece length is 3000*4000 mm, the main motor power is 11 kw, the machine width is 1380 mm, and the height is 1710 mm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Knowledge labeling based on FBS</head><p>For the field of machining, the key information of knowledge extraction is more on the functional level, since the key elements are assumed to be the activities (functions) that the artefact must perform to achieve its desired outputs. Studying functions as independent entities allows abstraction from particular technical solutions and therefore constitutes a compelling design strategy. Moreover, functions capture both the physical action that produces the output and the desired goal.</p><p>In this paper, we adopt the following definitions of the key components of the FBS ontology. Some of these definitions can be found in original works by Umeda et al. and by Gero; others have been derived from works on qualitative physics <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> and from related works <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> that complete the FBS framework. According to the above research foundation and the processing of patent documents in Fantoni <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, machining domain knowledge documents can be classified into entity tags, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Functions are interpretations of physical behaviors according to the user's goals. While Umeda et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> define functions as ''descriptions of behavior recognized by a human through abstraction in order to utilize it'', Gero <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> describes them as the motivation for the product existence or, more generally, ascribes them to teleology (what the object is for). Therefore, the purposes and motivations of the machining field included in the top-level function framework in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> are mainly divided into three entity labels: goals, needs and functional requirements.</p><p>Behaviors are the "physical phenomena" that cause a change in the ''states'' of a system. Both Hirschberg and Manning <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and Russo and Montecchi <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> introduced Physical Effects into this view. In our view, behavior is an equation described in natural language (belonging to physics, chemistry, mechanics, etc.) to describe the evolution of a system (machining field). Therefore, under the framework of behavior, the entity tags in the machining field are divided into three types: physical events, behaviors and interactions. To facilitate understanding, a few arrows are added from the entity tag class to the abstract instance in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, and the FBS framework can be better understood through an explanation of this abstract instance. For example, the abstract examples of physical event labels refer to axioms and theorems. Specific examples are the Joule effect, Coulomb friction law, Hertz contact, and other terms that imply structure and behavioral information.</p><p>The state level is relatively easy to understand, and its abstract examples are consistent with common objects in the machining field. It is worth noting that to allow the computer to attain a better extraction effect, this paper distinguishes the Attributes entity tag and Properties entity tag. On the one hand, we prefer the term "Attributes" to be defined as ''the specific characteristics of a single part of the product", such as the length, width and maximum cutting length. On the other hand, we define "Properties" as the chemical, physical, mechanical, biological, etc. properties of the material the product is composed of (e. g. the Young's modulus, resistance to acid or flame, transparency to certain light frequencies, thermal or electrical conductivity and porosity). According to the label classification in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the specific labeling method is as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>According to the above definition of machining process classification  and annotation, this paper proposes a framework for the automatic construction of a machining domain knowledge base. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the overall process of the automatic construction of the machining domain knowledge base, which includes three core steps:</p><p>Step 1: Knowledge extraction. First, in a large number of process text documents, a method based on multi-neural collaboration is used to extract knowledge, and the extracted knowledge is classified accordingly through tags, which are divided into three categories: rule-based process knowledge, same-property process template knowledge and personalized process instance knowledge.</p><p>Step 2: Knowledge representation based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation: Since the knowledge graph cannot accurately represent each type of process knowledge, this paper uses the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation algorithm to select a process knowledge representation scheme to determine the best representation of each type of process knowledge and finally obtain a preliminary process knowledge base.</p><p>Step 3: Knowledge fusion. Due to the wide range of knowledge sources, the knowledge base constructed according to the two steps above has high redundancy, so it is necessary to use latent semantic analysis, similarity calculations and attribute weighting to eliminate redundancy in the knowledge. First, the entity triples in the preliminary knowledge base are mapped with the Prot?g? ontology library, and then the semantic web rule language (SWRL) is used to represent the empirical rule knowledge. Finally, the data layer is instantiated to construct the final knowledge base.</p><p>In order to allow readers to better understand the model, the mathematical representation of this manuscript is presented. The definition of the notations used in the knowledge extraction framework is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p></div>

At the same time, in view of the problem that current scholars cannot accurately express process knowledge, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation algorithm is used to determine the appropriate expression form of the extracted knowledge, which better addresses the problem that triples cannot properly represent some knowledge in the machining fields.</p></div>

If the information extraction method is used directly, it is difficult to obtain satisfactory knowledge extraction results. To this end, consistent with the NLP processing in the general field, the author has carried out preprocessing on the data text. The specific steps are as follows:</p><p>Step 1: It is necessary to check whether the craft text is a meaningful language before text processing. If it is, different languages should be treated in different ways. So the natural language recognition tool called Langid is used. The accuracy of Langid is higher but the speed is slightly slower. Moreover, ISO 639-1 was set in the system as the language coding standard. For more accurate identification, the team also added a programming language test, whose reference sample is Linguist in Github.</p><p>Step 2: Sentence segmentation/Part-of-speech tagging. The Jieba word segmentation tool was used in the system, which supports three word segmentation modes, supports traditional Chinese, and supports custom dictionaries. In addition, the system uses SnowNLP and PkuSeg as auxiliary tools to make the tagging more accurate.</p><p>Step 3: The general situation in the process text is still considered, that is, it cannot confirm whether there is sensitive information in the data set. Therefore, the Cherry classifier was used to screen the data through secondary screening to prevent the model from deteriorating. Among them, thresholds and logical structures are added to ensure the accuracy of the model.</p><p>In addition, the system has made reasoning judgments about labels in the text of the craft document whose paragraph is within 128 words. From a technical perspective, regularization tool in the system was used to process and split the sentence, whose split identifier is the Chinese period. For the second case, if the knowledge text paragraph exceeds 128 words, the period will be used for regular segmentation, and the system will recognize the redundant sentence as the next sentence. Moreover, for paragraphs with character length of less than 128 words, the system will adopt a conventional processing method: Filling the The similarity threshold in the edit distance algorithm</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">function(i, j)</formula><p>The cost of changing a String to make i equalj</p></div>

Since the smallest-input unit of the process text in the machining field is a sentence, the recognition unit is also a sentence, and the sentence itself is invalid for knowledge extraction, so this article sets the sentence feature to 0. Therefore, it can be concluded that the input of the word vector representation layer is C k = e s k + e t k + e p k , where</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">C k ?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">BiLSTM neural network layer</head><p>There is a long-distance dependence problem in knowledge extraction in the machining field. This paper uses BiLSTM to solve it. BiLSTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref> is used to automatically extract sentence features. We use each word of a sentence as the input of a time step of BiLSTM and denote the forward LSTM as l = {l 1 , l 2 , ???, l n } and the reverse LSTM as r = {r 1 ,r 2 ,???, r n }. The inputs l 1 and r 1 are the vector inputs E 1 based on BERT.

Finally, the result of BiLSTM is connected to a linear layer, and the hidden state vector c i is mapped to the k-th dimension to obtain p i so that the automatically extracted sentence features are obtained, which are recorded as a matrix:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">p = (p 1 , p 2 , ???, p n ) = ? ? p 11 ... p 1m ? ... ? p n1 ... p nm ? ?<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Each dimension p ij of p i can be regarded as the scoring value for classifying x i under the j-th label.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Knowledge representation based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation</head><p>At present, most scholars use knowledge graph triples to formally represent knowledge, but knowledge graphs often have difficulty accurately expressing meaning when elaborating general knowledge, such as "face before the hole", "first rough and then refined". In addition, in the process of automatically constructing a knowledge base, the source of the knowledge is complex process text documents. These documents not only contain rule-based process knowledge but also contain process template knowledge and process instance knowledge. Therefore, relying on only the knowledge graphs to express the extracted knowledge clearly does not enable accurate explanations of the meaning of knowledge. For this reason, a knowledge expression form based on a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is proposed. The core ideas are as follows: ? Extract the corresponding knowledge from the process text document. ? Judge the optimal representation method for the knowledge through a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (knowledge graphs, IF-THEN production rules and two-dimensional data linked lists). ? If the result of evaluation is a knowledge graph, then construct the node of the pattern layer; if the result of evaluation is an IF-THEN production rule, then convert it into a SWRL representation; and if it is a two-dimensional data table, read and extract the entity tag information for data-driven. In addition, it should be noted that the carrier of entity information identified by BERT+BiLSTM+CRF is a tag. In addition, we can also understand the difference in knowledge types is mainly due to the variations in name tags. For example, considering the knowledge of the turning rule "To ensure the rigidity of turning, the larger-diameter part should be turned first, and the smaller-diameter part afterward" and the process template knowledge "For hardened steel holes, the precision grade is 8, the RA is 3.2, and the machining method is drilling-expanding-hinging"; The rule knowledge has two main tags: the processing purpose (to ensure rigidity during turning) and the processing conditions (the larger-diameter part should be turned first, and then the smaller-diameter part) in the Function layer. For personalized process instance knowledge such as "The maximum machining diameter of a TC20/32 lathe is 260 mm, and the maximum turning diameter is 380 mm", in contrast to the previous two types of knowledge, there are no "processing conditions" or "processing purpose" tags.</p><p>Therefore, based on the FBS annotation framework and the type and number of the tags identified by named entities, the evaluation factor set of the knowledge representation scheme is defined as follows: extraction; pm represents the number of processing method tags in knowledge extraction; pc represents the number of processing condition tags in knowledge extraction; and pp represents the number of processing purpose tags. In addition, to increase the calculation speed and facilitate calculation, this paper makes the following simplifications: the entity tags (the mechanical features tag, mechanical equipment tag, materials tag, etc.) are unified into the category of mechanical entity tags, and the secondary attribute tags are linked by the child-parent relationship. In addition, because a two-dimensional data linked list cannot express rule knowledge containing processing conditions and processing purposes, the two-dimensional data linked list is removed from the judgement set V, and its best expression is set as instance knowledge. Through the above simplifications, a judgement set V = {KG, PR} is constructed as shown, where KG represents the knowledge graph scheme and PR represents the production rule scheme. Regarding the classification of knowledge, the representation advantage of PR over KG is that it can explicitly represent general knowledge such as causal judgements but is not very good at representing mechanical entities or processing methods. Therefore, for the production rule, the membership function of the mechanical entity factor and the processing method factor can be set to the minor deflection type; the processing condition factor and the processing purpose factor can be set to the large type. Through fuzzy statistics, the corresponding membership function is determined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">U = {u 1 , u 2 , u 3 , u 4 } = {me,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">r PR = ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ( 4 -x 4 ) m ; u me e -2 ( x-1 2 ) ; u pm x - 1 2 8 ; u pc x - 1 2 4 ; u pp r KG = ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ( x 8 ) 2 , u me x -0.6 4 + ? , 0 &lt; x ? 1; u pm [ x -0.6 4 + ? ] 2 , 1 &lt; x &lt; 6; u pm 1, x ? 6; u pm 4 -? -x (4 -?) ? ; u pc 4 -x 16? ; u pp (5)</formula><p>For the membership function of the production rule program r PR , mis the reduction coefficient, and the author set m = 2; regarding the membership function r KG for the knowledge graph, we set ? as the correction coefficient, which is taken as 1. Since the knowledge graph is very sensitive to the effects of processing conditions and processing purposes, the control amount ?, ? of the knowledge graph processing label is set to 3, 2.</p><p>Setting the weights of the above factors in the decision scheme as A w = (a 1 ,a 2 ,a 3 ,a 4 ), they are incorporated into the membership function to complete the overall evaluation of the scheme. For example: for the knowledge text "To ensure the rigidity of turning, the part with the larger outer diameter should be turned first, and the part with the smaller outer diameter should be turned afterwards", in fuzzy reasoning, the number of mechanical entities is 3, the number of processing methods is 1, the number of processing purposes is 1, and the number of processing conditions is 2. The evaluation matrix R can be obtained by calculating the degree of membership, and the comprehensive evaluation matrixB = A w ?R = (0.2, 0.2, 0.3, 0.3)?R is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">B = A w ? ? ? ? ?</formula><p>0.0625 0.1406 0.3680 0.0800 0.1875 0.0370 0.1250 0.0930</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">? ? ? ? = [0.1801, 0.0832]<label>(6)</label></formula><p>From the judgement result, it can be seen that the membership degree of the production rule representation scheme is greater than that of the knowledge graph representation scheme, so this knowledge is represented by production rules.</p><p>After the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is completed, it is still necessary to make a supplementary explanation for the case where the evaluation result is knowledge graph. As we know, the knowledge graph is composed of the triples (entity-relationship-entity), and it seems that using BERT-BiLSTM-CRF can only be able to identify the entity information in the process document. But what we need to pay attention to is that the carrier of entity information are labels. Due to the particularity of the machining field, it does not contain many tags such as place names and people in the general field. Therefore, in view of the characteristics of the machining field, the author has summarized the relationships in the machining field through the FBS design framework in the Section 3. To put it simply, commonly used relationships in the machining field have been set as labels in FBS. When the knowledge expression form is judged to be knowledge graphs, the BiLSTM-CRF framework can still be used to automate the construction of triples (entity-relationship-entity). From the perspective of the relationship, the States level tends to be more internal to the entity (the relationship between the child and the parent class), and the Function level tends to be the external relationship (the connection between nodes and nodes).</p><p>More details are implemented through the system code. For example, there is a same property process template knowledge: For the end face of gray cast iron, the machining accuracy is level 6, and the surface roughness is 6.3, then the recommended machining method is rough machining.</p><p>Through the extraction framework, it can label the text knowledge. The label of processing method is rough processing; The material label is gray cast iron; The mechanical characteristics label is the end face and the characteristic attribute is IT=6, RA=6.3. Input these information into the system, and the algorithm flow steps of the system operation are as follows:</p><p>Step 1: The system obtains relevant tags and judges the type of knowledge (Same property process template knowledge). The system implements a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation algorithm, selects the best knowledge representation algorithm, and the result is knowledge graph. Then the system perform knowledge redundancy judgment.</p><p>Step 2: Start Neo4jUtils Jar and call related methods to realize the connection with Neo4j.</p><p>Step 3: It is very important for the system to search for the Function sub-tab, but the results shows that it is not found. Because the system does not find the Function level sub-tag responsible for external relationship connections, its priority is lowered. Then, the system converts the connection of the external relationship to search for the States label, and the Processing Method label will be found by the system, whose text content is rough machining. Therefore, the system will create a rough machining accuracy node. (If there is a Function sub-tag, the system will first create a Function sub-tag node, and will not grant Process_Method priority to connect to external nodes).</p><p>Step 4: Searching for entity tags. The system creates entity nodes (end faces) and fills in attribute information (this can be achieved through sub-parent relationship). After this step, two knowledge nodes have appeared, and the main content of Step5 is to establish related relationships.</p><p>Step 5: Building related relationships. According to the knowledge type judged by step1 and the system operation of step3, the relationship between the two nodes can be judged as Process Method.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Eliminating redundancy based on knowledge fusion</head><p>The algorithm based on multistage neural network collaboration performs knowledge extraction for the machining field. However, due to the wide variety of data sources in this field, the extraction results often contain a large amount of repetitive, confusing, and even conflicting knowledge. Therefore, to improve the quality of the knowledge base, it is necessary to address the redundancy in the extracted knowledge. In this paper, for the extraction of entities from the semantic, attribute and core tag perspectives, the similarity evaluation of the entities is determined, and the results of the similarity evaluation are organically combined to yield the final similarity value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Redundancy in knowledge extraction</head><p>For a given entity reference item, there are often multiple entities with the same semantics and attributes in the knowledge base; that is, the same ontology has different term descriptions. For example, for two knowledge triples A =&lt; s 1 , p 1 , o 1 &gt; and B =&lt; s 2 , p 2 , o 2 &gt; in the knowledge base, if the content of this pair of triples is the same or there is a case in which the subject s 1 ? s 2 , predicate p 1 ? p 2 , and object o 1 ? o 2 , it is called knowledge redundancy. Therefore, as the number of knowledge extraction entities increases, if similar knowledge triples are not eliminated, the redundancy of the knowledge base will become increasingly large, which will lead to a reduction in the quality of the knowledge base and further affect the accuracy of process reasoning in downstream applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Similarity judgement based on improved edit distance</head><p>The traditional edit distance (ED) is used as a function to measure the distance of a string. It can only judge whether the degree of literal matching of strings is the same but cannot judge whether the degree of semantics is the same. Therefore, we introduce the Word2vec tool into the traditional edit distance function. It is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">function(i, j) = ? ? ? 0 1 2<label>(7)</label></formula><p>In this formula, we use the following definition: If the i-th entity in sentence a and the j-th entity in sentence b in the knowledge base have the same semantics and attributes, we set function(i, j) = 0; if the i-th entity in sentence a and the j-th entity in sentence b in the knowledge base have different semantics and attributes, we set function(i, j) = 1; and if the i-th core entity in sentence a and the j-th core entity in sentence b in the knowledge base have different semantics and attributes, we set function(i, j) = 2.</p><p>The main steps of knowledge fusion are:</p><p>Step 1: Semantic similarity calculation. First, the Word2vec tool is used for unsupervised learning to obtain a low-dimensional vector representation of the semantics of the words in the sentence. At the same time, the cosine formula is used to calculate the vector angle between the two word embeddings in the semantic space. Generally, the more similar the semantics are, the greater the cosine score. Then, the semantic similarity threshold is set as w 1 , and the knowledge type is judged through a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation: if it is general knowledge, the core entities are the "processing purpose" and "processing conditions"; If it is general process template knowledge, the core entity is "mechanical characteristics"; and if it is personalized knowledge, the core entity is a "mechanical entity". Finally, the cosine score values are compared. If the cosine score value is higher than w 1 , indicating that the semantics are the same between the entities, the distance function is set to 0; otherwise, the entity is different from its semantics, the distance function is set to 1, and the core entity distance function is set to 2.</p><p>Step 2: Attribute mapping. In knowledge fusion, the entity attributes also affect the quality of the knowledge base. For example, consider the case of extracting two hole entities whose attributes are IT6, RA3.2, mass production types and whose locations are very close to each other. If the precision attributes are considered alone, without considering the location attributes or batch attributes, this entity is often mapped to the general hole in the knowledge base whose attribute are IT6 and RA3.2. If the entity in the knowledge base is used in the downstream process reasoning, it will be identified as a general method: drilling-expandingreaming. However, this process method easily causes the thin wall between the two holes to break in actual processing, which leads to the scrapping of the workpiece. Therefore, after the semantic similarity calculation, the weighted calculation of the attributes is also required. The threshold w 2 is introduced, and we define that if the score after attribute mapping is higher thanw 2 , the distance function will be set to 0. This means that the semantics and attributes of these two entities are the same, and there is no distance. Otherwise, the two entities have the same semantics but different attribute values, and the distance function is set to 1. If the core entities are different, the distance function is set to 2. The corresponding calculation formulas for Steps 1 and 2 are as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Sim p ( Tx i , Ty j ) = ? n i=1 Cos(x i ,y i ) = ? n i=1,j=1 x i ? y j ????????????????? ? n i=1,j=1 x i 2 ? ? ????????????????? ? n i=1,j=1 y i 2 ? (8) Sim T ( X i , Y j ) = ? n p=1 w p * Sim p (Tx i , Ty j )<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where X i Y j represent the number of entities in the sentences, Sim p (Tx i , Ty j ) represents the similarity of the attributes in concepts X i and Y j , and w p represents the weight of the p-th attribute.</p><p>Step 3: Semantics-based improved edit distance calculation. Through the above two steps, the word vector after the semantic calculation and attribute weighting can be obtained. At this time, the improved Levenshtein calculation is used to calculate the final similarity. The final similarity threshold w 3 is introduced. If the similarity result is greater than w 3 , then the extracted sentences are redundant with respect to the knowledge triples in the knowledge base and need to be deduplicated; otherwise, the extracted sentences are input into the knowledge base.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">ED(i, j) = ? ? ? ? ? max(i, j) min ? ? ? ED a,b (i -1, j) + 1 ED a,b (i, j -1) + 1 ED a,b (i -1, j -1) + function(i, j) (10) Sim T ( X i , Y j ) = ? n p=1 w p * Sim p (Tx i , Ty j )<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where ED a,b (i, j) is the edit distance between the first i characters in sentence a and the first j characters in b. function(i, j) is defined as the cost of changing (inserting, deleting, replacing) a string. For example, a= "For the end face with a surface roughness of 6.3, the processing strategy is generally rough machining" is a process template knowledge text. There is knowledge of b= "The main processing method for the outer cylindrical surface of RA 6.3 is rough turning" in the knowledge base. According to the semantic calculation and attribute weighting of the above formula, the semantic and attribute similarity between the entities is:</p><p>According to multiple sets of experimental data, we take w 1 as 0.75,</p></div>

If the influence of the core label is not considered, the maximum distance of function is set to 1, and the incidence matrix between two sentence entities is:</p><p>It can be calculated that ED(i, j) = 1 and Sim c (i, j) = 1 -1 4 = 0.75 are greater than the final similarity threshold w 3 , and these two sentences are redundant and need to be deduplicated. However, this result is obviously not in line with actual application because the core label "end surface-outer cylindrical" has different semantics. Therefore, the influence of the core label must be considered. Then, ED(i, j) = 2 and Sim c (i, j) = 1 -2 4 = 0.5 are less than the final similarity w 3 , there is no redundancy, and a is entered into the knowledge base without eliminating redundancy.</p></div>

It should be noted that to address the problem that IF-THEN rules are difficult to display and represent, the system uses the SWRL language to integrate production rules into Prot?g? to obtain their semantic expressions, as shown in ?. Based on the process data and knowledge extraction, the process knowledge graph visualization interface of the knowledge base is developed in the Java environment, as shown in ? and ?.</p><p>Finally, redundant processing is carried out in the knowledge fusion stage. Through the semantic similarity, attribute mapping and editing distance, the redundant knowledge in the previous extraction results is removed, and the conflicting or ambiguous knowledge is processed at the same time. The above steps can improve the quality of the knowledge base and provide an intelligent reasoning basis for the application of downstream process knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Quality analysis of knowledge extraction</head><p>To verify the extraction quality of the prototype system, for the entity recognition models based on BiLSTM-CRF and CNN-BILSTM-CRF, Word2vec and BiLSTM are used to train the word vectors. The feature matrix trained by the above steps is used to obtain the global optimal tag sequence of the target sentence from the CRF level. In addition, due to the different sentence lengths, the experiment is based on the longest sentence, and the left and right ends of the sentences are supplemented with zeroes to obtain a uniform extraction matrix. The parameters set in the experiment are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>:</p><p>On the same training set and test set, the effectiveness of the above three named entity recognition models and the model proposed in this paper are compared. The experimental results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>.</p><p>The experimental results show that the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF used in this paper is better than the other two extraction models for the extraction of knowledge in the machining domain. Since the  combination of word-level feature vectors considers only the characteristics of the words and ignores the shortcomings of entity recognition in combination with the context, the model used in this paper achieves a better entity recognition effect. This is because the model used combines word features, sentence features and position features to generate word vectors and uses Transformer to train the word vectors, which takes full account of the impact of contextual information on the entities.  have only a few possible causes that can be addressed in the future. These causes can be grouped into the following families:</p><p>? Pronouns Pronouns (that, which, etc.) are in general very difficult to resolve properly; moreover, the subordinate sentences from which the pronouns originate may not be correctly linked to their real subjects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>? Missing words</head><p>Many elements are still missing in all three FBS classes of the knowledge base.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>? Word structure</head><p>In the process of knowledge fusion, there are still limitations based on the improved editing distance algorithm, and there will be certain extraction obstacles for words with multiple attribution structures. In the future, we may consider applying statistical learning for algorithms to reasoning about the most likely meaning and attributes of each word.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.">Case study</head><p>This system uses an aero-engine cone gear axis as an example to verify the application of the knowledge base system. The aero-engine cone gear axis page in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the many characteristics of the cone gear axis, which mainly include typical features such as conical surfaces, cylindrical surfaces, end surfaces, chamfers, round grooves, helical tooth surfaces and thread surfaces. In addition, according to the accuracy requirements, the machining process includes rough machining and finishing machining. For the reasoning process, first, the parsed part information model is written to the knowledge graph information model. Then, the processing strategy, processing equipment, processing data and other parameters of the processing operation are mapped through the geometric information, accuracy information, and attribute information. For example, consider the feature machining knowledge Rule 1 in the knowledge base: For non-hardened cavity feature machining, the machining accuracy level is 12 and the surface roughness is 6.3. It can be inferred from the following rules that the cavity feature machining method is rough milling.</p><p>Rule: Micro_ProcessPlanning(?M)?Procket(?F)?HasMaterial(?F, NotHardenedSteel)HasMethod(?F,?M)?HasPrecisionGrade(?F,?IT)? HasSurfaceRoughness(?F,?R)?greaterThan(?IT,9)?greaterThan(? Ra,6.3)lessThanOrEqual(IT,11) ?lessThanOrEqual(?Ra,12.5)?HasPro-cessMethod(?M,Rough_Milling)</p><p>In addition, when the attribute values (batch attributes, location attributes, etc.) and feature names are normal, the processing method can be determined from the knowledge graph in the knowledge base. The applied knowledge graph is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.</p><p>Based on the knowledge-driven prototype system, the process design of the aero-engine bevel gear shaft is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. As seen from the reasoning results page in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, the process flow design includes not only the reasoning of the processing program but also the parameter data of the work steps, processing equipment (machine tools, tools, fixtures and measuring tools), cutting parameters, feed times and working hours. Through the knowledge extracted from the process text in the knowledge base, process reasoning for the features and parts can be completed, and automatic process design can be carried out.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusions</head><p>As the foundation of KBE technology and intelligent manufacturing, the process knowledge base plays an extremely important role in advanced manufacturing systems, which directly affects the process decision, product cost and production cycle of an enterprises. Therefore, we believe that in the intelligent manufacturing environment, the life cycle of manufactured products should not be calculated only in a narrow sense, and the construction time of the process knowledge base should also be included in the extensive product life cycle.</p><p>However, previous researches tend to use limited and manually created ways to construct a knowledge base, which lacks the automatic construction process of knowledge base for obtaining and targetoriented simulation knowledge in mechanical product design. Therefore, this method is time-consuming and labor-intensive, which has obvious limitations in the distributed environment.</p><p>To this end, the focus in this work is developing a framework for automatically constructing a knowledge base in the field of machining, and providing a case showing that this framework can assist the intelligent system in the automated process decision-making during machining. We think this is a very interesting topic, which transcends the traditional way of creating knowledge bases based on expert interview or manual way, especially with the restrictions posed by global occurrences such as Covid-19 whereby traditional in-person activities may be altered significantly.</p><p>In general, the method has the following advantages:</p><p>(1) A knowledge extraction model for the machining domain based on BERT-BiLSTM-CRF is applied. This architecture allows the capture, representation and reuse of manufacturing domain knowledge. In addition, by adding tags to the machining domain knowledge, the problems of unclear boundaries and complex types of domain entities have been solved. (2) A fuzzy comprehensive evaluation algorithm is proposed to determine the best expression of complex knowledge, integrating three expression schemes (knowledge graphs, SWRL, and twodimensional data tables) to effectively characterize the technological meaning of most knowledge, which can better support the application of comprehensive consideration rules and case knowledge in subsequent actual process design decisions. (3) A similarity judgement based on an improved edit distance is proposed, which reduces the redundancy of knowledge and improves the quality of the knowledge base. (4) The system adopts the B/S design architecture, which can easily be expanded to update the system and continuously upgrade the underlying knowledge base; In addition, it allows seamless integration with other data subjects in other Web environments.</p><p>In future work, we will consider using machine learning technology to automatically expand the capacity of the knowledge base. Finally, we aim to apply the model described in the discussion section to perform intelligent process reasoning for a knowledge base system under realtime dynamic information.</p></div>
