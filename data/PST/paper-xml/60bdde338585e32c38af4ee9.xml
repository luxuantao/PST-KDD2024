<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper studies unsupervised/self-supervised whole-graph representation learning, which is critical in many tasks such as molecule properties prediction in drug and material discovery. Existing methods mainly focus on preserving the local similarity structure between different graph instances but fail to discover the global semantic structure of the entire data set. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called Local-instance and Global-semantic Learning (GraphLoG) for selfsupervised whole-graph representation learning. Specifically, besides preserving the local similarities, GraphLoG introduces the hierarchical prototypes to capture the global semantic clusters. An efficient online expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is further developed for learning the model. We evaluate GraphLoG by pre-training it on massive unlabeled graphs followed by finetuning on downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on both chemical and biological benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></div>

Nevertheless, in many scientific domains, labeled data are very limited and expensive to obtain. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to learn the representations of graphs in an unsupervised or self-supervised fashion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proceedings of the</head><p>Self-supervised learning has recently achieved profound success for both natural language processing, e.g. GPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Radford et al., 2018)</ref> and BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref>, and image understanding, e.g. MoCo <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(He et al., 2019)</ref> and Sim-CLR <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chen et al., 2020)</ref>. However, how to effectively learn the representations of graphs in a self-supervised way is still an open problem. Intuitively, a desirable graph representation should be able to preserve the local-instance structure, so that similar graphs are embedded close to each other and dissimilar ones stay far apart. In addition, the representations of the entire set of graphs should also reflect the global-semantic structure of the data, so that the graphs with similar semantic properties are compactly embedded, which is able to benefit various downstream tasks such as graph classification or regression. Such global structure can be effectively captured by semantic clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Caron et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ji et al., 2019)</ref>, which can be further organized hierarchically <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Li et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>There are some recent works that learn graph representation in a self-supervised manner, such as local-global mutual information maximization <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Velickovic et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sun et al., 2019)</ref>, structural-similarity/context prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Navarin et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hu et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">You et al., 2020b)</ref>, contrastive learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hassani &amp; Ahmadi, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Qiu et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">You et al., 2020a)</ref> and meta-learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Lu et al., 2021)</ref>. However, all these methods are able to model only the local structure between different graph instances but fail to discover the global-semantic structure. To address this shortcoming, we are seeking for an approach that is sufficient to model both the local and global structure of a set of graphs.</p><p>To attain this goal, we propose a Local-instance and Global-semantic Learning (GraphLoG) framework for selfsupervised graph representation learning. Specifically, for preserving the local similarity between various graph instances, we seek to align the embeddings of correlated graphs/subgraphs by discriminating the correlated graph/subgraph pairs from the negative pairs. In this locally arXiv:2106.04113v1 [cs.LG] 8 Jun 2021 smooth latent space, we further introduce the additional model parameters, hierarchical prototypes 1 , to depict the latent distribution of a graph data set in a hierarchical way. For model learning, we propose to maximize the data likelihood with respect to both the GNN parameters and hierarchical prototypes via an online expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Given a mini-batch of graphs sampled from the data distribution, in the E-step, we infer the embeddings of these graphs with a GNN and sample the latent variable of each graph (i.e. the prototypes associated to each graph) from the posterior distribution defined by current model. In the M-step, we aim to maximize the expectation of complete-data likelihood with respect to the current model by optimizing with a mini-batch-induced objective function. Therefore, in this iterative EM process, the globalsemantic structure of the data can be gradually discovered and refined. The whole model is pre-trained with a large number of unlabeled graphs, and then fine-tuned and evaluated on some downstream tasks containing scarce labeled graphs.</p><p>To verify the effectiveness of the GraphLoG framework, we apply our method to both the chemistry and biology domains. Through pre-training on massive unlabeled molecular graphs (or protein ego-networks) using the proposed local and global objectives, the existing GNN models are able to achieve superior performance on the downstream molecular property (or biological function) prediction benchmarks.</p><p>In particular, the Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Xu et al., 2019)</ref> pre-trained by the proposed method outperforms the previous self-supervised graph representation learning approaches on six of eight downstream tasks of chemistry domain, and it achieves a 2.1% performance gain in terms of average ROC-AUC on eight downstream tasks.</p><p>In addition, the analytical experiments further illustrate the benefits of global structure learning through conducting ablation studies and visualizing the embedding distributions on a set of graphs.</p><p>1 Hierarchical prototypes are representative cluster embeddings organized as a set of trees.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Preliminaries</head><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). A typical graph can be represented as G = (V, E, X V , X E ), where V is a set of nodes, E denotes the edge set, X V = {X v |v ∈ V} stands for the attributes of all nodes, and X E = {X uv |(u, v) ∈ E} represents the edge attributes. A GNN aims to learn an embedding vector h v ∈ R δ for each node v ∈ V and also a vector h G ∈ R δ for the entire graph G. For an L-layer GNN, a neighborhood aggregation scheme is performed to capture the L-hop information surrounding each node. As suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gilmer et al. (2017)</ref>, the l-th layer of a GNN can be formalized as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">h (l) v = f (l) U h (l−1) v , f (l) M h (l−1) v , h (l−1) u , Xuv : u ∈ N (v) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where N (v) is the neighborhood set of v, h U stand for the message passing and update function at the l-th layer, respectively. Since h v summarizes the information of a subgraph centered around node v, we will refer to h v as subgraph embedding to underscore this point. The entire graph's embedding can be derived as below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">h G = f R h v |v ∈ V ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where f R is a permutation-invariant readout function, e.g. mean pooling or more complex graph-level pooling function <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Ying et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zhang et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>General EM Algorithm.

The main purpose of GraphLoG is to discover and refine both the local and global structures of graph embeddings in the latent space, such that we can learn useful graph representations for the downstream task like graph classification. Specifically, GraphLoG constructs a locally smooth latent space by aligning the embeddings of correlated graphs/subgraphs. On such basis, the global structures of graph embeddings are modeled by hierarchical prototypes, and the data likelihood is maximized via an online EM algorithm.

In specific, it is expected that similar graphs or subgraphs are embedded close to each other, and dissimilar ones are mapped to far apart. Using a similarity measurement defined in the latent space, we formulate this problem as maximizing the similarity of correlated graph/subgraph pairs while minimizing that of negative pairs.</p><p>In specific, given a graph G = (V, E, X V , X E ) sampled from the data distribution P G , we obtain its correlated counterpart G = (V , E , X V , X E ) through randomly masking a part of node/edge attributes in the graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hu et al., 2019)</ref> (see appendix for the detailed scheme). In addition, for a subgraph G v constituted by node v and its L-hop neighborhoods in graph G, we regard the corresponding subgraph G v in graph G as its correlated counterpart.

For example, drugs (i.e. molecular graphs) are represented by a five-level hierarchy in the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chen et al., 2012b)</ref>. After mapping to the latent space, the embeddings of all graphs in the data set are also expected to form some global structures corresponding to the hierarchical semantic structures of the original data.</p><p>However, for the lack of explicit semantic labels in the self-supervised graph representation learning, such global structure cannot be attained via label-induced supervision.</p><p>To tackle this limitation, we introduce an additional set of model parameters, hierarchical prototypes, to represent the feature clusters in the latent space in a hierarchical way. They are formally defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">C = {c l i } M l i=1 (l = 1, 2, • • • , L p )</formula><p>, where c l i ∈ R δ stands for the i-th prototype at the l-th layer, L p is the depth of hierarchical prototypes, and M l denotes the number of prototypes at the l-th layer.

The model parameters in this problem are the GNN parameters θ and hierarchical prototypes C. Since the corresponding latent variable of each graph is not given, it is hard to directly maximize the complete-data likelihood function p(G, Z|θ, C).

This approach is based on the i.i.d. assumption of the data set, where both the complete-data likelihood and the posterior probability of latent variables can be factorized over each observed-latent variable pair:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">p(G, Z|θ, C) = M m=1 p(G m , z Gm |θ, C),<label>(10)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">p(Z|G, θ, C) = M m=1 p(z Gm |G m , θ, C).<label>(11)</label></formula><p>First, we introduce the initialization scheme of model parameters.</p><p>Initialization of model parameters.

The prototypes of upper layers are initialized by iteratively applying K-means clustering to the prototypes of the layer below.

In specific, we sequentially sample a prototype from each layer in a top-down manner, and all the sampled prototypes form a connected chain from top layer to bottom layer in hierarchical prototypes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Model Optimization and Downstream Application</head><p>The GraphLoG framework seeks to learn the graph representations preserving both the local-instance and globalsemantic structure on an unlabeled graph data set G. For model optimization under this framework, we first pre-train the GNN by minimizing the local objective function L local and initialize the model parameters with the pre-trained GNN. After that, for each learning step, we sample a minibatch G from the data set and conduct an EM cycle. In the E-step, the latent variables corresponding to the minibatch, i.e. Z est , are sampled from the posterior distribution defined by the current model. In the M-step, model parameters are updated to maximize the expected log-likelihood on mini-batch G. Also, we add the local objective function to the optimization of M-step, which guarantees the local smoothness when pursuing the global-semantic structure and performs well in practice. We summarize the optimization algorithm in Alg. 1.</p><p>After the self-supervised pre-training on massive unlabeled graphs, the derived GNN model can be applied to various downstream tasks for producing effective embedding vectors of different graphs. For example, we can first pre-train a GNN model with GraphLoG on a large number of unlabeled molecules (i.e. molecular graphs). After that, for a downstream task of molecular property prediction where a small set of labeled molecules are available, we can learn a linear classifier upon the pre-trained GNN model to perform the specific graph classification task.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance comparison.</head><p>For the experiments on both chemistry and biology domains, we compare the proposed method with existing self-supervised graph representation learning algorithms (i.e. EdgePred <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kipf &amp; Welling, 2016)</ref>, InfoGraph <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sun et al., 2019)</ref>, AttrMasking <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hu et al., 2019)</ref>, ContextPred <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hu et al., 2019)</ref>, GraphPartition <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(You et al., 2020b)</ref> and GraphCL <ref type="bibr">(You et al., 2020a)</ref>) to verify its effec-  <ref type="formula">2019</ref>) and examine the performance of InfoGraph, GraphPartition and GraphCL based on the released source code.</p></div>

In specific, a subset of ZINC15 database <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Sterling &amp; Irwin, 2015)</ref> with 2 million unlabeled molecules is employed for self-supervised pre-training.

In Tab. 1, we report the performance of the proposed GraphLoG method compared with other works, where 'Random' denotes the GIN model with random initialization. Among all self-supervised learning strategies, our approach achieves the best performance on six of eight tasks, and a 2.1% performance gain is obtained in terms of average ROC-AUC. We deem that this improvement over previous works is mainly from the global structure modeling in GraphLoG, which is not included in existing methods.   proaches with a clear margin, i.e. a 1.7% performance gain. This result illustrates that the proposed approach is able to learn effective graph representations that benefit the downstream task involving fine-grained classification.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Analysis</head><p>Effect of different objective functions. In Tab. 4, we analyze the effect of three objective functions on the biology domain, and we continue using the GIN depicted in Sec. 5.1 in this experiment. When each objective function is individually applied (1st, 2nd and 3rd row), the one for global-semantic learning performs best, which probably benefits from its exploration of the semantic structure of the data. Through simultaneously applying different objective functions, the full model (last row) achieves the best performance, which illustrates that the learning of local and global structure are complementary to each other.</p><p>Sensitivity of hierarchical prototypes' depth L p . In this part, we discuss the selection of parameter L p which controls the number of discovered semantic hierarchies. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>(a), we plot model's performance under different L p values. It can be observed that deeper hierarchical prototypes (i.e. L p 3) achieve stable performance gain compared to the shallow ones (i.e. L p 2). Sensitivity of batch size N . In this experiment, we evaluate the effect of the batch size N on our method. <ref type="bibr">Fig. 3(b)</ref> shows the test ROC-AUC on downstream task using different batch sizes. From the line chart, we can observe that large batch size (i.e. N 256) can promote the performance of GraphLoG. Under such condition, the sampled mini-batches can better represent the whole data set and thus derive more precise likelihood expectation in Eq. 14.</p><p>Visualization. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, we utilize the t-SNE <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Maaten &amp; Hinton, 2008)</ref> to visualize the graph embeddings and hierarchical prototypes on ZINC15 data set. Compared with only using the local constraints L sub and L graph (configurations (a) and (b)), more obvious feature separation is achieved after applying the global constraint L global (configuration (c)), which illustrates its effectiveness on discovering the underlying global-semantic structure of the data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Theoretical Analysis</head><p>Theorem 1. Given a mini-batch G (batch size is N ) randomly sampled from the data set G which contains M graphs, the expected log-likelihood defined on this mini-batch, i.e. Q(θ, C) = E p( Z| G,θt−1,Ct−1) [log p( G, Z|θ, C)], is approximately proportional to the expected complete-data log-likelihood, i.e. Q(θ, C) = E p(Z|G,θt−1,Ct−1) [log p(G, Z|θ, C)]:</p><p>Proof. For each graph G n in the mini-batch, a latent variable ẑGn ∼ p(z Gn |G n , θ t−1 , C t−1 ) is sampled from the posterior distribution for Monte Carlo estimation, and the mini-batch log-likelihood can be estimated as follows:</p><p>Since the graphs in both mini-batch G and data set G can be regarded as randomly sampled from the data distribution P G , we deduce as below:</p><p>Here, for each graph G m in data set G, a latent variable ẑGm ∼ p(z Gm |G m , θ t−1 , C t−1 ) is sampled from the posterior distribution for Monte Carlo estimation.</p><p>Proposition 2. For each EM cycle, the model parameters θ and C are updated in such a way that increases the marginal likelihood function p(G|θ, C), unless a local maximum is reached on the mini-batch log-likelihood function Q(θ, C).</p><p>Proof. We verify this claim from the perspective of variational inference. For a mini-batch G, we suppose that q( Z) is a variational distribution over the true posterior p( Z| G, θ, C). For any choice of q( Z), the following decomposition of the marginal log-likelihood log p( G|θ, C) holds:</p><p>where L(q, θ, C) is the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of marginal log-likelihood function, i.e. L(q, θ, C) log p( G|θ, C) (equality holds when q( Z) = p( Z| G, θ, C)).</p><p>In the E-step, we set the variational distribution equal to the posterior distribution with respect to the current model parameters, i.e. q( Z) = p( Z| G, θ t−1 , C t−1 ), such that the KL divergence term vanishes, and the ELBO equals to the marginal log-likelihood log p( G|θ t−1 , C t−1 ). If we substitute q( Z) with p( Z| G, θ t−1 , C t−1 ) in the ELBO term, we see that, after the E-step, it takes the following form:</p><p>where H denotes the entropy function.</p><p>In the M-step, the variational distribution q( Z) is fixed, and thus the ELBO term equals to the expected mini-batch log-likelihood Q(θ, C) plus a constant:</p><p>In this step, we seek to maximize Q(θ, C) with respect to model parameters θ and C, which will increase the value of L(q, θ, C) unless a local maximum is reached on Q(θ, C). Except for the local maximum case, there will be new values of θ and C, denoted as θ t and C t , which gives out that:</p><p>Denoting the increase of the ELBO term after the M-step as ∆L(q, θ, C) = L(q, θ t , C t ) − L(q, θ t−1 , C t−1 ) &gt; 0, the increase of the marginal log-likelihood satisfies that:</p><p>where the KL term of log p( G|θ t−1 , C t−1 ) vanishes due to the operation in the E-step. Similar as the deduction in Theorem 1, the complete-data log-likelihood log p(G|θ, C) and the mini-batch log-likelihood log p( G|θ, C) have the following relation:</p><p>From this relation, we can derive that:</p><p>which illustrates that the EM cycle in our approach is able to increase the complete-data marginal likelihood p(G|θ, C) except that a local maximum is reached on Q(θ, C).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. More Implementation Details</head><p>Attribute masking scheme. For the chemistry domain, given a molecular graph, we randomly mask the attributes of 30% nodes (i.e. atoms) in it to obtain its correlated counterpart. Specifically, we add an extra dimension to the feature of atom type and atom chirality to indicate masked attribute, and the input features of all masked atoms are set to these extra dimensions.</p><p>For the biology domain, given a protein ego-network, we randomly mask the attributes of 30% edges in it to derive its correlated counterpart. In specific, we use an extra dimension to indicate masked attribute. For an edge to be masked, the weight of its extra dimension is set as 1, and the weights of all other dimensions are set as 0.</p></div>			</div>
