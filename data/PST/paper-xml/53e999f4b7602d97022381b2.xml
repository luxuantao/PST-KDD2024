<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Handwriting-based writer identification, a branch of biometrics, is an active research topic in pattern recognition. Since most existing methods and models aim to on-line and/or text-dependent writer identification, it is necessary to propose new methods for off-line, text-independent writer identification. At present, two-dimensional Gabor model is widely acknowledged as an effective and classic method for off-line, textindependent handwriting identification, while it still suffers from some inherent shortcomings, such as the excessive calculational cost. In this paper, we present a novel method based on hidden Markov tree (HMT) model in wavelet domain for off-line, text-independent writer identification of Chinese handwriting documents. Our experiments show this HMT method, compared with two-dimensional Gabor model, not only achieves better identification results but also greatly reduces the elapsed time on computation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Since the beginning of civilization, identifying the statuses of uncertain persons has been crucial to the human society. Consequently, personal identification is widely used in diverse commercial and governmental sections such as financial access, health care, security control, border control and communication. In particular, personal identification is in highly increasing demand after the 9  11 terroristic attack. Traditionally, the ways for personal identification are identification cards (ID cards) and passwords, while they cannot provide us an unique, secure and consistent personal identification. For example, passwords and ID cards can be shared by others and therefore are not unique. Furthermore, it is possible that we forget to bring the ID cards along with us or forget the passwords and thus they are not consistent. A nationwide survey in USA showed that heavy web users have an average of twenty-one passwords, and they often make confusion on their varied passwords <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. So we need better solutions to personal identification.</p><p>Writer identification, which, speaking in a simple way, is to determine the writer from his/her handwritings (including signatures, letters, notes, etc.), is such a technique that satisfies four requirements of personal identification: accessible, cheap, reliable and acceptable. Therefore, in spite of the existence and development of other techniques on personal identification based on DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, iris <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, fingerprint <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, etc., it appears that the writer identification still remains an attractive application. As a result, writer identification enjoys a huge interest from both industry and academia <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Writer identification can be classified in several ways, however the most straightforward one is to classify it into on-line and off-line writer identifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. The former assumes that a transducer device is connected to the computer, which can convert writing movement into a sequence of signals and then send these signals to the connected computer. The most common form of the transducer is a tablet digitizer, which consists of a plastic or electronic pen and a pressure or electrostatic-sensitive writing surface on which the user writes down his/her handwritings with the electronic pen. Since dynamic information of the writing process captured by the transducer device contains many useful writing features, on-line writer identification, compared to the off-line writer identification, is easier to achieve a high identification accuracy. On the other hand, off-line writer identification deals with handwritings scanned into a computer file in two-dimensional image representation. Despite continuous effort, off-line writer identification still remains as a challenging issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In fact, off-line systems rely on more sophisticated architectures to accomplish the same identification task, and their identification results are still lower than those of on-line identification systems under same testing conditions. Unfortunately, on-line systems are inapplicable in many cases. For example, on-line systems cannot help us to find out the writer of an existing handwriting document. Therefore, developing effective techniques on off-line writer identification is an urgent task.</p><p>Further, off-line writer identification can be divided into two types: text-dependent and text-independent writer identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Text-dependent identification matches one or a small group of same characters/words and consequently requires the writer to write the same fixed text in the handwriting documents. For example, signature identification, which is well known to us, is a special case of text-dependent writer identification. Commonly, the geometry or structure features of those given characters/words are extracted as the writing features in text-dependent writer identification. While in many applications, it is impossible to find out the same text from different handwriting documents and therefore text-dependent identification is unavailable. In this case, we need text-independent identification. Text-independent identification does not use the writing features of some specific characters/words, while instead considers handwriting document layout features, text line features, etc. Generally speaking, text-dependent identification, compared to text-independent identification, has a better identification performance. However, as mentioned above, its applicability is lower than text-independent identification because of its strict requirement on same characters/words. In this paper, we focus on the research on off-line, text-independent writer identification, which still is a challenging research topic and comparatively less touched by researchers. In the following, we briefly review the previous researches on off-line, textindependent writer identification.</p><p>In Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, R. Plamondon made a summary of the early researches on the handwriting-based writer identification. He pointed out that two general approaches had been proposed for the off-line, text-independent writer identification: transform techniques and histogram descriptions. In transform techniques, Duvernoy et al. had reported that the most important variations of the writer's transfer function are reflected in the low frequency bands of the Fourier spectrum of handwritten pages <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. Durvernoy et al. had also designed a hybrid opticaldigital image processing system to extract features from Fourier spectra of handwritten texts. The dominant eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix of the Fourier description of the difference between spectras were used as features <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Similarly Kuckuck et al. had used Fourier transform techniques to preprocess handwritten text as a texture. The feature sets extracted in this study were either composed of a sequence of spectrum mean values per bandwidth, or polynomial fitting coefficients or linear transform of these coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In the second technology, frequency distributions of different global or local properties were used. In most cases, the properties were extracted by measuring global run length, the handwritten line's curvature <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, length and direction of straight pixel chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, relative number of connected segments, distance between special points <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</p><p>In view of that the handwritings of different people usually are visually different, and at the same time inspired by the idea of multi-channel spatial filtering technique, Said et al. proposed a texture analysis approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In this method, they regarded the handwriting as an image containing some special textures and applied a well-established two-dimensional Gabor model to extract features of such textures. In their paper, Said et al. also compared the two-dimensional Gabor model with the greyscale co-occurrence matrix, and concluded the two-dimensional Gabor model outperformed grey-scale co-occurrence matrix.</p><p>Except the global style of handwriting, some researchers found valuable features from single word or text line. In Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, Zois et al. morphologically processed horizontal projection profiles of single words. To increase the identification efficiency, the projections were derived and processed in segments. Bayesian classifier or neural network was used for classification. In Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, Hertel et al. designed a system for writer identification base on the text line features. They segmented a given text into individual text lines and then extracted a set of features from each text line. The text line features were regarded as the writing features. And then the k-nearest neighbor classifier was adopted for classification. In Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Schlapbach et al.</ref> proposed the hidden Markov model (HMM) based recognizer which also extracted the text line features. They trained an HMM recognizer on text line for each writer in the database. The query handwriting was presented to each of these recognizers, and thus a series of log-likelihood score results were obtained. They ranked log-likelihood score results and regarded the recognizer with the highest log-likelihood score belonged to the writer of query handwriting.</p><p>Structure features and geometrical features also came into the researchers' views. In Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, Bulacu et al. used the edge-based directional probability distributions as features for writer identification. They found out that the joint probability distribution of the angle combination of two "hinged" edge fragments outperformed all individual features. Limitation of their method is that a large number of handwritten materials were needed to obtain the reliable distribution estimates.</p><p>In Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, researchers gave a definition of writer invariants. They suggested that each handwriting could be characterized by a set of writer invariant features and these invariant features could be detected by using an automatic grapheme clustering procedure.</p><p>In Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, G. Leedham et al. presented eleven innovative features, which could be extracted from handwritten digits. All these features were binarized to form a binary feature vectors of constant lengths. Then the formed binary feature vectors were measured by Hamming distance for writer discrimination.</p><p>Naturally, some papers integrated multiple features to writer identification. In Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, Cha et al. integrated several distance measures for many feature types: element, histogram, string, convex hull, etc. A satisfied result was achieved on their experiment database.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, two-dimensional Gabor model, a classic method for off-line, text-independent writer identification, is briefly introduced, which is used as a benchmark to be compared with our method in this paper. In Section 3, we propose our method on off-line, text-independent writer identification. The experiments for writer identification using our method and relative discussions are offered in Section 4. Finally, a short conclusion is made in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">A classic method for writer identification: two-dimensional Gabor model</head><p>Gabor function is the name given to a Gaussian weighted sinusoid. The function was named after Dennis Gabor who used this function in the 1940s. Later, Daugman proposed the function to describe the spatial response of cells in visual stimuli experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Gabor function is chosen for image processing because of its biological relevance and technical properties:</p><p>(1) Gabor function is of similar shape as the receptive fields of simple cells in the primary visual cortex. (2) Gabor function is localized in both space and frequency domains and has the shape of plane waves restricted by a Gaussian function. Generally, the Gabor function is a representative of time-frequency analysis and multi-channel filtering technology, and is used in a wide range of image processing applications.</p><p>In Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, Said et al. firstly applied the two-dimensional Gabor model on English off-line, text-independent writer identification. Later, in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Zhu et al. also applied the same two-dimensional Gabor model on Chinese off-line, text-independent writer identification. Both of the two papers said two-dimensional Gabor model achieved good results and outperformed the co-occurrence matrix in their experiments. And nowadays, the academia also widely acknowledges this two-dimensional Gabor model is one of the best methods for off-line, text-independent writer identification.</p><p>The computational model of the two-dimensional Gabor filters proposed in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> is given as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">h e (x, y) = g(x, y) cos[2 f (x cos + y sin )],</formula><p>(1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">h o (x, y) = g(x, y) sin[2 f (x cos + y sin )],<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where h e and h o denote the so-called even-and odd-symmetric Gabor filters, and g(x, y) is an isotropic Gaussian function.</p><p>The spatial frequency responses of the Gabor filters are</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">H e (u, v) = [H 1 (u, v) + H 2 (u, v)] 2 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">H o (u, v) = [H 1 (u, v) -H 2 (u, v)] 2j ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where j = √ -1 and</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">H 1 (u, v) = exp{-2 2 2 [(u -f cos ) 2 + (v -f sin ) 2 ]}, H 2 (u, v) = exp{-2 2 2 [(u + f cos ) 2 + (v + f cos ) 2 ]}.</formula><p>Here, f, , are the spatial frequency, orientation, and space constant of the Gabor envelope, respectively. h e (x, y) and h o (x, y) will combine to provide multi-channel outputs of the input image with different f, and . An example of multichannel output of Gabor filters are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>The mean (M) and standard derivation ( ) of the multichannel outputs are selected as features to represent writer global features for writer identification. Weighted Euclidean Distance (WED) is applied for feature matching after extracting the writing features,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">WED(k) = N i=1 (M i -M k i ) 2 k i ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where M i denotes the ith mean value of the query handwriting, M k i and k i denote the ith mean and standard derivation of the training handwriting of writer K separately, and N denotes the total number of mean values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Our algorithm for writer identification</head><p>Our algorithm for writer identification, which can be regarded as a problem of pattern recognition to some extent, contains three main steps. They are The whole procedure of our algorithm is described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Preprocessing</head><p>As we know, the original handwriting image contains characters of different sizes, spaces between text lines and even noises. So prior to FE, the original image should be preprocessed firstly. In the whole identification procedure, preprocessing plays an important role and inevitably influences the later processes and even the identification result.</p><p>In Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, preprocessing steps are as follows: firstly, removing the noises in the handwriting image; secondly, locating the text line and separating the single character using projection; thirdly, normalizing each character into a same size; finally, creating the preprocessed handwriting image (PHI) by text padding. However this method only aims to handle the handwriting documents with a regular layout. Admittedly, automatic localization and segmentation of irregular handwriting documents are far from being successfully solved <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and evasive in nearly all relevant papers. While we cannot guarantee that all involved handwritings are written in a regular layout in practical applications. Therefore, we must find out an effective method to deal with the irregular handwriting documents. For this, in our research, we develop a software which can interactively localize and segment the characters manually from the irregular part of handwritings and generates the preprocessed handwriting images (PHIs) with high-quality. In the following, we offer an example to show how our software works.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">f =16, =0°f =16, =45°f =16, =90°f =16, =135°f =32, =0°f =32, =45°f =32, =90°f =32, =135°f =64, =0°f =64, =45°f =64, =90°f =64, =135°f =128, =0°f =128, =45°f =128, =90°f =128, =135°F</formula><p>Our software provides a rubber-like tool to remove the noises and needless marks.  revising mark. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>(b) shows how to remove the outside circle, where the dotted box is the area the rubber-like tool is working in. The size of this tool can be adjusted. Therefore, one user can select large size when dealing with a large area of noise and small size when carefully dealing with the overlapping. Fig. <ref type="figure">3(c</ref>) is the result after removing the needless mark.</p><p>Our software also provides a segmenting tool, which is a rectangle box with two blue "ears" at the left upper corner and right bottom corner separately. By manipulating these two "ears", the user can segment any rectangle area from the image. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the Chinese character we want is segmented and then padded into the PHI. The normalization of the character is implemented automatically by our software when the character is padded into the PHI.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows one original Chinese handwriting and the PHI generated from it using our software. Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> provides more details about the preprocessing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">FE based on the hidden Markov tree model in wavelet domain</head><p>Though two-dimensional Gabor model is effective to extract the global writing style of handwriting images, this method still suffers from some inherent disadvantages, which greatly limit its practicability. One of the most serious disadvantages is its intensively computational cost, because the two-dimensional Gabor filters have to convolute the whole handwriting image for each orientation and each frequency. As a better multi-channel analysis tool, wavelet transform can decompose the image into a series of wavelet subbands with different resolutions, and afterward only subbands with interest are taken into account. Another disadvantage of the Gabor method is that it does not consider relation among the Gabor coefficients in each subband and only use the mean and standard derivation to represent a whole subband. As we know, mean and standard derivation are not accurate statistical description of one subband. To well capture the relation among wavelet coefficients, hidden Markov tree (HMT) is an ideal model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Two-dimensional wavelet decomposition</head><p>Here we assume that point (x, y) is a pixel in an image. It has a gray function f (x, y), which indicates the gray level at this pixel. Then, the wavelet transform of function f (x, y) is defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> W f (x, y) = f (x, y) * (x, y), <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> where, ' * ' stands for the two-dimensional convolution operator, and (x, y) is a two-dimensional wavelet function, which satisfies the "admissibility" condition,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">c := +∞ -∞ +∞ -∞ ( ˆ ( x , y )) 2 /( 2 x + 2 y )d x d y &lt;∞, (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>where, ˆ ( x , y ) is Fourier transform of the function (x, y).</p><p>In order to extract features from an image at different resolutions, the multi-scale wavelet function can be written explicitly as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">s (x, y) = (1/s 2 ) (x/s, y/s), (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>where s is the scale. Wavelet transform of f (x, y) at scale s is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">W s,f (x, y) = f (x, y) * s (x, y).<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Furthermore, some constraints are forced into the "mother" wavelet function so as to guarantee the transform to be nonredundant, complete, and form a multi-resolution representation for the original image. A well-known example is Daubechies wavelet, which is the orthonormal bases of compactly supported wavelet <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, from which the pyramid algorithm of wavelet decomposition can be drawn out.</p><p>After we decompose the handwriting image into a series of wavelet subbands, what we should do next is to is find the feature information contained in these wavelet subbands, based on which we can discriminate one handwriting image from others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Training HMT model for the handwriting image</head><p>In Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, researchers found the wavelet coefficients satisfy two properties: clustering, persistence across scale. Clustering means the large/small values of wavelet coefficients tend to propagate to their neighbors. Persistence across scale means the large/small values of wavelet coefficients tend to propagate across scales.</p><p>To match the non-Gaussian nature of the wavelet coefficients, M-state Gaussian mixture density is used as a probabilistic models for an individual wavelet coefficient,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">f W (w) = M s=1 P S (s)f W |S ( |s),<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where, P S (s) s∈1,2,...,M is the probability massive function (pmf) of state variable S with value s, and f W |S ( |s) is the Gaussian conditional probability density function (pdf).</p><p>The persistence property of wavelet coefficients suggests an across-scale dependency between a wavelet coefficient w i at a coarse resolution and its corresponding coefficients at the next resolution, which are also called the children of w i . For example, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, tree nodes 2, 3, 4, 5 are children nodes of node 1. In other words, node 1 is the parent node of tree nodes 2, 3, 4, 5. The cluster property of wavelet coefficients reveals a strong inter-scale dependency between a wavelet coefficient w i and its neighbors within the same scale.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> is a vivid example graph to describe the dependency among wavelet coefficients. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, each white node refers to the observed value of a continuous wavelet coefficient i , each black node represents the mixture state value S i for i . Connecting the hidden state value nodes vertically across scale (solid links) yields the HMT model <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>Using the M-state Gaussian mixture model mentioned above for each wavelet coefficient i , the HMT model can be completely defined by the following parameters.</p><p>(1) P S 1 (m), the pmf of state value of the root node 1.</p><p>(2) i,P (i) m,n =P S i |S P (i) (m|n), the parent → children link between hidden states.</p><p>(3) im , im , the mean and standard derivation of Gaussian pdf of wavelet coefficient i given state S i = m.</p><p>For simplicity, we usually assume M =2 because in this case the state value has a clear physical meaning. Wavelet coefficients with large value contain significant contributions of signal energy, wavelet coefficients with small value contain little signal energy. And since the wavelet coefficients are generated by the wavelet filters with zero sum, they can be considered to be zero-mean.</p><p>The basic idea of using HMT model to characterize the features of a handwriting image is to train an HMT model for a handwriting image, and then use the trained HMT parameter set = {P S 1 (m), i,P (i) m,n , im } as the features of handwriting.</p><p>On training HMT model, we look for the parameters that best fit a given set of wavelet coefficients. Maximum likelihood estimation is an effective principle for parameter estimation. That is, we choose the model parameters that maximize the probability of the observed wavelet data. Therefore, we adopt the EM algorithm used in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> for training. The basic steps are given as follows:</p><p>(1) Initialization: Set an initial model estimate 0 .</p><p>(2) E step: Estimate P {S|W, t }, the probability for the hidden state variables of the wavelet coefficients. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Similarity measurement</head><p>After obtaining the parameter set of HMT model, we can regard a handwriting image is completely represented by its corresponding parameter set . In other words, the similarity between two handwriting images can be considered as the similarity between the two corresponding HMT parameter sets.</p><p>From Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, we know the Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD) is an effective measurement of the similarity between two HMT models.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Database used in our experiments</head><p>One thousand Chinese handwritings written by 500 persons have been carried out in our experiments, with one training handwriting and one query handwriting for each person. All handwritings are scanned into computer with a resolution of 300 dpis. We produce one PHI from each original handwriting, and thus totally 1000 PHIs are obtained. The training and query PHIs both consist of 64 Chinese characters with size 64 × 64 (the unit is pixel), arranged in an 8 × 8 array, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Identification performance evaluation 1</head><p>In our experiments, we compare our method with twodimensional Gabor model on not only the identification accuracy but also the computational efficiency. For two-dimensional Gabor model, Tan et al. pointed out that for an image of size N × N , the most significant Gabor frequency components were equal to or smaller than N/4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Therefore, for a PHI of size 512 × 512, the Gabor frequency should not be larger than 128. Several combinations of different Gabor frequencies are tested, ranging from 16 to 128. For each spatial frequency, we select 0, 45, 90 and 135 degree as orientations. In our method, we decompose the handwriting image via traditional discrete wavelet transform (DWT) using Daubechies orthogonal wavelets. Of course, different wavelet filters may lead to different results. While testing all possible wavelet filters and finding out which one is the best is out of the scope of this paper.</p><p>The evaluation criterion of identification is defined as follows: for each query handwriting, if the training handwriting belonging to the same writer is ranked within the top S matches, we say that this is a correct identification, otherwise a failure identification. The identification rate is the percentage of the correct identification. The identification results of our experiments are offered in the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> shows a graph, which more directly illustrates the comparison of our method and two-dimensional Gabor model on identification rate. Obviously, the identification rate changes at varied number of top matches considered.</p><p>An example of writer identification using our method is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>. The training handwriting written by the same writer of the query handwriting is ranked at the top 1, so certainly this is a successful identification.</p><p>And KLD values between the query handwriting and top matches are much less than those between the query handwriting and undermost matches. In this example, the KLD values of the top 9 matches are {1.32×10 4 , 3.18×10 4 , 3.44×10 4 , 5.41× 10 4 , 5.75×10 4 , 5.79×10 4 , 6.77×10 4 , 6.98×10 4 , 7.41×10 4 },  while the KLD values of the undermost 5 matches are {4.45 × 10 6 , 4.60 × 10 6 , 4.83 × 10 6 , 4.87 × 10 6 , 4.93 × 10 6 }. To some extent, the difference between the similarity distances of correct matches ("01601" in this example) and uncorrect matches can indicate one method's discriminating ability. The larger the difference is, the better the discriminating ability is.</p><p>Our program also records the elapsed time of our method and two-dimensional Gabor model. Our program is implemented in PC computer. The software environment of our computer is: Window XP, Matlab 7.0; and the hardware environment is: Intel Pentium IV 2.4 GHZ CPU, 512 MB RAM. The record of average elapsed time is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>.</p><p>From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, it is clear that in two-dimensional Gabor model, the more frequencies are combined, the higher identification rate is achieved; unfortunately at the same time, the elapsed time also increases greatly. The identification rate of two-dimensional Gabor model combing four frequencies f = 16, 32, 64, 128 is nearly same to that of our method, while its elapsed time is four times of that used by our method. The elapsed time of two-dimensional Gabor model with f = 16 is close to our method, however its identification rate is large lower. Comprehensively, our method outperforms  two-dimensional Gabor model on both identification performance and the computational efficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Identification performance evaluation 2</head><p>To increase the writing samples for one writer in order to enhance the persuasion of the performance evaluation, we divide one PHI of 512 × 512 into four non-overlapped sub-PHIs of 256 × 256. A figure illustrating this division is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>. In this way, we can obtain eight sub-PHIs from one writer. Inspired by the evaluation criterion in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, for each query sub-PHI, only the top S 7 matches are considered since, for each query sub-PHI, there are seven sub-PHIs of the same writer. The identification percentage is the ratio of the number of correct matches within the top S identification results to   <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we presented a new method using HMT model in wavelet domain for off-line, text-independent handwriting identification. Experiments on 1000 Chinese handwritings and 4000 sub-handwritings provided by 500 persons indicate that our new method is satisfactory and outperforms the twodimensional Gabor model, one representative of the existing methods for off-line, text-independent writer identification, on both identification accuracy and computational efficiency. This is consistent with our expectation. At first, in our method, the handwritings are decomposed into a series of wavelet subbands at different resolutions via wavelet transform, and only the wavelet coefficients within subbands of interest are considered. While in two-dimensional Gabor model, the whole handwritings are convoluted with the two-dimensional Gabor filters for each frequency and each orientation and the convolution must redo when either frequency or orientation changes, as greatly decreases the computational efficiency. In addition, mean and standard derivation, two statistical parameters used in twodimensional Gabor model, certainly cannot well describe the statistical properties of Gabor coefficients within each Gabor subband. On the contrary, the HMT model provides an accurate description for the statistical distribution of wavelet coefficients. The accurate model naturally brings about a better identification result. By the way, the methods discussed in this paper are also applicable to English, Korean, Japanese and Latin Language, etc., since text-independent methods do not care about the writing content.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>( 1 )</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Preprocessing: Removing the image noises and other detrimental factors which would disturb the later processings.
