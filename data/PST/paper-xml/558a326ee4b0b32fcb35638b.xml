<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Introduction</head><p>Both mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) MANETs and the proposed Ant Routing Algorithm for Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (ARAMA) have many common characteristics. Both of them are distributed, self-built and self-configured. ARAMA can respond to dynamic changes and attempt to solve problems locally. ARAMA has many of the on demand and the table routing advantages. It provides high number of routes, reliable connections, controlled updating and broadcasting. The scope of this paper is to show how ARAMA works and to show the ability of the algorithm to solve dynamic problems in MANETs. Section two briefly demonstrates the special characteristic of the MANETs' routing problem. In section 111, the shortest path problem in the real ant colony is described. In section IV, the structure of the proposed algorithm is described. Section V has simulation results for two dynamic cases to show the responseaf ARAMA to energy distribution and mobility. Section VI shows our conclusion and finally in section VI1 we propose a number of enhancements to the algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">MANETs Routing Problem</head><p>To solve the routing problem in MANETs, the goal of the routing algorithm should be achieved, while taking into consideration the special network characteristics such as mobility, limited energy, unfair energy usage distribution, limited bandwidth, high bit error rate. The routing algorithm should deal with the rapid change in the network and it should optimize more than one quality of service parameters (QOS) in the network. Many routing algorithms have been developed for MANETs; these algorithms can be classified into two groups: Table <ref type="table">driven</ref> routing [ l l , 12, 141 and Source initiated on demand routing [ 1 1, 12, 131. Both groups need large uncontrolled overheads to solve the routing problem. This large routing overhead affects the scalability of the network and affects the network performance since it uses a significant part of the wireless bandwidth and of the node's energy. In addition, Most of these algorithms are optimizing only one parameter, which is in most cases the number of hops.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IILThe shortest path problem in a real Ant Colony</head><p>A real ant colony is able to find food and follow the shortest path from the nest to the food. As a real ant moves, it deposits a substance called pheromone on the ground. When an ant reaches a point that has more than one outgoing branch, the probability that a branch will be food 1 -b 1 -c 1 -d 1 -e I-a Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>ant colony shortest path problem selected by an ant is dependent on the amount of pheromone deposited on each branch. An ant will select a branch and deposit more pheromone on this branch; as a result, the probability of selecting this branch will increase. The pheromone on the branches of the shortest path to the food will grow faster than pheromone on other branches. The pheromone is evaporated over time, allowing the system to forget old paths and helping to avoid quick convergence to a sub-optimal solution. To highlight how the ant colony finds the shortest path, an example is described in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">1-a</ref>, two ants at the nest need to reach the food. No pheromone is originally placed on the two paths. Each ant selects one of the two paths randomly. The Ants deposit pheromone trails while moving (Fig. <ref type="figure">1-b</ref>). The ant that selected the shortest path will arrive first; pick up the food and retums back following the path with highest pheromone. In this case, ant B will reach the food first (Fig. <ref type="figure">I-c</ref>) and, in its way back, it will select the path it came from since it has the highest pheromone and at the same time deposits more pheromone as seen in (Fig. <ref type="figure">I-d</ref>). Now when ant A reaches the food, it will also follow ant B's path since this path has more pheromone and deposits more pheromone, thus enforcing more the selection of this path. Gradually, the pheromone on the shortest path will increase as shown in (Fig <ref type="figure">1-e</ref>).</p><p>A single ant is not intelligent, but the ant colony can find the shortest path. As the ants search for the shortest path, they explore many paths. The longest paths and unexplored paths still have a probability to be visited. If the shortest path fails, a recently explored path will be followed by the ants. Even if , the first ants used the longer path, the ant colony is able to find the shortest one as the pheromone evaporates with time and the shortest path still has a probability to be visited.</p><p>The real ant colony is a dynamic self-built and selfconfigured system, which is capable of solving its problems efficiently. These features of real ant colony system are matching the requirements of the MANETs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. ARAMA</head><p>The ant colony optimization algorithms have been inspired by the behavior of the real ant colony. The algorithm can find the optimum solution by generating artificial ants. As the real ants search their environment for food, the artificial ants search the solution space. The probabilistic movement of ants in the system allows the ants to explore new paths and to re-explore the old visited paths. The strength of the pheromone deposit directs the artificial ants towards the best paths and the pheromone evaporation lets the system forget old information and avoid quick convergence to sub-optimal solutions. The probabilistic selection of the paths allows searching large number of solutions. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) has been applied successhlly to discrete optimization problems such at the traveling salesman problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> [I81 uses ant-like mobile agents, which are moving like ants, just to scan a large area of the network. While its movement the agents collect and distribute information, which is usefid for routing, across the network nodes. Another class of these algorithms, which use the ants, is Ant Optimization routing algorithms. In this class the algorithm uses an optimization method inspired from the real ant's life. For example, The Ant-Colony-Based Routing Algorithm ( A M ) [ 191. In this algorithm, flooding is used for route discovery. A modified simpler version of S-ACO has been used for route maintenance. The algorithm stability when applied to large network is questionable because of the use of S-ACO, which gives less stable paths when applied to more complex systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Another example in this class is the Ants-Based Routing algorithm in Large Scale Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks [20] is using the ant algorithm in the searching for the destination. However this algorithm is complex because it needs means to determine the positions of all the nodes and to distribute it across the network nodes. All nodes should be aware of their position and other nodes positions.</p><p>The application of ARAMA to MANETs has many advantages. ARAMA is a very reliable and survivable routing Algorithm. ARAMA has many of the on-demand and table routing advantages and at the same time avoids many of their drawbacks. It depends on probability routing tables, thus providing a number of redundant paths to the destination. While the updating of the tables is on demand. When the best path fails, the algorithm immediately uses the next available path. In addition, the routing overheads (path discovery and updating) can be controlled by the algorithm, unlike blind flooding. The majority of the routing packets are concentrated in the best paths regions. The control of the overheads helps increasing the scalability of the algorithm. In ARAMA, the route optimization is based on local as well as global information. The algorithm optimizes the number of hops as well as other quality of service parameters. The algorithm can be energy efficient by optimizing the fair use of the energy across all the nodes in the network. Different energy usage priorities can be applied to different nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The ARAMA Algorithm</head><p>Every node in the network can finction as a source node, destination node, andor intermediate node. Highlevel flow chart for these functions is described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>.</p><p>When a node wants to find andor maintain a path to a destination, it sends forward ants searching for this destination (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2-a</ref>).</p><p>A forward ant moves in the network searching for the destination using the intermediate nodes' probability routing tables and the local heuristic information (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2b</ref>). Forward ants collect paths' information and intermediate nodes' local information as they travel. When a forward ant reaches its destination, the information carried by this forward ant will be graded.</p><p>The forward ant will be killed and a backward ant will be generated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2-c</ref>). The backward ant carries its corresponding forward ant's grade and path's intermediate nodes identifications. The backward ant is sent back following the reverse path of its corresponding forward ant. As backward ants move in the reverse path, the intermediate nodes modifies their pheromone table based on the path grade carried by the backward ant and accordingly update their probability routing tables (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2d</ref>). this type of updating is called "Online delayed updating," because it performs the update that the forward ant should do with the corresponding backward ant. Finally, the source node eventually receives the backward ants, updates its tables and kills the backward ant.</p><p>1. Source node. When a node wants to maintain a path to a destination, it generates forward ants. A forward ant carries the path source address, the destination address, the intermediate node's ids and the path information (path information will be defined in details later in section 1V.C). The forward ant's generation rate can be a function</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">~~~~~~ ~ ~~</formula><p>k is the number of neighbors n is the number of Destinations Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> -Pheromone link destination table at node i of network dynamics, data rate, time and the required ability to quickly respond to changes in the network. The forward ant format is described in appendix A. The forward ant's next node will be selected randomly using the probability routing table. (This will be shown in section IV.A.2) When a backward ant is received at the source node, the pheromone table and the probability routing table will be updated (this will be shown in section IV.2.b) and the backward ant will be killed.   -Kill the loop by removing the pheromone Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> -Reception of forward ants will be selected and the ant will be forwarded to it. The selection of the next node in the ants path are done as following:</p><p>At node i, For Destination D, The probability of selecting a neighbor j is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">0 if j eMi</formula><p>Where 'lij is the local heuristic value of the link</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(ij]</formula><p>between node i and node j. This value can represent neighbor's information such as neighbors queue delay, remaining battery energy, link's signal to noise ratio, bit error rate, etc.</p><p>Fun(rDij ,vi$ is a function of rD,iJ (the pheromone value on link(ij1) and vij (the local heuristic information for link (id) Mi is the set of all feasible neighbor nodes defined by the ant's information and the routing constraints such as the guarantee of loop free.</p><p>The intermediate node i inserts its id "i" in the forward ant and it adds and/or modifies the forward ant path information (such as number of hops, remaining Energy, bandwidth, queue length, etc.)</p><p>If the forward ant experiences any unwanted path constraint (Looping, time to live (TTL) value, etc.), it will be killed.</p><p>At the destination, the forward ant path will be graded depending on the path information collected by the forward ant. A backward ant will be generated and will carry the path's grade " p " and all the ids of the intermediate nodes visited by the corresponding forward ant. Backward ant's format is described in appendix A.</p><p>When receiving backward ant, the backward ant follows the reverse path of its corresponding forward ant and updates the pheromone values on the path's links using the grade it carries. When a backward ant is received at intermediate node i, the node collects the path grade from this backward ant. This grade will be used to update the pheromone values and hence the probability routing table entry corresponding to the forward ant's destination (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>). The pheromone value on the incoming link is increased and the values on other links are decreased using the pheromone updating function (this will be shown later in section B). The backward ant will be sent to the next node in the reverse path of the forward ant. When the backward ant reaches the forward ant's source node, it will be killed after updating the pheromone table of the source node.</p><p>In the forwarding process, unlike the flooding, the he node collects the grade from he node will update the pheromone table ing the grade of the backward ant bs this node is the source node node forwards the forward ant to only one neighbor. The route discovery and maintenance overheads are controlled. This is because the overheads of the searching and the maintenance of a destination is linearly proportion to the source node forward ants' generation rate and the average number of hops the ants experience between the source and the destination, which is the number of transmissionlreception processes experienced by the ant. The forward ant's generation rate can be selected according to the quality of service required. The number of hops depends on the average distance between the sources the destination. Unlike some algorithms, which depend on flooding for path discovery, the search for paths across the entire network in ARAMA depends on ants. The majority of the ants are concentrated in the best paths regions and number of ants discovers the rest of the network. The ratio between the two groups of ants is controlled too. In the algorithms, which depend on flooding, the routing overheads are proportional to the generation rate of route discovery packet and the size of the network. The route discovery packet will be broadcasted covering the entire network, till each node receives a copy of the discovery packet. The number of transmissionlreception processes is proportional to the number of nodes in the network.</p><p>In highly dynamic network, the generation rate of the discovery/ maintenance control packets (in our case the forward ants) should be high, thus the number of transmissionlreception processes corresponding to each control packet should be minimized to reduce the routing overheads. This number is much lower in the case of ARAMA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Table Updating:</head><p>When a backward ant is received at intermediate node i, the node collects the path grade from this backward ant. This grade will be used to update the pheromone values and hence the probability routing table entry corresponding to the forward ant's destination. The pheromone value on the incoming link is increased and the values on other links are decreased using the pheromone updating function. This function is working as follows:</p><p>For destination D At intermediate node i, When backward ant received, +g&amp; j ) incomming link '0,i.j</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Path information and Path Grading</head><p>The path information may include the node's local information and global path information. This information should be the parameters we would like to optimize such as Quality of service parameters. We should be very careful in selecting the path information to be collected. The more information collected about the nodes and path, the more close to optimum is the solution. However, the ants' sizes will increase, which increases the routing overheads. These routing overheads in MANETs consume significant part of the network's energy and bandwidth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>local normalized node/ link Index Ii</head><p>A good solution for this is that each node calculates a Where I, is node i normalized index. 0&lt;1,&lt;1 P , , ~ is node's/ link's i normalized optimization parameter m (Quality of service parameters such as the number of hops, delay, battery, etc) a,,, is the weight given to parameter pbm indicating its importance in the optimization process.</p><p>The node/ link 'i' has a high potential to be selected as a member in the source destination path as the value of I, become closer to unity. I, may have discrete values located between zero and one or they may be continuous. The threshold between two different steps of I, values can be controlled and it affects the switching frequency between paths.</p><p>Each discovered path by a forward ant has a path index Ip&amp;, which is a function of all the nodes' information along the path.</p><p>Ip,,,h can be the multiplication of all the nodes'/links' indices for all the nodes in the path.</p><p>The calculation of I p [ h can be done in a distributed way in the intermediate nodes of the path. The path information I, , , h can be only one field in the forward ant, which will be modified as the forward ant moves between intermediate nodes. Thus the forward ant size is not affected by the amount of information collected.</p><p>The value zpa!h gives a good indication for the number of hops. As the number of hops increases, the multiplication of Ils decreases. I p [ h is a good measure of the overall path information. As the values of Z,s is smaller than one, the value of I p [ h is smaller than the smallest local normalized parameter (Z,) along the path.</p><p>In this paper we want to optimize the number of hops and the remaining battery energy in the nodes to obtain fair energy distribution. Minimizing the number of hops can be achieved by calculating the path index of any node i as follows: I, =constant=C.

Data can be sent encapsulated in the forward ants, sent following the maximum pheromone path, following the best path found or a combination of them.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Scenarios</head><p>We have performed different scenarios to show that the algorithm dynamic response to different network parameters. First scenario is applied to show how the algorithm can provide fair energy usage (distribution) across the network. The Second Scenario shows the dynamic response to dynamic changes due to mobility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Fair Energy Usage.</head><p>Here we are interested in obtaining a fair energy distribution (usage) across the network's nodes. A normalized value for every node's remaining energy is being calculated at each node. These values are being collected by the forward ants. At the destination, the paths which have higher remaining energy will be given higher grades, favoring the lower number of hops paths. Now the data packets will be directed to the paths, which have higher remaining energy. When these paths is being used for a while, their remaining energies will be lower and the data will switch to other paths with higher energy.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows the 12 nodes network we used in this scenario. All the nodes in this scenario are stationary to show only the response to only the node's remaining energy. The Data Rate SOOKbit/s, inter-arrival time for data packets = 0.045, packet size = 20Kb, Note: We have selected a large packet size to consume more energy per packet. We have used an energy consumption model described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[21]</ref> with some modifications. We are using only the network layer packets in the energy model. The effect of power consumption due to lower layers not included. Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>.a shows the simulation results for scenario l(i.e. optimizing only the number of hops) while Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>.b represents scenario 2 results (optimizing both number of hops and the node remaining energy). At the start of the simulation, all the intermediate node's batteries' energy is equal to 63 Watt Second The simulation is run to simulate 50 minutes. Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> shows some network characteristics (number of hops and node remaining energy) on the yaxis and the time on the x-axis.  The time till the first node fails (due to battery depletion) is 18 minutes, while the time till the whole network fails (due to node failures along all available paths between the source and the destination) is 52 minutes. It should be apparent that optimizing the number of hops only, leads to the initial utilization of nodes along this optimized paths and thus their batteries depletion. This effect propagates in other nodes and eventually leading to network failure. Regarding energy usage, the distribution between the nodes that belong to the paths with lower numbers of hops, and the nodes of higher number of hops paths is not fair.</p><p>From the results of Scenario 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>.b) we notice the following:</p><p>Here the algorithm optimizes both the minimum number of hops and the battery usage. From the battery usage point of view, the algorithm distributes the selection of the optimized paths to guarantee fair loading on the battery usage among all nodes in the network. The first node's failure time is 31 minutes, which is closer to the network failure time, which is 43 minute. The remaining battery energy is more fairly distributed. The network starts by using the minimum number of hops paths. When these paths batteries decrease to a certain threshold, the bath information of paths with higher number of hops will be higher, and the network will switch to them. The network keeps switching between paths to fairly distribute the energy usage over the network's nodes.</p><p>By comparing both cases, we find that using the remaining battery lifetime in addition to the number of results we have noticed that the algorithm has the ability to respond to dynamic changes in the network due to mobility and it deliver packets from the source to destination. In addition, we have noticed that as forward ants rate increase, the performance of the algorithm become better. By comparing the number of received packets between the 1 antsls and the 2 antsls results, we have found that the number of packets received at lower number of hops increase as the forward ants rate increases. The number of received packets at lower number of hops is higher in the case of 2 antsls. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, we have noticed that as the forward ant's rate increase the total number of packets received increase. This effect of the forward ants is more significant as the nodes' mobility increase. The effect of the forward ants can be summarized as following: As the forward ant's rate increases, the amount of information collected about the network increase in a certain time period, which helps finding, with higher speed, the minimum number of hops paths. Better performance is achieved by increasing the number of ants. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. Conclusion</head><p>ARAMA is a suitable routing algorithm for solving the routing problem in MANETs because of many reasons. ARAMA is dynamic routing algorithm with controlled routing overheads, which depends on controlled flooding of the ants in the network. The algorithm is a reliable, survivable and dynamic routing algorithm. In addition, ARAMA is self-built and selfconfigured optimization algorithm that matches the characteristics of MANETs. The algorithm can use different Quality of service parameters in optimization. ARAMA combines many advantages of the on-demand based and table based routing algorithms. All the path exploring and table updating is done on demand, which minimize the routing overheads, in addition, the use of the probability routing tables provides a number of redundant paths between each source-destination pair. These paths increase the reliability and survivability of the algorithm.</p><p>The lifetime of many nodes has been extended, this is because of that a fair distribution of energy usage across the network has been achieved, however the network lifetime decreased. We expect this happened because some packets have used non-optimal paths in the transit switching time between routes. The use of node index and path index results in a small control packet. This allows collection of reasonable amount of information about the nodes and paths with small overheads. We will make low and high level comparisons between ARAMA and different ant routing algorithms and MANETs' routing algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. Future work</head><p>We are looking forward to enhancing the algorithm to get better performance. The algorithm parameters and functions should be fine-tuned and made more adaptive to network dynamics. We will run the simulation for more complex scenarios to study the performance for large networks with high mobility and study the effect of using the local heuristic information and its effect on the network. The simulation model will be enhanced to allow different priorities for different nodes. The initialization period until the first ant finds the destination may be long. However, this time can be reduced using some -speeding techniques for the algorithm to start from a closer point to the optimum solution. W e will investigate why the network has a lower lifetime.

Every node has a pheromone table (Fig.3) and a probability routing table. Each required destination has an entry in these tables. In the pheromone table, each entry has the pheromone trails' values corresponding to all the intermediate node's available neighbors. As in most table routing algorithms, ARAMA provides the source with multiple paths to the destination. These paths are graded and ready to be used in case of a failure of the best path. The pheromone values of each entry can be initialized to equal values, thus providing non-biased search for the best path. If some information about the best path is available, the pheromone values of the entry can be set to closer values to the optimum, thus speed up the algorithm. The intermediate node does two main functions. The first one works when receiving a forward ant, and the second fimction works when receiving a backward ant.When Receiving a forward ant, The response of the nodes depends on whether this node is a destination node, an intermediate node or a source node. Source node generates forward ants and then forwards them. Intermediate node receives the forward ants and then forwards them. Both intermediate and source nodes response to the forward ants in the same way. Fig.4shows the h c t i o n s of the intermediate nodes and the destination nodes when receiving forward ants. At intermediate node i, when a forward ant is received, this ant will be forwarded to a neighbor node. The selection of this neighbor node is done randomly using the probability routing table. The values of the probability routing table are calculated using the pheromone tables and the local heuristic information.
