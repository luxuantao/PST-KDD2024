<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A code-division multiple-access system with channel coding may be viewed as a serially-concatenated coded system. In this paper we propose a low complexity method for decoding the resulting inner code (due to the spreading sequence), which allows iterative (turbo) decoding of the serially-concatenated code pair. The per-bit complexity of the proposed decoder increases only linearly with the number of users.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>It is well known that channel coding can be used to combat mobile radio channel effects such as noise and fading. For multiple-access channels, information theory promises an increase in capacity if joint decoding of the users is employed <ref type="bibr">[I]</ref>. The design of good (easily decodeable) multiple-access codes is difficult, and we do not address that problem here. However, information theory also tells us that under the assumption of joint decoding, judicious use of pseudo-random directsequence spreading incurs only a minimal loss in capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, compared to the unspread case. With these motivations, we consider the joint decoding of a code-division multiple-access (CDMA) system in which each user in addition to spreading with a sequence whose period is much longer than the datasymbol duration, employs a single-user channel code. As we shall show, the concatenation of direct-sequence spreading with the asynchronous multiple-access channel.may be viewed as a special form of a convolutional code. We shall consider this convolutional code as the inner code of a serially-concatenated system, with the single-user channel codes forming the outer code. With the serially-concatenated system so <ref type="bibr">(I)</ref> This work was performed, in part, while P.D. Alexander was at the Institute for Telecommunications Research, South Australia.</p><p>(2) This work was performed while A.J. Grant was at the Laboratory for Signal and Information Processing. Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich. defined, we propose an iterative decoding technique inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Our main contribution is a low-complexity decoder for the inner (CDMA) code suitable for use in such an iterative scheme and its subsequent analysis. This contrasts with the work of Giallorenzi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> where the generator polynomials pertaining to the inner and outer code are combined and decoding is performed using a single super-trellis at the receiver. The resulting number of states in that case is proportional to the exponential of the product of the number of users and the memory in the convolutional codes. Such a system is intractable for realistic system parameters.</p><p>The optimal joint decoder for the inner code has a number of states that increases exponentially with the number of users. As a result, many suboptimal, linear complexity solutions have been proposed, suchas the matched filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the decorrelator <ref type="bibr">[6.7]</ref> and the projection receiver [ S ] . None of these techniques were designed with the idea of iteration in mind. Several authors have however proposed iterative decoders. In [9], the synchronous CDMA channel is considered as a block code and an iterative decoder is developed from this basis. A multistage decoder, which resembles the iterative one proposed here is described in <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>. The main difference being our exploitation of the maximuma-posteriori (MAP) decoding technique rather than soft output Viterbi algorithm. Other relevant prior work includes [I 1, 12, 13, 141 where various alternative inner decoders are suggested. In addition to proposing the receiver structure we also provide performance analysis.</p><p>The paper is arranged in the following way. In section 2 we define the interference model incorporating the random spreading sequences and multipath propagation. Furthermore, we make the observation that the resulting CDMA channel can be viewed as nothing more than a convolutional code. We proceed to define the iterative receiver structure in section 3 calling on Turbo codes for motivation. In section 4 we derive analytical expressions to evaluate the performance as a function of the number of iterations for each user, each which may have different encoding polynomials and multipath channels. Performance examples are given in section 5 , where simulation and analysis are compared. We summarise our results in section 6.</p><p>Throughout the paper vectors and matrices are indicated as bold-face lower case and bo!d-face upper case respectively. If x is a vector, then the notation xi refers to element i of x. The superscript * is the conjugatetranspose operator. If M is a matrix, the vector mi is its i-th column.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">MODEL</head><p>With reference to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, let each of the K users in the multiple access system encode their binary information sequences using a (possibly different) rate kln binary convolutional code. Without loss of generality, we set k = 1 and consider the transmission of L code symbols per user, corresponding to a total of KUn information bits. Each user independently interleaves their encoded sequence. Interleaving is conventionally employed for time diversity, but here we shall require it for the implementation of the receiver. Denote the sequence output from the interleaver of user k = 1, 2 ,..., K as xk <ref type="bibr">[i]</ref>,</p><p>where i = 1.2 ,..., L is the symbol index. At each time i, each user transmits sk [i] xk <ref type="bibr">[i]</ref>, which is the real multiplication of xk <ref type="bibr">[i]</ref> with the N-chip spreading sequence, sk [i] E (-1, + l P . In practice, the spreading sequences for each symbol interval are chosen pseudo-randomly from symbol to symbol, and are known to the receiver. This models the use of spreading sequences with periods much longer than the data symbol duration <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>We shall assume multipath propagation with maximum delay spread MT, where M is some integer and T, is the chip duration. The entire received signal after down converting e E C(L+l)N+M may be written as follows where The output of the RAKE receiver front end (which assumes neither chip, nor symbol synchronism between users) can now be written as The matrix A is the receiver's estimate of A . Channel estimation for such a system using random spreading sequences is non-trivial, but may be accomplished using the techniques described in <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. Assuming perfect channel knowledge, let R = A*A. From (1) we have which defines y to be nothing more than a convolutional encoding of the sequence d in coloured Gaussian noise with E (zz') = R 4 . This realisation comes about due to the band diagonal nature of the R (encoding) matrix. The bandwidth of R is 2 ( K + M) -1. Our conclusion from this realisation is that we can employ convolutional code decoding techniques, such as Viterbi or MAP algorithms, to determine d given y and R. Note that R defines a timevarying convolutional code over the complex field.</p><p>For the purpose of describing the decoder for this code we write y as a perturbed version of d</p></div>

Using our view that the CDMA channel is a convolutional code, y, is the (noise perturbed) j-th codeword emitted by the encoder, and mi behaves like the convolutional encoder shift register since the non-zero portion of mp which selects the subsequence of d , acts like a sliding window on d due to the band diagonal nature of R.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">ITERATIVE DECODER</head><p>Due to the serially-concatenated convolutional code structure of the transmitter we propose an iterative decoding principle [3], in which the inner code creates reliability information for the outer code, which in turn creates reliability for the inner code. The iterative process can then be continued until further iteration yields minimal improvement.</p><p>. The receiver block diagram is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The joint CDMA MAP decoder block ideally (3) performs joint symbol-wise maximum-a-posteriori decoding [ 161 of the inner (CDMA) code, based on the encoding matrix R. The trellis over which the joint MAP algorithm for the inner code would operate has 2K+M states, which is intractable for large K. It is this system block that we shall sub-optimise. The de-interleaver simply reverses the interleaving performed by each user at the transmitter. This interleaving is used to spread burst errors that may arise in the single user decoders (due to adverse channel effects) and more generally to decorrelate the errors at the input of the MAP decoders. The K single user (SU) MAP decoder block performs single-user symbol-wise MAP decoding of the outer channel codes, according to <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. Both the CDMA MAP and the K SU MAP decoders pro- (say using the MAP algorithm), we compute the approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> It is because I Dl increases exponentially with the number of users that ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) is intractable for large K.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">I, P ( d j = d , y ) = P ( y j ( d j = d , [ d i = E ( d i ( y ) : i # j ] }</formula><p>The approximation (6) may be arrived at by the following reasoning. Let di be the vector d with element j removed, and likewise, let y; be the vector y with ele- The approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> now results from the following three assumptions i) We treat yj as if it were independent of y~ given ii) We use the symbol-wise, rather than the sequence iii) We assume P (d, = d,y;) to be constant (4) w.r.t. d.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E (d?. IYJ).</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>expectation.</head><p>Another way to interpret ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) is that we approximate <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> by conditioning on the average interfering signal. This is very similar to the expectation step of the expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation for incomplete data [17], described for uncoded CDMA systems in [18]. In the language of the EM algorithm, our observed data is y , the missing data is d; and we wish to find an estimate for di. The EM algorithm performs this estimation iteratively as follows (where we write 4' to mean the estimate for dj after p iterations). Conceptually, we could iterate eqs. ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) and (8) to produce an estimate for 4, within the inner decoder block. However, we do not perform this iteration. Instead, it is easy to verify that the logarithm of the approximation in (6) is entirely equivalent to (7), under the assumptions just stated. Rather than performing the maximisation step, we simply pass the soft information to the outer decoder.</p><p>The conditional expectations are estimated using the output of the single user lMAp decoders, which outputs the channel symbol likelihoods P (dj ly), as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(ij = E (dj 1y) = -P (dj = -1 ly) + P (dj = + 1 I y )</formula><p>Note that ij is not a hard decision constrained to (-1, 1). rather it lies in the interval (-1, 1). These conditional expectations define a "soft state" in the trellis over which the full complexity MAP decoder for the CDMA inner code would operate. This technique of marginalising and softening the encoder state, is akin to that described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> for the intersymbol interference channel. The complexity reduction is due to the collapsing of the trellis down to one soft state. The SU MAP decoders also output the information symbol probabilities, from which information bit decisions may be computed in the usual manner, once the iterations have terminated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The probability density function used to compute (6)</head><p>is the Gaussian since, from (3), y j = widj + zj + m j d <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> where the inner product with mi describes the mechai s m by which the interference arises. It follows that Since we cannot compute this probability for all d we shall employ an estimate of d, namely d , from the SU MAP decoders and compute this probability for each bit dj. Observe that eq. ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) corresponds to an interference cancellation operation. For sufficiently large numbers of users K, the random variable is Gaussian distributed with variance c &amp; .</p><p>Assuming that the zj and zf"" noise processes are statistically independent we have</p></div>

The noise corrupting the SU MAP decoder outputs is</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">~C C = var [dj -E (di Iy&gt;l 2 A</formula><p>which is assumed to be independent of i. We make no further claims on the joint distribution of the error sequbnce.</p><p>When the received powers are all equal to a constant, w, we can drop the dependence on j and simply write Observe that the attenuation of the noise power through the IC is dependent on the load of the system K/N. The lighter the load, the more attenuation. The SU MAP decoders operate in an AWGN environment with noise variance described by (1 1) or (13) if the received powers are equal. We can see from the above analysis that we require the noise variance output by the SU MAP decoders. There does not seem to be a simple way to calculate this quantity, and we therefore resort to simulation.</p><p>In particular the quantity &amp;, by (12). is estimated by simulation over a range of input variances, $$. Similarly the probability of information bit error, P,, for a particular input variance can be computed by simulation.</p><p>We have constructed functions which yield the noise variance output given the noise variance of the input for both the inner CDMA code decoder, and SU MAP decoders. By linking these functions in a recursive manner we can track the noise variance of the iterated decoder as a function of the iteration number. Observe that the minimum value of the variance out of the CDMA channel decoder is a : which corresponds to single user performance and occurs when O&amp; = 0. The initial condition of the analysis system is determined from the initial condition of the SU MAP decoders. Specifically, we initialise the output of these decoder to Thls leads to E (dj I y) = 0 and therefore Adding an additional subscript denoting the iteration number to o&amp; and q$ we have where fcc is derived by simulation for the particular convolutional codes employed by the users. We need only simulate each different convolutional code once, even though several users may employ this code for FEC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">PERFORMANCE DISCUSSION</head><p>We now present performance results for the proposed system. Both simulation and analytical results are given.</p><p>The ratio of the number of users K to the spreading code length N (or processing gain) is kept high for good spectral efficiency (and according to the information theoretic arguments of [2]). Actually uillike conventional results we shall "overload" the channel by selecting K &gt; N. The convolutional codes employed by the users were the maximal free distance rate 1/2, 4 state convolutional codes with generators 5, 7. If a more powerful code was employed the single user performance would improve and the multiuser receiver proposed here would follow this improvement [14]. We do not terminate the single user convolutional code trellis and use information sequences of length 100 resulting in length L = 200 interleaving.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Symbol error pe@ormance</head><p>We simulate the K = 30, N = 14 system which prohibits execution of the full complexity inner CDMA code MAP algorithm. With K = 30 the CDMA channel trellis has 229 states in the multipath free case. The average bit error rate over users and iterations of the receiver are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> versus EJN,. Simulated and analytical curves are shown and it can be seen that there is some small discrep ancy between the results. This discrepancy may be due to the small correlations that exist in the noise at the input to the SU MAP decoders. Another possible source of error may arise since mje is only Gaussian if K + -. The performance for the case where only a single user is present is also included (SU) along with the corresponding dmin bound for Viterbi decoding. We see that after 5 iterations that single user performance is achieved for all 30 users using the receiver defined here.</p><p>The large gap between single user performance and the final iteration of the proposed receiver at low EbINo iS explained by our analysis. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> we have shown how we compute the variance of the noise into and out of both of the blocks in the iterative receiver. The vertical line corresponds to the target variance which is dependent on the Eb/No, at the receiver, of each of the users. In this case we have set this to be low (-1 &amp;)in order to illuminate the reason for the large gap between single user, and obtained performance at low EbINo as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The performance of the iterative receiver is limited by the point at which the "CC" and "IC" characteristics cross. We see, in this case, the intersection is at .</p><p>; " = = 1.95 which is higher than the ideal value of 0 , ' = 1.26. The corresponding performance loss is about 2 dB .</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> yields further insight into the operation of the iterative receiver. We see that as the underlying EbINo is increased the point at which the IC characteristic crosses the horizontal axis will shift left. This has the effect of moving the intersection of the IC and CC characteristics closer to the ideal operating point. Alternatively, reducing the ratio KIN (KIN = 30114 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) has the effect of increasing the the slope of the IC characteristic. This would also have the effect of moving the intersection point closer to the ideal. The other mechanism available for performance improvement is the convolutional code characteristic. If the variance in versus variance out profile was improved, perhaps by using a stronger code, the CC curve would move down and again the intersection point would move left, closer to the ideal.</p><p>Previous proposals such as the conventional system <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and the maximum likelihood linear preprocessing technique known as the projection receiver [8] are several dB away from the single user bound. In fact, the result after the first iteration of the proposed system is equivalent to a conventional system. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Near-far pegormance</head><p>Let us now study the near-far performance of the proposed system. We shall have 13 users received at 1.5 dB and 14 users received at 4.5 dB, resulting in a 3dB difference. There are a total of 27 users in the system with spreading codes of length N = 31 with the other parameters retained from the previous section. The average performance of the 1.5 dB set of users along with the average performance of the 4.5 dB set of users is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref> over iterations. The case where all 27 users have the same receiver power is also included. The ideal scenario is that performance of the two sets of users are decoupled, with the performance being dependent only on the received power of the user. We see that for the final iteration the strong users are degraded by less than 0.5 dB relative to the case when all users are at 4.5 dB, We also see that the weak users are improved by more than 0.5 dB. A point of interest is the first iteration. Here we see that the strong users are doing better in the presence of 13 weak users instead of 13 users at 4.5 dB. This follows since, as can be seen from (14). at the first iteration the other users are treated as noise. Interestingly as the iterations proceed the roles are reversed. The near far effect is not severe in this receiver. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Channel estimation errors</head><p>Finally let us study the effect of channel estimation errors at the receiver. In particular, let Sj = ak uj where the distribution of the ak is Gaussian with hard limits.</p><p>We limit the estimated power to be within 23 dB of the actual power. The multiplicative factors ak are normally distributed with unit mean and variance 0.02 (2%). The same erroneous estimate is used for the entire signaling interval of length L. The estimate errors are statistically independent across users and the actual powers of all users are identical. The number of users in this test was K = 13 with N = 15 chips per spreading code. These values follow the theme of this work which is to highly load the available bandwidth. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref> shows the performance of the receiver for the erroneous amplitude estimates and the exact eshmates. We see that the fourth iteration at high EJN, seems bounded away from single user performance. This is justified since we used a multiplicative method for introducing channel estimate errors. If we had employed an additive error then an error floor would have been evident. Assuming that a 2% error on the estimated amplitude is realistic, then acceptable error rates for continuous data applications are realisable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have proposed a low-complexity iterative decoder for the uplink in a CDMA communications system. The receiver provides unusually good performance for the complexity spent. Although the system must iterate several times, the complexity of one iteration is extremely low. The complexity of the CDMA MAP decoder is approximately equal to a single branch metric computation for a corresponding full complexity MAP decoder.</p><p>The performance of the receiver is computed using both simulation and analytical tools, and good agreement is observed. System performance after a only a few iterations is as if there were only one user in the system, i.e. the interference has been almost completely eliminated. Although this has been done in the past with small numbers of users or orthogonal codes we drop both restrictions and allow the codes to be random and the number of users to exceed the spreading code length. Multipath propagation is easily incorporated in the receiver design, even taking into account errors in channel estimation. Future studies will study the possibility of integrated channel estimation procedures. The receiver is also shown to have excellent near-far resistance.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1-Code-division multiple-access channel.</figDesc></figure>
