<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Transmission of digital subband-coded images over lossy packet networks presents a reconstruction problem at the decoder. This paper presents two techniques for reconstruction of lost subband coefficients, one for low-frequency coefficients and one for high-frequency coefficients. The low-frequency reconstruction algorithm is based on inherent properties of the hierarchical subband decomposition. To maintain smoothness and exploit the high intraband correlation, a cubic interpolative surface is fit to known coefficients to interpolate lost coefficients. Accurate edge placement, crucial for visual quality, is achieved by adapting the interpolation grid in both the horizontal and vertical directions as determined by the edges present. An edge model is used to characterize the adaptation, and a quantitative analysis of this model demonstrates that edges can be identified by simply examining the high-frequency bands, without requiring any additional processing of the low-frequency band. High-frequency reconstruction is performed using linear interpolation, which provides good visual performance as well as maintains properties required for edge placement in the low-frequency reconstruction algorithm. The complete algorithm performs well on loss of single coefficients, vectors, and small blocks, and is therefore applicable to a variety of source coding techniques.</p></div>

Proposed FEC techniques require sophisticated buffer control and place limitations on the numbers of and spacings between lost packets to work correctly <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. ARQ lowers the data transmission rate while resending requested data, thus sacrificing visual quality for higher compression <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. ARQ can also increase the network congestion that initially induced packet loss, thus aggravating the situation. Although some networks are considered to provide layered transmission, in which high-priority data experiences a lower packet loss rate than low-priority data <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, packet loss is still experienced to some extent by all data.</p><p>Unlike raw data, which must be received perfectly, visual data contains a great deal of redundancy that can be exploited to reconstruct the damaged image data while not providing an exact replica of the original. Providing that human perception is considered, the visual data can be successfully reconstructed using lossy signal processing techniques that exploit perceptual qualities and correlation within the signal. Ideally, these techniques should provide the highest quality reconstructed data possible with minimal computational requirement. They can then be easily incorporated into existing systems, demanding minimal load from on-board video boards in workstations, or consuming minimal battery power in hand-held receivers, for example.</p><p>This paper considers reconsruction of lost data in hierarchical subband-coded images, in which a separable twodimensional (2-D) filter is first applied to an image and then recursively applied to the lowest frequency output subband of the filter. Each application of the filter bank is called a decomposition level, and image decompositions are referred to by the total number of decomposition levels. The separable 2-D filters considered are composed of (half-band) one-dimensional (1-D) quadrature mirror filters (QMF's). The reconstruction algorithm consists of two parts: reconstruction of lost coefficients in the visually most important lowest frequency band (lowfrequency reconstruction) and reconstruction of coefficients in all other bands (high-frequency reconstruction). Emphasis is placed on providing high-quality low-frequency reconstruction, because the low-frequency band contains over 95% of the analyzed image signal energy, and errors therefore have a much greater effect on the quality of the synthesized image than errors in high-frequency reconstruction.</p><p>Previous work on reconstructing subband coefficients in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> iteratively generated lost coefficients to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the correctly received coefficients and the coefficients resulting from the analysis of the synthesized reconstructed image. This technique is limited to systems in which the analysis filters have significant overlap in the passbands to provide high interband correlation. Good results were observed with 2-tap and 4-tap perfect reconstruction filters, while QMF's proved unsuitable. The iterative nature of this technique makes it computationally intensive. The techniques proposed in this paper apply to both even-and odd-length QMF's and produce good quality reconstructed images with a computational overhead of less than 5%.</p><p>Synthesis of a subband-coded image that has suffered lowfrequency loss without reconstruction (i.e., setting lost coefficients to zero) produces an image with dark "holes" spread out to an extent determined by the number of decomposition levels and the filter length. High-frequency loss without reconstruction may or may not be visible, depending on where the loss occurs. Because of their visual importance, edges play a primary role in defining the reconstruction algorithm. Any algorithm for low-frequency reconstruction must generate coefficients that maintain clean edge structures when the reconstructed coefficients are synthesized. Incorrect reconstruction leads to blurring in synthesized edges, which is visually very distracting.</p><p>This paper addresses reconstruction of lost subband coefficients and presents two reconstruction techniques, one for low-frequency coefficients and one for high-frequency coefficients. The low-frequency reconstruction algorithm exploits interband relationships and is based on three properties of the hierarchical subband decomposition: The lowest frequency band visually exhibits smoothness and has high horizontal and vertical correlation coefficients, and the high-frequency bands at the lowest decomposition level contain horizontal and vertical edge information corresponding to the lowest frequency band. To maintain smoothness and exploit the high intraband correlation, a cubic interpolative surface is fit to known coefficients to interpolate lost coefficients. Accurate edge placement is achieved by adapting the interpolation grid in both the horizontal and vertical directions as determined by the high-frequency bands. A simple edge model is used to characterize the adaptation, and a quantitative analysis of this model demonstrates that edges can be identified in the low-frequency band by simply examining the high-frequency bands, without requiring any additional processing of the lowfrequency band. High-frequency reconstruction in bands that have been highpass filtered in only one direction exploits correlation in the lowpass filtered direction. Linear interpolation provides good visual performance as well as maintains properties required for edge placement in the low-frequency reconstruction algorithm.</p><p>The organization of the paper is as follows. Section II introduces the simple edge model and presents an analysis for both even and odd length QMF's, the results of which indicate how the high-frequency coefficients can be used for edge identification and placement. In Section III, the edge-model-based surface generation algorithm for lowfrequency reconstruction is presented. Section IV describes high-frequency reconstruction. In Section V, reconstruction results are presented. The paper is concluded with a summary in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. EDGE MODEL ANALYSIS</head><p>Reconstructing coefficients so that edges are accurately synthesized is crucial to providing visually acceptable images. The subband decomposition provides a natural framework through which relationships between low and high-frequency subbands can be used to characterize the low-frequency signal for accurate edge reconstruction. Previous work on describing interband relationships in subband decomposition has relied on heuristic techniques and additional processing of the low-frequency band to relate activity in the low-and highfrequency signals. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, an empirically derived threshold measure is used to determine activity for each coefficient in the low-frequency band, and this activity is used to predict the amplitudes of high-frequency coefficients. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, an edge detector is applied to the low-frequency band, the output of which is then thresholded. A window of three high-frequency coefficients centered on locations above the threshold is then selected as significant in representing edge structures in synthesized images. In both cases, the low-frequency coefficients are used to determine edge structures and, hence, to select important high-frequency coefficients.</p><p>In the case of reconstruction, some low-frequency coefficients are missing, so processing of the low-frequency band cannot be used to accurately identify edge locations. However, the fact that edges are clearly visible in the high-frequency bands suggests that they may be identified based on highfrequency characteristics alone. This section describes how high-frequency subband behavior in the vicinity of edges is characterized and is used in reconstruction. A simple edge model is proposed and then analyzed using both highpass and lowpass QMF's, indicating how to identify edges using only the high-frequency coefficients, and how coefficients in the vicinity of edges should be reconstructed.</p><p>In the following, subbands in a hierarchical decomposition are referred to by two letters, corresponding to the last set of horizontal and vertical filters used to generate them, respectively. The low-frequency subband is referred to as the LL band, indicating that the signal has been lowpass filtered in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Only one LL band exists, and it occurs in the lowest decomposition level. There are three types of high-frequency subbands, the LH, HL, and HH bands. Multiple LH, HL, and HH bands exist, one set for each decomposition level. When these bands are discussed, the decomposition level is stated as either the lowest level, or as a higher decomposition level.</p><p>A simple 1-D edge model is defined and is used to illustrate the importance of correct edge placement for low-frequency reconstruction. The model is defined as a three-valued signal, where either or and the mixture value is referred to as the edge center. Analysis of this signal yields two different low-frequency subband signals, depending on whether the subsampling occurs in even or odd locations, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. For the example shown using a 5-tap QMF from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the even-subsampled low-frequency signal resembles a step function, while the odd-subsampled signal resembles a ramp. Reconstruction of the second coefficient in the step incorrectly as a ramp results in the synthesized edge placement offset by one pixel to the left from its correct location.</p><p>The high-frequency bands clearly contain edge information that can be selected as important without extra processing of the low-frequency band to explicitly detect edges. Based on this observation, an analysis of the simple edge model using a highpass QMF provides a quantitative characterization of the high-frequency signal so that edge structures can be identified using the high-frequency coefficients alone. An analysis of the edge model using a lowpass QMF then provides details about how low-frequency coefficients in the vicinity of edges should be reconstructed. Edges are identified using the high-frequency signal, and their relative locations to the lost low-frequency coefficients determines the correct placement of synthesized edges in reconstruction.</p><p>In the following subsections, the three-valued edge model is analyzed using a highpass QMF derived from a lowpass QMF, for both even-and odd-length filters, to identify characteristics in the high-frequency band that indicate the presence of an edge. While even and odd length filters have different coefficient relationships, it is shown that the end results of the analysis are independent of the filter type used, and edges can be easily identified by the presence of two large adjacent highfrequency coefficients. A corresponding analysis of the edge model using even and odd length lowpass QMF's provides the required information for reconstruction of low-frequency coefficients in the vicinity of edges. Use of the high-frequency coefficients to determine edge placement information is then described.</p><p>In this section, the following conventions are used: the filter coefficient at 0 is underlined, and the subband coefficients are given as a function of representing the absolute distance between the edge center and the filter coefficient at 0. Coefficients to the left of the edge are coefficients corresponding to spatial indices less than the edge center index; coefficients to the right of the edge are coefficients corresponding to spatial indices greater than the edge center index.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Even-Length Filter Analysis</head><p>Consider a symmetric, even-length lowpass filter, with one more causal tap than noncausal tap. This filter is represented by coefficients Then the corresponding highpass QMF is represented as To analyze the behavior of the high-frequency subband coefficients in the presence of edges, the edge model is filtered with the highpass QMF and the resulting coefficients are characterized in three locations. The high-frequency subband coefficients to the left of the edge (prior to subsampling) are given by ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) can be simplified to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> In similar simplified form, coefficients to the right of the edge are given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> The high-frequency coefficient at the edge center is (4) From ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>)-(4), it is apparent that for a given filter, the highfrequency coefficients are functions of the edge parameter and the difference in pixel values across the edge Thus, stronger edges have larger (in absolute value) highfrequency coefficients, and the behavior of the coefficients in the vicinity of edges can be characterized as a function of</p><p>The magnitudes of seven nonsubsampled normalized (i.e., high-frequency coefficients are plotted versus in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> for an 8-tap filter from <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Prior to subsampling, with the exception of small regions for around 0.3 and 0.7, there are four adjacent filtered values  that are at least an order of magnitude larger than surrounding values. These values occur immediately to the left of the edge, at the edge center, and at the two positions to the right of the edge. When the high-frequency signal is subsampled, each of the even and the odd subsampling cases has two large adjacent coefficients in the vicinity of the edge, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, again with the exceptions of regions around 0.3 for even subsampling and 0.7 for odd subsampling (regions on the axis where the two largest coefficients are not adjacent will be referred to as error regions). By allowing an error for approximately 10% of edges with in these ranges (assuming even and odd subsampling are equally likely), edges in the low-frequency subband can be identified by examining the corresponding high-frequency subband coefficients and the locations of large high-frequency coefficients relative to the low-frequency coefficient location. Similar results extend to the longer filters given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, with error occurring for only approximately 5% of the edges; the error region for even subsampling does not exist for filters of length 12 and higher, while the odd subsampling error region around 0.7 is present for most of the filters, an exception being filters of length 16. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Odd-Length Filter Analysis</head><p>Now consider an odd-length filter, of length even. The lowpass filter is represented by coefficients</p><p>The corresponding highpass filter is represented as where, using the filter relationships for odd-length QMF's, the filter is delayed by one sample relative to the lowpass filter.</p><p>Coefficients to the left of the edge are given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> Coefficients to the right of the edge have values <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> The coefficient at the edge center is given by ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>)</p><p>Because the signs of coefficients on either side of the symmetry point are the same, cancellation as in the case with even-length filters does not occur, and at first glance, the equations do not seem to simplify nicely.

Therefore, again for each filter the subband coefficient behavior can be characterized as a function of the edge parameter and the pixel difference across the edge. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> plots the magnitudes of the normalized high-frequency coefficients versus for a 5-tap filter from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Examination of the nonsubsampled high-frequency signal shows that as in the case of the even-length filters, an edge is characterized by two large adjacent coefficients, with the exception of a region for even subsampling around 0.5. Allowing this error, even and odd subsampling patterns yield the same results diagrammed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. As filter length increases for the longer odd length filters given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the even subsampling error region remains around 0.5 and does not increase in size, while an error region for odd subsampling appears around 0.9 and has width of approximately 0.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Low-Frequency Edge Model Analysis</head><p>The high-frequency edge model analyses of the previous two subsections demonstrate that two adjacent large highfrequency coefficients indicate the presence of a simple edge.

These results will be used in determining reconstruction parameters for lowfrequency coefficients, described in Section III.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Edge Classification Using the Edge Model</head><p>Given that there are two large coefficients in the vicinity of edges, the edge classification for a single low-frequency coefficient is determined by examining a window of five highfrequency coefficients centered at the location of the lost low-frequency coefficient, and looking for two adjacent large absolute values (the definition of "large" will be made more precise in the reconstruction results section).</p><p>If there are zero, one, or two nonadjacent large coefficients, the edge classification is "normal," indicating that no edge is present. If there are two adjacent large coefficients, one of four patterns occur. If the pattern is or referring to small and referring to large), then the lost coefficient is to the right or left of an edge, respectively. If the pattern is or then the coefficient is immediately on an edge or just beyond it, depending on the subsampling pattern. If there are more than two large coefficients occurring in any pattern, then the edge classification is "high-frequency variations" (HFV), indicating that there is more high-frequency activity than the simple edge model can predict. These five cases and the lowfrequency coefficient behavior summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> are used in determining the interpolation points when reconstructing lost coefficients.</p><p>Use of the edge model is easily extended to two dimensions for both vertical and horizontal edge identification in the LL band by applying it independently in each direction. Because the LL band contains a signal lowpass filtered and subsampled in both directions, the original properties of the signal are generally maintained following 1-D analysis in either direction and the edge model applies independently in both the horizontal and vertical directions. The LH band at the lowest decomposition level contains the required highfrequency information in the vertical direction to classify vertical edges, while the HL band contains the corresponding information in the horizontal direction.</p><p>In independently classifying both horizontal and vertical edges, diagonal edges are implicitly identified and classified. Assuming that a diagonal edge follows the edge model, lowpass filtering in one dimension yields a signal approximating the edge model as given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>-each lowpass filtered and subsampled row or column now resembles a noisy edge model. Filtered coefficients are predominantly a function of or are Because these coefficients, when observed in the orthogonal direction prior to highpass filtering, still resemble the edge model, the highpass filtered signal indicates an edge in both the horizontal and vertical directions, as expected for a diagonal edge. This result provides the desired diagonal edge reconstruction as described in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. EDGE-MODEL-BASED SURFACE GENERATION</head><p>FOR LOW-FREQUENCY RECONSTRUCTION The high correlation present in the low-frequency subband suggests that lost coefficients can be reconstructed using their neighbors, and the smooth, natural appearance of this subband suggests that interpolation should maintain this smoothness. Bicubic interpolation is selected as the surface generation technique, and is then modified to incorporate the edge information from the high-frequency subbands. The bicubic surface can be considered to be a cubic spline surface with first order continuity on the edges. Requiring only first order continuity (continuity in the first derivatives) is better suited to interpolation of low-frequency subband coefficients than imposing higher order continuity constraints. First derivatives can be reasonably estimated using differences of adjacent coefficients. Generation of higher order derivatives involves using more coefficients in a larger area, thus incorporating more global signal characteristics rather than local characteristics. A review of bicubic interpolation is first presented, and then the grid adaptation used to accurately place synthesized edges is described. Incorporation into the low-frequency reconstruction algorithm is then discussed. A more detailed description of bicubic interpolation can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>In bicubic interpolation, a surface cubic in both and is generated by specifying four points on the corners of a grid (referred to as the grid corners) and their corresponding gradients and and cross derivatives Subband coefficients generated by a 2-D separable filter lie on a regular sampling grid, so bicubic interpolation can be applied to reconstructing a lost coefficient by using the four corner coefficients as grid corners and by using adjacent coefficients to calculate the required gradients using one-or two-sided differencing. The direct application of bicubic interpolation to reconstruct a single lost coefficient at the grid point fixes the interpolation point at and the reconstructed coefficient is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> where</p><p>An illustration of the coefficient grid and the coefficients used to compute the quantities in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> is given in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. The reconstructed value can be considered to be the mean of the four corners with correction factors. While inclusion of the derivative terms provides some incorporation of the local surface structure, it is not enough to accurately place edges as discussed earlier. A visual example of bicubic interpolation and the edge defects it causes is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8(c)</ref>. Hence the edge model and LH and HL information at the lowest decomposition level is used to adapt the otherwise regular interpolation grid to better reconstruct the edges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Grid Adaptation</head><p>One-dimensional grid adaptation is conceptually understood as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. First, a cubic polynomial is fit to two points and their derivatives on a regularly spaced grid, yielding an equation for the curve Interpolation at the center point on the grid gives and places the point approximately between the two end points. However, adapting the grid by compressing it toward the left pushes the edge to the left and places a point closer to the rightmost value in the center. This The quantized interpolation locations for each edge classification are determined using the lowpass analysis of the edge model outlined in Section II-C. For example, consider even-length filters. For odd subsampling, the low-frequency coefficients selected are at 2, 4, to the left of the edge, the edge center, and at 2, 4, to the right of the edge. For the class the lost coefficient is located at 2 to the right of the edge. Based on the low-frequency characterization in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>, this coefficient has more content, and should be reconstructed with a weighting toward the adjacent coefficient with greater contgent; that is, a weighting toward the coefficient on the right. Therefore, the interpolation location is 3/4. The interpolation locations for the four edge classifications are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>. For the classes and the interpolation location is the same for both even and odd subsamplinng. However, for and one of the locations is a function of Therefore, more information is required than simply the edge classification. Referring to the two large coefficients in the high-frequency signal as and this additional information is obtained by examining the ratio which is only a function of for a given filter. The ratio behavior is filter dependent and is characterized by plotting the function versus for each filter with even and odd subsampling. Interpolation points are then defined for various ranges of the ratio. This procedure can be simplified to simply selecting 3/4 for and 1/4 for in which case the location is correct for one subsampling pattern all the time, and for the other subsampling pattern half of the time.</p><p>Similar results hold for odd-length filters, except that only the center value is a function of corresponding to the class in odd subsampling. In this case, the ratio must be used to determine the interpolation point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Low-Frequency Reconstruction Algorithm</head><p>The complete low-frequency reconstruction algorithm is as follows. For each lost coefficient, the horizontal and vertical edge classifications are determined from the HL and LH subbands by thresholding the absolute values of the subband coefficients. Three scenarios can occur. In the first, neither class is HFV. Then the interpolation locations are determined from the classifications, derivatives are estimated using one-or two-sided differencing, and unknown values that are required for calculation of either the four interpolation points or derivatives are estimated using weighted means, where unknown coefficients are estimated as the means of available coefficients directly above, below, to the left, and to the right, that are not classified as part of an edge structure based on their LH and HL classifications. The lost coefficient is then generated using edge-model-based surface generation.</p><p>In the second scenario, the high-frequency variations case is detected in only one direction. The lost coefficient is reconstructed following the procedure outlined above, but 1-D interpolation is performed in the direction with the non-HFV classification.</p><p>Finally, HFV can be detected in both directions. In this case, the threshold is increased until one direction has a non-HFV class and reconstruction proceeds as in the second scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Extension to Adjacent Lost Coefficients</head><p>Because bicubic interpolation uses points not in the row or column of the lost coefficient, it is well suited to reconstructing adjacent coefficient loss. If multiple coefficients in a row or column are lost, the high-frequency classification of the lost coefficients is examined and HFV-classified coefficients in the direction of loss are reconstructed one dimensionally first. Following this 1-D reconstruction, coefficients are reconstructed using 2-D interpolation. Coefficients exhibiting high-frequency variations in the direction perpendicular to the direction of loss are reconstructed last.</p><p>If the coefficients are coded in vectors of size 1 or 1 in the event of adjacent vector loss, the dimensions of a lost region will exceed one in both directions for some regions. In this case, grid adaptation is extended across two adjacent coefficients by modifying the interpolation location and highfrequency classification for each of the adjacent coefficients. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> illustrates the coefficient grid and the coefficients used to compute the derivatives for adjacent coefficient reconstruction. The interpolation locations are quantized to (1/6, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 5/6) to allow placement of a single edge between either of the two lost coefficients. As in grid adaptation for one coefficient, the possible high-frequency patterns across two coefficients are enumerated and based on examination of the corresponding coefficient locations with respect to the edge, an interpolation point is assigned for each coefficient. These are enumerated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref>. Patterns not listed are either not possible (e.g., produces a HFV classification for both coefficients) or not reconstructed using interpolation across two coefficients because at least one of the two classifications is HFV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. LINEAR INTERPOLATION FOR HIGH FREQUENCY RECONSTRUCTION</head><p>Random loss with no reconstruction in high-frequency bands is typically visually imperceptible in natural images. However, because low-frequency reconstruction relies on high-frequency bands at the lowest decomposition level to place edges, accurate reconstruction of these bands is important. High-frequency reconstruction is based on the fact that the HL and LH bands exhibit high correlation in the direction that has been lowpass filtered. A parallel exists between the LH/HL and HH bands, as exists between the LL and LH/HL bands; that is, the same subband intermediate signal has been lowpass and highpass filtered in one dimension. However, forming a model and characterizing its behavior is difficult because the intermediate signal has been highpass filtered before the final lowpass/highpass filtering stages. This highpass filtering removes correlation and visual smoothness from the signal.</p><p>Fortunately, the high-frequency signals can be adequately and accurately reconstructed using simple 1-D linear interpolation in the low-frequency direction. Use of averaging is motivated by the results of linear minimum mean-square estimation (LMMSE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Unknown coefficients are interpolated from the two coefficients on either side of them in the lowpass direction. A single lost coefficient is reconstructed as where is the LMMSE solution and is the 1-D, one-step correlation coefficient. Note that must be only greater than 1/2 to produce Assuming that this will generally be the case, the interpolation is simplified to 0.5, for averaging. Table IV lists values computed using measured correlation coefficients for two images with one and two decomposition levels. The couple image exhibits high lowpass direction correlation and, hence, the values are close to the linear interpolation value. The Lena image's HL bands are farther off, while the LH bands exhibit very low correlation even in the lowpass direction and, hence, the values are quite different. However, the correlation values used to calculate the values given in the table are taken over the entire subbands, which are The HH band exhibits low correlation in both horizontal and vertical directions. Lost coefficients are not reconstructed; they are set to zero.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS &amp; COMPARISONS</head><p>The complete reconstruction algorithm was evaluated in two steps. First, the applicability of the edge model for edge identification was verified, and the threshold to identify large high-frequency coefficients was determined. Then, after defining appropriate implementation aspects for packetization and coding to permit reconstruction in a transmission environment with packet loss, algorithm performance was evaluated on both unquantized and quantized data. Finally, a brief comparison with the discrete cosine transform (DCT) reconstruction problem is given.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Edge Identification and Classification Performance</head><p>To evaluate the usefulness of the edge model analysis for edge identification and classification, edges were identified in original images prior to subband analysis, and then the corre- sponding horizontal and vertical high-frequency classifications were determined using the HL and LH subbands, respectively. Evaluation therefore consists of two parts: accurate edge identification in the original image and subsequent determination of high-frequency classification.</p><p>Edges were identified using pixels in the original image to the left (top) of and to the right (bottom) of the coefficient subsampling points.

Because HFV was not allowed in both directions, HFV classifications do not contribute to reconstruction errors.</p><p>For all edge thresholds as the coefficient threshold increases, the numbers of normal classifications increase, while the numbers of edge and HFV classifications decrease because the number of coefficients exceeding the threshold decreases. For a fixed coefficient threshold the ratio of percentages of edges to percentages of normal classifications (edges:normal) decreases as the edge threshold increases. is the edge difference, and as it increases, the size of the large high-frequency coefficients increases, making them larger and hence easier to identify. Because the normal classifications are considered erroneous, the coefficient threshold that maximizes the edges:normal ratio will minimize reconstruction errors caused by misclassification. The results given in Tables V and VI indicate that selecting 2 maximizes this ratio for all edge thresholds given. Results for horizontal edges yield the same threshold. For 2, 35-50% of the edges will be reconstructed one dimensionally in the opposite direction. Of the remaining edges, approximately 30-40% are classified as edges, 10-20% are classified as edges, and 10-20% are misclassified as normal. However, the misclassified edges are not guaranteed to be incorrectly reconstructed. Normal edges are interpolated at location 1/2, which would be correct for 50% of the cases as given by Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>. Simulations to visually examine the effect of the coefficient threshold for identification of large coefficients in the LH and HL subbands verified that the best visual results and the highest PSNR's are obtained with a threshold of 2 for one decomposition level. Because the energy in the QMF's is the threshold should increase by a factor of 2 for each decomposition level, and simulations with two and three decomposition levels verified this.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Implementation Aspects</head><p>This section describes system-level packetization and coding requirements to facilitate subband coefficient reconstruction using the proposed algorithm. While compression efficiency may suffer slightly, the ability to gracefully recover from packet loss is far greater with the system requirements discussed here. Computational complexity is also described.</p><p>Coefficients at the lowest decomposition level are packetized within each subband, so that if a low-frequency coefficient is lost, the high-frequency coefficients corresponding to the same spatial location are not lost along with it. Note that this packetization strategy still permits progressive transmission, and if packets are lost and reconstruction is performed, only one level of progression is lost. When packetized, data is assumed to be interleaved within subbands, so that large continguous areas of loss within a subband are avoided, thereby allowing reconstruction using neighboring coefficients. Coded data is transmitted in a predetermined order, and sequence numbers as inserted into each packet, enabling the detection of lost packets. Thus the locations of lost coefficients are known at the decoder. Any source coding techniques can be applied to the subband coefficients, provided that the resulting stream can be packetized such that loss of a packet does not affect decoding of subsequent packets. For example, scalar quantization, vector quantization, or transform coding of the subband coefficients followed by variable-length coding are acceptable providing only that the variable-length codes are self-contained within packets. Huffman coding of coefficients is acceptable when packet boundaries fall between codewords, while segmenting an arithmetically coded stream across several packets is not acceptable, as loss of any packet destroys synchronization at the decoder. Proposed subband coding techniques that can immediately be used with the described intraband coding, interleaving, and packetization requirements include <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>The compression efficiency is affected by the packetization requirements described in the previous paragraph if fixedlength packets are used. Assume that a packet contains data bits and that exceeds the length of the longest codeword (packet overhead bits are not included in the calculations, because they are present regardless of how the data bits are placed in packets). With the average codeword length in coded subband given by assuming that all codeword lengths are equally likely to overflow a packet yields an expected fractional increase in the data stream of where is the floor operator and the numerator represents the average number of bits per packet that are unused when transmitting subband Note that if the codeword lengths are fixed, and the increase can be 0 if is a multiple of all 's. For example, for the fixed-length technique presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> (fixed-rate lattice vector quantization, for Lena at 0.25 b/pixel, PSNR 31.4 dB), with ATM packets with 384, the increase is 14%. For the variable-length technique presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> (entropy-constrained lattice vector quantization, for Lena at 0.136 b/pixel, PSNR 30.9 dB), again using ATM packets, the increase is 4%. The smaller increase in the cited variable-length technique is due to shorter average codeword lengths, caused by using vector dimensions smaller than those used in the fixed-length technique. With shorter average codeword lengths, the number of unused bits is on average smaller. The fixed increase in data rate with the proposed reconstruction technique does not limit the amount of lost data that can be reconstructed. In contrast, forward error correction (FEC) or retransmission limit the amount of data that can be reconstructed to at most the amount of overhead information, and possibly less, depending on spacings of lost data in case of FEC and transmission success in the case of retransmission. As such, the proposed reconstruction technique is more efficient in dealing with higher loss percentages.</p><p>Computational overhead at the decoder is a function of the number of decompositions and the filter length. For a 5-tap symmetric filter (i.e., having three unique values), the decoder overhead per percentage of lost coefficients across all bands is 0.5% for one level of decomposition. For longer filters and higher numbers of decomposition levels, these values decrease.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Performance Simulations</head><p>Algorithm performance was evaluated by reconstructing random loss of three coefficient groupings across all subbands at all decomposition levels: single coefficients, vectors of length 4, and blocks of size 2</p><p>2. These three groupings may appear in source coding of the subbands using scalar quantization, vector quantization, and transform coding, for example. Random loss was selected using the assumption that the packetized data was interleaved within subbands, avoiding large areas of continguous loss.</p><p>The most accurate reconstruction is achieved when all coefficients used in interpolation and derivative estimation are known. If there is a horizontal or vertical vector or low-frequency coefficients lost, near-optimal reconstruction is also achieved because half-derivatives can be used. If coefficients are coded in horizontal or vertical vectors, better reconstruction is obtained if vectors are staggered down rows or columns. In the case of length-4 vectors, the LH and HL bands were assumed vectorized in the high-frequency direction to minimize the number of adjacent lost coefficients in the low-frequency direction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Unquantized Subband Performance</head><p>The Couple image was subband decomposed to 1, 2, and 3 levels using both odd-and even-length QMF's as given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In general, the reconstructed LH and HL bands provide accurate information for edge placement. Lowfrequency reconstruction performs well on horizontal, vertical, and strong diagonal edges. To demonstrate algorithm performance on diagonal edges and to contrast the performance of the proposed algorithm with standard bicubic interpolation, an enlarged section of the curtains in the Couple image is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>. In general, one-directional high-frequency patterns are maintained, and spatial masking tends to reduce the visual effects of errors in multidirectional patterns. Setting lost HH coefficients to zero produces negligible visual effects. One-and two-level decompositions of a segment of Couple suffering 10% random vector loss and reconstructed using the algorithm are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>.</p><p>Loss and reconstruction of individual coefficients produces slightly higher PSNR's than vectors, which in turn have slightly higher PSNR's than 2 2 block loss. Randomly lost coefficients are most likely to have the highest number of known coefficients required in interpolation present. Randomly lost vectors are only missing coefficients in one direction, while blocks require the most coefficient estimation for use in interpolation. A plot of PSNR versus precentage loss for three types of loss for both one and two decomposition levels is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>.</p><p>The visual effects of errors in low-frequency reconstruction change as the number of decomposition levels increases. At one decomposition level, errors in edge reconstruction are visible as small, sharp discontinuities in edges. At two and three levels, edge reconstruction errors are visible as slight or moderate blurring in the vicinity of an edge, caused by multiple levels of upsampling and filtering. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref> indicates that there is a difference of approximately 2 dB between reconstructed quality of the same types of loss at one and two levels of decomposition on unquantized data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Quantized Subband Performance</head><p>To evaluate performance on quantized as well as unquantized coefficients, the low-frequency subband was quantized using scalar quantizers designed for a Gaussian distribution using the Lloyd-Max algorithm, and the high-frequency subbands were quantized using scalar quantizers designed for a generalized Gaussian distribution with parameter 0.7, again using the Lloyd-Max algorithm. Bit allocations were chosen for constant quality, specifically, the PSNR of the synthesized quantized subbands was 35 dB. This value was selected because the corresponding bit allocations provided the highest compression ratio in which objectionable quantization artifacts (e.g., splotching and excessive graininess) were not visible in a one decomposition level synthesized image. (The data was quantized to evaluate algorithm performance, not to demonstrate a compression technique. In an actual implementation, variable-length coding would follow the quantization to provide more realistic compression ratios. The bit rates quoted do not include entropy coding.)</p><p>When the subband data is quantized, the PSNR spread drops, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">12</ref> for one decomposition level. Quantization of the high-frequency subbands at the lowest decomposition level affects the reconstruction quality of the LL subband. Quantization that is too coarse destroys the edge classification patterns used to identify edges. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13</ref> compares the MSE of the reconstructed LL coefficients at 1-30% random loss for four different high-frequency bit allocations. The LL band bit allocation is constant at 5 b/sample (32-level quantizer), while the HL and LH bands are quantized to 2, 4, 8, and 16 levels (the HH band is omitted). With 16 quantization levels for the high-frequency bands, the MSE is within 20% of the nonquantized MSE. Visually, errors begin to appear with a four-level quantizer, and a two-level quantizer produces unacceptable reconstructed edges. Four levels is also the minimum required to avoid excessive graininess in the synthesized image, so it appears that provided the bit allocation does not produce graininess, the reconstruction algorithm will work. For two decomposition levels with 7 b/sample in the LL band, reconstruction errors induced by high-frequency band quantization appear at 4 b/sample in the LH and HL bands at the lowest decomposition level, while graininess appears at 3 b/sample. Reconstruction errors in two decomposition levels tend to be minimized in visual impact due to two stages of upsampling and lowpass filtering, compared to only one in a one level decomposition.</p><p>One-and two-level quantized decompositions of a segment of Couple suffering 10% random vector loss and reconstructed using the algorithm are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">14</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">15</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Comparison with DCT Reconstruction</head><p>Despite the fact that DCT reconstruction differs greatly from subband coefficient reconstruction with respect to both data characteristics and the effects of packet loss, the widespread use of the DCT suggests a brief comparison of the two  reconstruction problems and solutions. This section briefly describes the DCT reconstruction problem and several proposed solutions and how they compare with the technique presented in this paper.</p><p>An 8 8 discrete cosine transform applied to an image consists of segmenting the image into independent 8 8 blocks of pixels and then performing a DCT on each block. This can be viewed as a 64-band subband decomposition using eight length-8 filters in a separable application with decimation by eight, where the filters are the time-reversed DCT basis functions. In this case, there is still one low-frequency band (corresponding to filtering with the time-reversed zeroth-order basis function) but seven high-frequency bands. The filter length is equal to the decimation factor, so nonspatially colocated coefficients contribute to independent pixels. The baseline Joint Photographers Expert Group (JPEG) compression algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> only allows entire blocks of coefficients (i.e., all 64) to be coded together, and intraband coding is therefore precluded. As such, packet losses affect all 64 coefficients and, hence, pixels in a block. Reconstruction of a lost DCT block can be performed either in the pixel domain or in the coefficient domain. In either case, 64 values must be reconstructed, representing all information about a spatial location; no interband correlation can be used. Selection of the DCT in JPEG is based in part on its asymptotic equivalence to the KLT, the optimal decorrelating transform, and experiments have shown that DCT coefficients within a block are only weakly correlated <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. This, combined with the fact that packet loss affects entire blocks, precludes exploitation of any interband correlation to aid in reconstruction. Because the coefficients within a block are only weakly correlated and a relatively large amount of spatial information is lost, assumptions must be made about the structure of the lost block to reconstruct it. With entire blocks being reconstructed, a common reconstruction artifact is blocking, and most reconstruction techniques either implicitly or explicitly attempt to minimize blockiness. In the pixel domain, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> describes an iterative technique to generate minimum variance estimates of the pixels. More successful results have been reported in the coefficient domain. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, all blocks are assumed to be smooth, both in the interior and along boundaries with adjacent blocks, and only the 15 lowestfrequency coefficients are generated. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, only smoothness with adjacent blocks is assumed, and lost blocks are generated as a linear combination of available adjacent blocks. Overhead information is transmitted with the image in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> to aid in reconstruction, and again linear combinations of blocks are used. In all of the above techniques, when the data matches the assumptions, the reconstructed image quality can be quite good. However, when the data does not match the assumptions, in the best case the reconstructed blocks may be visually acceptable but may differ greatly from the original blocks, and in the worst case, severe blocking artifacts may appear.</p><p>In comparison, the subband technique presented in this paper relies on both intraband and interband correlation to reconstruct lost subband coefficients. Filter lengths longer than the decimation factor in the subband decomposition eliminate or greatly reduce blocking artifacts and provide greater intraband correlation than in the DCT case. When the packetization strategy is followed, coefficients corresponding to the same spatial location are not all lost, allowing use of the high-frequency information to reconstruct the low-frequency information. A (1-D) two-band decomposition yields a clear delineation between low-frequency and high-frequency information, in contrast with the DCT in which the highfrequency energy is dispersed throughout the seven highfrequency bands. The combination of using the correlations inherent in the coefficients and a packetization strategy where not all coefficients in a single location are lost provides reconstructed images with equal or better subjective quality than in the DCT case. Quantitatively, the PSNR's of both reconstruction techniques on the quantized Couple image with 10% random loss are approximately equal, around 32 dB <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. In summary, the technique presented in this paper is specialized to the properties of the subband decomposition and exploits them to maximize the reconstructed image quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. SUMMARY</head><p>A decoder-based reconstruction algorithm for hierarchical subband-coded images using QMF's has been developed. Interband relationships based on QMF properties were derived and used to accurately reconstruct edge structures in the visually important lowest frequency band, thus assuring minimal visual distractions in the synthesized reconstructed image due to errors in strong edges. The analysis also permits edge identification in the low-frequency subband by examining only the high-frequency coefficients. Surface fitting using 2-D bicubic interpolation provides the smooth characteristics required of the lowest frequency band while providing a simple technique for placing the edges, by simply adapting the 2-D interpolation grid.</p><p>The algorithm is applicable to a variety of source coding coefficient groupings, e.g., pulse-code modulation, vector quantization, or small block-based transform coding, and is applicable to progression transmission or multirate applications. By requiring only the lowest decomposition level for reconstruction of the lowest frequency band, the progressive transmission quality of hierarchical subband coding is preserved. Once the LL band has been reconstructed, the lowest level can be synthesized, so only one level of progression has been lost. The high-frequency bands from higher decomposition levels can then be reconstructed and used in refinement as they are received. In multiresolution applications, again only one level of multiresolution decomposition is lost. Flexibility across both coding and transmission techniques, combined with the low computational complexity and good quality, makes the algorithm a strong candidate for applications in which reconstruction of hierarchical subband-coded data with minimal system changes is required.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
