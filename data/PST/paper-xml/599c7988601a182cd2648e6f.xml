<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The capacity of cellular networks can be improved by the unprecedented array gain and spatial multiplexing offered by Massive MIMO. Since its inception, the coherent interference caused by pilot contamination has been believed to create a finite capacity limit, as the number of antennas goes to infinity. In this paper, we prove that this is incorrect and an artifact from using simplistic channel models and suboptimal precoding/combining schemes. We show that with multicell MMSE precoding/combining and a tiny amount of spatial channel correlation or large-scale fading variations over the array, the capacity increases without bound as the number of antennas increases, even under pilot contamination. More precisely, the result holds when the channel covariance matrices of the contaminating users are asymptotically linearly independent, which is generally the case. If also the diagonals of the covariance matrices are linearly independent, it is sufficient to know these diagonals (and not the full covariance matrices) to achieve an unlimited asymptotic capacity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The Shannon capacity of a channel manifests the spectral efficiency (SE) that it supports. Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) improves the sum SE of cellular networks by spatial multiplexing of a large number of user equipments (UEs) per cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. It is therefore considered a key timedivision duplex (TDD) technology for the next generation of cellular networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The main difference between Massive MIMO and classical multiuser MIMO is the large number of antennas, M , at each base station (BS) whose signals are processed by individual radio-frequency chains. By exploiting channel estimates for coherent receive combining, the uplink signal power of a desired UE is reinforced by a factor M , while the power of the noise and independent interference does not increase. The same principle holds for the transmit precoding in the downlink. Since the channel estimates are obtained by uplink pilot signaling and the pilot resources are limited by the channel coherence time, the same pilots must be reused in multiple cells. This leads to E. Björnson is with the Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden (emil.bjornson@liu.se). J. Hoydis is with Nokia Bell Labs, Paris-Saclay, 91620 Nozay, France (jakob.hoydis@nokia-bell-labs.com). L. Sanguinetti is with the University of Pisa, Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Informazione, Italy (luca.sanguinetti@unipi.it) and also with the Large Systems and Networks Group (LANEAS), CentraleSupélec, Université Paris-Saclay, 3 rue Joliot-Curie, 91192 Gif-sur-Yvette, France. The authors have contributed equally to this work and are listed alphabetically.</p><p>This research has been supported by ELLIIT, the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SFF), the EU FP7 under ICT-619086 (MAMMOET), and the ERC Starting Grant 305123 MORE.</p><p>Parts of this paper were presented at the International Conference on Communications (ICC), 21-25 May, 2017, Paris, France.</p><p>pilot contamination which has two main consequences: the channel estimation quality is reduced due to pilot interference and the channel estimate of a desired UE is correlated with the channels to the interfering UEs that use the same pilot. Marzetta showed in his seminal paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> that the interference from these UEs during data transmission is also reinforced by a factor M , under the assumptions of maximum ratio (MR) combining/precoding and independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading channels. This means that pilot contamination creates a finite SE limit as M → ∞.</p><p>The large-antenna limit has also been studied for other combining/precoding, such as the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) scheme. Single-cell MMSE (S-MMSE) was considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, while multicell MMSE (M-MMSE) was considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The difference is that with M-MMSE the BS makes use of estimates of the channels from the UEs in all cells, while with S-MMSE the BS only uses channel estimates of the UEs in the own cell. In both cases, the SE was proved to have a finite limit as M → ∞, under the assumption of i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channels (i.e., no spatial correlation). In contrast, there are special cases of spatially correlated fading that give rise to rank-deficient covariance matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. If the UEs that share a pilot have rankdeficient covariance matrices with orthogonal support, then pilot contamination vanishes and the SE can increase without bound. The covariance matrices R 1 and R 2 have orthogonal support if R 1 R 2 = 0. To understand this condition, note that for arbitrary covariance matrices</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R 1 = a c c b R 2 = d f f e<label>(1)</label></formula><p>every element of R 1 R 2 must be zero. The first element is ad + cf . If we model the practical covariance matrices of two randomly located UEs as realizations of a random variable with continuous distribution, then ad + cf = 0 occurs with zero probability. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> Hence, orthogonal support is very unlikely in practice, although one can find special cases where it is satisfied. The one-ring model for uniform linear arrays (ULAs) gives orthogonal support if the channels have non-overlapping angular support <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, but the ULA microwave measurements in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> show that the angular support of practical channels is highly irregular and does not lead to orthogonal support. In conclusion, practical covariance matrices do not have orthogonal support, at least not at microwave frequencies. The literature contains several categories of methods for mitigation of pilot contamination, also known as pilot decontamination. The first category allocates pilots to the UEs in an attempt to find combinations where the covariance matrices have relatively different support <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. This method can substantially reduce pilot contamination, but can only remove the finite limit in the unlikely special case when the covariance matrices have orthogonal support. The second category utilizes semi-blind estimation to separate the subspace of desired UE channels from the subspace of interfering channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. This method can fully remove pilot contamination if M and the size of the channel coherence block go jointly to infinity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Unfortunately, the channel coherence is fixed and finite in practice (this is why we cannot give unique pilots to every cell), thus we cannot approach this limit in practice. The third category uses multiple pilot phases with different pilot sequences to successively eliminate pilot contamination <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, without the need for statistical information. However, the total pilot length is larger or equal to the total number of UEs, which would allow allocating mutually orthogonal pilots to all UEs and thus trivially avoiding the pilot contamination problem. This is not a scalable solution for networks with many cells. The fourth category is pilot contamination precoding that rejects interference by coherent joint transmission/reception over the entire network <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. This method appears to achieve an unbounded SE, but this has not been formally proved and requires that the data for all UEs is available at every BS, which might not be feasible in practice.</p><p>In summary, it appears that pilot contamination is a fundamental issue that manifests a finite SE limit, except in unlikely special cases. We show in this paper that this is basically a misunderstanding, spurred by the popularity of analyzing suboptimal combining/precoding schemes, such as MR and S-MMSE, and focusing on unrealistic i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channels (as in the prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> on M-MMSE). We prove that the SE increases without bound in the presence of pilot contamination when using M-MMSE combining/precoding, if the pilot-sharing UEs have asymptotically linearly independent covariance matrices. Note that R 1 and R 2 in (1) are linearly independent if [a b c] T and [d e f ] T are non-parallel vectors, which happens almost surely for randomly generated covariance matrices. Hence, our results rely on a condition that is most likely satisfied in practice-it is the general case, while prior works on the asymptotics of Massive MIMO have considered practically unlikely special cases. In contrast to prior work, no multicell cooperation is utilized herein and there is no need for orthogonal support of covariance matrices. In the conference paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, we proved the main result in a two-user uplink scenario. 2 In this paper, we prove the result for both uplink and downlink in a general setting. Section II proves and explains the intuition of the results in a two-user setup, while Section III generalizes the results to a multicell setup. The results are demonstrated numerically in Section IV and the main conclusions are summarized in Section V. 2 After submitting our conference paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the related work <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> appeared. That paper considers the mean squared error in the uplink data detection of a single cell with multiple UEs per pilot sequence. The authors show that the error goes asymptotically to zero for linearly independent covariance matrices. However, the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> contains no mathematical analysis of the achievable SE.</p><p>Notation: The Frobenius and spectral norms of a matrix X are denoted by X F and X 2 , respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. ASYMPTOTIC SPECTRAL EFFICIENCY IN A TWO-USER SCENARIO</head><p>In this section, we prove and explain our main result in a two-user scenario, where a BS equipped with M antennas communicates with UE 1 and UE 2 that are using the same pilot. This setup is sufficient to demonstrate why M-MMSE combining and precoding reject the coherent interference caused by pilot contamination. We consider a block-fading model where each channel takes one realization in a coherence block of τ c channel uses and independent realizations across blocks. We denote by h k ∈ C M the channel from UE k to the BS and consider Rayleigh fading with</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">h k ∼ N C (0, R k ) for k = 1, 2, where R k ∈ C M ×M with 3 tr(R k ) &gt; 0 is the chan- nel covariance</formula><p>matrix, which is assumed to be known at the BS. The Gaussian distribution models the small-scale fading whereas the covariance matrix R k describes the macroscopic effects. The normalized trace β k = 1 M tr (R k ) determines the average large-scale fading between UE k and the BS, while the eigenstructure of R k describes the spatial channel correlation. A special case that is convenient for analysis is i.i.d. Rayleigh fading with R k = β k I M <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, but it only arises in fully isotropic fading environments. In general, each covariance matrix has spatial correlation and large-scale fading variations over the array, represented by non-zero off-diagonal elements and non-identical diagonal elements, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Uplink Channel Estimation</head><p>We assume that the BS and UEs are perfectly synchronized and operate according to a TDD protocol wherein the data transmission phase is preceded by an uplink pilot phase for channel estimation. Both UEs use the same τ p -length pilot sequence φ ∈ C τp with elements such that φ 2 = φ H φ = 1. The received uplink signal Y p ∈ C N ×τp at the BS is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Y p = ρ tr h 1 φ T + ρ tr h 2 φ T + N p (2)</formula><p>where ρ tr is the normalized pilot power and N p ∈ C N ×τp is the normalized receiver noise with all elements independently distributed as N C (0, 1). The matrix Y p is the observation that the BS utilizes to estimate h 1 and h 2 . We assume that channel estimation is performed using the MMSE estimator given in the next lemma (the proof relies on standard estimation theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>).</p><p>Lemma 1. The MMSE estimator of h k for k = 1, 2, based on the observation Y p at the BS, is ĥk = 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ρ tr R k Q -1 Y p φ (3) with Q = 1 ρ tr E{Y p φ (Y p φ ) H } = R 1 + R 2 + 1</formula><p>ρ tr I M being the normalized covariance matrix of the observation after correlating with the pilot sequence. The estimate ĥk and the estimation error hk = h k -ĥk are independent random vectors distributed as ĥk</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">∼ N C (0, Φ k ) and hk ∼ N C (0, R k -Φ k ) with Φ k = R k Q -1 R k .</formula><p>Interestingly, the estimates ĥ1 and ĥ2 are computed in an almost identical way in (3): the same matrix Q is inverted and multiplied with the same observation Y p φ / ρ tr . The only difference is that for ĥk there is a multiplication with the UE's own channel covariance matrix R k in (3), for k = 1, 2. The channel estimates are thus correlated with correlation matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Υ 12 = E{ ĥ1 ĥH 2 } = R 1 Q -1 R 2 .</formula><p>If R 1 is invertible, then we can also write the relation between the estimates as ĥ2 = R 2 R -1 1 ĥ1 . In the special case of i.i.d. fading channels with R 1 = β 1 I M and R 2 = β 2 I M , the two channel estimates are parallel vectors that only differ in scaling: ĥ2 = β2 β1 ĥ1 . This is an unwanted property caused by the inability of the BS to separate UEs that have transmitted the same pilot sequence over channels that are identically distributed (up to a scaling factor). In the alternative special case of R 1 R 2 = 0 M , the two UE channels are located in orthogonal subspaces (i.e., have orthogonal support), which leads to zero correlation: Υ 12 = 0 M . Consequently, it is theoretically possible to let two UEs share a pilot sequence without causing pilot contamination, if their covariance matrices satisfy the orthogonality condition R 1 R 2 = 0 M . As described in Section I, none of these special cases occur in practice, therefore we will develop a general way to deal with the correlation of channel estimates caused by pilot contamination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Uplink Data Transmission</head><p>During uplink data transmission, the received baseband signal at the BS is y ∈ C M , given by y = ρ ul h 1 s 1 + ρ ul h 2 s 2 + n, where s k ∼ N C (0, 1) is the informationbearing signal transmitted by UE k, n ∼ N C (0, I M ) is the independent receiver noise, and ρ ul is the normalized transmit power. The BS detects the signal from UE 1 by using a combining vector v 1 ∈ C M to obtain v H 1 y. Using a standard technique (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>), the ergodic uplink capacity of UE 1 is lower bounded by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">SE ul 1 = 1 - τ p τ c E log 2 1 + γ ul 1 [bit/s/Hz]<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where the expectation is with respect to the channel estimates. We refer to SE ul 1 as an achievable SE. The instantaneous effective signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) γ ul 1 in (4) is</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">γ ul 1 = |v H 1 ĥ1 | 2 E |v H 1 h1 | 2 + |v H 1 h 2 | 2 + 1 ρ ul v H 1 v 1 ĥ1 , ĥ2 = |v H 1 ĥ1 | 2 v H 1 ĥ2 ĥH 2 + Z v 1 (5) with Z = 2 k=1 (R k -Φ k )+ 1 ρ ul I M .</formula><p>Since γ ul 1 is a generalized Rayleigh quotient, the SINR is maximized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_8">v 1 = 2 k=1 ĥk ĥH k + Z -1 ĥ1 .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>This is called MMSE combining since ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">6</ref>) not only maximizes the instantaneous SINR γ ul 1 , but also minimizes E{|x 1v H 1 y| 2 | ĥ1 , ĥ2 } which is the mean squared error (MSE) in the data detection (conditioned on the channel estimates). Plugging (6) into (5) yields</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">γ ul 1 = ĥH 1 ĥ2 ĥH 2 + Z -1 ĥ1 .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>We will now analyze the asymptotic behavior of SE ul 1 and γ ul 1 as M → ∞. To this end, we make the following technical assumptions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Assumption 1. For k = 1, 2, lim inf M 1 M tr(R k ) &gt; 0 and lim sup M R k 2 &lt; ∞. Assumption 2. For λ = [λ 1 , λ 2 ] T ∈ R 2 and i = 1, 2, lim inf M inf {λ: λi=1} 1 M λ 1 R 1 + λ 2 R 2 2 F &gt; 0.<label>(8)</label></formula><p>The first assumption is a well established way to model that the array gathers more energy as M increases and also that this energy originates from many spatial dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In particular, it is a sufficient condition for asymptotic channel hardening; that is, h k 2 /E{ h k 2 } → 1 in probability as M → ∞. The second assumption requires R 1 and R 2 to be asymptotically linearly independent, in the sense that if one of the matrices is scaled to resemble the other one, the subspace in which the matrices differ has an energy proportional to M . Note that this is a stronger condition than linear independence, defined as inf {λ:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">λi=1} λ 1 R 1 + λ 2 R 2 2 F &gt; 0 for i = 1, 2,</formula><p>which is satisfied even if the matrices only differ in one element. We will elaborate further on Assumption 2 in Section II-D.</p><p>The following is the first of the main results of this paper: Observe that if R 1 and R 2 are linearly dependent, i.e., R 1 = ηR 2 , then Assumption 2 does not hold. Under these circumstances, ĥ2 = 1 η ĥ1 and by applying Lemma 5 in Appendix A we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Theorem 1. If MMSE</formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">γ ul 1 = ĥH 1 Z -1 ĥ1 1 + 1 η 2 ĥH 1 Z -1 ĥ1<label>(9)</label></formula><p>from which, it is straightforward to show that γ ul 1 η 2 (by dividing and multiplying each term by M and using Lemma 3 in Appendix A). This implies that SE ul 1 converges to a finite quantity when M → ∞, as Marzetta showed in his seminal paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for the special case of R 1 = ηR 2 = I M .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Downlink Data Transmission</head><p>During the downlink data transmission, the BS transmits the signal x ∈ C M . This signal is given by x = ρ dl w 1 ς 1 + ρ dl w 2 ς 2 , where ς k ∼ N C (0, 1) is the information-bearing signal transmitted to UE k, ρ dl is the normalized downlink transmit power, and w k is the precoding vector associated with UE k. This precoding vector satisfies E w k 2 = 1, so that E w k ς k 2 = ρ dl is the downlink transmit power allocated to UE k. The received downlink signal z 1 at UE 1 is 4</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">z 1 = ρ dl h H 1 w 1 ς 1 + ρ dl h H 1 w 2 ς 2 + n 1 = ρ dl E {h H 1 w 1 } ς 1 + ρ dl (h H 1 w 1 -E {h H 1 w 1 })ς 1 + ρ dl h H 1 w 2 ς 2 + n 1<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where n 1 ∼ N C (0, 1) is the normalized receiver noise. The first term in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> is the desired signal received over the deterministic average precoded channel E {h H 1 w 1 }, while the remaining terms are random variables with unknown realizations. By treating these terms as noise in the signal detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the downlink ergodic channel capacity of UE 1 can be lower bounded by</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">SE dl 1 = 1 - τ p τ c log 2 1 + γ dl 1 [bit/s/Hz]<label>(11)</label></formula><p>with the effective SINR</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">γ dl 1 = |E{h H 1 w 1 }| 2 E {|h H 1 w 2 | 2 } + V {h H 1 w 1 } + 1 ρ dl .

In contrast to the uplink, there is no precoding that is always optimal <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. However, motivated by uplink-downlink duality 4 For notational convenience, we treat h H 1 and h H 2 as the downlink channels, instead of h T 1 and h T 2 . This has no impact on the SE since the difference is only in a complex conjugate.</p><p>[9], a reasonable suboptimal choice is the so-called MMSE precoding</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">w k = v k E { v k 2 } = ϑ k 2 k=1 ĥk ĥH k + Z -1 ĥk<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">v k = ( 2 k=1 ĥk ĥH k +Z) -1 ĥk is MMSE combining and ϑ k = (E v k</formula><p>2 ) -1 is a scaling factor. The following is the second main result of this paper: Theorem 2. If MMSE precoding is used, then under Assumptions 1 and 2 the effective SINR γ dl 1 increases unboundedly as M → ∞. Hence, SE dl 1 increases unboundedly as M → ∞. Proof: The proof is given in Appendix D. This theorem shows that, under the same conditions as in the uplink, the downlink SE (and thus the capacity) increases without bound as M → ∞. The asymptotic SE growth is proportional to log 2 (M ), since the proof in Appendix D shows that γ dl 1 /M has a non-zero asymptotic limit. UE 2 can simultaneously achieve an unbounded SE, which is proved directly by interchanging the UE indices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Interpretation and Generality</head><p>Theorems 1 and 2 show that the SE (and thus the capacity) under pilot contamination is asymptotically unlimited if Assumption 2 holds. To gain an intuitive interpretation of this underlying assumption, recall from (3) that ĥ1 = R 1 a and ĥ2 = R 2 a, where a = 1 √ ρ tr Q -1 Y p φ * is the same for both UEs. Hence, ĥ1 and ĥ2 are (asymptotically) linearly independent when R 1 and R 2 are (asymptotically) linearly independent, except for special choices of a. As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, it is then possible to find a combining vector v 1 (or precoding vector w 1 ) that is orthogonal to ĥ2 , while being non-orthogonal to ĥ1 . Similarly, one can find v 2 (and w 2 ) such that v H 2 ĥ1 = 0 and v H 2 ĥ2 = 0. For example, if we define</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">Ĥ = [ ĥ1 ĥ2 ] ∈ C M ×2 , then the zero-forcing (ZF) combining vectors v 1 v 2 = Ĥ ĤH Ĥ -1<label>(14)</label></formula><p>satisfy these conditions.

If the channel estimates are also asymptotically linearly independent, it follows 5 that v 1 2 → 0 as M → ∞; that is, we can reject the coherent interference and get unit signal gain, while at the same time using the array gain to make the noise term 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">ρ ul v H 1 v 1 = 1 ρ ul v 1 2</formula><p>vanish asymptotically. Since optimal MMSE combining (and also MMSE precoding) provides a higher SINR than the heuristic ZF scheme in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, it also rejects the coherent interference while retaining an array gain that grows with M .</p><p>To further explain the implications of Assumption 2, we provide the following three examples. 5 Notice that, by applying Lemma 3 in Appendix A, we have Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>: If the pilot-contaminated channel estimates are linearly independent (i.e., not parallel), there exists a combining vector v1 that rejects the pilot-contaminated interference from UE 2 in the uplink, while the desired signal remains due to v H 1 ĥ1 = 0.

Example 2. Channels with i.i.d. fading, where the covariance matrices are R 1 = β 1 I M and R 2 = β 2 I M , are a notable case when the covariance matrices are not linearly independent.

Since every random variable has non-zero variance and β 1 &gt; 0, we conclude that {R 1 , R 2 } satisfy (8) and thus Assumption 2 holds.</p><p>The key implication from Example 2 is that all cases where R 1 and R 2 are equal (up to a scaling factor) are non-robust to random perturbations and thus anomalies. Since practical propagation environments are irregular and behave randomly (see the measurements reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>), linear dependent covariance matrices are not appearing in practice and Assumption 2 is generally satisfied.

Note that the matrix inverse in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> only exists if b 11 b 22 = b 12 b 21 , which is again the condition for linear independence of the covariance matrices. Since pilot contamination precoding can only be applied in special multicell cooperation cases, MMSE combining/precoding is generally the preferable choice.</p><p>Remark 2 (Acquiring Covariance Matrices). Theorems 1 and 2 exploit the MMSE estimator and thus the BS needs to know the (deterministic) channel statistics. In particular, the BS can only compute the MMSE estimate ĥk in Lemma 1 if it knows R k and also the sum R 1 +R 2 of the two covariance matrices. In practice, R k can be estimated by a regularized sample covariance matrix, given realizations of h k over multiple resource blocks (e.g., different times and frequencies) where this channel is either observed in only noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> or where some observations are regular pilot transmissions containing the desired channel plus interference/noise and some contain only the interference/noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. It seems that around M samples are needed to obtain a sufficiently accurate covariance estimate <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The covariance estimation can be further improved if the channels have a known structure. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> provides algorithms for estimating the covariance matrices of channels that have limited angle-delay support that is also separable between users.</p></div>

Let S jk ⊆ { ĥjlk : ∀l = j} denote a subset of the estimated interfering channels that form a basis for all interfering channels.

For an angleof-arrival (AoA) θ and many scatterers that are uniformly distributed in the angular interval</p><formula xml:id="formula_72">[θ -∆, θ + ∆], the (m, n)th element of R is [R] m,n = β 2∆ ∆ -∆ e πı(n-m) sin(θ+δ) dδ.</formula><p>2) Exponential correlation model for a ULA with correlation factor r ∈ [0, 1] between adjacent antennas, average largescale fading β, and AoA θ <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, which leads to [R] m,n = βr |n-m| e ı(n-m)θ .</p><p>3) Uncorrelated Rayleigh fading with average large-scale fading β and independent log-normal large-scale fading variations over the array, which gives (similar to the perturbations considered in Example 2) R = βdiag 10 f1/10 , . . . , 10 f M /10</p><p>(42</p><formula xml:id="formula_73">)</formula><p>where f m ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) and σ denotes the standard deviation. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the eigenvalue distribution with the three covariance models above, for M = 100 antennas, uniformly distributed AoAs θ in [-π, +π), β = 1, ∆ = 15 • , r = 0.5, and σ = 2. All three models create eigenvalue variations, but  there are substantial differences. The one-ring model provides rank-deficient covariance matrices, where a large fraction of the eigenvalues is zero (this fraction is computed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>). In contrast, the other two models provide full-rank covariance matrices with more modest eigenvalue variations. In the remainder, we consider the latter two models to emphasize that our main results only require linear independence between the covariance matrices, not rank-deficiency (which in special cases give rise to orthogonal covariance supports <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Uplink</head><p>We consider the challenging symmetric setup in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> with L = 4 cells, K = 2 UEs per cell, pilots of length τ p = K, and coherence blocks of τ c = 200 channel uses. The BSs are located at the four corners of the area and the UEs are all located at the cell edges and have similar but non-identical AoAs and distances to the BSs. Thus, the pilot contamination is very large in this setup. Note that the star-marked UEs share a pilot, while the plus-marked UEs share another pilot.</p><p>The asymptotic behavior of the uplink SE is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> using the exponential correlation model (r = 0.5), with M-1536-1276 (c) 2017 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission. See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information. MMSE, S-MMSE, MR, and M-ZF, where the latter cancels interference between all UEs. The SE per UE is shown as a function of the number of antennas, in logarithmic scale. The average SNR observed at a BS antenna is set equal in the pilot and data transmission: ρ ul tr(R jli )/M = ρ tr tr(R jli )/M . It is -6.0 dB for the intracell UEs and between -6.3 dB and -11.5 dB for the interfering UEs in other cells. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> shows that S-MMSE provides slightly higher SE than MR, but both converge to asymptotic limits of around 1 bit/s/Hz as M grows. In contrast, M-MMSE provides an SE that grows without bound. The instantaneous effective SINR grows linearly with , which is in line with Theorem 4, as seen from the fact that the SE grows linearly when the horizontal scale is logarithmic. M-ZF performs poorly because the channel estimates are so similar that full interference suppression removes most of the desired signal. In contrast, M-MMSE finds a nontrivial tradeoff between interference suppression and coherent combining of the desired signal, leading to superior SE. The reference curve "time splitting" considers the case when the 4 cells are active in different coherence blocks, to remove pilot contamination. MMSE combining is used and the SE grows without bound, but at a slower pace than with M-MMSE, due to the extra pre-log factor of 1/4. Hence, even for a small system with L = 4, it is inefficient to avoid pilot contamination by time splitting.</p><p>Next, we consider the uncorrelated Rayleigh fading model in (42) with independent large-scale fading variations over the array. The uplink SE with M = 200 antennas and varying standard deviation σ from 0 to 5 is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5(a)</ref>. M-MMSE provides no benefit over S-MMSE or MR in the special case of σ = 0, where the covariance matrices are linearly dependent (i.e., scaled identity matrices). This is a special case that has received massive attention in academic literature, mainly because it simplifies the mathematical analysis. However, M-MMSE provides substantial performance gains over S-MMSE and MR as soon as we depart from the scaled-identity model by adding small variations in the large-scale fading over the array, which make the covariance matrices linearly independent. This is in line with what we demonstrated in Example 2. As the variations increase, the SE with M-ZF improves particularly fast and approaches the SE with M-MMSE. M-ZF will never be the better scheme since M-MMSE is optimal. The motivation behind this simulation is the measurement results reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, which show largescale variations of around 4 dB over a massive MIMO arraythis corresponds to σ ≈ 4 in our setup.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>(b) shows the received power (normalized by the noise power) after receive combining for an arbitrary UE when = 4. It is divided into the desired signal power, the interference from UEs using the same pilot, and the interference from UEs using a different pilot. The figure shows that MR and S-MMSE suffer from strong interference from the UEs that use the same pilot, since these schemes are unable to mitigate the coherent interference caused by pilot contamination. In contrast, M-MMSE and M-ZF mitigate all types of interference and receive roughly the same amount of interference from UEs with the same or different pilots. Note that the price to pay for the interference rejection is a reduction in desired signal power when using M-MMSE and M-ZF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Downlink</head><p>The setup in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> is also used in the downlink wherein we set ρ dl = ρ ul to get the same SNRs as in the uplink. We consider a setup with both spatial channel correlation and large-scale fading variations over the array, such that the EW-MMSE estimator is suboptimal but Assumption 6 is satisfied. More precisely, we consider a combination of the exponential correlation model and (42): [R] m,n = βr |n-m| e ı(n-m)θ 10 (fm+fn)/20 , where θ is the AoA, r = 0.5 is used as correlation factor, and f 1 , . . . , f M ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) give independent large-scale fading variations over the array with σ = 4.</p><p>The downlink SE is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">6</ref> as a function of M , where 6(a) shows results with the MMSE estimator that uses the full channel covariance matrices and 6(b) shows results with the EW-MMSE estimator that only uses the diagonals of the covariance matrices. When using the EW-MMSE estimator, we consider the approximate M-MMSE scheme in (38) and a corresponding approximation of S-MMSE, while M-ZF and MR are as before. The results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">6</ref>(a) with the MMSE estimator are similar to the uplink in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5(a)</ref>: M-MMSE and M-ZF provide SEs that grow without bound,  while the SEs with S-MMSE and MR converge to finite limits. In contrast to the uplink, M-MMSE and M-ZF precoding are both suboptimal in the downlink, but they can be shown to be asymptotically equal. 7 Interestingly, the same behaviors are observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">6</ref>(b) when using the EW-MMSE estimator, which is a suboptimal estimator that neglects the off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrices. This result is in line with Theorem 6. There is a small SE loss (2%-4% for M-MMSE) compared to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6(a)</ref>, but this is a minor price to pay for the greatly simplified acquisition of covariance information (estimating the entire diagonal is as simple as estimating a single parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>).</p><p>We now increase the number of UEs per cell to K = 10, which leads to more interference but the same pilot contamination per UE. The UEs are uniformly and independently distributed in the cell-edge area, which is the shaded area in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. The channel model is the same as in the previous figure. The downlink SE per UE is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref> when using either MMSE or EW-MMSE estimation. The results resemble the ones for K = 2, but the curves are basically shifted to the right due to the additional interference. M-MMSE and M-ZF 7 For M-MMSE precoding in (37), Z j has bounded spectral norm while l i ĥjli ĥH jli has LK eigenvalues that grow unboundedly as M → ∞. As the impact of Z j vanishes, the approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> can be used to prove that M-MMSE approaches M-ZF asymptotically.  provide SEs that grow without bound, while the SE with S-MMSE and MR saturate, but more antennas are needed before reaching saturation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS</head><p>We proved that the capacity of Massive MIMO systems increases without bound as M → ∞ in the presence of pilot contamination, despite the previous results that pointed toward the existence of a finite limit. This was achieved by showing that the conventional lower bounds on the capacity increase without bound when using M-MMSE precoding/combining. These schemes exploit the fact that the MMSE channel estimates of UEs that use the same pilot are linearly independent, due to their generally linearly independent covariance matrices. For our results to hold, the covariance matrices can have full rank and only minor eigenvalue variations. There are special cases where the channel covariance matrices are linearly dependent, but these are not robust to minor perturbations of the covariance matrices. Hence, they are anomalies that will never appear in practice or be drawn from a random distribution, although they have frequently been studied in the academic literature. Since the SE of MR (also known as conjugate beamforming or matched filtering) generally has a finite limit, we conclude that this scheme is not asymptotically optimal in Massive MIMO. Note that our results do not imply that the pilot contamination effect disappears; there is still a performance loss caused by estimation errors and interference rejection, but there is no fundamental capacity limit.</p><p>Most of our results assume that the full covariance matrices of the channels are known, but this is not a critical requirement. Theorems 3 and 6 proved that it is sufficient that the diagonals of the covariance matrices are known and linearly independent between pilot-sharing UEs; a condition that has been shown to hold for practical channels by the measurements in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Such statistical information can be accurately estimated from only some tens of channel observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, whereof some contain the desired signal plus interference/noise and some contain only interference/noise.</p><p>The purpose of analyzing the asymptotic capacity when M → ∞ is not that we advocate the deployment of BSs with a nearly infinite number of antennas-that is physically impossible in a finite-sized world and the conventional channel models will eventually break down since more power is received than was transmitted. The importance of asymptotics is instead what it tells us about practical networks with finite numbers of antennas. For example, consider a network with any finite number of UEs that each have a finite-valued data rate requirement. Our main results imply that we can always satisfy these requirements by deploying sufficiently many antennas, even in the presence of pilot contamination. In fact, it is enough to have two channel uses per coherence block (one for pilot, one for data) to deliver any capacity value to any finite number of UEs. The linear M-MMSE scheme is sufficient to achieve this in practice and interference can be treated as noise in the receivers, because the capacity lower bounds that we considered rely on such simplifications. </p><formula xml:id="formula_74">C such that A + ρxx H is invertible x H (A + ρxx H ) -1 = x H A -1 1+ρx H A -1 x and (A + ρxx H ) -1 = A -1 -ρA -1 xx H A -1 1+ρx H A -1 x .
