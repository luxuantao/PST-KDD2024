<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Models of the dynamics of cellular interaction networks have become increasingly larger in recent years. While whole-cell models are not on the horizon yet, complex networks underlying specific cellular processes have been modeled in detail, such as the osmotic shock response in yeast <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref>, the yeast cell cycle <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, and signalling pathways involved in cancer <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>. The study of these models by means of analysis and simulation tools leads to large amounts of predictions, typically time-courses of the concentrations of several dozens of molecular components in a variety of physiological conditions and genetic backgrounds. This raises the question how to make sense of these data, that is, how to obtain an understanding of the way in which particular molecular mechanisms control the cellular process under study, and how to identify interesting predictions of novel phenomena that can be confronted with experimental data.</p><p>Methods from the field of formal verification provide a promising way to deal with the analysis of large and complex models of cellular interaction networks <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. Generally speaking, formal verification proceeds by specifying dynamical properties of interest as statements in temporal logic. Efficient so-called model-checking algorithms, implemented in publicly-available computer tools, exist to determine whether the statements are true or false, and thus whether the dynamic properties are satisfied by the model. The methods are generally applicable to discrete models of cellular interaction networks, or continuous models that have been discretized under a suitable abstraction criterion. Several examples exist of the application of model-checking approaches in systems biology (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">14]</ref>).</p><p>Formal verification based on model checking provides a powerful technology to query models of cellular interaction networks. It raises a number of new issues though, notably that of formulating good questions when analyzing a huge network model. The problem of posing relevant and interesting questions is critical in modeling in general, but even more so in the context of applying formal verification techniques, due to the fact that it is not easy for non-experts to formulate queries in temporal logic. For instance, the property "Gene g is eventually expressed, and necessarily preceded over the whole duration of the experiment by a concentration larger than 0.9 µM of the transcription factor P" corresponds to the following CTL formula, where exp g denotes expression of g: EF (exp g ) ∧ ¬E(T rue U (¬([P ] &gt; 0.9µM ) ∧ E(T rue U exp g )))</p><p>(1)</p><p>The response to this problem proposed by the formal verification community is the use of patterns, that is, high-level query templates that capture recurring questions in a specific application domain and that can be automatically translated to temporal logic <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. Apart from lists of example queries <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>, the systematic definition of queries has not received any attention in systems biology thus far.</p><p>The aim of this paper is to develop a set of patterns for the analysis of dynamic models of cellular interaction networks. Its main contributions lie, first, in the development of generic query templates, based on a review of frequentlyasked questions by modelers, and the translation of these templates into temporal logic formulas (Sec. 2). Second, we apply the patterns for analyzing the qualitative dynamics of a large and complex model of the E. coli carbon starvation response <ref type="bibr">(Sec. 3)</ref>. This model extends a previous model <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref> by taking into account additional regulators of the bacterium, notably a module centered around the general stress response factor RpoS. We verify the control the latter is predicted to exert on the DNA supercoiling level in the cell.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Patterns of biological queries 2.1 Description of network dynamics</head><p>As a basic hypothesis, we assume that the dynamics of molecular interaction networks can be modeled by means of finite state transition systems (FSTSs) <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>. The latter formalism provides a general description of a dynamical system that implicitly or explicitly underlies many of the existing discrete formalisms used to model cellular interaction networks, such as Boolean networks and their generalizations, Petri nets, and process algebras. In addition, by defining appropriate discrete abstractions, continuous models of cellular interaction networks can also be mapped to FSTSs. The generality of the FSTS formalism is important for assuring the wide applicability of the patterns developed in this section. Moreover, statements in temporal logics are usually interpreted on FSTSs, so that the latter naturally connect network models to model-checking tools.</p><p>A finite state transition system is formally defined as a tuple Σ = S, AP, L, T, S 0 , where S is a set of states, AP is a set of atomic propositions, L : S → 2 AP is a labeling function that associates to a state s ∈ S the set of atomic propositions satisfied by s, T ⊆ S × S is a relation defining transitions between states, and S 0 ⊆ S is a set of initial states. For our purpose, S describes the possible states of the cellular interaction network, each of which is characterized by a set of atomic propositions, such as that the concentration of protein P is increasing, or that the concentration of metabolite M is smaller than 5 mM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Identification of patterns</head><p>The notion of patterns originates in architecture <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> and was introduced in the domain of software engineering as a means to capture expert solutions to recurring problems in program design <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. In the formal verification domain they have been introduced in an influential paper by <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>, to help non-expert users formulate their temporal-logic queries. In the latter context, patterns are highlevel descriptions of frequently asked questions in an application domain that are formulated in structured natural language rather than temporal logic. The aim of the patterns is not to cover all possible questions an expert can think of, but rather to simplify the formulation of those that are primary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INRIA</head><p>The difficulty of proposing patterns is to come up with a limited number of query schemas that are sufficiently generic to be applicable in a variety of situations, and at the same time sufficiently concrete to be comprehensible for the non-expert user. Moreover, the overlap between the patterns should be minimal. We analyzed a large number of modeling studies in systems biology (starting from the references in <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>), as well as previous applications of model checking and temporal logic (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">14]</ref>). This bibliographic research allowed us to identify an open-ended list of questions on the dynamics of genetic, metabolic, and signal transduction networks, for instance: Is the basal glycerol production level combined with rapid closure of Fps1 sufficient to explain an initial glycerol accumulation after osmotic shock? <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref> Once a cell has executed START, does it slip back into G1 phase and repeat START? Or rather, must it execute a FINISH to return to G1? <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. Does Shc phosphorylation exhibit a relative acceleration with decreasing EGF concentration and show a decline over time? <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref> The identified questions were grouped into four categories, depending on whether they concerned the occurrence/exclusion, consequence, sequence, and invariance of cellular events. For each of these, we developed an appropriate pattern, capturing the essence of the question and the most relevant variants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Description of patterns</head><p>The patterns consist of structured natural language phrases, represented in schematic form, with placeholders for so-called state descriptors. A state descriptor is a statement expressing a state property, and takes the form of (a Boolean combination of) atomic propositions. Let φ, ψ be state descriptors, then</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">φ, ψ ::= p 1 ∈ AP |p 2 ∈ AP | . . . ::= ¬φ|φ ∧ ψ|φ ⇒ ψ| . . .</formula><p>The state descriptors are interpreted on the FSTS, in the sense that their meaning is formally defined as the set of states S 1 ⊆ S satisfying the state descriptor. In addition to (Boolean combinations of) atomic propositions, the state descriptors may be temporal-logic formulas defined on the atomic propositions. We will return to this generalization in Sec. 5.</p><p>It is often convenient to introduce predefined state descriptors that capture Boolean combinations of atomic propositions that are recurrently used. Some examples of predefined state descriptors that we found useful are the following:</p><p>Increases i /Decreases i : the concentration of molecular component i increases/decreases in this state;</p><p>IsSteadyState: the concentrations of all molecular components are steady in this state;</p><p>IsOscillatoryState: the concentrations of some molecular components oscillate in this state.</p><p>Notice that the precise definition of the state descriptors depends on the particular type of FSTS that is used, as the latter determines the set of atomic propositions AP .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 1 (Occurrence/exclusion pattern) φ</head><p>This pattern represents the concepts of occurrence and its negation, exclusion. It will often be used during the development of a model to check for the presence or absence of some property that was experimentally observed. For instance, "It is possible for a state with high expression of protein P 1 to occur". Using this pattern, we can also check for mutual exclusion, by using the pattern negative form in combination with a conjunctive state descriptor. For instance, "It is not possible for a state to occur in which protein P 1 and protein P 2 are highly expressed".</p><p>More generally, the exclusion pattern captures the safety properties used in the domain of concurrent systems. A safety property (of which mutual exclusion is a typical example) expresses that "something bad never happens" during the execution of the system, in our example a bad state violating mutual exclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 2 (Consequence pattern) φ ψ</head><p>The consequence pattern relates two events separated in time. More precisely, it expresses that if the first state occurs, then it is possibly or necessarily followed by the occurrence of the second state. If the latter state necessarily follows, then the consequence pattern expresses a form of causal relation. Instances of this pattern are, for instance, "If a state occurs in which protein P is phosphorylated, then it is possibly followed by a state in which the expression of gene g decreases", or "If a state occurs in which the concentration of protein P is below 5 µM, then it is necessarily followed by a state in which the expression of gene g is at its basal level".</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">INRIA Definition 3 (Sequence pattern) ψ φ</formula><p>The sequence pattern represents an ordering relation between two events. It ought not to be confused with the consequence pattern, since the conditional occurrence of the second state which characterizes the latter, is absent in the sequence pattern. Both the first and the second state, in that order, have to be observed for an instance of the sequence pattern to be true.</p><p>Four variants of the pattern are distinguished, depending on whether the second state follows possibly or necessarily after the first state, and whether the system is in the first state all the time or only at some time before the occurrence of the second state. Instances of this pattern are "A state in which reactions R 1 and R 2 occur at a high rate is reached after 2 min, and is possibly preceded at some time by a state in which the transcription factor P is phosphorylated" or "A steady state is reached and is necessarily preceded all the time by a state in which nutrient N is absent".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 4 (Invariance pattern) φ</head><p>The invariance pattern is used to check if the system can or must remain indefinitely in a state. In contrast with the occurrence/exclusion pattern, the question is not whether a particular state can be reached, but rather whether a particular state is invariable. Instances of the pattern are "A state in which reaction R occurs at a high rate can persist indefinitely" and "A state with a basal expression of gene g must persist indefinitely".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Translation to temporal logic</head><p>By defining a translation into temporal logic of the patterns, the user queries can be automatically cast in a form that allows the verification of the specified property by means of model-checking tools. The patterns defined above are independent of a particular temporal logic, which allows the same high-level specification of a user query to be verified by means of different approaches and tools. It is worth noticing though that some of the patterns we propose have a branching-time nature (e.g., the consequence and the sequence patterns), and therefore these are not translatable into a linear-time formalism, such as LTL <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Two examples of translations of the patterns in Sec. 2.3 are shown in tabular form: the Computational Tree Logic (CTL) translation and the µ-calculus translation (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). In both CTL and µ-calculus, formulas are built upon atomic propositions. Also, the usual connectors of propositional logic, such as negation (¬), logical or (∨), logical and (∧) and implication (⇒), can be used in both logics. In addition, CTL provides two types of operators: path quantifiers, E and A, and temporal operators, such as F and G. Path quantifiers are used to specify that a property p is satisfied by some (E p) or every (A p) path starting from a given state. Temporal operators are used to specify that, given a state and a path starting from that state, a property p holds for some (F p) or for every (G p) state of the path. Each path quantifier must be paired with a temporal operator. In the case of µ-calculus, two types of operators are provided: fixed points, the least (µ) and greatest (ν), and modal operators, possibility (♦) and necessity ( ). Least and greatest fixed points specify finite and infinite recursive applications of a formula, respectively. For instance, given a state and a path starting from that state, the fact that a property p holds for some state or for all states of the path is expressed using a least (µ) or a greatest (ν) fixed point, respectively. Modal operators are used to specify that, given a state, a property p possibly (♦ p) or necessarily ( p) holds on some or all of its outgoing states. Table <ref type="table">1</ref>: Rules for the translation of the patterns into CTL and µ-calculus. For each of the four patterns, the translation of all variants is shown. We use the version of µ-calculus presented in <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>, which is interpreted on classical Kripke structures. The symbol T stands for True.</p><p>3 Carbon Starvation Response in E. coli</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Model of carbon starvation response</head><p>To test the applicability of the temporal logic patterns, we have used our approach for the analysis of a model of the carbon starvation response in the bacterium E. coli. In the absence of essential carbon sources in its growth environment, an E. coli population abandons exponential growth and enters a nongrowth state called stationary phase. This growth-phase transition is accompanied by numerous physiological changes in the bacteria <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>, and controlled on the molecular level by a complex genetic regulatory network integrating various environmental signals.</p><p>The molecular basis of the adaptation of the growth of E. coli to the nutritional conditions has been the focus of extensive studies for decades <ref type="bibr">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr">20]</ref>. However, notwithstanding the enormous amount of information accumulated on the genes, proteins, and other molecules known to be involved in the stress adaptation process, it is currently not understood how the response of the cell emerges from the network of molecular interactions. Moreover, with some exceptions <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>, numerical values for the kinetic parameters and the molecular concentrations are absent, which makes it difficult to apply traditional methods for the dynamical modeling of genetic regulatory networks.</p><p>These circumstances have motivated the development of a qualitative model of the carbon starvation response network using a class of piecewise-linear (PL) differential equations. The PL models, originally introduced by <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>, provide a coarse-grained picture of the dynamics of genetic regulatory networks. They associate a protein concentration variable to each of the genes in the network, and capture the switch-like character of gene regulation by means of step functions that change their value at a threshold concentration of the proteins. The advantage of using PL models is that the qualitative dynamics of the high-dimensional systems are relatively simple to analyze, using inequality constraints on the parameters rather than exact numerical values <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">3]</ref>. This makes the PL models a valuable tool for the analysis of the carbon starvation network.</p><p>In previous work we developed a PL model that we extend here by the general stress response factor RpoS and related regulators ( <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>; Ropers et al., in preparation). The dynamics of this system are described by nine coupled PL differential equations, and fifty inequality constraints on the parameter values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Qualitative simulation of carbon starvation response</head><p>The mathematical properties of the class of PL models used for modeling the stress response network have been well-studied <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. We have previously shown how discrete abstractions can be used to convert the continuous dynamics of the PL systems into a FSTS <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. The states S of the FSTS correspond to hyperrectangular regions in the concentration space, while the transitions T arise from trajectories that enter one region from another. The atomic propositions AP describe, among other things, the concentration bounds of the regions and INRIA the trend of the variables inside a region (increasing, decreasing, or steady). The generation of the FSTS from the PL model has been implemented in the computer tool Genetic Network Analyzer (GNA) <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. GNA is able to export the FSTS to standard model checkers like NuSMV <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref> and CADP <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>.</p><p>The application of this approach to the model of the E. coli carbon starvation network generates a huge FSTS. The entire state set consists of approximately O(10 10 ) states, while the subset of states that is most relevant for our purpose, i.e. the states that are reachable from an initial state corresponding to a particular growth state of the bacteria, still consists of O( <ref type="formula">10</ref>3 ) states. It is clear that FSTSs of this size cannot be analyzed by visual inspection, and that formal verification techniques are needed.</p><p>In the next section we show how the patterns defined in Sec. 2.3 can speed up the querying of these FSTSs, by simplifying the formulation of relevant properties to be tested. We are particularly interested in the question how the extension of the model with RpoS affects the predicted dynamics of the system. The instances of the patterns were translated into the temporal logic CTL following the translation rules of Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, and then verified using the model-checker NuSMV.</p></div>

In turn, the latter synthesizes a small molecule, cAMP, which binds to CRP. This active form of CRP is able to regulate the expression of a large number of genes. In particular, CRP•cAMP binds to the promoter region of the gene fis, thereby preventing synthesis of new Fis proteins. Fis is an important regulator of genes involved in the cellular metabolism but it also inhibits crp expression, by binding to multiple sites in the two promoter regions of the gene, P1 and P2. The regulatory interactions between genes fis and crp form a positive feedback loop, a motif often found in the genetic regulatory networks. When present in isolation, this kind of motif has been shown to lead to bistability <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>.</p><p>The question can be asked whether the motif is also functional in the context of the carbon starvation response network. For instance, the expression of fis is not only controlled by CRP•cAMP, but also by the DNA supercoiling level and Fis itself. To check whether the bistability property is preserved in the larger network, we used two instances of the occurrence/exclusion pattern to express that it is impossible that proteins Fis and CRP be simultaneously present at high and at low concentration in the cells (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). This property was shown to be true by the NuSMV model checker. We conclude that the positive feedback loop involving fis and crp is functional.  topA and θ 1 gyrI , respectively. The regulatory logic of gyrAB expression is modeled by means of step functions. For instance, s + (x gyrAB , θ 2 gyrAB ) evaluates to 1, if x gyrAB &gt; θ 2 gyrAB (and to 0 otherwise). The protein is degraded at a rate proportional to its own concentration, γ gyrAB x gyrAB . The constraint θ 2 gyrAB &lt; κ gyrAB /γ gyrAB &lt; max gyrAB express that the derepression of the gyrAB promoter allows the concentration of GyrAB to reach a high level, above the threshold θ 2 gyrAB .</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">+ (x gyrAB , θ 2 gyrAB ) s -(x gyrI , θ 1 gyrI ) s -(x topA , θ 1 topA )) s -(x f is , θ 4 f is ) -γ gyrAB x gyrAB 0 &lt; θ 1 gyrAB &lt; θ 2 gyrAB &lt; κ gyrAB /γ gyrAB &lt; max gyrAB (b)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Damped oscillations after carbon upshift</head><p>The carbon starvation response network also contains a negative feedback loop, involving the genes gyrAB, topA, and fis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). GyrAB is a gyrase protein which supercoils the DNA structure, whereas the topoisomerase TopA relaxes it. An increase of the DNA supercoiling level stimulates expression of Fis, which in turn decreases the supercoiling level, by stimulating topA expression and inhibiting gyrAB expression. The resulting negative feedback loop was predicted to give rise to (damped) oscillations of Fis and GyrAB concentrations after a carbon upshift <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>.</p><p>In the present version of our model, additional interactions contribute to controlling the DNA supercoiling level. Hence, the gyrase inhibitor GyrI represses the activity of GyrAB by forming a complex with the protein. The expression of gyrI is notably stimulated by RpoS <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>. We formulated a consequence pattern to verify whether this affects the functioning of the negative feedback loop. In particular, we checked whether the carbon upshift is still a necessary condition for the occurrence of damped oscillations, as it was in the previous model (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). In the pattern we made use of the state descriptor isOscillatoryState, which labels states as belonging to a (terminal) cycle in the FSTS. The occurrence of an oscillatory state could alternatively be expressed using temporal logic formulas (Sec. 5). The model-checker returned true for the query, meaning that the damped oscillations still occur following a carbon upshift.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Control of entry into stationary phase by RpoS</head><p>RpoS is a stress sigma factor that allows cells to adapt to and survive under harmful conditions by entering stationary phase <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>. Due to its key role, the concentration of RpoS is tightly regulated, at the transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels. The stability of the protein is mainly controlled in our conditions: while cells grow on a carbon source, RpoS is actively degraded through the protein RssB, which binds to RpoS and targets the factor to an intracellular protease. However, the depletion of the carbon source inactivates RssB, thus allowing RpoS to accumulate at a high concentration.</p><p>Given the importance of RpoS for cell survival, one may ask whether the entry into stationary phase is always preceded by the accumulation of RpoS in the cell. We formulated this question using a sequence pattern, where the stationary phase is represented by a low level of stable RNAs rrn (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). The latter indicator is motivated by the fact that stationary-phase cells do not need high levels of these RNAs, which are necessary for the high translational activity of the exponential phase. The property is true, which indicates that the entry into stationary phase cannot occur before RpoS has accumulated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Expression of topA during growth-phase transitions</head><p>Our previous model was incapable of accounting for the control of DNA supercoiling during growth-phase transitions. In particular, TopA was predicted to be never expressed, which is consistent with published data <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>. The extension of the model with RpoS makes it possible to refine the description of the control of the DNA supercoiling level. On the one hand, GyrAB activity is regulated by GyrI, as mentioned previously, and on the other hand, the topA promoter is activated by RpoS.</p><p>In order to know whether topA is expressed in response to the carbon source availability, we used an invariance pattern to check if the absence of topA expression persists indefinitely (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). The corresponding temporal logic formula is false and the diagnostic of the model-checker shows that expression of topA is stimulated at the entry into stationary phase, most likely under the influence of RpoS. Indeed, following carbon starvation, the protein RssB is inactivated, which leads to the accumulation of RpoS at high levels. RpoS in turn stimulates the expression of topA.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>Formal verification techniques are promising tools for upscaling the analysis of cellular interaction networks. The widespread adoption of model-checking approaches is restrained, however, by the difficulty for non-expert users to formulate appropriate questions in temporal logics. Inspired by work in the formal verification community ( <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>, see also <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref>), the first contribution of the paper consists in the formulation of a set of patterns in the form of query templates in structured natural language. The patterns capture a large number of frequentlyasked questions by modelers in systems biology, but they are not restricted to a particular type of network or a particular biological system. In addition, we have provided translations of the patterns to two different temporal logics, CTL and µ-calculus.</p><p>The second contribution of the paper is the use of these patterns for the analysis of the complex genetic regulatory network involved in the carbon starvation response in E. coli. We have modeled this network by means of PL differential equations and simulated the qualitative dynamics of the system in response to carbon starvation and carbon upshift. Our model extends a previous model <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref> with additional global regulators, notably the sigma factor RpoS, to better account for the control of DNA supercoiling during the growth transitions of the bacteria. The patterns are instantiated to verify the effect of this addition to the predicted network dynamics.</p><p>The patterns proposed in this paper are globally consistent with those discussed in <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>, but there are differences due to the specific application domain for which our patterns were developed. For instance, the notion of scope used by <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> is not commonly defined for all the patterns, but implicitly present through the use of specific variants for each pattern. Also, we have not explicitly included patterns that can be obtained by the recursive application of other patterns, such as the chain response pattern defined in <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. While patterns have not been used for the querying of cellular interaction networks thus far, some papers list example questions. It is reassuring to observe that all questions in the list of <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> can be expressed by means of the patterns in Sec. 2.3.</p><p>An obvious generalization of the patterns proposed in this paper, already briefly mentioned in Sec. 2, would be to allow state descriptors that are formulas in temporal logic. For instance, instead of using atomic propositions to label states belonging to a (terminal) cycle in the FSTS, which requires the preliminary detection of strongly connected components in the state transition graph, we could use temporal logic formulas <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. The introduction of temporal logic formulas as state descriptors makes the patterns more general, but also potentially more complicated to formulate and dependent on a particular temporal logic. A compromise trading some expressive power for user-friendliness would be to restrict the possible temporal logic formulas to simple forms and introduce these as predefined state descriptors (Sec. 2.3). This is consistent with the main idea underlying the use of patterns, namely that they cannot be expected to cover all possible queries, but rather should allow users to formulate their frequent questions without worrying about the translation to temporal logic.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Models of the dynamics of cellular interaction networks have become increasingly larger in recent years. While whole-cell models are not on the horizon yet, complex networks underlying specific cellular processes have been modeled in detail, such as the osmotic shock response in yeast <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref>, the yeast cell cycle <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, and signalling pathways involved in cancer <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>. The study of these models by means of analysis and simulation tools leads to large amounts of predictions, typically time-courses of the concentrations of several dozens of molecular components in a variety of physiological conditions and genetic backgrounds. This raises the question how to make sense of these data, that is, how to obtain an understanding of the way in which particular molecular mechanisms control the cellular process under study, and how to identify interesting predictions of novel phenomena that can be confronted with experimental data.</p><p>Methods from the field of formal verification provide a promising way to deal with the analysis of large and complex models of cellular interaction networks <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. Generally speaking, formal verification proceeds by specifying dynamical properties of interest as statements in temporal logic. Efficient so-called model-checking algorithms, implemented in publicly-available computer tools, exist to determine whether the statements are true or false, and thus whether the dynamic properties are satisfied by the model. The methods are generally applicable to discrete models of cellular interaction networks, or continuous models that have been discretized under a suitable abstraction criterion. Several examples exist of the application of model-checking approaches in systems biology (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">14]</ref>).</p><p>Formal verification based on model checking provides a powerful technology to query models of cellular interaction networks. It raises a number of new issues though, notably that of formulating good questions when analyzing a huge network model. The problem of posing relevant and interesting questions is critical in modeling in general, but even more so in the context of applying formal verification techniques, due to the fact that it is not easy for non-experts to formulate queries in temporal logic. For instance, the property "Gene g is eventually expressed, and necessarily preceded over the whole duration of the experiment by a concentration larger than 0.9 µM of the transcription factor P" corresponds to the following CTL formula, where exp g denotes expression of g:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">EF (exp g ) ∧ ¬E(T rue U (¬([P ] &gt; 0.9µM ) ∧ E(T rue U exp g )))<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The response to this problem proposed by the formal verification community is the use of patterns, that is, high-level query templates that capture recurring questions in a specific application domain and that can be automatically translated to temporal logic <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. Apart from lists of example queries <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>, the systematic definition of queries has not received any attention in systems biology thus far.</p><p>The aim of this paper is to develop a set of patterns for the analysis of dynamic models of cellular interaction networks. Its main contributions lie, first, in the development of generic query templates, based on a review of frequentlyasked questions by modelers, and the translation of these templates into temporal logic formulas (Sec. 2). Second, we apply the patterns for analyzing the qualitative dynamics of a large and complex model of the E. coli carbon starvation response (Sec. 3). This model extends a previous model <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref> by taking into account additional regulators of the bacterium, notably a module centered around the general stress response factor RpoS. We verify the control the latter is predicted to exert on the DNA supercoiling level in the cell.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Patterns of biological queries 2.1 Description of network dynamics</head><p>As a basic hypothesis, we assume that the dynamics of molecular interaction networks can be modeled by means of finite state transition systems (FSTSs) <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>. The latter formalism provides a general description of a dynamical system that implicitly or explicitly underlies many of the existing discrete formalisms used to model cellular interaction networks, such as Boolean networks and their generalizations, Petri nets, and process algebras. In addition, by defining appropriate discrete abstractions, continuous models of cellular interaction networks can also be mapped to FSTSs. The generality of the FSTS formalism is important for assuring the wide applicability of the patterns developed in this section. Moreover, statements in temporal logics are usually interpreted on FSTSs, so that the latter naturally connect network models to model-checking tools.</p><p>A finite state transition system is formally defined as a tuple Σ = S, AP, L, T, S 0 , where S is a set of states, AP is a set of atomic propositions, L : S → 2 AP is a labeling function that associates to a state s ∈ S the set of atomic propositions satisfied by s, T ⊆ S × S is a relation defining transitions between states, and S 0 ⊆ S is a set of initial states. For our purpose, S describes the possible states of the cellular interaction network, each of which is characterized by a set of atomic propositions, such as that the concentration of protein P is increasing, or that the concentration of metabolite M is smaller than 5 mM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Identification of patterns</head><p>The notion of patterns originates in architecture <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> and was introduced in the domain of software engineering as a means to capture expert solutions to recurring problems in program design <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. In the formal verification domain they have been introduced in an influential paper by <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>, to help non-expert users formulate their temporal-logic queries. In the latter context, patterns are highlevel descriptions of frequently asked questions in an application domain that are formulated in structured natural language rather than temporal logic. The aim of the patterns is not to cover all possible questions an expert can think of, but rather to simplify the formulation of those that are primary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INRIA</head><p>The difficulty of proposing patterns is to come up with a limited number of query schemas that are sufficiently generic to be applicable in a variety of situations, and at the same time sufficiently concrete to be comprehensible for the non-expert user. Moreover, the overlap between the patterns should be minimal. We analyzed a large number of modeling studies in systems biology (starting from the references in <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>), as well as previous applications of model checking and temporal logic (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">14]</ref>). This bibliographic research allowed us to identify an open-ended list of questions on the dynamics of genetic, metabolic, and signal transduction networks, for instance: Is the basal glycerol production level combined with rapid closure of Fps1 sufficient to explain an initial glycerol accumulation after osmotic shock? <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref> Once a cell has executed START, does it slip back into G1 phase and repeat START? Or rather, must it execute a FINISH to return to G1? <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. Does Shc phosphorylation exhibit a relative acceleration with decreasing EGF concentration and show a decline over time? <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref> The identified questions were grouped into four categories, depending on whether they concerned the occurrence/exclusion, consequence, sequence, and invariance of cellular events. For each of these, we developed an appropriate pattern, capturing the essence of the question and the most relevant variants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Description of patterns</head><p>The patterns consist of structured natural language phrases, represented in schematic form, with placeholders for so-called state descriptors. A state descriptor is a statement expressing a state property, and takes the form of (a Boolean combination of) atomic propositions. Let φ, ψ be state descriptors, then φ, ψ ::= p 1 ∈ AP |p 2 ∈ AP | . . .</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">::= ¬φ|φ ∧ ψ|φ ⇒ ψ| . . .</formula><p>The state descriptors are interpreted on the FSTS, in the sense that their meaning is formally defined as the set of states S 1 ⊆ S satisfying the state descriptor. In addition to (Boolean combinations of) atomic propositions, the state descriptors may be temporal-logic formulas defined on the atomic propositions. We will return to this generalization in Sec. 5.</p><p>It is often convenient to introduce predefined state descriptors that capture Boolean combinations of atomic propositions that are recurrently used. Some examples of predefined state descriptors that we found useful are the following:</p><p>Increases i /Decreases i : the concentration of molecular component i increases/decreases in this state;</p><p>IsSteadyState: the concentrations of all molecular components are steady in this state;</p><p>IsOscillatoryState: the concentrations of some molecular components oscillate in this state.</p><p>Notice that the precise definition of the state descriptors depends on the particular type of FSTS that is used, as the latter determines the set of atomic propositions AP .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 1 (Occurrence/exclusion pattern) φ</head><p>This pattern represents the concepts of occurrence and its negation, exclusion. It will often be used during the development of a model to check for the presence or absence of some property that was experimentally observed. For instance, "It is possible for a state with high expression of protein P 1 to occur". Using this pattern, we can also check for mutual exclusion, by using the pattern negative form in combination with a conjunctive state descriptor. For instance, "It is not possible for a state to occur in which protein P 1 and protein P 2 are highly expressed".</p><p>More generally, the exclusion pattern captures the safety properties used in the domain of concurrent systems. A safety property (of which mutual exclusion is a typical example) expresses that "something bad never happens" during the execution of the system, in our example a bad state violating mutual exclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 2 (Consequence pattern) φ ψ</head><p>The consequence pattern relates two events separated in time. More precisely, it expresses that if the first state occurs, then it is possibly or necessarily followed by the occurrence of the second state. If the latter state necessarily follows, then the consequence pattern expresses a form of causal relation. Instances of this pattern are, for instance, "If a state occurs in which protein P is phosphorylated, then it is possibly followed by a state in which the expression of gene g decreases", or "If a state occurs in which the concentration of protein P is below 5 µM, then it is necessarily followed by a state in which the expression of gene g is at its basal level".</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">INRIA Definition 3 (Sequence pattern) ψ φ</formula><p>The sequence pattern represents an ordering relation between two events. It ought not to be confused with the consequence pattern, since the conditional occurrence of the second state which characterizes the latter, is absent in the sequence pattern. Both the first and the second state, in that order, have to be observed for an instance of the sequence pattern to be true.</p><p>Four variants of the pattern are distinguished, depending on whether the second state follows possibly or necessarily after the first state, and whether the system is in the first state all the time or only at some time before the occurrence of the second state. Instances of this pattern are "A state in which reactions R 1 and R 2 occur at a high rate is reached after 2 min, and is possibly preceded at some time by a state in which the transcription factor P is phosphorylated" or "A steady state is reached and is necessarily preceded all the time by a state in which nutrient N is absent".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 4 (Invariance pattern) φ</head><p>The invariance pattern is used to check if the system can or must remain indefinitely in a state. In contrast with the occurrence/exclusion pattern, the question is not whether a particular state can be reached, but rather whether a particular state is invariable. Instances of the pattern are "A state in which reaction R occurs at a high rate can persist indefinitely" and "A state with a basal expression of gene g must persist indefinitely".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Translation to temporal logic</head><p>By defining a translation into temporal logic of the patterns, the user queries can be automatically cast in a form that allows the verification of the specified property by means of model-checking tools. The patterns defined above are independent of a particular temporal logic, which allows the same high-level specification of a user query to be verified by means of different approaches and tools. It is worth noticing though that some of the patterns we propose have a branching-time nature (e.g., the consequence and the sequence patterns), and therefore these are not translatable into a linear-time formalism, such as LTL <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Two examples of translations of the patterns in Sec. 2.3 are shown in tabular form: the Computational Tree Logic (CTL) translation and the µ-calculus translation (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). In both CTL and µ-calculus, formulas are built upon atomic propositions. Also, the usual connectors of propositional logic, such as negation (¬), logical or (∨), logical and (∧) and implication (⇒), can be used in both logics. In addition, CTL provides two types of operators: path quantifiers, E and A, and temporal operators, such as F and G. Path quantifiers are used to specify that a property p is satisfied by some (E p) or every (A p) path starting from a given state. Temporal operators are used to specify that, given a state and a path starting from that state, a property p holds for some (F p) or for every (G p) state of the path. Each path quantifier must be paired with a temporal operator. In the case of µ-calculus, two types of operators are provided: fixed points, the least (µ) and greatest (ν), and modal operators, possibility (♦) and necessity ( ). Least and greatest fixed points specify finite and infinite recursive applications of a formula, respectively. For instance, given a state and a path starting from that state, the fact that a property p holds for some state or for all states of the path is expressed using a least (µ) or a greatest (ν) fixed point, respectively. Modal operators are used to specify that, given a state, a property p possibly (♦ p) or necessarily ( p) holds on some or all of its outgoing states.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">INRIA Occurrence/Exclusion pattern CTL µ-calculus It is possible for a state φ to occur EF (φ) µX.(φ ∨ ♦X) It is not possible for a state φ to occur ¬EF (φ) ¬µX.(φ ∨ ♦X) Consequence pattern If a state φ occurs, then it is possibly followed by a state ψ AG (φ ⇒ EF (ψ)) νX.((φ ⇒ µY.(ψ ∨ ♦Y )) ∧ X) If a state φ occurs, then it is necessarily followed by a state ψ AG (φ ⇒ AF (ψ)) νX.((φ ⇒ µY.(ψ ∨ Y )) ∧ X)</formula><p>Sequence pattern A state ψ is reached and is possibly preceded at some time by a state φ EF (φ</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">∧ EF (ψ)) µX.((φ ∧ µY.(ψ ∨ ♦Y )) ∨ ♦X) A state ψ is reached and is possibly preceded all the time by a state φ E (φ U ψ) µX.(ψ ∨ (φ ∧ ♦X)) A state ψ is reached and is necessarily preceded at some time by a state φ EF (ψ) ∧ µX.(ψ ∨ ♦X) ∧ ¬E (¬φ U ψ) ¬µY.(ψ ∨ (¬φ ∧ ♦Y )) A state ψ is reached and is necessarily preceded all the time by a state φ EF (ψ) ∧ ¬E(T U µX.(ψ ∨ ♦X) ∧ ¬µY.(¬φ ∧ (¬φ ∧ E(T U ψ))) µZ.(ψ ∨ (T ∧ ♦Z)) ∨ (T ∧ ♦Y ))</formula><p>Invariance pattern A state φ can persist indefinitely</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">EG (φ) νX.(φ ∧ ♦X) A state φ must persist indefinitely AG (φ) νX.(φ ∧ X)</formula><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>: Rules for the translation of the patterns into CTL and µ-calculus.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Model of carbon starvation response</head><p>To test the applicability of the temporal logic patterns, we have used our approach for the analysis of a model of the carbon starvation response in the bacterium E. coli. In the absence of essential carbon sources in its growth environment, an E. coli population abandons exponential growth and enters a nongrowth state called stationary phase. This growth-phase transition is accompanied by numerous physiological changes in the bacteria <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>, and controlled on the molecular level by a complex genetic regulatory network integrating various environmental signals.</p><p>The molecular basis of the adaptation of the growth of E. coli to the nutritional conditions has been the focus of extensive studies for decades <ref type="bibr">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr">20]</ref>. However, notwithstanding the enormous amount of information accumulated on the genes, proteins, and other molecules known to be involved in the stress adaptation process, it is currently not understood how the response of the cell emerges from the network of molecular interactions. Moreover, with some exceptions <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>, numerical values for the kinetic parameters and the molecular concentrations are absent, which makes it difficult to apply traditional methods for the dynamical modeling of genetic regulatory networks.</p><p>These circumstances have motivated the development of a qualitative model of the carbon starvation response network using a class of piecewise-linear (PL) differential equations. The PL models, originally introduced by <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>, provide a coarse-grained picture of the dynamics of genetic regulatory networks. They associate a protein concentration variable to each of the genes in the network, and capture the switch-like character of gene regulation by means of step functions that change their value at a threshold concentration of the proteins. The advantage of using PL models is that the qualitative dynamics of the high-dimensional systems are relatively simple to analyze, using inequality constraints on the parameters rather than exact numerical values <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">3]</ref>. This makes the PL models a valuable tool for the analysis of the carbon starvation network.</p><p>In previous work we developed a PL model that we extend here by the general stress response factor RpoS and related regulators ( <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Ropers et al., in preparation)</ref>. The dynamics of this system are described by nine coupled PL differential equations, and fifty inequality constraints on the parameter values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Qualitative simulation of carbon starvation response</head><p>The mathematical properties of the class of PL models used for modeling the stress response network have been well-studied <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. We have previously shown how discrete abstractions can be used to convert the continuous dynamics of the PL systems into a FSTS <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. The states S of the FSTS correspond to hyperrectangular regions in the concentration space, while the transitions T arise from trajectories that enter one region from another. The atomic propositions AP describe, among other things, the concentration bounds of the regions and INRIA the trend of the variables inside a region (increasing, decreasing, or steady). The generation of the FSTS from the PL model has been implemented in the computer tool Genetic Network Analyzer (GNA) <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. GNA is able to export the FSTS to standard model checkers like NuSMV <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref> and CADP <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>.</p><p>The application of this approach to the model of the E. coli carbon starvation network generates a huge FSTS. The entire state set consists of approximately O(10 10 ) states, while the subset of states that is most relevant for our purpose, i.e. the states that are reachable from an initial state corresponding to a particular growth state of the bacteria, still consists of O( <ref type="formula">10</ref>3 ) states. It is clear that FSTSs of this size cannot be analyzed by visual inspection, and that formal verification techniques are needed.</p><p>In the next section we show how the patterns defined in Sec. 2.3 can speed up the querying of these FSTSs, by simplifying the formulation of relevant properties to be tested. We are particularly interested in the question how the extension of the model with RpoS affects the predicted dynamics of the system. The instances of the patterns were translated into the temporal logic CTL following the translation rules of Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, and then verified using the model-checker NuSMV.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Mutual inhibition of Fis and CRP</head><p>The proteins Fis and CRP mutually inhibit their expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The regulatory protein CRP is the target of a signal-transduction pathway, which activates the adenylate cyclase Cya in case of carbon starvation. In turn, the latter synthesizes a small molecule, cAMP, which binds to CRP. This active form of CRP is able to regulate the expression of a large number of genes. In particular, CRP•cAMP binds to the promoter region of the gene fis, thereby preventing synthesis of new Fis proteins. Fis is an important regulator of genes involved in the cellular metabolism but it also inhibits crp expression, by binding to multiple sites in the two promoter regions of the gene, P1 and P2. The regulatory interactions between genes fis and crp form a positive feedback loop, a motif often found in the genetic regulatory networks. When present in isolation, this kind of motif has been shown to lead to bistability <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. The question can be asked whether the motif is also functional in the context of the carbon starvation response network. For instance, the expression of fis is not only controlled by CRP•cAMP, but also by the DNA supercoiling level and Fis itself. To check whether the bistability property is preserved in the larger network, we used two instances of the occurrence/exclusion pattern to express that it is impossible that proteins Fis and CRP be simultaneously present at high and at low concentration in the cells (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). This property was shown to be true by the NuSMV model checker. We conclude that the positive feedback loop involving fis and crp is functional. </p><formula xml:id="formula_10">+ (x gyrAB , θ 2 gyrAB ) s -(x gyrI , θ 1 gyrI ) s -(x topA , θ 1 topA )) s -(x f is , θ 4 f is ) -γ gyrAB x gyrAB 0 &lt; θ 1 gyrAB &lt; θ 2 gyrAB &lt; κ gyrAB /γ gyrAB &lt; max gyrAB (b)</formula><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>: (a) Network of key genes, proteins and regulatory interactions involved in the carbon starvation response network in E. coli.

The regulatory logic of gyrAB expression is modeled by means of step functions. For instance, s + (x gyrAB , θ 2 gyrAB ) evaluates to 1, if x gyrAB &gt; θ 2 gyrAB (and to 0 otherwise). The protein is degraded at a rate proportional to its own concentration, γ gyrAB x gyrAB .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Damped oscillations after carbon upshift</head><p>The carbon starvation response network also contains a negative feedback loop, involving the genes gyrAB, topA, and fis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). GyrAB is a gyrase protein which supercoils the DNA structure, whereas the topoisomerase TopA relaxes it. An increase of the DNA supercoiling level stimulates expression of Fis, which in turn decreases the supercoiling level, by stimulating topA expression and inhibiting gyrAB expression. The resulting negative feedback loop was predicted to give rise to (damped) oscillations of Fis and GyrAB concentrations after a carbon upshift <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>.</p><p>In the present version of our model, additional interactions contribute to controlling the DNA supercoiling level. Hence, the gyrase inhibitor GyrI represses the activity of GyrAB by forming a complex with the protein. The expression of gyrI is notably stimulated by RpoS <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>. We formulated a consequence pattern to verify whether this affects the functioning of the negative feedback loop. In particular, we checked whether the carbon upshift is still a necessary condition for the occurrence of damped oscillations, as it was in the previous model (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). In the pattern we made use of the state descriptor isOscillatoryState, which labels states as belonging to a (terminal) cycle in the FSTS. The occurrence of an oscillatory state could alternatively be expressed using temporal logic formulas (Sec. 5). The model-checker returned true for the query, meaning that the damped oscillations still occur following a carbon upshift.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Control of entry into stationary phase by RpoS</head><p>RpoS is a stress sigma factor that allows cells to adapt to and survive under harmful conditions by entering stationary phase <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>. Due to its key role, the concentration of RpoS is tightly regulated, at the transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels. The stability of the protein is mainly controlled in our conditions: while cells grow on a carbon source, RpoS is actively degraded through the protein RssB, which binds to RpoS and targets the factor to an intracellular protease. However, the depletion of the carbon source inactivates RssB, thus allowing RpoS to accumulate at a high concentration.</p><p>Given the importance of RpoS for cell survival, one may ask whether the entry into stationary phase is always preceded by the accumulation of RpoS in the cell. We formulated this question using a sequence pattern, where the stationary phase is represented by a low level of stable RNAs rrn (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). The latter indicator is motivated by the fact that stationary-phase cells do not need high levels of these RNAs, which are necessary for the high translational activity of the exponential phase. The property is true, which indicates that the entry into stationary phase cannot occur before RpoS has accumulated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Expression of topA during growth-phase transitions</head><p>Our previous model was incapable of accounting for the control of DNA supercoiling during growth-phase transitions. In particular, TopA was predicted to be never expressed, which is consistent with published data <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>. The extension of the model with RpoS makes it possible to refine the description of the control of the DNA supercoiling level. On the one hand, GyrAB activity is regulated by GyrI, as mentioned previously, and on the other hand, the topA promoter is activated by RpoS.</p><p>In order to know whether topA is expressed in response to the carbon source availability, we used an invariance pattern to check if the absence of topA expression persists indefinitely (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). The corresponding temporal logic formula is false and the diagnostic of the model-checker shows that expression of topA is stimulated at the entry into stationary phase, most likely under the influence of RpoS. Indeed, following carbon starvation, the protein RssB is inactivated, which leads to the accumulation of RpoS at high levels. RpoS in turn stimulates the expression of topA.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>Formal verification techniques are promising tools for upscaling the analysis of cellular interaction networks. The widespread adoption of model-checking approaches is restrained, however, by the difficulty for non-expert users to formulate appropriate questions in temporal logics. Inspired by work in the formal verification community ( <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>, see also <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref>), the first contribution of the paper consists in the formulation of a set of patterns in the form of query templates in structured natural language. The patterns capture a large number of frequentlyasked questions by modelers in systems biology, but they are not restricted to a particular type of network or a particular biological system. In addition, we have provided translations of the patterns to two different temporal logics, CTL and µ-calculus.</p><p>The second contribution of the paper is the use of these patterns for the analysis of the complex genetic regulatory network involved in the carbon starvation response in E. coli. We have modeled this network by means of PL differential equations and simulated the qualitative dynamics of the system in response to carbon starvation and carbon upshift. Our model extends a previous model <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref> with additional global regulators, notably the sigma factor RpoS, to better account for the control of DNA supercoiling during the growth transitions of the bacteria. The patterns are instantiated to verify the effect of this addition to the predicted network dynamics.</p><p>The patterns proposed in this paper are globally consistent with those discussed in <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>, but there are differences due to the specific application domain for which our patterns were developed. For instance, the notion of scope used by <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> is not commonly defined for all the patterns, but implicitly present through the use of specific variants for each pattern. Also, we have not explicitly included patterns that can be obtained by the recursive application of other patterns, such as the chain response pattern defined in <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. While patterns have not been used for the querying of cellular interaction networks thus far, some papers list example questions. It is reassuring to observe that all questions in the list of <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> can be expressed by means of the patterns in Sec. 2.3.</p><p>An obvious generalization of the patterns proposed in this paper, already briefly mentioned in Sec. 2, would be to allow state descriptors that are formulas in temporal logic. For instance, instead of using atomic propositions to label states belonging to a (terminal) cycle in the FSTS, which requires the preliminary detection of strongly connected components in the state transition graph, we could use temporal logic formulas <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. The introduction of temporal logic formulas as state descriptors makes the patterns more general, but also potentially more complicated to formulate and dependent on a particular temporal logic. A compromise trading some expressive power for user-friendliness would be to restrict the possible temporal logic formulas to simple forms and introduce these as predefined state descriptors (Sec. 2.3). This is consistent with the main idea underlying the use of patterns, namely that they cannot be expected to cover all possible queries, but rather should allow users to formulate their frequent questions without worrying about the translation to temporal logic.</p></div>
