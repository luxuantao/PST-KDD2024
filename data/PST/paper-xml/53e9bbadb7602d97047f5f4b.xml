<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we present a vision beyond the conventional Long Term Evolution Fourth Generation (LTE-4G) evolution path and suggest that time division duplexing (TDD) could be a key enabler for a new heterogeneous network architecture with the potential to provide ubiquitous coverage and unprecedented spectral area effi ciencies. This architecture is based on a cochannel deployment of macro base stations (BSs) with very large antenna arrays and a secondary tier of small cells (SCs) with a few antennas each. Both tiers employ a TDD protocol in a synchronized fashion. The resulting channel reciprocity enables not only the estimation of large-dimensional channels at the BSs, but also an implicit coordination between both tiers without the need to exchange user data or channel state information (CSI) over the backhaul. In particular, during the uplink (UL), the BSs and SCs can locally estimate the dominant interference sub-space. This knowledge can be leveraged for downlink (DL) precoding to reduce intra-and inter-tier interference. In other words, the BSs and SCs "sacrifi ce" some of their degrees of freedom for interference rejection. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture and precoding scheme can achieve a very attractive rate region compared to several baseline scenarios. For example, with 100 antennas at each BS and four antennas at each SC, we observe an aggregate area throughput of 7.63 Gb/s/km 2 (DL) and 8.93 Gb/s/km 2 (UL) on a 20 MHz band shared by about 100 mobile devices.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The biggest challenge in the wireless industry today is to support the ever-growing demands for higher data rates and to ensure a consistent quality of service (QoS) throughout the entire network. Rising to this challenge means increasing network capacity by a factor of thousand over the next ten years <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</p><p>(UEs) on the same time-frequency resource. Once the number of antennas largely exceeds the number of actively transmitting or receiving UEs per cell, we are speaking about large-scale or "massive" multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The second approach is based on a dense deployment of small cells (SCs) which also increases the spatial reuse since less UEs share the resources of a single cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. Thus, cellular networks are going to be operated in a regime where the number of serving antennas equals or exceeds the number of UEs. As antennas become a commodity, it is natural to ask how the new abundance of degrees of freedom can be exploited effi ciently.</p><p>Although the benefi ts of using multiple antennas at a transmitter and/or a receiver are well studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref>, it was revealed only recently that very large antenna arrays can provide tremendous performance gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31]</ref>. Massive MIMO cannot only allow for aggressive spatial multiplexing and improved link reliability, but can also reduce the radiated power due to signifi cant array gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. Since such antenna arrays are composed of cheap low-power components, which can be integrated in existing cell sites or buildings (facades, windows, and other deployments), they could revolutionize the way traditional base stations (BSs) are built and deployed. However, in order to reap the benefi ts of a large number of coordinated antennas, channel state information (CSI) must be available at the transmitter. For this reason, massive MIMO systems fi nd their sweet spot in the time division duplexing (TDD) mode where channel reciprocity can be exploited. This allows a BS to estimate its downlink (DL) channels from uplink (UL) pilots sent by the UEs. Therefore, the resulting overhead scales linearly with the number of UEs and is independent of the number of antennas <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> argue that the performance gains of massive MIMO can also be realized in frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems, given that certain assumptions about the antenna correlation hold true and that information about the channel covariance matrix is available at the transmitter. Nevertheless, since massive MIMO suffers from some practical limitations, such as pilot contamination <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and antenna correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, it is unlikely that this type of network densifi cation alone can satisfy future traffi c demands.</p><p>On a separate track, shrinking the size of cells has been the single most effective way to increase network capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. This is because the capacity scales, at least in theory, linearly with the cell density. Moreover, the total transmit power of the network could be reduced since the cell density is proportional to the square of the cell radius while the path loss is proportional to the distance raised by some path loss exponent which is typically greater than two <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Thus, the capacity improvement does not come at the cost of an increase in the radiated energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. Nevertheless, regardless of the diffi culties and costs related to cell site acquisition, backhaul provision, and operation, deploying a large number of SCs can possibly exacerbate network performance. In particular, with antennas located below the rooftops and cell radii of less than 50 meters, supporting highly mobile UEs and providing seamless coverage over large areas determines which nodes of each tier interfere with each other. Hence, depending on the network topology, RTDD may or may not outperform TDD. Our simulation results show that a co-channel deployment of SCs and massive MIMO BSs in conjunction with either TDD or RTDD and the proposed precoding scheme leads to a very promising rate region compared to some baseline scenarios. In particular, we observe an aggregate area throughput of 7.63 Gb/s/ km 2 (DL) and 8.93 Gb/s/km 2 (UL) on a 20 MHz band shared by about 100 UEs. This rate could be easily increased by increasing the bandwidth, installing more antennas at the BSs, or adding more SCs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Related Work</head><p>The precoding design problem using interference covariance knowledge has been extensively studied in cognitive radio networks. In this context, a secondary transmitter acquires useful information about the interfering links in order to minimize interference imposed on a primary transmitter-receiver pair <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>. A similar approach is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> in order to maximize the sum rate in a two-cell TDD system. However, our extension of this concept to dense heterogeneous networks operating a TDD-protocol in a synchronized fashion is new. RTDD or time-shifted TDD protocols have been previously proposed to reduce the negative effects of pilot contamination in TDD cellular systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. RTDD is also considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, where, building upon the UL-DL duality established in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, a distributed power allocation algorithm is proposed to ensure symmetric UL-DL rates in both tiers. However, this scheme is based on a distributed iterative power allocation algorithm which needs to run over multiple channel coherence blocks to converge.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we present a general system model, explain different duplexing schemes, and discuss our proposed precoding technique. We then present some numerical results and evaluate the performance in an outdoor deployment scenario. Next, we discuss practical issues such as channel reciprocity and channel estimation and outline possible extensions. We fi nish with a summary and conclusions. become increasingly diffi cult. Hence, SCs alone are unlikely to meet QoS and capacity requirements for next-generation mobile networks. A simple solution to this problem is a two-tier network architecture, where macro BSs ensure outdoor coverage and serve highly mobile UEs, while SCs act as the main capacity-driver for indoor and outdoor hotspots. However, with limited spectral resources, a co-channel deployment of BSs and SCs is the only viable solution, and this in turn calls for low-complexity and distributed interference management schemes across both tiers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37]</ref>. A well-known technique for timedomain interference cancellation is the use of "almost blank subframes" which are under consideration for the Long Term Evolution (LTE) Advanced standard <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we present a TDD-based network architecture consisting of a massive MIMO macro tier overlaid with a second tier of SCs. Our goal is to integrate the complementary benefi ts of both. The key observation is that the synchronized operation of a TDD protocol in both tiers results in a channel reciprocity which facilitates not only the estimation of large-dimensional channels at the BSs, but also enables all devices in the network (BSs, SCs, UEs) to learn the eigenstructure of their interfering channels with no additional overhead. This information can be leveraged to design precoders which trade off beamforming gains against a reduction of interference imposed on the rest of the network. In other words, the SCs and BSs sacrifi ce some of their degrees of freedom (or "excess antennas") to reduce intra-and inter-tier interference. This enables some form of implicit cooperation between all devices in the network which does not necessitate any form of data or CSI exchange. Moreover, this scheme is fully distributed, easily scalable, and realizes the additional benefi ts of TDD, such as reduced latency, the ability to operate in unpaired frequency bands, and the support of asymmetric traffi c <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. We also consider a variant of the TDD protocol, called reverse TDD (RTDD). In contrast to TDD, the order of the UL and DL periods in one of the tiers is reversed, i.e., while the macro BSs are in the DL mode, the SCs are in the UL mode and vice versa.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>System Model and Precoding Scheme</head><p>We consider a two-tier network consisting of B macro BSs wherein each cell is overlaid with a dense tier of S SCs, as exemplarily shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The BSs and SCs are respectively equipped with N and F antennas. Each BS serves K ≤ N macro UEs (MUEs) while each SC serves a single small cell UE (SUE). The MUEs and SUEs have only one antenna. Extensions to multi-antenna UEs and multiple SUEs per SC are straightforward, but not considered here for clarity of presentation. Generally, F would lie somewhere in the range from 1 to 4 (as is state-ofthe-art for Wi-Fi access points <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>), while N could be very large, i.e., 100, 1000, or even more <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>.</p><p>In this setting, we compare the performance of four different duplexing modes, namely: • Frequency division duplexing (FDD), • Time division duplexing (TDD), • Co-channel TDD (coTDD), and • Co-channel reverse TDD (coRTDD).</p><p>The operating principles for each are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. In both the FDD and TDD schemes, the BS and SC tiers operate on non-overlapping frequency bands, while UL and DL transmissions are duplexed in either frequency (FDD) or time (TDD). Although transmissions do not interfere across the tiers, the main performance-limiting factor is intra-tier interference which is particularly severe among the SCs. Unlike the aforementioned schemes, with coTDD and coRTDD, both tiers share the entire bandwidth. While the UL and DL transmissions are synchronized in both tiers with coTDD, their order is reversed in one of the tiers with coRTDD, i.e., the BSs are in DL mode while the SCs operate in UL mode, and vice versa. The duplexing mode determines which groups of devices interfere with each other. For example, in coTDD, the SUEs interfere with the MUEs in the UL while the BSs interfere with the SCs in the DL. This behavior is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. Note that we assume perfect synchronization across all devices in the </p></div>

Without loss of generality, we consider a frequency-flat block-fading channel model with coherence time T.

Perfect CSI of the local channels at all devices in the network is assumed. Later in the paper, we further discuss the implications of some of these assumptions.

The transmit powers of the BSs and SCs are denoted by P BS and P SC , respectively. Note that each BS distributes its transmit power equally among the K MUEs in its cell. The role of the regularization parameters can be explained as follows. For α,β = 0, the BSs and SCs do not take the interference they may create for neighboring devices into account. Hence, they precode as if they were operating in an isolated cell, i.e., MMSE precoding for the BSs and maximumratio transmission for the SCs. On the other hand, large values for the regularization parameters make the precoding vectors more orthogonal to the interference subspace. Thus, by tuning α and β, the BSs and SCs can trade off the beamforming gains for their target UEs against interference reduction to neighboring UEs. Intuitively, a transmitter "sacrifi ces" some degrees of freedom (or, fi guratively speaking, "antennas") to reduce interference towards the directions from which it receives the most interference. Consider a scenario where an MUE is located in the vicinity of an SC. Since the MUE creates strong interference to the SC in the UL, the SC will specifi cally reduce interference towards this MUE in the DL. Since this precoding technique automatically reduces the negative impact of the strongest sources of interference, one already expects to achieve signifi cant performance gains with few antennas at each SC. This will be demonstrated by simulations in the next section. As such, network-wide TDD and the resulting channel reciprocity allow for cooperation between the devices without any form of data or CSI exchange. This is in stark contrast to network MIMO schemes which require full CSI and user data exchange among multiple BSs or SCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Moreover, our scheme is fully distributed and scalable. Hence, it is amenable to practical utilizations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Numerical Results</head><p>In this section, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed precoding scheme by numerical simulations. For simplicity, we consider a 3x3 grid of B = 9 BSs, where each BS serves K = 20 MUEs. Every BS covers an area of one square kilometer (1 km 2 ) over which S = 81 SCs are distributed on a regular grid with an inter-site distance of 111 meters. The MUEs are uniformly randomly distributed over the entire area while one SUE is uniformly distributed within a disc of radius 40 meters around each of the SCs. We ensure that a guard distance of 35 meters from the BSs and 10 meters from the SCs is maintained. The SUEs are associated with their closest SC while the MUEs are associated with their closest BS, even if other cell associations could provide a higher instantaneous rate. This assumption is primarily motivated by a scenario where highly mobile MUEs cannot be associated with SCs due to prohibitive handover signaling. A random snapshot of the center cell is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. We consider a distance-dependent path loss model which encapsulates the effects of smallscale and shadow fading as well as line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) links as specifi ed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> (Table <ref type="table">6</ref>.4-1). The path loss functions, LOS probabilities, and shadowing standard deviations, as well as all other system parameters are summarized in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. In order to avoid border effects, a wrap-around (torus) topology is assumed so that each macrocell has eight neighboring cells. Note that the SCs, BSs, and all UEs are located outdoors. From the perspective of interference, this is a worst-case scenario since there are no shielding walls separating interfering devices. We compute UL and DL sum rates of the macro and SC tier in the center cell, averaged over 10,000 different channel realizations and UE distributions.</p><p>Our baseline scenario is the FDD scheme, assuming that each SC has F = 1 and each BS has N = 20 antennas. Thus, the number of antennas equals the number of UEs in the system, i.e., the access points need all of their degrees of freedom to serve their UEs. We assume that each tier uses half of its bandwidth for UL and DL transmissions. By changing the fraction of the total bandwidth allocated to each tier,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Duplexing Schemes</head><p>Due to their similarity and lack of space, we only briefl y summarize the signaling models for the other duplexing schemes. FDD signaling does not create cross-tier interference, but channel reciprocity does not hold either. Therefore, the UL interference covariance matrices cannot be used for DL precoding. Moreover, each tier is assigned only a fraction of the total available bandwidth. We assume that the BSs and SCs apply single-user MMSE detection in the UL and the precoders in equation 11 and equation 12 for α = β = 0 in the DL. Likewise, the TDD signaling completely nulls the cross-tier interference. However, channel reciprocity holds for each tier and the proposed precoding scheme can be used to reduce intratier interference. The interference covariance matrices Q BS i and Q SC ij are the same as in equation 3 and equation 4, respectively, without the inter-tier interference terms resulting from the transmissions of the MUEs and SUEs. In the coRTDD scheme, both tiers operate on the same band; hence, cross-tier interference plays a major role. The system model is the same as that of the coTDD scheme described earlier, where the only difference is that the order of UL and DL transmissions in the SC tier is reversed. (This also impacts the defi nition of Q BS i and Q SC ij in equation 3 and equation 4). In this case, the proposed precoding scheme does not need any modifi cation. we obtain the DL and UL rate-regions as shown by black solid lines in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>, respectively. Next, with the same duplexing scheme, we demonstrate the gains of having additional antennas in each tier. To this end, each SC is equipped with F = 4 and each BS with N = 100 antennas, while the number of UEs is kept constant. As can be seen from the dashed lines in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>, the UL and DL rates in both tiers are signifi cantly improved (SC UL + 100 percent, SC DL + 50 percent, macro UL + 200 percent, macro DL + 150 percent). Interestingly, the resulting gains are more pronounced in the UL than in the DL. The reason is that MMSE detection is considered in the UL, which allows for signifi cant interference reduction as the number of antennas grows. However, since channel reciprocity does not hold, the UL covariance matrices cannot be used for DL precoding in order to reduce intra-tier interference. Thus, the gains achievable by adding more antennas are less substantial.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. System parameters and path loss models used for simulations. Next, we illustrate the gains from TDD in conjunction with the proposed precoding technique. As before, both tiers operate on different frequency bands, but TDD is used instead of FDD to separate UL and DL transmissions. Since in this case channel reciprocity holds within each tier, the UL covariance information can be used for DL precoding to reduce intra-tier interference. The dashed-and-dotted line in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> indicates the rate region for the TDD scheme using the precoders as defi ned in equation 11 and equation 12 with α = β = 1. Note that the corresponding interference covariance matrices Q BS i and Q SC ij are defi ned in equation 3 and equation 4, respectively, without the inter-tier interference terms from the MUEs and SUEs. This leads to an additional DL sum rate gain of about 50 percent in the macro tier and 30 percent in the SC tier. Note that the precoding only affects the DL rates in both tiers. Consequently, the UL rates are the same as in the FDD scheme.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transmit</head><p>Furthermore, we consider the co-channel deployment of BSs and SCs under the coTDD and coRTDD schemes. In these cases, both tiers use the entire bandwidth and are assumed to assign equal time fractions to UL and DL transmissions, i.e., T UL ___ T = 0.5. This parameter could be changed to further enlarge the rate regions of both duplexing schemes. It is notable that, in the coRTDD scheme, the macro UL and SC DL rates are coupled, i.e., increasing the UL duration of the macro tier decreases the DL duration of the SC tier and vice versa. As before, we assume N = 100 and F = 4. By tuning the precoding parameters α and β, different points of the rate region can be obtained, as shown by colored trapezoids in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>. Note that the entire rate region has a more complex shape whose characterization is a prohibitive task. The four corner points correspond to the (α,β)-tuples (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1). In contrast to TDD, the precoder design now affects the rates of both tiers simultaneously. We focus fi rst on the coTDD scheme. In this case, the DL transmissions of the BSs create signifi cant interference to the SUEs. Hence, increasing α enables the BSs to cancel interference towards the SUEs at the cost of reduced DL rates for their own MUEs. On the other hand, the MUEs experience strong interference from the SCs. Although each SC is equipped with only four antennas, increasing β considerably reduces this interference. As can be seen from Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, the proposed precoding scheme can increase the SC and macro DL sum rates by 50 percent and 200 percent, respectively. Remarkably, the (1,1)-corner point lies well beyond the TDD rate region. This fully justifi es the co-channel deployment of SCs and BSs, even in an outdoor scenario with strong interference. The area throughput at this point of the rate region with a 20 MHz bandwidth is 7.63 Gb/s/km 2 (DL) and 8.93 Gb/s/km 2  One can observe that the impact of the precoding scheme is less signifi cant in the coRTDD scheme. The main reason for this is that the interfering links have changed. By increasing α, the BSs can reduce the interference towards the SCs (leading to a 50 percent gain in the SC UL sum rate) at the cost of a reduced SINR for their MUEs (incurring a 40 percent loss in DL sum rate). On the other hand, since the SCs have fewer antennas than the BSs, they cannot reduce cross-tier interference by increasing β. Thus, only the SC DL rates can be improved, by about 15 percent. It is worth highlighting that although coRTDD with the proposed precoding scheme can achieve DL sum rates beyond the TDD rate region, this gain cannot be achieved in the UL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this section, we discuss implementation considerations along with several practical aspects of the proposed network architecture and precoding scheme, such as channel reciprocity, channel estimation, synchronization, and interference covariance matrix estimation. Furthermore, some advantages of TDD and coRTDD over FDD are explained and possible extensions to FDD and UEs employing multiple antennas are investigated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Channel Reciprocity</head><p>In order to employ the proposed precoding scheme, it is crucial that channel reciprocity holds. Therefore, every UE must be scheduled on the same frequency resources during two subsequent UL and Co-channel reverse TDD DL periods. Note that the TDD protocol only ensures the reciprocity of the physical propagation channel. However, in order to achieve full channel reciprocity, one must compensate for random phase and amplitude differences in the transceiver radio frequency (RF) chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In general, this can be established by either internal self-calibration <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> or external calibration mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. A recent non-commercial testbed developed using off-the-shelf hardware has shown that this is generally possible, even for very large antenna arrays <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. Nonetheless, even if channel reciprocity holds, the interference levels experienced by the UEs and the access points differ substantially <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>. Thus, some feedback from the UEs for rate adaptation is still necessary. Another important aspect of the network architecture studied in this work is the time synchronization requirement for all devices. Relying on the Global Positioning System (GPS) time information, which today is available at most access points and UEs, this should not be impossible to achieve. Finally, channel reciprocity could be also exploited in FDD systems since the eigenstructure of the wireless channel has been shown to remain similar over a wide range of wavelengths (after appropriate frequency transformation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. The eigenspace of the UL interference covariance matrix could hence be used to design interference-aware precoders similar to the ones proposed in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Channel Estimation</head><p>We have assumed that perfect CSI of the local channels is available at all devices. If channel reciprocity holds, CSI can be acquired at the BSs and SCs from uplink pilots sent by the UEs. In practice, this has currently been exploited only in TDD systems, while FDD systems rely on a combination of downlink training and feedback. Unless certain conditions on the channel eigenstructure are satisfi ed <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the overhead for channel training scales linearly with the number of antennas, making the use of very large arrays impossible. Another problem in dense heterogeneous networks is the optimal assignment of pilot sequences to UEs in order to reduce the negative effects of pilot contamination <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. The cochannel deployment of multiple tiers is expected to render this problem even more diffi cult. To the best of our current knowledge, this problem has not yet been addressed in the literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimation of the Interference Covariance Matrix</head><p>We have assumed that the BSs and SCs can perfectly estimate their local channels and interference covariance matrices. However, with an increasing number of antennas at the BSs and SCs, this task becomes prohibitive. Classical estimators like the sample covariance matrix which require that the number of antennas is much smaller than the number of observations, i.e., the channel coherence time, fail to work in the large antenna regime <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. In this context, the coRTDD protocol has the advantage that the interfering channels between the SCs and the BSs are quasi-static so that they could be estimated over very long periods of time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FDD versus TDD and RTDD</head><p>As mentioned earlier, the choice of duplexing mode entails which devices interfere with each other. Apart from that, TDD is not only the key enabler for exploiting channel reciprocity, but it also has several other advantages over FDD which are summarized here for completeness (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> for more details). In contrast to FDD, TDD does not require DL feedback of CSI from the UEs, which reduces latency. It further does not need paired frequency bands, which are increasingly diffi cult to obtain in the overcrowded spectrum. Moreover, TDD can lead to more effi cient devices from the perspective of both cost and power since no duplexer is required and the same oscillator and fi lters are used for UL reception and DL transmissions. Since the entire bandwidth is used, TDD increases the frequency diversity, but also increases the noise power by 3 dB. However, this does not play a major role since dense networks are interference limited. Finally, TDD is more suitable in adapting to asymmetric traffi c since the UL/DL ratio can be quickly changed. As mentioned earlier, since the MUEs are prone to strong interference from the SC tier, DL in the macrocell is considered to be the main performance bottleneck. Reducing this interference is thus of utmost importance. In this regard, coRTDD is a less promising candidate than coTDD since only BS-to-SC interference can be reduced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Possible Extensions</head><p>First, our proposed scheme could be extended to the case of multi-antenna UEs in a rather straightforward manner. This would enable the UEs to estimate their interference covariance matrices and employ precoders to reduce interference to adjacent access points or UEs during the UL transmissions. Second, we have considered a worst-case scenario without any form of power control, cell association, and user scheduling. By employing location-dependent user scheduling and interference-temperature power control schemes, the network-wide performance could be further enhanced <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Third, more sophisticated duplexing schemes could be considered. For example, an attractive alternative to coTDD is band switching duplexing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>). In this scheme, both tiers operate simultaneously on two frequency bands over which they apply TDD in reversed orders. Thus, every device is permanently in UL and DL mode so that conventional TDD-duplexing delays are reduced. One could further reverse the orders of UL and DL for certain fractions of devices in the network to favorably shape the interference distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary and Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we have presented a TDD-based network architecture which integrates the complementary benefi ts of a massive MIMO macro tier overlaid with a dense tier of SCs. The synchronized networkwide TDD protocol is the key enabler for exploiting channel reciprocity which allows every device to reuse its received interference covariance matrix estimate for interference-aware precoding. Based on this observation, we have proposed a simple precoding scheme which relies only on local information, does not require any data exchange between the devices, and is hence fully distributed and scalable. Simulation results have shown that this architecture can achieve an area throughput on the order of tens of Gb/s per square kilometer, which can be further improved by either installing more BS antennas or deploying more SCs. In summary, we believe that a TDD-based heterogeneous network architecture consisting of massive MIMO BSs and SCs is a very attractive candidate for the next generation of cellular networks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Panel 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Terms 4G-Fourth generation BS-Base station coRTDD-Co-channel reverse TDD coTDD-Co-channel TDD CSI-Channel state information DL-Downlink FDD-Frequency division duplex GPS-Global Positioning System LOS-Line-of-sight LTE-Long Term Evolution MIMO-Multiple input multiple output MMSE-Minimum mean square error MUE-Macro user equipment NLOS-Non line-of-sight QoS-Quality of service RF-Radio frequency RTDD-Reverse time division duplex SC-Small cell SINR-Signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio SUE-Small cell user equipment TDD-Time division duplex UE-User equipment UL-Uplink</figDesc></figure>
