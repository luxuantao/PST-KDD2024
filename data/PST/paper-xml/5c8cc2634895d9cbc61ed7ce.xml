			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Developing software in distributed development environments exhibits coordination, control and communication challenges. Agile practices, which demand frequent communication and self-organization between remote sites, are increasingly found in global software development (GSD) to mitigate said challenges. Objective: We aim to provide detailed insight into what is reported on the successful application of agile practices in GSD from 1999 to 2016 and also identify the most frequently applied agile practices and reported distribution scenarios. We further strive to uncover research opportunities and gaps in the field of agile GSD. Method: We build our systematic literature review on top of a previous review, which investigated studies published between 1999 and 2009, and extend the review by years 2010-2016, for which we conduct both a quantitative and a qualitative analysis. Results: Our results show that the majority of the cases studied is global and involves complex distribution scenarios with Scrum or combined Scrum/Extreme Programming being the most used agile methods. Key results include that in contrast to 1999-2009, where four Extreme Programming practices were among the ten most frequently used agile practices, in 2010-2016 Scrum is in the center of agile GSD implementations with eight Scrum-based practices in the top ten agile practices used in GSD. Conclusion: Agile GSD is a maturing research field with higher quality contributions and a greater variety of publication types and methods from 2010 to 2016 than before from 1999 to 2009. However, researchers need to report full empirical contextual details of their studied cases in order to improve the generalizability of results and allow the future creation of stronger frameworks to drive the implementation of agile practices in GSD.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Global software development (GSD) promises cost savings, access to large multi-skilled workforces, a reduced time to market <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[16]</ref> and the possibility to follow critical-path tasks around the clock <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[11]</ref>. These deciding factors, among others, have made GSD a daily reality in today's IT organizations although development environments are more complex and exhibit several challenges such as: physical distances and time zones, loss of "teamness", culture differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[5]</ref>, strategic issues, process differences, knowledge management and technical challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Agile methods are built around empowered and self-organizing teams with a strong focus on collaboration and communication supported by various agile practices including pairing, customer collaboration, stand-ups, reviews, retrospectives and the planning game <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[24]</ref>. Agile practices are regarded as being able to mitigate the challenges faced in GSD by several authors such as e.g. <ref type="bibr">Ramesh et al. [19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Paasivaara et al. [17]</ref> and Hossain et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[12]</ref>. However, neither the leading agile method Scrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[21]</ref> nor Extreme Programming (XP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[6]</ref> was designed for teams working in distributed environments. Hence adaptations to the original process are necessary <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[4]</ref>. The goal of these adaptations is to transfer agile values, which produced excellent results in the last decade for collocated teams <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[8]</ref>, to GSD environments. Combining agile practices with GSD has not only been an active research stream (S112) but is also extensively practiced in industry as the usage of distributed agile teams has more than doubled from 35% in 2012 <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[28]</ref> to 86% in 2016 <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[29]</ref>.</p><p>The objective of this study is to provide a systematic literature review (SLR) on the successful usage of agile practices in GSD. We define agile according to ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[7]</ref>, p. 340) as a "method to rapidly or inherently create change, proactively or reactively embrace change, and learn from change while, contributing to perceived customer value". A practice within the scope of this study is understood as "the customary, habitual, or expected procedure or way of doing of something", <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> and we regard an agile practice as a central component (such as e.g. the daily standup or pair programming) which originates from an agile method (such as e.g. Scrum, Extreme Programming, FDD or Kanban), either used in its original or an adapted form. Furthermore, in accordance with <ref type="bibr">(S62)</ref>, we understand global software development as the "development of a software artifact across more than one location" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[25]</ref>, p. 122), which includes all scenarios of geographical distribution, not only global ones.</p><p>Our main contribution is to provide a comprehensive understanding and analysis of the successful usage of agile practices in GSD. To that end, we continue the analysis carried out by Jalali and Wohlin (S62; S63) covering years 1999-2009 with an extension for the years of 2010-2016. We strive to both expand on their results for an updated state of the art as well as offer a comparison between the two periods of investigation <ref type="bibr">(1999</ref><ref type="bibr">-2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">by Jalali and Wohlin, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">-2016</ref> added in this study). We provide an overview of successful empirical cases, identify which agile practices are used and which cases are typically reported (concerning their empirical context such as e.g. project duration, project size or application domain but also their distribution scenarios such as shoring and sourcing strategies). Further important contributions of our study are that practitioners can use our findings to identify which agile practices are commonly used to successfully drive their own implementation of agile GSD while researchers can gain an aggregation of past results to build upon and focus future research on the research gaps identified and avoid repetitions.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the research significance, motivation and objectives of this study in light of related work. The detailed study design and procedure is explained in Section 3. Section 4 presents the results of the systematic review, both in continuation of, covering <ref type="bibr">1999-2016, and in comparison to, covering 1999-2009 vs. 2010-2016, previous</ref> research by <ref type="bibr">Jalali and Wohlin (S62;</ref><ref type="bibr">S63)</ref>. Section 5 presents the discussion including future research opportunities and limitations of this review study. Section 6 concludes the report. Some studies referenced in the first few sections of this report, such as e.g. (S62; S63), are part of our review's set of included studies, which is why they are referenced by their included study ID (S62; S63) rather than as a general reference, for consistency and to avoid the listing of duplicate references.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Research motivation and objectives</head><p>Global software development is an active research field as several systematic reviews account for <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">27]</ref> and all seem to agree that there is a need for more primary studies in GSD research. Most relevant to our line of research are systematic mapping (SM) and systematic literature review (SLR) studies focusing on the application of agile practices in GSD.</p><p>Jiménez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[13]</ref> conducted an SLR on challenges and improvements in distributed software development. Although <ref type="bibr">Jiménez et al. [13]</ref> identified agile methodologies as one success factor in GSD, their study's focus was different to ours and no concrete agile practices were addressed. <ref type="bibr">Hossain et al. [12]</ref> conducted an SLR on Scrum and GSD, which is the first SLR addressing agile practices in GSD, but in contrast to our SLR their focus is limited solely to Scrum. Jalali and Wohlin were the first to deliver an extensive overview of agile GSD by conducting a systematic mapping study <ref type="bibr">(S62)</ref> and a systematic review (S63) on top. Both studies (S62; S63) covered years <ref type="bibr">1999-2009.</ref> There is also a related tertiary study by <ref type="bibr">Hanssen et al. [10]</ref> summarizing twelve SLRs in GSD by looking through an agile lens, where the authors conclude that agile is a frequent topic in GSD, but many publications lack proper research design and rather have the character of industrial reports. Furthermore Hanssen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[10]</ref> call for a new SLR for agile in GSD to cover publications of 2008 and newer.</p><p>The most comprehensive and recent review relevant to our approach is by <ref type="bibr">Rizvi et al. (S112)</ref>, who investigated distributed agile software engineering for years 2007-2012. Our scope is different as we focus on the state of the art of agile practices and methods, whereas <ref type="bibr">Rizvi et al. (S112)</ref> look closer at underlying reasons for adopting agile methods to GSD as well as risks. The distinguishing factor is that <ref type="bibr">Rizvi et al. (S112)</ref> aim to understand the prospects of the agile adoption in GSD while Jalali and Wohlin (S62; S63) and our systematic review study, in continuation of work by Jalali and Wohlin, focus on the evolvement of the field and the practices that have been used in different scenarios. Another recent SLR is by Alzoubi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[3]</ref>, who investigate the communication challenges in distributed teams that adopt agile methods up to the year 2014. Alzoubi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[3]</ref> categorize found challenges in six categories, but their focus is different to ours because agile practices are not taken into account. The newest SLR in the field is by Alsahli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[2]</ref>, who studied the years of 2006-2016 in their SLR and tried to aggregate how agile practices mitigate GSD challenges. Apart from their shorter period of analysis, the distinguishing factor to this SLR is that Alsahli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[2]</ref> only include studies which particularly state the GSD challenges that a practice mitigates, which is why their result set is much more limited.</p><p>The successful application of agile practices in GSD is also a very important topic to the practitioner, as the 11th annual state of agile survey report <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[29]</ref> shows that the usage of distributed agile teams has more than doubled from 2012 to 2016: while in 2012 35% of the respondents reported to work in distributed agile teams <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[28]</ref>, in 2016 the number increased to 86% <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[29]</ref>.</p><p>In conclusion, although there have been reviews covering different aspects of agile GSD in the past, we have identified the research gap that there is no recent study focusing on aggregating and synthesizing the state of the art on the successful application of agile practices in GSD, which as our discussion of related work shows, is a very recent and relevant challenge to both researcher and practitioner and deserves further research attention.</p><p>In order to answer the identified research gap, we build our research on top of (S62; S63) in order to both continue their analysis on 1999-2009 for the years 2010-2016, and also to compare our newer studied period <ref type="bibr">(2010-2016) to theirs (1999-2009)</ref>. This study is furthermore unique in the way that it effectively covers the usage of agile practices in GSD from agile origins (1999) to recent time <ref type="bibr">(2016)</ref>. Although it can be regarded a limitation to build on the methodology and results of others (see Section 5.2), we see particular value in our study by continuing the work of Jalali and Wohlin (S62; S63) to perform a complete and updated analysis in contrast to covering the whole time frame on our own, which would not only be duplicate work but also infeasible given the amount of studies over the years. We also strive to identify future research potential based on our analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research design</head><p>Jalali and Wohlin conducted a systematic mapping (S62) and a systematic review (S63) for the years 1999-2009. We expand on their work in order to continue their analysis and provide up-to-date maps and results. Since the systematic review of (S63) also contains the mappings of (S62), we decided to focus on the revised study (S63), with the exception of our Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>, which has only been published in <ref type="bibr">(S62)</ref>, but is also part of our analysis.</p><p>In order to be able to continue the work of Jalali and Wohlin (S62; S63) and compare results, we chose an almost identical study design. A few minor changes are explained in the remainder of this section. On top of that we also consulted guidelines for systematic review study design by <ref type="bibr">Kitchenham and Charters [14]</ref> and Petersen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[18]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Research questions</head><p>In order to continue the analysis of Jalali and Wohlin (S62; S63) we use the same research questions RQ1a, RQ2a in an effort to provide upto-date answers. Additionally, we also want to compare the results of our newly studied period of 2010-2016 to the former research on 1999-2009, by adding RQ1b and RQ2b to analyze whether significant changes occurred in our extension of recent years.</p><p>RQ1a. What is reported in peer-reviewed research literature about agile practices in GSD between 1999 and 2016? RQ1b. Can we see different results in this study's extension for years 2010-2016 as compared to the results of 1999-2009? RQ2a. Which agile practices, in which GSD settings, under which circumstances have been successfully applied in peer-reviewed research literature between 1999 and 2016? RQ2b. Can we see different results in this study's extension for years 2010-2016 as compared to the results of 1999-2009?</p><p>As stated before, part of our motivation for this research is to analyze the significant rise from 2012 to 2016 in the implementation of agile distributed teams in today's industry as reported by respondents of the 11th annual state of agile survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[29]</ref>. So we are interested in analyzing whether this fact produces different results in the newer years since 2009. Hence, RQ1b and RQ2b link directly to that objective, while RQ1a and RQ2a address our goal of providing a complete and updated state of the art overview of 1999-2016 by continuing the work of Jalali and Wohlin (S63).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Research steps</head><p>In accordance with the recommendations by <ref type="bibr">Kitchenham and Charters [14]</ref>, the research was conducted by following these steps:</p><p>1. Planning the review:</p><p>1. Identification of the need for a review (Section 2). 2. Specifying the research questions (Section 3.1).</p><p>3. Developing a review protocol (Appendix A). 4. Evaluating the review protocol (carried out by the second author). 2. Conducting the review:</p><p>1. The identification of primary studies (Section 3.3). 2. Selection of primary studies (Section 3.4).</p><p>3. Study quality assessment (Section 3.5).</p><p>4. Data extraction and synthesis (Section 3.6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Reporting the review (this report).</head><p>The first author served as the primary reviewer, supported by the second author as a secondary reviewer, for conducting all three steps. They controlled each other by checking random data extraction samples of each other's work to avoid individual bias and ensure a consistent handling during data collection (step 2).</p><p>The third and fourth author, respectively, assisted with setting up the review protocol (step 1), overseeing the review process (step 2), and improving and reviewing the final study report (step 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Literature search</head><p>To achieve comparable results to (S62; S63), we used the same search terms and constraints except for the term "open source" which produced many irrelevant results during a pilot search in IEEE Xplore and was dropped. The publication years were set to 2010-2016 and the language to English. Our search was limited to abstract, keywords and title to minimize the number of irrelevant hits. Although there are books touching the area such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">31]</ref>, books were excluded on all database searches in alignment with (S62; S63) as they are generally not peer-reviewed. Our search string looks for agile AND global software development, with synonyms or variants of both terms separated by ORoperators, as follows:</p><p>(agile OR scrum OR "extreme programming" OR "pair programming" OR "lean development" OR "lean software development")AND("global software engineering" OR "global software development" OR "distributed software engineering" OR "distributed software development" OR GSE OR GSD OR "distributed team" OR "global team" OR "dispersed team" OR "spread team" OR "virtual team" OR offshore OR outsource)</p><p>We searched all databases of (S63): ACM Digital Library, AIS Electronic Library (AISeL), Compendex, IEEE Xplore, INSPEC and Scopus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Study selection</head><p>We defined for the inclusion criteria that the study directly relates to the research questions, i.e. addresses agile practices in GSD and that the study is available via the university library services accessible to the authors during the time of search (Stanford University, Vienna University of Technology and PUCRS) or was freely available on the web. Our exclusion criteria were, in accordance with (S62; S63), potentially not or not rigorously peer-reviewed literature such as books, theses, workshop papers and gray literature as well as publications in other languages than English.</p><p>The selection process is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The first author searched all six databases with the pre-defined search string and the noted limitations. For databases that allowed exporting the search results in CSV-format, the first author wrote a script that automatically aggregated the findings to a spreadsheet of potentially relevant studies. The script added a new entry to the spreadsheet if the study was not a part of it yet.</p><p>Our final search conducted by the first author resulted in 512 studies. In the second step the first author excluded books, theses, workshop papers and gray literature, by reading all of the abstracts, and classified the remaining studies with regard to their relevance to the research questions as relevant (N yes ), maybe relevant (N mb ) or irrelevant (N no ). In the third step the second author double-checked all papers in categories maybe relevant and irrelevant to reduce the individual researcher's bias. After step 4, the first and second author arrived at an agreement on the maybe relevant studies, by excluding those studies which at least one of the reviewers regarded as irrelevant, but keeping all those which one reviewer regarded as relevant or both regarded as maybe relevant. After downloading all studies through the university library services, and achieving an agreement at the end of step 4, we were left with 234 potentially included studies. During full-text analysis in the next step 5, another 89 studies were excluded, resulting in the final set of 145 included studies for 2010-2016 (cf. Appendix B). This final set of 145 studies is the basis for our analysis, but in accordance with (S62; S63) we further selected all successful empirical cases (89 cases within the set of 145 studies) for detailed empirical analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Study quality assessment criteria</head><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows our quality assessment checklist that has been used by the first and second author for full-text analysis. Jalali and Wohlin (S62; S63) stated their exclusion criteria, but not how quality of studies has been assessed. The only criteria we could extract from their report are to not include studies without results and studies which have been published more than once, which became part of our criterion 6 in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p>For conducting our SLR, we defined five additional criteria for quality assessment (cf. Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). We chose our criteria carefully and regarded them as knock-out criteria, i.e. if one criterion was not met, the study's quality was considered unfit to be included in our review.</p><p>Criterion 1 ensures that the study focuses on agile methods, such as e.g. Scrum or XP, in distributed environments and thus has a suitable context. On top of that criterion 2 demands that also concrete agile practices have to be described. The combination of criteria 1 and 2 guarantees that no studies are included which state to use agile GSD or Scrum in GSD without also referring to the concrete agile practices in use.</p><p>We handled criterion 6, i.e. multiple publications of the same results with small extensions or minor variations, in the way that only the first study published is included in our SLR (if it also met our other criteria).</p><p>There was no additional quality assessment for the years 1999-2009, i.e. the studies included by Jalali and Wohlin (S62; S63), but we performed sanity checks when aggregating their results from 1999-2009 with the data from our analysis in Section 4 and found their results and according analysis presented for 1999-2009 convincing overall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Data extraction and synthesis</head><p>Data extraction was initially conducted based on title, keywords and abstract and then continued with a full-text analysis for the final set of 145 included studies. The first author implemented a web form, which facilitated and improved the data extraction process and was used by both the first and the second author. The Appendix A shows the detailed layout of our data extraction form and underlying spreadsheet.</p><p>We classified all included studies into one of the following research types inspired by Wieringa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[30]</ref>:</p><p>Solution proposal: Proposal of a novel solution technique without a full-blown validation, but may offer a proof of concept or a small example.</p><p>Validation research: Investigation of the properties of a solution that has not yet been implemented in practice, methods may include e.g. experiments, simulation or prototyping.</p><p>Evaluation research: Analysis of a problem or the implementation of a technique in practice by means of e.g. a case study, field study or a survey.</p><p>Philosophical papers: Sketch of a new way of looking at things, e.g. a new conceptual framework.</p><p>Opinion paper: Statement of the author's personal opinion.</p><p>Experience paper: Listing of the author's personal experience in an anecdotal way, may also be often written by industry practitioners.</p><p>Furthermore we extracted the following information for all 145 included studies: general (such as e.g. authors' information, year and publication target), research (type, method and sub-method and means of analysis) and results (type of contribution). For the 89 successful empirical cases among our included set of studies, featured in case studies or experience reports, we also extracted the following kinds of information: empirical (such as e.g. project size and duration), distribution (such as e.g. location and legal entity) and agile (agile method, agility level and agile practices).</p><p>The data extracted using the web form was copied to a spreadsheet for data synthesis. Additionally, the result data from (S63), as extracted from their published report, was also added to the same spreadsheet.</p><p>Data synthesis is divided into quantitative and qualitative synthesis. Synthesis for multiple-case studies has been conducted by treating each reported case separately.</p><p>As has been explained in the introduction, we included all geographically distributed software development teams, not only globally distributed ones. This aligns with (S62; S63) and also with the definition of global software development by <ref type="bibr">Šmite et al. ([25]</ref>, p. 122): "development of a software artifact across more than one location". We expanded on the classification used by Jalali and Wohlin (S62; S63) for distribution types/scenarios to incorporate the GSD taxonomy of <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[25]</ref> with the following definitions to extract more detailed information:</p><p>Location: Offshore (different countries) &gt; Onshore (same country) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1</head><p>Checklist for quality assessment of the studies.</p><p>Criteria Question 1 Does the study mainly focus on the usage of agile methods in distributed environments? 2 Does the study refer to concrete agile practices and not just mention an agile context? 3</p><p>Does the study deal with distributed software engineering sites and not just a remote customer? 4</p><p>Is the objective of the study clear? 5</p><p>Is the methodology appropriate for achieving the objective of the study? 6</p><p>Does the study report original results that have not been published elsewhere?</p><p>or Unclear.</p><p>Legal entity: Outsourcing (different companies) &gt; Insourcing (same company) or Unclear.</p><p>Geographic distance: Far (flying time 2 h and more) &gt; Near (flying time less than 2 h) or Unclear.</p><p>Temporal distance: Large (more than 4 h) &gt; Small (4 h or less) or Unclear.</p><p>If a study falls into several distribution types, e.g. a multi-site environment with two sites involved in onshoring and one site in offshoring, the most complex category will be assigned (as denoted by the "&gt;" sign), i.e. "offshoring" for that example. Šmite et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[25]</ref> propose to have different notions for geographic and temporal distance for offshoring and onshoring. While we see benefit to specify contextual information more accurately that way for a specific case, we argue that it is sufficient to use the more coarse-grained view for our review and also in order to stay closer to the taxonomy used by Jalali and Wohlin (S62; S63).</p><p>There is a distinction between the terms distributed team and virtual team in (S62): distributed teams work on independent tasks while virtual teams work jointly on the same tasks. Since no reference is cited for this definition, we coin the terms for the teams' distribution type, inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[26]</ref>, as follows.</p><p>Team distribution type: "Isolated distributed teams" or "Integrated distributed teams" or "Unclear". Isolated distributed team: each team consists only of team members of one site, hence the team is a collocated (isolated) and works on mostly independent tasks from other teams. We regard this as the corresponding term to Jalali and Wohlin's (S62) distributed team. Integrated distributed team: Team members are dispersed across different locations and work jointly on the same tasks as a team, i.e. the team is integrated over multiple sites. We see this as the corresponding term to Jalali and Wohlin's (S62) virtual team.</p><p>Other than that, we extracted similar data from each paper as Jalali and Wohlin did to be able to compare results: The overall project size is also defined as in <ref type="bibr">(S62)</ref> with: Large (more than 50 persons) &gt; Medium (21-50 persons) &gt; Small (20 or less persons) or Unclear. Project duration was defined as: Long (more than 7 months) &gt; Medium &gt; Short (less than 1 month) or Unclear. Like (S62), we based the knowledge areas on SWEBOK <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Jalali and Wohlin (S62; S63) use the term "practice" for both "agile methods" (S62; S63: "agile practices") such as Scrum, Extreme Programming, FDD and Kanban for example as well as for activities or elements within these agile methods (such as daily standup, retrospective, pair programming, among others). To make the difference more explicit to the reader in this study, we will use the word "practice" only for activities/elements within agile methods, and we further define an agile practice as one which originates from an agile method (such as e.g. Scrum, Extreme Programming, FDD or Kanban).</p><p>Jalali and Wohlin (S62; S63) also extracted whether reported empirical studies were successful, however they did not report how they determined it. We extracted the information from studying the full-text carefully: a study was considered a success if the application of agile practices was successful in the end (even if struggles have been reported along the way) or a failure if that state was not reached in the end. Since in our pilot search we found that studies do not report success or failure on the level of individual agile practices, we considered all applications of agile practices within a study a success if the study had a successful overall outcome (and all applications of agile practices as failed if the study was not successful overall).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Quantitative analysis</head><p>The quantitative analysis is two-fold in accordance with (S63).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1.">Full final set</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> shows the distribution of papers over the years 1999-2016. Compared to years 1999-2009 (S63), there is an increase in total paper count per year and thus also in total <ref type="bibr">(1999-2009: 82 publications, 2010-2016: 145 publications)</ref>, which indicates bigger interest in the subject of combining agile practices with GSD. There is also a trend evolving of around 20 publications on average per year, which started in 2008. We were looking for unique search results in the following order: ACM, IEEE, Compendex, Inspec, AIS and Scopus, i.e. if a study was found in ACM first and then IEEE as well later, it counted towards ACM.</p><p>4.1.1.1. Mapping of publication types. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the mapping of research types over the whole period of 1999-2016 including data from (S63). In years 1999-2001 there was no publication on agile practices in GSD. Compared to 1999-2009 (S63) we can see a maturing research field with a shift from experience reports, which was the most frequent publication type by far from 1999 to 2009 (42 publications), to evaluation studies in 2010-2016 (79 publications).</p><p>4.1.1.2. Distribution of research methods. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows that from 1999-2016 studies are almost exclusively qualitative (74%) with 88% in <ref type="bibr">1999-2009 and 52% in 2010-2016.</ref> In 2010-2016 we see mixed approaches in 22% of the studies <ref type="bibr">(as compared to 4% in 1999-2009)</ref> and quantitative ones in 13% of the studies (as compared to 2% in 1999-2009), so a decrease in the usage of purely qualitative methods in favor of more mixed and quantitative approaches.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> illustrates that case study research was the most frequently adopted research sub-method throughout 1999-2016 in 39% of all studies. In the later period of 2010-2016 there is a rise in literature reviews (to 15% as compared to 1% in 1999-2009), which can be explained by a maturing research field and the associated necessity to aggregate past findings, and there are also fewer studies with an unclear approach from 2010 to 2016, which also supports the observation of a maturing field. 4.1.1.3. Distribution of means of analysis. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows that descriptive means of analysis were the most widely used from 1999 to 2016 (71%).</p><p>Their usage was at 83% from 1999 to 2009 but has decreased to 52% in 2010-2016 in favor of other means which aligns with the observations regarding research methods in general (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) that qualitative approaches are lesser used in the later period.</p><p>4.1.1.4. Distribution of study contributions. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> illustrates that contributions in the form of lessons learned, although overall the most frequently seen contribution (51%), have decreased drastically from 70% in 1999-2009 to 20% in 2010-2016 in favor of more rigorous contributions such as case study analysis (26%) and frameworks/ models (17%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2.">89 successful empirical cases</head><p>In accordance with (S62; S63) we continue our analysis to focus on reported successful empirical cases (within our final set of 145 included studies). For years 2010-2016, we had 106 publications with an empirical background such as e.g. (multiple) case studies, surveys, interviews and experiments. Out of this set of 106 empirical publications, we were able to extract 93 cases (79 from single case studies and 14 more from multiple-case studies), of which only 4 reported overall failure and 89 successes. These 89 empirical cases with successful applications of agile practices in GSD are the basis of further analysis in this section.</p><p>4.1.2.1. Empirical characteristics. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> shows the empirical characteristics of each of the successful cases (with data for 1999-2009 (S62) being presented in parentheses). Most reported cases (62 from 1999 to 2016) focus on the SE process as a whole rather than on a specific part of the workflow which indicates that research on agile practices in GSD is still quite holistic rather than indepth. In 1999-2009 certain contextual details such as project size (18 cases), project duration (35 cases), application domain (34 cases) or even whether development was globally distributed (13 cases) where frequently not reported and that trend continues for 2010-2016 (cf. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>).</p><p>4.1.2.2. Agile methods in various distribution settings. Jalali and Wohlin (S62; S63) report having found weak empirical descriptions in their studies reporting the context to be "agile" and featuring "distributed teams" without further details in years 1999-2009. For 2010-2016, although most studies still lack some details of the empirical context,   we are able to present a much more fine-grained picture in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, which compares the agile method in use against the different distribution settings. Every part of the distribution setting (location, legal entity, geographical distance, temporal distance, team distribution and number of sites) sums up to the total number of 89 successful empirical cases, e.g. regarding the distribution setting location, 57 cases featured an offshore environment, 14 cases were onshore and for the remaining 18 cases it was unclear whether an offshore or onshore environment was in place. Jalali and Wohlin (S63) used the category agile for studies, which did not describe which agile method they used. We chose a different denomination to be more in line with the rest of the review: if it was not obvious which agile method was followed then the process was unclear rather than agile.</p><p>Jalali and Wohlin (S63) reported Extreme Programming (XP) as the top agile method found in GSD. In 2010-2016 the picture is quite different. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> does not show any studies following solely the XP method, yet we see many XP practices employed in GSD, as Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> shows. Although no case used XP exclusively, there are multiple cases that used a combination of XP &amp; Scrum. Kanban or lean software development was only applied in a small fraction of the cases in GSD as was FDD (Feature Driven Development) and DAD (Disciplined Agile Delivery).</p><p>In 2010-2016 we found the following agile methods employed in GSD: Scrum (53 cases), XP &amp; Scrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(14)</ref>, unclear agile method descriptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(12)</ref>, Kanban/lean <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(8)</ref>, FDD and DAD (1 each). The following distribution details were most frequently reported: offshore (57 cases), far distance (41), two-site environment (35), large time gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(30)</ref> and insourcing ( <ref type="formula">29</ref>), i.e. complex global cases. However, analyzed cases seldom reported all details to a full extent, thus limiting the generalizability of results of a study. The most often skipped contextual details were team distribution (48 cases), legal entity (38), geographic and temporal distance (32 each).</p><p>4.1.2.3. Supplier to customer relationships in agile GSD. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref> shows the supplier and customer countries involved in agile GSD. Countries represented as customers are either the clients (for outsourcing business relationships) or the main site/office with major responsibilities (for insourcing business relationships, i.e. the product/project owner). To achieve comparison to (S63), we too counted cases with multiple countries in a customer-supplier(s) relationship as 1/N where N is the number of suppliers. So if a case e.g. involved a customer in the US and two suppliers, one in US and one in India, then 0.5 (1 customer/2 suppliers = 0.5) will be added to the relationship US-US and US-India respectively.   Overall, from 1999 to 2016, either the customer (in 51% of all cases) or supplier (35%) or both (28%) remained in the dark. Among the reported supplier to customer relationships, India to US was the most commonly found. The most reported customer countries were US, Finland and UK and the most reported supplier countries India, Finland and US. It may seem surprising to find highly industrialized countries such as the US and Finland among the top three suppliers in the analyzed reported cases, but we found two explanations in our data collected. First, many cases feature an environment where the main site serves as both the customer (project owner) and the supplier, in collaboration with other remote suppliers. This fact increases relationships for industrialized countries on the supplier's end. Second, researchers from US and Finland have been especially active in the field and naturally report cases where their country is involved due to collaborations with local industry.</p><p>In our newer studied period of 2010-2016, the customer has been even less frequently reported and remained unclear in 65% of relationships -a huge increase in comparison to 1999-2009 studied by Jalali and Wohlin (S63) with undisclosed customers in 26% of all relationships. In comparison to (S63), the UK has become the third most reported customer (up from sixth most reported in 1999-2009), but US remained first and Finland the second most reported customer. Regarding suppliers, Finland has become the second most reported supplier country (up from 16th place in 1999-2009) and India remained on top. While information on customers remains scarce in 2010-2016, there is a greater variety of reported suppliers <ref type="bibr">(1999-2009: 20 different countries, 2010-2016</ref>: 42 different countries), indicating the coverage of a greater diversity of cases and relationships.</p><p>4.1.2.4. Frequencies of agile practices. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> shows the extraction of successfully applied agile practices that have been reported in at least five cases. As explained in the introduction, we defined practice according to the Oxford dictionary as "the customary, habitual, or expected procedure or way of doing of something",<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> in other words any element of an agile method (such as e.g. Scrum and XP) that describes a way of doing something will qualify as an agile practice by our definition. To further elaborate, roles such as product owner or scrum master are not practices because they do not define a way of doing something, whereas the standup meeting, as a defined way of conducting a daily meeting, or the backlog, as a defined way of working with requirements, qualifies as practices according to our definition. Jalali and Wohlin (S62; S63) did not provide a definition of their understanding of practice but as Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> shows the definition we chose seemed to fit well with their understanding. As stated in Section 3.6, since studies do not report success or failure on the level of individual practices, all agile practices within a study with a successful overall outcome were considered as successfully applied.</p><p>From 1999 to 2016, the "standup meeting" has been most frequently applied (70.5 cases), making it the core element of an agile GSD environment based on our analysis, followed by "backlog" (52 cases) and "sprint/iterations" (51.5 cases).</p><p>The isolated view at years 2010-2016 follows the exact same ranking. The years of 1999-2009 also featured "standup meeting" (18.5 cases) as the most frequently applied agile practice but then followed by "sprint/iterations" (13.5 cases) and "continuous integration" (12 cases) as the second and third most frequently applied practices, respectively. Compared to years 1999-2009, where six practices out of the top ten where Scrum-based, in 2010-2016 the Scrum practices are even more in the center of agile GSD implementations with eight of the top ten practices being affiliated with Scrum. XP practices seem to have been lesser used (or lesser reported), which may be explained by the fact that many studies in 2010-2016 use a mixed approach with Scrum as the agile method and additionally XP for development practices also in distributed development settings. This observation is also supported by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, which shows that combined "XP &amp; Scrum", is the second most frequently used agile method after Scrum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Qualitative analysis</head><p>We strive to answer the defined research questions based on our quantitative analysis (Section 4.1) and added qualitative analysis in this section. This analysis both addresses a holistic view of 1999-2016 (RQ1a, RQ2a) as a continuation to (S63) as well as a comparison of our newer studied period of 2010-2016 against former results of 1999-2009 (RQ1b, RQ2b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">RQ1a</head><p>. What is reported in peer-reviewed research literature about agile practices in GSD between 1999 and 2016?</p><p>This section explores the continuation aspect of this study, i.e. continuing trends covering the whole time span of 1999-2016. The newest comprehensive study is by Rashid and Khan (S108), who conduct an SLR and identify eight challenges in agile GSD, which they call risk factors. We thus found different approaches to tackle challenge categorization, which indicates that the field moves towards deeper and more comprehensive analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.2.">Success reports.</head><p>Although publishing challenges of agile GSD is a recurring theme, the vast majority of publications from 1999 to 2016 is solution-based and offers success stories. Good richly-described studies include the multi-case study (S58) with detailed descriptions of how the Scrum practices were used in four cases, and Zieris and Salinger (S145) describing the Scrum practices in use in a nearshoring case, as well as further experience reports such as (S75) and case studies such as (S76, S96, S99). These, among others, describe particularly well, how agile practices were put to good work in GSD environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.3.">Lack of contextual information.</head><p>We confirm the continuation of the trend reported by Jalali and Wohlin (S63) that contextual information is insufficiently reported (cf. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>). Furthermore, when contextual information was reported, it also often had to be carefully extracted from the full text rather than being stated at one point or a table, which makes it harder to comprehend. Extra care needs to be taken when trying to generalize from studies which do not provide detailed empirical characteristics.</p><p>We have updated the data extraction checklist (cf. Appendix A) of (S63) to follow the taxonomy of Šmite et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[25]</ref>. We have successfully used our updated checklist to drive the description of contextual information in our own multiple-case study (S139) and invite other researchers to use it as well to make sure to report a complete picture of empirical characteristics in case studies on agile GSD. 4.2.1.4. Increasing popularity. While Jalali and Wohlin (S63) were only able to report a growing interest in agile GSD, we can now confirm based on our explored studies, that agile GSD has continually become more popular over the years with 20 publications on average per year from 2008 to 2016 (cf. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>), allowing a great variety of empirical characteristics (cf. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>), distribution scenarios (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>), involved customer and supplier countries (cf. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>) and applied agile practices (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>). This finding is also supported by results from the survey by VersionOne <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[29]</ref>, which shows that the number of agile teams working in distributed environments has more than doubled from 35% in 2012 <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[28]</ref> to 82% in 2016 <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[29]</ref>.</p><p>4.2.1.5. Modified agile practices. Agile practices, which have been designed for collocated teams, need to be modified to work in distributed environments. Jalali and Wohlin (S63) have found this necessity in studies of 1999-2009, which continues for 2010-2016.</p><p>Hallikainen (S54) explores seating in an agile multisite environment including a permanent video connection window between the sites to facilitate agile practices. <ref type="bibr">Hossain et al. (S58)</ref> describe in detail, how the agile practices were modified, e.g. sprint planning with an additional pre-and post-planning in one case or daily scrums held separately by both teams in another. Vallon et al. (S138) describe the use of a joint sprint review and retrospective and a two-tiered planning process in a case study on a subcontractor relationship.</p><p>In 2010-2016 we have found the following different means being used to overcome distance in the analyzed studies: video/audio conference meetings (43 cases), instant messaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(18)</ref>, contact visits <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(17)</ref>, wikis <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(16)</ref>, chat <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(10)</ref> and screen sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(10)</ref>. It is likely that these and other means have been used even more, but not always been reported in detail. Jalali and Wohlin (S63) did not particularly report on these means other than that modifications are necessary for agile practices to work.</p><p>4.2.1.6. Dominance of Scrum, XP &amp; Scrum. As Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> illustrates, the most frequently used process in use is Scrum (e.g. (S58)), followed by Scrum combined with XP practices (e.g. S16). The XP practice "pair programming" received comparably big attention and has been featured in several studies (9 cases from 1999 to 2009) and several more from 2010 to 2016 (e.g. (S32; S116; S141)) with an SLR focusing exclusively on distributed pair programming (S33). Kanban and lean Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). We found experience reports in very different quality, some providing a very good picture of how the agile practices were implemented (e.g. (S75; S86; S105)), others were mostly anecdotal lacking synthesis. The problem remains, as was also pointed out by <ref type="bibr">Jalali and Wohlin (S63)</ref>, that the experience reports usually do not cover related work and thus lack generalizability and suffer from repetitions. However, since fewer experience reports were published, the problem is less significant for 2010-2016 than it was for 1999-2009.</p><p>4.2.1.8. Case studies over models/frameworks. There were many case studies (e.g. (S58; S96)) published from 1999 to 2016 (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) and several literature reviews covering different aspects in the newer period of 2010-2016, e.g. on distributed pair programming (S33) or on task allocation techniques (S47) but not many frameworks. As of 2010-2016 we still see mostly case study analysis and lessons learned rather than the development of frameworks (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). One exception to that trend is (S139), where the authors have developed a framework called ADAPT based on a multiple-case study featuring 10 guidelines and 29 practices in its current installment. The ADAPT framework helps practitioners with tailoring their agile GSD process implementation in an iterative way. However, as our SLR shows that the trend continues in 2010-2016 that most of the case studies continue to fail at fully reporting their empirical context (cf. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>), it remains infeasible to develop a framework on top of past research (instead of on top of authors' own case studies) due the limited generalizability of results.</p><p>4.2.1.9. Lack of details on success and failure. We found 89 cases reporting success and only 4 failure in 2010-2016. Jalali and Wohlin (S63) also stated that the number of failure cases was small in 1999-2009. We do see more research focusing on challenges and risks (e.g. ( <ref type="formula">S120</ref>)) in general in agile GSD, but in case study research failure is often not reported although it would be interesting to see more failure cases published for further analysis.</p><p>During data extraction of this SLR we had to deduct from full text whether the reported case was a success as there were frequently no criteria available to indicate whether the study was a success and we had to trust the authors for a genuine report. We suggest defining upfront criteria for success in future case studies on agile GSD to improve documentation of success or failure, ideally on the level of individual practices.</p></div>

Years 2010-2016 deliver new evidence of successful large-scale applications in GSD, as Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> shows. 22 cases were reported with large project sizes, considerably more than 6 cases from 1999 to 2009. Examples for large-scale agile GSD adoptions include studies such as e.g. (S87; S99), or also <ref type="bibr">Tripathi et al. (S134)</ref> analyzing a Kanban large-scale multi-site case. Hence agile practices have been effectively used in large-scale environments, although researchers note that all large-scale transformations are not without its challenges and drawbacks, where agile ones are no different (S92). 4.2.2.2. Teaching activity. Jalali and Wohlin (S63) did not report on teaching activity in 1999-2009, but we found a lot of teaching activity in 2010-2016. Published teaching efforts include course results and lessons learned to provide better ways of teaching the usage of agile practices in GSD, which also supports the finding that this is a maturing research field and knowledge worth teaching to future generations. Notable examples include (S115) with student teams distributed across the US, Cambodia, India and Senegal developing mobile apps with a focus on auditing. <ref type="bibr">Klein et al. (S69)</ref> propose a "Collaborative Pattern Approach" to derive an agile distributed development process from an existing collocated one, assessed in a students' project between Leibniz University of Hanover and TU Clausthal. <ref type="bibr">Paasivaara et al. (S93)</ref> report on a course with Finnish and Canadian students featuring both samesite and cross-site teams and a switch halfway through the course, so that students can experience challenges and benefits of both respective approaches.</p><p>4.2.2.3. GSD taxonomy. Jalali and Wohlin (S63) stated that the taxonomy in use was very diverse in their analyzed studies and that researchers and practitioners should agree on a common terminology. From 1999 to 2009 Jalali and Wohlin (S63) reported that many cases just reported to be "agile" or "offshore" or that "distributed teams" were in use without further contextual details. Although empirical context is still not fully described in 2010-2016, we can see a huge improvement over 1999-2009, which allows us to look further into distribution scenarios and agile methods, as Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> illustrates. Additionally, a common taxonomy on GSD has been published <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[25]</ref>, which we suggest to be used by researchers in the future to allow better comparability and generalizability of results. We incorporated the taxonomy into our data extraction checklist (cf. Appendix A). 4.2.2.4. XP practices. Jalali and Wohlin (S63) reported that 19.5 cases in 1999-2009 featured XP as the main process and thus more than Scrum at the time with 17.5 cases. As Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> shows, we have found a drastically different picture from 2010 to 2016 where not a single case used XP as its agile method in GSD. However, we found 14 cases that used Scrum as their agile method but enhanced by XP development practices, so XP is still being used but it is not in the center of agile GSD implementations any longer. 4.2.2.5. Agile GSD in traditional environments. In contrast to 1999-2009, where this particular topic was not reported as frequent by <ref type="bibr">Jalali and Wohlin (S63)</ref>, from 2010 to 2016 we found a significant number of studies dealing with how to use agile practices in traditional GSD environments. <ref type="bibr">Batra et al. (S19)</ref> explore the balancing of agile and structured, i.e. "traditional", approaches within the same project and conclude that not only can both complement each other in GSD environments but also that agile methods improved discipline in the studied case. Del Nuevo et al. (S34) present the integration of Scrum with traditional RUP (Rational Unified Process) in distributed environments, which they call "scRumUP". Femmer et al. (S45) investigate the implementation of an artifact model for distributed agile project management. Based on their experiences the authors conclude that agile project management may be not that different from traditional one in GSD environments, which remains subject to further study. The newest study analyzing agile GSD in a traditional plandriven organization is by <ref type="bibr">Richter et al. (S111)</ref>, who identify several problems and conclude that there is no one-size-fits-all solution.  <ref type="bibr">4.2.2.7. Tool support. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr">4.2.2.7. Tool support. -2009</ref> mostly featured experience reports and lessons learned, but in 2010-2016 with a maturing research field and improved empirical evidence we can also see an increasing effort put into facilitating the implementation of agile practices with tool support in different ways. <ref type="bibr">Sohan et al. (S124)</ref> present a tool for autotagging emails with a 70% hit rate for inquiries on user stories to improve knowledge sharing and synthesis in distributed environments. <ref type="bibr">Lehtinen et al. (S77)</ref> present a tool for root cause analysis to be used in distributed retrospectives for agile GSD, which received promising results in their conducted field study. <ref type="bibr">Urrego et al. (S136)</ref> developed Archinotes, a tool for collaborative global agile architecture design, which promotes incremental design as part of sprint iterations. Tsompanoudi et al. (S135) provide insights into scripted distributed pair programming sessions supported by a redesigned Eclipse IDE plugin keeping track of users' activities. Newest studies in this regard include (S118) with Agile Workbench, a digitalized project governance tool, and (S42) with Scrumpy, an open source tool designed to support distributed Scrum implementations. 4.2.2.8. Focus on the whole SE process. In contrast to 1999-2009 where the different knowledge areas are rather equally distributed, the vast majority of cases from 2010 to 2016 focus on the SE process as a whole (cf. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>). Exceptions to that trend are several noteworthy studies covering specific aspects in agile GSD, including requirements engineering (e.g. (S20; S59)), planning (e.g. (S56)), effort estimation (e.g. (S24; S25)), architecture (e.g. (S23; S81; S136)), design (e.g. (S74)) and distributed testing (e.g. (S28; S29; S71; S79; S85)). The increased research effort on communication and information sharing techniques is necessary for an improved adoption of agile practices which demand frequent communication and interaction also in GSD environments and indicates a deeper interest in the underlying mechanics of agile GSD than in years 1999-2009.</p><p>4.2.2.10. Extension of agile practices. The extension of agile practices was not reported to be a major concern by Jalali and Wohlin (S63) in 1999-2009. In the newer studied period of 2010-2016, we do not only see modified agile practices (cf. Section 4.2.1.5) but also new ones added to the agile GSD implementations. Zieris and Salinger (S145) added the practice code buddy, an on-site proxy from the other site, and a sync meeting for the code buddy proxy to stay in touch with his distant team members. Vallon et al. (S137) employed distributed micro teams across two development sites, as small as 2-3 people per micro team, which can be easily assembled and broken up again between sprint iterations. <ref type="bibr">Moe et al. (S87)</ref> added the role of a technical area responsible (TAR), the teams' contact person for technical discussions in order to avoid interrupts for fellow developers, working about 50% in the team and 50% as the TAR. Daneva et al. (S31) introduce the concept of a delivery story instead of a user story, which includes functional requirements, design specifications and optional security requirements, and argue it to be better suited to complex distributed environments than user stories. Schmidt and Meures (S117) analyze how agile GSD can be extended by known communication practices which are categorized as frequent visits, multiple communication modes, mirroring, ambassador and synchronization of work hours. 4.2.2.11. Research types. As Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> illustrates, in our later studied period of 2010-2016, there was a significant shift from experience papers, the most published research type in 1999-2009, to evaluation studies indicating a maturing research area and also increasing researchers' attention as experience reports are also often written by industrial practitioners. Although in 2010-2016 we still see mostly qualitative approaches in 52% of the studies (down from 88% in 1999-2009), there are also 22% of mixed approaches (up from 4% in 1999-2009) and 13% of quantitative ones (up from 2% in 1999-2009, cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). As Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows, we identified a significant rise of the studies being literature reviews <ref type="bibr">(to 15% in 2010-2016, up from 1% in 1999-2009)</ref> due to the increased number of overall studies in the field that need aggregation and synthesis. The change in trends continues with Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, where we see less descriptive means of analysis with 52% in <ref type="bibr">2010-2016 (down from 83% in 1999-2009)</ref>, but more comparisons, grounded theory approaches, as well as statistical means and measurements. 4.2.2.12. Contributions. As Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> shows, we see fewer lessons learned in 2010-2016 (e.g. in (S28; S75)), only in 20% of studies as the main contribution <ref type="bibr">(down from 70% in 1999-2009)</ref>. We found more case study analysis with 26% (e.g. (S58; S137)) and the development of frameworks or models in 17% of the studies in 2010-2016, which include the following. Shrivastava and Rathod (S120) present a risk framework of 45 risk factors under five core risk categories in agile distributed development.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref> shows, India to US was the most frequently reported supplier to customer relationship from 1999 to 2016, followed by US to US, and Finland to Finland, where US and Finland were mostly serving as co-suppliers in cooperation with lower cost countries. The top reported customers were the US, Finland and UK, but overall customers' countries remained frequently unreported (in 51% of cases). <ref type="bibr">4.2.3.3.</ref> Efficient agile methods, practices and distribution type combinations. The following combinations have been reported by <ref type="bibr">Jalali and Wohlin (S63)</ref> as the top ones from 1999 to 2009: "XP-Distributed team" (9 cases), "Agile-Offshore" (7.5 cases) and "Scrum-Distributed team" (7 cases). For years 2010-2016 we could not observe these combinations because on the one hand, there was no case in 2010-2016 which reported XP as the main agile method (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> and also <ref type="bibr">Section 4.2.2.4)</ref>, and on the other hand, we did not find studies which just reported to be "agile". So we refer to <ref type="bibr">Section 4.2.4.3</ref>   <ref type="bibr">1999</ref><ref type="bibr">-2009 (cf. Table 4) (cf. Table 4)</ref>, there is a much greater variety reported in the later period with 42 different supplier countries as compared to 20 in 1999-2009 and 13 different customer countries as compared to 11 before. <ref type="bibr">4.2.4.3.</ref> Efficient agile methods, practices and distribution type combinations. Jalali and Wohlin (S63) were frequently confronted with vague descriptions in their analyzed cases such as "agile" for method and "distributed teams" for distribution scenario. For 2010-2016, although not all of the following details of distribution scenarios have been consistently reported, we can provide a much more fine-grained overview of the relations between agile methods, distribution types, the most used practices and involved countries. The following analysis is based on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>.</p><p>Location (offshore/onshore): The combination used most frequently regarding location is "Offshore-Scrum". This scenario was reported in 34 cases and the top practices applied in this specific scenario were "standup meeting" (in 19 cases), "backlog" (in 18 cases), "sprint/ iterations", "sprint planning" and "retrospective" (tied for third place with 15 cases each). Most projects were owned by the US as the customer and the top supplier country in this scenario was India.</p><p>Legal entity (outsourcing/insourcing):</p><p>The combination "Insourcing-Scrum" has been most frequently reported with 20 cases in total. The following practices were applied the most: "standup meeting" (10 cases), "sprint/iterations" (8 cases), "backlog" and "sprint planning" (in 7 cases each). The top customer is shared among Austria, Netherlands, Sweden and USA. The top supplier was India.</p><p>Geographical distance (far, near): The combination "Far-Scrum" was practiced successfully the most (28 cases) with the most frequent implementation of Scrum practices "backlog", "standup meeting" (in 17 cases each) and "sprint/iterations" (in 15 cases). Most projects were owned by the US and supplied by India.</p><p>Temporal distance (large, small): The combination "Large-Scrum" was found in 20 successful cases. The most applied agile practices in this scenario were "backlog", "standup meeting" (in 10 cases each) and "sprint/iterations" (in 9 cases). Again, the US prevailed as the top customer and India as the top supplier. For the combination "Small-Scrum", which we found equally often to "Large-Scrum" (also in 20 cases), "standup meeting" (in 13 cases), "backlog" (in 12 cases), "sprint/iterations" and "sprint planning" (in 11 cases each) were practiced the most. Most projects in this scenario were both owned and supplied by Finland, indicating several projects where Finland collaborated with other sites to co-develop.</p><p>Team distribution type (integrated, isolated): The combination "Integrated Teams-Scrum" was seen the most (in 19 cases), i.e. team members spread across sites and working collaboratively. In this scenario "standup meeting" (in 14 cases), "backlog" (in 13 cases) and "sprint/iterations" (in 11 cases) were practiced the most. The top supplier was India and Finland served most often as the project owner/ customer.</p><p>Number of sites <ref type="bibr">(2, 3, 4 and more)</ref>: The combination of "Two Sites-Scrum" was practiced successfully the most (20 cases). Most frequently applied practices in this scenario include "backlog" (in 14 cases), "standup meeting" (in 13 cases), "sprint planning", "retrospective" and "sprint review/demo" (in 12 cases each). Tied for top supplier in this scenario were India and Finland and the top customer was Finland, again indicating (as in the temporal distance scenario "Small-Scrum") that Finland was both project owner and co-supplier in several cases of the "Two Sites-Scrum" distribution scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>This section provides concise conclusions based on the presented analysis.</p><p>#1: The most successful distribution scenario in agile GSD is "Offshore-Scrum".</p><p>We have found a great variety of distribution scenarios in years 2010-2016 and were able to provide deeper insight compared to (S63), where authors often just reported to use "agile" and "distributed teams" without further explanation. In 1999-2009 "XP-Distributed team" was the most popular scenario with 9 cases, but in 2010-2016 we uncovered a predominance of Scrum as the agile method of choice across all distribution scenarios: 1. Offshore-Scrum (location): 34 cases 2. Far-Scrum (geographical distance): 28 cases 3. Insourcing-Scrum (legal entity): 20 cases 4. Two Sites-Scrum (number of sites): 20 cases 5. Large-Scrum and Small-Scrum (temporal distance): 20 cases each 6. Integrated Teams-Scrum (team distribution type): 19 cases #2 The most successfully used agile practices in GSD across all distribution scenarios are "standup meeting", "backlog" and "sprint/iterations".</p><p>Scrum was the most successful agile method in GSD from 1999 to 2016 and thus its central practices have been found employed very frequently (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> Hence eight of the top ten agile practices used in GSD from 1999 to 2016 are core Scrum practices complemented by two XP practices ("continuous integration" as the 8th most frequent and "pair programming" as the 10th most frequent practice), even though XP was the predominant agile method from 1999 to 2009.</p><p>#3 Agile GSD is a maturing research field.</p><p>The following chain of evidence supports that claim. There is an average of 20 publications per year in the field since 2008 (cf. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>).</p><p>There is a shift from experience reports, which were predominant up to 2009, to evaluation studies in 2010-2016 (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). This change is associated with the application of a greater variety of research methods next to qualitative case study research (cf. Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) and means of analysis (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>) and more mature results in the form of case study analysis and frameworks/models in place of former lessons learned (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Future directions of agile GSD</head><p>We continue our conclusions with possible future directions and research potential to improve the state of the art in the field of agile GSD.</p><p>#4 There is a need to report rich and complete empirical context in future studies.</p><p>Although we see a maturing field, empirical characteristics and contextual information on the cases and their distribution scenarios were consistently underreported. The following kinds of contextual information were still frequently missing in 2010-2016 (cf. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>): Project duration (38%), application domain (31%) and project size (22%). Furthermore information on the distributed environment often lacked the following (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>): Team distribution type (54%), legal entity (43%), geographical distance (36%), temporal distance (36%), number of sites (29%) and location (20%). The involved countries (cf. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>) were also consistently underreported in 1999-2016: Unreported customer country (51%), unreported supplier countries (35%), both unreported (28%).</p><p>Therefore we invite researchers to report contextual information based on our checklist in Appendix A, which is an update to the one used in (S63) to incorporate the GSD taxonomy of <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[25]</ref>.</p><p>#5 There is a need for more research covering specific knowledge areas instead of the whole SE process.</p><p>As Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> shows, 64% of reported successful cases in 2010-2016 focused on the SE process as a whole. The issue with many of these cases was that they contain a holistic analysis of the SE process and thus agile practices and their necessary adaptations in GSD were not described in sufficient detail to allow generalization. Studies on specific knowledge areas of the SE process, such as e.g. requirements engineering, testing, design and maintenance may also produce more detailed descriptions of the agile practices in use within that particular area.</p><p>#6 There is an opportunity to investigate more core agile development practices in GSD.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> we identified that most of the agile practices in our cases studied are non-technical agile practices, mainly Scrum-based. We see a research opportunity to also investigate more agile coding-based practices such as e.g. test driven development (TDD), strategies for collective code ownership and exploring the role of DevOps in GSD.</p><p>#7 There is an opportunity to report more failure cases on applying agile practices in GSD.</p><p>In 2010-2016 out of 93 empirical cases, only 4 explicitly reported failure. Applying agile practices in GSD is not an easy task as the challenge and risk frameworks show (cf. Section 4.2.1.1), but failure cases do not get reported or published. However, to increase knowledge on the application of agile practices in GSD it would be important to analyze and understand under what circumstances cases have failed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Limitations</head><p>Since this review builds on top of Jalali and Wohlin's results (S62; S63) and we used their research design in order to allow for a continuation and comparison, all of their limitations are also a potential threat to this study and may affect our findings. Since we cannot change the research design because of the nature of our study (continuation and comparison), we add the following concerns regarding research design to this study's limitations. The search string "pair programming" is not an agile method but a single XP practice and as such should not be part of the search string for this SLR. Jalali and Wohlin (S62; S63) did not present their quality assessment criteria in detail so we do not know how this step was conducted but we defined our own criteria (cf. Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) to make up for that shortcoming.</p><p>We did not (and could not) conduct a full evaluation of former results of (S62; S63), but carried out sanity checks when aggregating their results with ours, and found their results and arguments to be coherent and their choices in conducting the review well-documented, which allowed replicating their systematic procedure for this study. Although we present in great detail how we conducted the review for years 2010-2016 and are positive that we achieved a faithful replication of the procedure used in (S62; S63), there is a chance that we slightly misinterpreted their reported procedure.</p><p>Reliability is a major concern in any SLR study, which is why we chose to involve four researchers from different universities in this review, which allows the consideration of different research experiences and minimizes individual researcher's bias. Threats to study design and procedure have been discussed early in the study before the beginning of the actual searches. We also conducted pilot searches to ensure that the developed review protocol is functional. The first and second author also discussed corner cases, where the relevance of studies for this SLR was not immediately apparent during the inclusion process and found a mutual agreement to arrive at a final decision for the inclusion of such studies.</p><p>Another limitation of this study is that we cannot judge if an agile practice has been implemented successfully as most authors did not report on individual practices in sufficient detail. We had to assume that a practice was applied successfully if the whole case had a successful outcome.</p><p>We had to exclude 19 studies because full text was not available to the authors at the time of the search, which is a limitation of this study. However, given the amount of studies included (145) and the amount of studies not available to us <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(19)</ref>, we are confident that these studies would not have changed the trends as most likely only a fraction of these 19 studies would have been included after full-text analysis (as was the case with studies that were available).</p><p>To achieve construct and conclusion validity, each step along the way has been documented and presented thoroughly and extensively. The paper draft has been mainly driven by the first author, but all decisions have been discussed with the other authors including several iterations of thorough review and suggested improvements by all authors for construct and conclusion validity.</p><p>Even when following a systematic procedure, we cannot claim that the exact same set of studies would have been included by other researchers as individual decisions may differ and may result in a slightly different set, but we are confident that the trends, needs and opportunities we identified in this study would be the same if our systematic procedure was replicated by other researchers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>We built our systematic review on top of a study conducted by Jalali and Wohlin (S63) and reviewed the usage of agile practices in GSD from 1999 to 2016, analyzing both the 1999-2016 period as a whole (RQ1a, RQ2a) as well as comparing Jalali and Wohlin's (S63) studied period of 1999-2009 against our newly studied period of <ref type="bibr">2010</ref><ref type="bibr">-2016 (RQ1b, RQ2b)</ref>.</p><p>The research contribution of this study lies in reporting the state of the art of agile practices in GSD for 1999-2016, where we almost exclusively found success stories. The field sees a steady research output of about 20 publications on average per year since 2008, most of which are higher quality contributions compared to 1999-2009, which attributes to a maturing research field. We also saw several modifications and extensions of agile practice in use to deal with the challenges of GSD. There is a predominance of Scrum, often in combination with XP practices. In our later studied period of 2010-2016 studies focused on how to scale up, publish teaching efforts, transform from traditional environments, facilitations with newly developed tools and advances on how to best share information.</p><p>We also took a very close look at the successful empirical cases. Our review shows that from 1999 to 2016 cases were almost exclusively globally distributed with India to US being to most frequently reported supplier to customer relation, feature long project durations and varying project sizes. In our newer studied period of 2010-2016 most cases featured the following attributes: offshore, insourced, equally often with large and small temporal distance, and integrated teams, i.e. teams that collaborate together across sites rather than isolated on a single site, and two development sites. We uncovered that eight out of the top agile practices were Scrum-based with "standup meeting", "backlog" and "sprint/iterations" being the three most frequently applied across all distribution scenarios.</p><p>Another contribution lies in the development of an improved data extraction checklist (cf. Appendix A) which incorporates the GSD taxonomy of <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[25]</ref>. We invite other researchers to use it as reference when describing empirical contextual details in their study on agile GSD to ensure that all details are reported and thus strengthen the generalizability of their results.</p><p>Following our analysis we identified serious needs and opportunities to be addressed to further mature the field of agile GSD. If our conclusion #4 (need for reporting complete empirical context), #5 (need for covering specific knowledge areas of agile GSD), #6 (opportunity to investigate more core agile development practices) and #7 (opportunity to report more failure cases) were to be addressed in the future, the creation of a universal database would be an interesting research endeavor, which could not only list challenges and solutions for agile GSD (as suggested by (S63)), but contain agile practices and their fully described empirical application scenario based on our checklist in Appendix A. Reporting empirical context based on our checklist would severely increase the generalizability of results on successfully reported agile practices and a possible future universal agile GSD database could become a turn-to resource for both researchers and practitioners. The information provided in such database could in a further step be used to develop a framework on how to tailor agile practices to GSD environments, or more specifically to different distribution scenarios within GSD, which is currently not feasible due to the lack of contextual information reported. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

Combining agile practices with GSD does not come without its challenges. This was reported byJalali and  Wohlin (S63)  and is continued to a bigger extent in the newer period of 2010-2016. We found three literature reviews dealing with challenges in agile GSD (S65; S66; S120).Kajko-Mattsson et al. (S66) developed classes of problems in agile GSD, such as culture, time zone, communication, trust, customer collaboration, training and technical. Kamaruddin et al. (S65) found 13 problems in their review of case studies into agile GSD. Shrivastava and Rathod (S120) found multiple risk factors in the following categories: software development life cycle, project management, group awareness, technology setup and external stakeholder, based on their field experience and literature review. Pries-Heje and Pries-Heje (S104) and Modi et al. (S83) investigate the CCC challenges ((S104): coordination, communication and control; (S83): coordination, communication and cooperation) in their analyzed cases.</figDesc></figure>

Jalali and Wohlin (S63) did not particularly report on transition or transformation studies in 1999-2009. In 2010-2016, on the contrary, we found multiple studies covering a transition to agile GSD environments. Lavazza et al. (S73) present that switching to distributed Scrum development was successful in an open source software development process. Noordeloos et al. (S91) study a case on the successful transition from RUP to Scrum in a GSD environment. Vallon et al. (S137) report on the successful transition from a single-site R&amp;D development to a two-site Scrumbased product development. Paasivaara and Lassenius (S98) describe the transition from a waterfall model to a lean and agile process facilitated by the use of communities of practice. The newest transformation study is by Paasivaara and Lassenius (S99), who describe the scaling of two collocated Scrum teams to 20 teams in four countries.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_10"><head>4. 2 . 2 . 9 .</head><label>229</label><figDesc>Communication and information sharing. Jalali and Wohlin (S63) did not particularly report on communication and information sharing as a main point of interest in 1999-2009. In 2010-2016 we can see several studies investigate communication in agile GSD. Green et al. (S50) analyze the role of synchronous and asynchronous communication concluding that distributed teams in complex global scenarios tend to use more asynchronous forms of communication whereas teams that communicate daily use asynchronous and synchronous communication techniques equally often. Korkala et al. (S70) explore communication with the customer in agile GSD. Persson et al. (S102) investigate the formal and informal elements of communication in a successful case with regard to control. Razzak and Ahmed (S110) investigate knowledge sharing strategies (Systems, Cartographic, Engineering, Organizational and Spatial) on a variety of projects and conclude that locally and globally distributed projects require different strategies. One of the most recent studies on the subject is by Bass (S18), who identified 25 artifacts which are essential to information sharing in agile GSD.</figDesc></figure>
