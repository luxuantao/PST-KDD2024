<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">V2X communication applications</head><p>One aim of scientific and industrial automotive research is the development of applications that enhance safety and traffic efficiency. Vehicular communication based on wireless short-ranged networks (V2X communication) provides the foundation for these applications (V2X applications). For such applications, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> define several scenarios and use cases.</p><p>Safety applications are characterised by vehicular communication used to mitigate the occurrence of dangerous situations and accidents. During driving, V2X applications, installed in a vehicle, monitor the vehicle's state and the activities of the driver. After a relevance check, relevant pieces of information are transmitted to vehicles in the neighbourhood, e.g. information about position and speed of a vehicle or about dangerous locations on the roadway are exchanged. The received information is used by the V2X applications in the vehicle to either inform the vehicle driver or automatically optimize the safety systems for the best possible reaction to a dangerous situation.</p><p>Traffic efficiency applications improve the efficiency of the transportation network by exchanging traffic-related information among vehicles and traffic infrastructure units. The received information is analysed by the V2X applications in the vehicle and used, for example, to inform the driver about delays to be expected and to optimize the vehicle's speed and route depending on the traffic conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Impact assessment of the V2X technology by field operational tests and simulations</head><p>Field operational tests (FOTs) are large-scale real world testing programmes aiming at a comprehensive assessment of the efficiency, quality, robustness, and acceptance of technologies used for smarter, safer, cleaner, and more comfortable transport solutions. Previous experience has shown that field trials are an excellent way to raise awareness, collect real data, and enhance the take-up of new solutions. The European approach to field operational testing has been developed in the FESTA project <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The project has produced a comprehensive manual which guides you through all the steps you need to take when implementing a field operational test. For the System and Function Analysis and the Socio-Economic Impact Assessment, the FESTA manual recommends simulations to generalize the results of the field trials. Simulations can incorporate indirect effects, such as congestion in the network at peak times. Since microscopic traffic simulation models consider individual vehicles in the traffic stream, the impacts on the traffic system level can be estimated by simulations including varying levels of the system penetration within the vehicle population. Consequently, simulations represent an essential part of the FOT chain and need to be carried out during a field operational test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">V2X simulation requirements</head><p>Currently, different kinds of simulators are necessary for the simulation of vehicular communication. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>, a realistic simulation of V2X communication scenarios needs to consider various aspects of simulation, i.e. the vehicular traffic, the V2X communication network, and the application, at least. Vehicular traffic includes the physical movements of vehicles on an arbitrary road network. The simulation of the V2X communication network handles the wireless message transmission among vehicles, and between a vehicle and the fixed infrastructure. Application simulation means the integration of applications that are to be implemented in real world vehicles. For this purpose, inner vehicle interfaces have to be emulated to allow the application to interact with other components of the vehicle. A further, but optional, aspect is the event simulation which is responsible for simulating temporary effects, like bad weather conditions and road works.</p><p>One key requirement is the interaction at runtime of the simulation between communication, traffic, and application simulator, because modifications of traffic parameters, like movements of vehicles and characteristics of roads, need to be made at runtime. So, for example, when an obstacle warning application of a vehicle detects a dangerous situation, this vehicle sends a warning message to the vehicles in its neighbourhood using the communication simulator. As a result, the receivers of this warning could, then, change their routes, which is triggered by the application simulator and has to be fed into the traffic simulator.</p><p>Several existing simulator couplings are adapted to specific simulators and cannot be exchanged <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Since requirements for each simulator coupling vary depending on the simulated scenarios, we have developed the V2X simulation runtime infrastructure (VSimRTI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Our simulation infrastructure allows the integration of discrete event-based simulators, e.g. for communication network, vehicular traffic, and V2X application simulation. We couple simulators and provide the flexibility to exchange them depending on the specific requirements of a simulation scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">Our concept</head><p>The VSimRTI system architecture is inspired by the IEEE Standard for Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) High Level Architecture (HLA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. However, the complexity of the HLA standard and its implementation would have exceeded the scope of our V2X simulation framework. In-stead, a subset of the standard and some of its fundamental concepts were used to realize VSimRTI. So, a framework for simulator integration was created that facilitates the simulation of V2X communication scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. VSimRTI offers services to handle synchronization, communication as well as lifecycle management of the coupled simulators. Communication among the simulators is enabled by the VSimRTI which is accessible by ambassadors similar to the HLA standard. The types of data to be exchanged are defined as an extensible set of messages instead of using the general object model template (OMT) of HLA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5.">Structure of this paper</head><p>Section 2 describes the different approaches that exist for V2X simulation architectures. A brief overview about existing V2X simulator couplings and the High Level Architecture is given in Section 3. In Section 4, our simulation architecture VSimRTI and its concepts are introduced in greater detail. Furthermore, the principles of simulator synchronization are explained. An excerpt of simulation results that VSimRTI has identified thus far are presented in Section 5. Finally, we conclude our paper in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">V2X Simulation architecture approaches</head><p>In general, existing V2X simulation architectures can be divided into three different areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>: An integrated simulator covering all V2X domains, a fixed coupling of different simulators, and a flexible simulator coupling realised by a simulation runtime infrastructure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Integrated simulator covering traffic, communication, and applications domains</head><p>An integrated simulator covers the three domains important for V2X simulations, i.e. vehicular traffic, communication, and application simulations. Only one clock for the time management exists and no further synchronization is necessary. Here, the integration of different simulation domains is a major challenge for the simulator developers. In the history of computer simulations, vehicular traffic and wireless communication have been divergent domains without intersections. In general, an expert in developing traffic simulators does not necessarily have detailed knowledge about the simulation of wireless communication and vice versa. Thus, the development of such a tool with a high accuracy in traffic, communication, and application simulation has proven to be difficult. As a result, existing integrated simulators are rather suited for high-level simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Fixed coupling of different simulators for the different domains</head><p>Fixed simulator couplings are couplings of independent simulators where each simulator is specified for one of the domains, i.e. vehicular traffic, communication, or application simulation. Each simulator has its own clock for its time management. Thus, additional synchronization mechanisms have to be implemented in the coupling mechanism to ensure that all events of the coupled simulators are processed in the correct order. The coupling component is adapted to the used simulators, and integrated simulation tools cannot be exchanged. A disadvantage of the fixed coupling is that a re-implementation is not only necessary if a simulator is to be exchanged, but also the integration of new versions of one of the coupled simulators mostly requires adjustments. So, a fixed simulator coupling is sufficient as long as all simulation requirements are fulfilled by the existing coupling and no simulator has to be exchanged or replaced by a newer version.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Simulation runtime infrastructure (RTI) with common interfaces for flexible simulator coupling</head><p>The approach of a simulation runtime infrastructure (RTI) allows the integration of arbitrary discrete eventbased simulators. The coupling is realised via common interfaces which facilitate the integration of further simulation tools and the exchange of already coupled simulators. Attaching a simulator merely requires the implementation of the interfaces of the simulation runtime infrastructure and the realization of the commands specified within. The internals of the underlying implementation are hidden. A central management is provided by the simulation runtime infrastructure and offers services to handle synchronization, interactions among the coupled simulators as well as lifecycle management of each component. Thus, in contrast to the fixed coupling, a modification of simulators does not involve complex tasks, such as a customisation of the simulator synchronization or the interaction management. Hence, the effort for the realisation of a new simulator coupling is less than that in fixed couplings. Whereas most fixed simulator couplings only connect two simulators (generally a traffic simulator with a communication simulator), simulation runtime infrastructures do not limit the number of coupled simulation tools. This is an advantage for a detailed simulation of V2X applications because a separate application simulator is essential in this case.</p><p>The IEEE Standard for Modeling and Simulation (M&amp; S) High Level Architecture (HLA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> provides various concepts for the realisation of a simulation runtime infrastructure. For V2X simulations, a subset of the HLA standard would be sufficient.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">V2X simulator couplings</head><p>A number of projects have already combined different kinds of simulators for the simulation of V2X communication scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. An Open Source implementation that integrates the traffic simulator SUMO <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and the communication simulator ns-2 is TraNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. It enables the direct interaction of both simulators. A further project is the Multiple Simulator Interlinking Environment for C2CC in VA-NETs (MSIECV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> that integrates the communication simulator ns-2, the traffic simulator VISSIM <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and Matlab/Simulink for application level simulation. In both projects, it is possible to influence the vehicle behaviour, e.g. to stop or reroute vehicles.</p><p>The project iTETRIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> has integrated wireless communication and road traffic simulation into an environment that is tailored to specific situations allowing performance analysis of cooperative ITS at the city level. iTETRIS has coupled two open source simulation platforms. SUMO is used for microscopic traffic simulation. For wireless communication simulation, iTETRIS decided to adopt the ns-3 platform<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> .</p><p>Sommer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> developed the hybrid simulation framework Veins (Vehicles in Network Simulation), composed of the network simulator OMNeT++ <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and the road traffic simulator SUMO. To perform IVC evaluations, both simulators are running in parallel, connected via a TCP socket. The protocol for this communication has been standardized as the Traffic Control Interface (TraCI). This allows a bidirectionally coupled simulation of road traffic and network traffic. Movement of vehicles in the road traffic simulator SUMO is reflected in the movement of nodes in an OMNeT++/INET simulation. Thus, nodes can interact with the running road traffic simulation, e.g. to simulate the influence of V2X on road traffic.</p><p>Whereas the projects, described above, follow the second approach explained in Section 2.2, the VANET Simulation Environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> realizes the approach of Section 2.1. This tool is an integrated simulation environment on top of the communication simulator JiST/SWANS <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The original random way point model in SWANS is replaced by a more accurate traffic model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">IEEE Standard for Modeling and Simulation (M&amp; S) High Level Architecture (HLA)</head><p>A standardized approach to combine simulators with each other is the IEEE Standard for Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) High Level Architecture (HLA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. It consists of rules, a runtime infrastructure, interface descriptions, and an object model template. In this standard, the coupling of different simulators is a federation that satisfies the defined rules. These rules consist of requirements for participating simulators and for the overall federation which regulate the object management and the interaction among simulators. The central component of each federation is a runtime infrastructure (RTI). It connects all participating simulators that are encapsulated by federates and it controls the simulation run. The RTI and each federate implement ambassadors to handle the communication between them. The runtime infrastructure provides a set of services available to the federates. The services manage the coordination of federation-wide activities; the synchronization of federates; and the generation, modification, and distribution of information, objects, and interactions. The object model template (OMT) provides a common framework for the communication within the federation. The HLA object models are formal definitions of the data transferred among federates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Our simulation architecture VSimRTI</head><p>For sophisticated V2X simulations, we developed the V2X simulation runtime infrastructure (VSimRTI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> that follows the third approach, explained in Section 2.3. We can couple arbitrary simulators and enjoy the flexibility to exchange them depending on the specific requirements of a simulation scenario. The VSimRTI system architecture supports a subset of the HLA standard and some of its fundamental concepts are used. However, the complexity of the whole HLA standard and its implementation would have exceeded the scope of a V2X simulation framework. So, a lightweight framework was created which facilitates the simulation of V2X communication scenarios.</p><p>In order to increase performance and scalability of complex V2X simulations, we implemented a time management service that enables optimistic synchronization in VSimRTI.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Concept of VSimRTI</head><p>One of the fundamental design principles of VSimRTI is that it creates a federation of simulators that is managed by services of a runtime infrastructure. A federation of simulations is built by integrating each participating simulator into a designated federate. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates the FMC Model<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> of the general VSimRTI architecture. In the upper part of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the inner structure of a federate is illustrated. It consists of the original simulator that is connected to its Feder-ate Ambassador and to an instance of a VSimRTI ambassador. The complete communication among federates is handled by their ambassadors using messages. Each federate provides an ambassador offering an interface that is used by the VSimRTI to control the simulator and to provide messages from other federates. The resulting set of federates is managed by the runtime that provides required services for communication, time management, and lifecycle management (see lower part of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The federates themselves consist of the simulation system as well as of two ambassador components for the bidirectional communication between the runtime core and a federate: the VSimRTI Ambassador and the Federate Ambassador. The ambassador pattern allows transparently connecting arbitrary simulation systems that provide a remote control interface for the needed interactions. Furthermore, it decouples the internals of that interface from the semantics of the VSimRTI services. More precisely, attaching a simulation federate requires only the implementation of the federate ambassador interface and the realization of the commands specified within. The internals of the underlying federate implementation are hidden from the services of VSimRTI. In the opposite direction, the VSimRTI ambassador allows the federates to access services of the VSimRTI core. These services, offered by the V2X simulation runtime infrastructure (lower part of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), include federation-, time-, and interactionmanagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The federation management is responsible for the lifecycle management of participating federates. The time management is necessary for coordinating the simulation progress and for synchronizing participating federates. The exchange of data among federates is enabled by the interaction management that handles message publication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Simulator synchronization fundamentals</head><p>Federated simulation systems characteristically consist of a set of physically independent simulation processes that interact using time stamped messages. During computation, each simulator processes events from its local event queue. These events may either be scheduled by the simulator itself or generated remotely by other simulators via messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Although the processes are independent, event processing within each simulator must happen in time stamp order for all events in the event queue, regardless of the origin is local or remote. Otherwise, a simulator may send a message to another simulator which has already advanced further in simulation time. This could, then, induce an event in the receiver's past which, obviously, would invalidate the simulation results. Such an out-of-order event processing is referred to as causality error. The challenge in parallel executed simulation systems to prevent such errors is typically referred to as the synchronization problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>In order to prevent causality errors, the following condition has to be fulfilled at any time during the simulation and is referred to as local causality constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>: A discrete event simulation, consisting of simulators that interact exclusively by exchanging time stamped messages, obeys the local causality constraint if and only if each simulator processes events in non-decreasing time stamp order.</p><p>Apparently, if each simulator adheres to this constraint, the simulation can be guaranteed to be correct, i.e. the results are the same as if the simulation had been executed in a sequential manner. In order to obey this constraint, a synchronization protocol is required. The trivial approach is to avoid violations of the local causality constraint by not allowing any parallel execution at all. Instead, only one simulator may process a scheduled event while all others have to wait for the processing to finish. This sequential synchronization usually suffers from poor performance since benefits of the parallel and distributed system architecture cannot be exploited. Further alternatives to such synchronization protocols exist and are introduced in the following. Conservative synchronization addresses the synchronization problem by avoiding any causality error in general. In contrast to that, optimistic synchronization allows causality errors to occur, but integrates corrective activities in order to compensate for them <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Conservative synchronization</head><p>The fundamental goal of conservative synchronization <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> is to determine when it is safe for a logical process (LP) to process an event from its queue and proceed in its simulation time. An event with a time stamp T E is considered safe when it can be guaranteed that no other event with a time stamp less than T E is scheduled for this LP. LPs that have no safe events in their event queue must wait until an event becomes safe, or an event with a safe time stamp is scheduled.</p><p>Each LP advances its local time in a strictly increasing manner. Hence, assuming that communication preserves the ordering of messages, time stamps of incoming messages are guaranteed to have an increasing order as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. This technique makes it possible to determine which event can be considered safe by using the last time stamp received on every incoming channel from other simulators. However, additional information is required in conservative synchronization to enable a significant parallelism among the participating simulators. In order to increase the amount of safe events in the simulation, each simulator must be able to predict the earliest simulation time at which it could possibly schedule a new event on a remote simulator. This time window is usually referred to as Lookahead <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. While a simulator with a lookahead value L is processing an event, other simulators can already process events with timestamps less than T + L in parallel.</p><p>However, since the size of the lookahead value always depends on the simulation model, a small L can lead to several flaws in conservative synchronization. Our experimental evaluations have shown that for V2X simulation models, the lookahead value tends to become quite small or even zero, which results in nearly the same performance as in sequential synchronization <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Optimistic synchronization</head><p>In contrast to conservative synchronization, optimistic synchronization enables parallel simulator execution, although it cannot be guaranteed that all interactions among the simulators will be correct, then. Instead, corrective actions are taken when it comes to a violation of correctness constraints, i.e. optimistic synchronization allows causality errors to occur, but provides mechanisms to recover from them <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Thus, an increased parallelism can be achieved that allows exploiting the inherent scalability of distributed and parallel simulations.</p><p>A common algorithm for optimistic synchronization is the Time Warp algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. In case of causality violations, a rollback to a correct simulation state is performed and delivery of previously sent messages is undone. In order to roll back to a previous simulation state, a snapshot of the variables of the simulator is required. Basically, two fundamental concepts are distinguished that can be used by an LP to recreate a previous simulation state <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>:</p><p>Copy State Saving (CSS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> creates a complete snapshot of the simulator's state variables and stores this copy in memory. This has the advantage that in case of rollbacks, no additional computation is necessary to recreate the simulator's state object. If such a snapshot has to be restored as a result of a straggler, the current state variables are completely replaced by the contents of the snapshot. Incremental State Saving (ISS) reduces the amount of memory required per snapshot by logging only state variables that have changed since the last snapshot. In case of a rollback, logged states are recreated in reverse order.</p><p>It depends on the simulation model, which one of these two approaches performs best. If an event often modifies larger portions of the state variables, CSS outperforms ISS. In contrast, when changing only a few state variables per simulation step, ISS saves a significant amount of memory per state and compensates the additional computational effort for rolling back.</p><p>Rolling back the simulation state locally undoes any illegal state changes that happened during the event processing of the affected simulator. However, since messages might have been sent to other simulators during event processing, these messages have to be unsent in order to eliminate the effects of the incorrect computation. Therefore, the Time Warp algorithm introduces the concept of anti-message that permits retracting a sent message. Anti-messages are identical copies of the original message, but carry an additional flag indicating that they are intended to eliminate their corresponding message.</p><p>When a simulator receives an anti-message, three situations may occur:</p><p>1. If the corresponding message is in the queue and has not yet been processed, message and anti-message can annihilate each other without any further impact. 2. If the corresponding message has already been processed, a rollback has to occur, eventually incorporating the sending of further anti-messages. 3. If the corresponding message has not yet been received, e.g. due to latencies in the network, the anti-message is stored in the input queue and immediately annihilates the corresponding message as soon as it arrives.</p><p>Due to point 2, this algorithm also eliminates incorrect computation that was already distributed among multiple federates. This allows for the complete simulation to recover from an incorrect computation. Nevertheless, it is guaranteed that cascading rollback cannot cause a simulation to be rolled back to its initial state. During a rollback to a timestamp T R , a sent anti-message must carry a timestamp strictly greater than T R . Since this also applies to cascading rollbacks, no federate involved will ever rollback to a simulation time prior to T R .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Synchronization in VSimRTI</head><p>Time management services implemented in the VSimR-TI core are responsible for managing the progress of simulation time and for synchronizing participating simulation federates. During runtime, each simulator schedules its events and waits for approval before executing the corresponding simulation steps, i.e. before advancing its time.

The simulation is dynamically advanced to the time of the most imminent event <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</p><p>Conservative time management performs well under the assumption that a significant Lookahead <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> of a value greater than 0 can be provided by the simulators. However, many simulators that are common for V2X simulation scenarios, e.g. communication network simulation, may have zero lookahead values <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">Federated optimistic synchronization</head><p>Optimistic synchronization in a federated V2X simulation environment has to obey several constraints. Since not every participating simulation federate may support optimistic synchronization concepts and the mechanism of state saving, the system design has to facilitate cooperative time management where optimistic, conservative or sequential synchronization can coexist. In order to enable such cooperative time management, a decentralized layered time management has been implemented. Thus, components of the VSimRTI core and conservative federates remain unaffected by additional optimistic features. Hence, optimistic and conservative federates can co-exist under different time management mechanisms without any further modification of the existing conservative federates.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows a top-level overview of the concept of perfederate implemented optimistic synchronization. Basically, the components on the left-hand side of the model are federates that are attached to the runtime using default time management and synchronization mechanisms like conservative synchronization. This is achieved by using the components of the VSimRTI core. Hence, the Federate Ambassador and the VSimRTI Ambassador are connected directly to the runtime core.</p><p>On the right-hand side of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, optimistic federates are located. In contrast to default federates, the ambassadors are not directly attached to the runtime, but to an intermediate layer called optimistic federate layer. This additional layer manages optimistic synchronization for its associated federate. It is created together with the instance of the federate by the runtime federation management and transparently realizes the RTI services for the underlying federates, i.e. the default ambassadors are attached to the optimistic federate layer without further changes. Additionally, the optimistic federate layer presents itself towards the VSimRTI core as a default federate. This is necessary in order to enable the synchronization among time management implemented in the VSimRTI core and in optimistic federates. The design of the optimistic federate layer, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, is inspired by the HLAbased approach of Vardanega et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. It implements the idea of a transparent intermediate layer that extends existing functionality of the associated federates. The top-level architecture of the optimistic federate layer is composed of two types of components: a rollback controller and dedicated interceptors for RTI and federate communication.</p><p>Interaction between runtime and federate is enabled by ambassadors that allow the federate to invoke services in the runtime (RTI Ambassador) and vice versa (Federate Ambassador). In order to avoid specialized implementations for optimistic and conservative federates, a mechanism was needed to allow the optimistic layer to monitor and influence communication with the federates. It is realized by installing interceptors in the channels between runtime and federate. Communication that is relevant for optimistic synchronization, e.g. state modifying messages, is intercepted and eventually rerouted to the rollback controller.</p><p>The rollback controller is designed to aggregate the interactions from both interceptors in order to enable a coordinated optimistic time management. A local time management that is implemented in the rollback controller controls the time advances of the associated federate and decouples it from the control of the RTI. When a rollback becomes necessary, the federate is reset to a state that was captured by the internal state management and antimessages for messages sent previously are published.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Virtual federates for in-depth performance evaluations</head><p>The term virtual federates is used to describe simulation federates for VSimRTI that do not include an actual simulator. Instead, they imitate the behaviour of actual simulation systems based on a configuration that describes performance and communication behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. The decision for virtual federates was motivated by experiences made during the evaluation of optimistic behaviour of VSimRTI. A set of real simulation federates, e.g. for traffic or communication network simulation, has several drawbacks for an in-depth performance evaluation of the simulation architecture. Since each simulation federate has special characteristics in terms of performance, costs of synchronization mechanisms, and interactions with other simulation federates, the analysis of the influences of variations of these characteristics in real simulation federates proves to be difficult because several characteristics, like interaction patterns, are not arbitrarily alterable. In order to circumvent these limitations, a new VSimRTI federate called virtual federate has been designed. Its aim is to enable the precise specification of a federate's behaviour for analysis purposes. Thus, the impact of synchronization mechanisms on specific federation architectures can be studied. Furthermore, virtual federates can also be used for general performance analysis. In this way, studies can be performed to verify a potential benefit before an actual implementation is made. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> illustrates the design of virtual federates and their integration into VSimRTI.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">VSimRTI success stories</head><p>VSimRTI has been used in various simulation studies to evaluate V2X communication and its applications. For example, VSimRTI was used in the PRE-DRIVE C2X project <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">3</ref>to get an integrated simulation tool set <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Moreover, possible attacks on vehicular networks and the resulting driver behaviour were simulated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. To give an overview, the following examples are an excerpt from the wide range of VSimRTI simulations performed thus far:</p><p>The aim of the research work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> was to develop and evaluate an approach based on the V2X technology eliminating the drawbacks of conventional traffic manage- ment solutions and, thus, help improve traffic efficiency. We presented an V2X application where the received speed information of other vehicles in the vicinity is used to update the travel route of a vehicle reflecting the current local traffic situation in the neighbourhood. To analyse the effectiveness of our algorithm and to identify potential problems, we selected an excerpt of the city of Cologne (Germany) as the simulation scenario. VSimRTI simulations were carried out to evaluate the improvements that can be achieved through this application. The developed algorithm showed a good performance in terms of travel time reduction for both regular and V2X-based vehicles. Our results illustrated that navigation systems using the V2X technology for a more intelligent route calculation can improve the traffic efficiency of future transport systems.</p><p>Whereas the examples above have been used to evaluate the efficiency and robustness of the V2X technology, the following research work aims to enhance the overall simulation performance without a loss on accuracy. In the following sections, studies are presented which optimize the synchronization of simulators, evaluate the influences of different communication models varying in their complexity, and result in highly accurate, but more efficient traffic simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">The benefit of optimistic synchronization</head><p>Since configurable virtual federates, explained in Section 4.4, enable the design of specialized federations for the purpose of experiments with optimistic synchronization, we used this concept in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> to analyse if optimistic synchronization yields a significant performance benefit. Experiments were performed to analyse the correlation between specific characteristics of optimistic federates and the overall simulation performance. At an average rollback frequency of less than 20% per federate, optimistic synchronization performed well assuming that such federates share a significant workload. Our results illustrated that the optimistic series performs significantly better compared to the conservative runs. Although the increasing interaction probability triggered additional rollbacks, the resulting overhead was small compared to the conservative series. Thus, the overhead for the optimistic runtime layer did not influence the performance of the federation significantly.</p><p>Furthermore, a V2X simulation scenario was executed and analysed within our experiments to prove the applicability of the optimistic time management for real simulation use cases. Here, we ran VSimRTI with the traffic simulator VISSIM, the communication simulator JiST/ SWANS, and the application simulator VSimRTI_App. In our scenario, applying optimistic synchronization for the traffic simulation federate increased the simulation performance by an average of approximately 25%. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, this ratio does not change significantly when the simulation complexity is increased because the increased complexity is distributed among all participating simulation federates. As other experiments, using virtual federates have shown, this rising complexity does not influence the effectiveness of optimistic synchronization as long as the ratio of distribution among the federates remains unchanged. The evaluation of the use case simulation showed a positive effect of optimistic synchronization within VSimRTI for the simulation performance. VSimRTI with an optimistic VISSIM federate achieved increases in a range between 20% and 25%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">The influences of communication models on the simulated effectiveness of V2X applications</head><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, we evaluated the influences of the three propagation models Free Space Propagation, Rayleigh Fading, and Rice Fading on the results of V2X simulations. Our study consisted of two parts: First, in a simple synthetic scenario, we analysed how the models influence communication in general. In the second part, we investigated a real inner city scenario where a V2X application was used to improve traffic efficiency. Generally, with regard to the probability of packet reception, the Free Space Propagation delivered the most optimistic results, Rice Fading turned out to be the intermediate model, and Rayleigh Fading caused the lowest number of successfully received messages. Whereas the differences between the two probabilistic models (fading) and the deterministic model (free space) were exceptionally evident in the simulations of the simple synthetic scenario without background communication, a harmonization among the models appeared if background communication occurred. In the real inner city scenario, we also analysed the impact of the propagation models on the simulated behaviour of a V2X traffic efficiency application. Here, the number of sent messages was independent of the propagation model and increased linearly depending on the number of V2X-based vehicles. However, the number of received messages was influenced by the propagation model: As assumed from the results of the synthetic scenario, free space delivered most messages successfully, Rayleigh Fading caused the lowest packet reception probability, and Rice Fading yielded intermediate results. But, the selected propagation model exerted no significant influences on the simulated effectiveness of the V2X application. Consequently, the simulated travel time benefit was almost the same for Free Space Propagation, Rayleigh Fading, and Rice Fading. Two reasons were responsible for this effect: first, V2X traffic efficiency applications are characterized by broadcasting all necessary information periodically. Second, the traffic density in urban areas is mostly high. As a result, vehicles received, generally, several messages with similar information and an accurate simulation of each message propagation was not essential here. In a further study, we plan to evaluate if this implication can also be applied to rural areas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Advanced traffic simulator couplings</head><p>VSimRTI permits several new aspects for the simulation of V2X communication scenarios. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, we introduced a concept for the coupling of different traffic simulators to simulate one overall V2X scenario. This coupling has the benefit that the most suitable simulator for each of the different regions is used. To show the advantages of our concept, we analysed the performance of a V2X scenario simulation where both the traffic simulators VISSIM <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and SUMO <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> were combined. VISSIM was used to achieve a highly accurate simulation of the most interesting region, whereas the more efficient traffic simulator SUMO simulated all surrounding areas.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, the performance results of the simulations with VISSIM as the single traffic simulator and the simulation with the coupling of VISSIM and SUMO are compared. Up to a number of about 150 vehicles, the VISSIM simulation is faster. For more vehicles, the coupling of VISSIM and SUMO yields better performance. In the simulations with VISSIM as the single traffic simulator, the real time factor is only greater than 1 if a small number of vehicles is simulated. As a result, no coupling with real time critical components, e.g. with hardware test beds or the real world, is possible here. In contrast, the real time factor of the coupled simulation is greater than 1 all the time even though a huge number of vehicles is simulated. This is suitable for simulations that have to run in real time.</p><p>Our results showed that this simulator coupling reduces the overall simulation time without leading to a decrease in accuracy. The traffic simulator coupling concept, described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, provides a solution to enable huge, but time critical-traffic simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>Wireless vehicular communication (V2X) helps to enhance safety and traffic efficiency. However, the simulation of V2X scenarios is a challenge because two different simulation worlds come together here: vehicular traffic and wireless network communication. To solve this problem, VSimRTI couples different simulators and enables the simulation of the various aspects of V2X-based future intelligent transportation systems. Consequently, VSimRTI simulations allow the analysis of V2X test cases before real field tests start. The aim of the VSimRTI project is to make the preparation and execution of simulations as easy as possible for the users. Therefore, a framework for simulator integration was created that facilitates the simulation of V2X communication scenarios. All management tasks, such as synchronization, interaction, and lifecycle management are completely handled by VSimRTI. Several optimization techniques, such as optimistic synchronization, enable high performance simulations. Special V2X features, e.g. traffic lights, roadside stations, and both CAM and DENM types, are supported by VSimRTI.</p><p>In contrast to existing fixed simulator couplings, the VSimRTI simulation infrastructure allows the easy integration and exchange of simulators. Thus, the high flexibility of VSimRTI enables the coupling of the most appropriate simulators for a realistic presentation of vehicle traffic, emissions, wireless communication, and the execution of V2X applications. Depending on the specific requirements of a simulation scenario, the most relevant simulators can be used. VSimRTI uses an ambassador concept inspired by some fundamental concepts of the High Level Architecture (HLA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Thus, it is possible to couple arbitrary simulation systems with a remote control interface. Attaching an additional simulator only requires that the ambassador interface is implemented.</p><p>For immediate use, a set of simulators is already coupled with VSimRTI. So, for example, the traffic simulators VISSIM and SUMO, the communication simulators JiST/ SWANS and OMNeT++, the application simulator VSimR-TI_App, and several visualization and analysis tools have been prepared for VSimRTI.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
