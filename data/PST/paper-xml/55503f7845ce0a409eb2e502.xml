			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>An interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic set (IVHFLS) can serve as an extension of both a 25 linguistic term set and an interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set. This new set combines quan-26 titative evaluation with qualitative evaluation; these can describe the real preferences of 27 decision-makers and reflect their uncertainty, hesitancy, and inconsistency. This work 28 focuses on multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems in which the criteria are in 29 different priority levels and the criteria values take the form of interval-valued hesitant 30 fuzzy linguistic numbers (IVHFLNs). The new approach to solving these problems is based 31 on the prioritized aggregation operators of IVHFLNs. Having reviewed the relevant litera-32 ture, we provide interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic operations and apply some lin-33 guistic scale functions, which have been improved on the basis of psychological theory 34 and prospect theory. Ultimately, two kinds of prioritized aggregation operators of IVHFLNs 35 are developed, which extend to a grouping prioritized situation and are applied to MCDM 36 problems. Finally, an example is provided to illustrate and verify the proposed approach in 37 two separate situations, which are then compared to other representative methods.</p><p>38</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Since the fuzzy set was proposed by Zadeh in 1965 <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, it has been widely researched and developed as well as being successfully applied in various fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref>. In many multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems, due to their fuzziness and uncertainty, the criteria weights and values of alternatives can be inaccurate, uncertain, or incomplete. Under these circumstances, fuzzy sets can provide robust solutions. In fuzzy sets, the membership degree of the element in a universe is a single value between zero and one; however, these single values are inadequate to provide complete information due to a lack of systematic and comprehensive knowledge.</p><p>Hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs), an extension of traditional fuzzy sets, can address these situations. HFSs were first introduced by Torra and Narukawa <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>, and they permit the membership degrees of an element to be a set of several possible values between zero and one. HFSs are highly useful in resolving situations where people hesitate when providing their preferences in the decision-making process, and they have been a subject of great interest to researchers. Recently, Rodríguez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> presented an overview and discussed future trends for HFSs. Farhadinia <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> proposed a series of score functions for HFSs.</p><p>Wei <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>, Yu <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>, and Ai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> studied the aggregation operators of HFSs. Farhadinia <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, Xu and Xia <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>,</p><p>Peng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, and Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> discussed the information measures of HFSs. Hesitant fuzzy TOPSIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> and hesitant fuzzy</p><p>The new class is based on linguistic term sets and IVHFSs. IVHFLSs combine the advantages of both linguistic term sets and IVHFSs. The main advantage of IVHFLSs is that they can describe two fuzzy attributes of an object: a linguistic term and an interval-valued hesitant fuzzy element (IVHFE). The former provides an evaluation value, such as ''excellent'' or ''good''. The latter describes the hesitancy for the given evaluation value and denotes the interval-valued membership degrees associated with the specific linguistic term.</p><p>To date, several methods have been proposed for dealing with linguistic information, and the main ones will now be briefly discussed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> A method based on a transformation to fuzzy numbers by means of membership functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>. However, this method led to a certain degree of information loss in the transformation process, and it is difficult to choose the appropriate membership functions in practical decision-making applications. (2) A method based on symbols that made computations on the subscripts of linguistic terms and was easy to operate <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. However, this approach performed the retranslation step as an approximation process to express the results in the initial term sets, which led to a lack of accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. (3) A method based on the cloud model, which can correctly depict the uncertainty of a qualitative concept. This model has been successfully used <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>. (4) A method based on the 2-tuple linguistic representation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which avoids the information distortion and loss that had hitherto occurred in linguistic information processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>. However, as was depicted by Martínez and Herrera <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, these approaches possess certain advantages, but this does not mean that they can successfully model and solve all types of problems.</p><p>Clearly in real world decision-making problems it is not realistic to use only one technique, because different criteria, attributes, and other factors are better suited to different types of modeling. In the method based on the 2-tuple linguistic representation model, there is a conversion and inverse conversion process. Motivated by this idea and taking into consideration the limitations in previous linguistic methods, we propose new linguistic scale functions to deal with linguistic translation issues under different semantic situations. These scale functions provide a higher degree of flexibility for modeling linguistic information.</p><p>In general, aggregation operators are important tools for dealing with information fusion in MCDM problems and are a research area of great interest throughout the world. In practical situations, decision-makers usually consider different criteria priorities. To deal with this issue, Yager <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> developed prioritized average (PA) operators by modeling the criteria priority on the weights associated with the criteria, which depend on the satisfaction of higher priority criteria. Yager <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref> further focused on PA operators and proposed two methods for formulating this type of aggregation process. As is well known, the PA operator has many advantages over other operators. For example, the PA operator does not need to provide weight vectors and, when using this operator, it is only necessary to know the priority among the criteria. However, Yager <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> only discussed the criteria values and weights in the real number domain. Therefore our aim is to develop some prioritized aggregation operators for aggregating interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic information.</p><p>The focus of this paper is on a type of MCDM problems where a criterion priority exists, referred to as a prioritized MCDM.</p><p>Two PA operators for interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic numbers (IVHFLNs) that are a special case of IVHFLSs will be proposed and extended to a grouping prioritized situation. The main use of these operators is to solve MCDM problems in which the criteria are at different priority levels. Therefore, the rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, some basic concepts of linguistic term sets, interval numbers, and IVHFSs are briefly reviewed. In Section 3, the concepts for IVHFLSs and interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic operations are provided and a method for comparing two IVHFLNs is proposed. In Section 4, two kinds of prioritized aggregation operators for IVHFLNs are proposed and some desirable properties are analyzed. Then, a method for solving MCDM problems with IVHFLNs, in which the criteria are in different grouping priority levels, is developed. In Section 5, an illustrative example is provided for two situations in which the proposed method is used. Subsequently comparison analyzes are made. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section 6.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">IVHFLSs and their operations</head><p>From the above analysis, we can see that both linguistic term sets and IVHFSs are useful tools to deal with uncertainty.</p><p>Motivated by HFLSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> that are based on linguistic term sets and HFSs, we propose IVHFLSs based on linguistic term sets and IVHFSs as follows. IVHFLNs, as the elements and special case of IVHFLSs, have great significance for information evaluation. Therefore, several linguistic scale functions are given to provide a higher degree of flexibility for modeling linguistic information. Some interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic operations are also provided, and a comparison method for two IVHFLNs, based on the score function and accuracy function, is presented. When X = {x 1 , x 2 , . . ., x n } has only one element, IVHFLS A is reduced to &lt;s h(a) , C a &gt;. For convenience, a = &lt;s h(a) , C a &gt; is called an interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic number (IVHFLN). IVHFLNs are the elements of IVHFLSs, and they can be considered as a special case of IVHFLS. Moreover, when C A (x) = {r} has only an interval value, it indicates that the degree to which x belongs to s h(x) is r. For example, &lt;s 2 , {[0.3, 0.4]}&gt; is called an interval-valued fuzzy linguistic number (IVFLN), which is a special case of IVHFLN. [0.7, 0.9]}&gt; are IVHFLNs. [0.4, 0.5], [0.6, 0.7], and [0.7, 0.8] are the possible interval-valued membership degrees where x 1 belongs to s 5 ; [0.1, 0.3], [0.5, 0.6], and [0.7, 0.9] are the possible interval-valued membership degrees where x 2 belongs to s 6 .</p><p>In the practical decision-making process, due to the uncertainty and complexity of objective factors and the ambiguity of human thought, it is more suitable and convenient to provide criteria values that are in the form of IVHFLNs, as opposed to linguistic terms or IVHFEs. Clearly, an IVHFLN is an extension of an IVHFE and a linguistic term. Compared to linguistic terms, IVHFLNs embody the possible interval-valued membership degrees that an evaluation object attaches to the linguistic term, and they more accurately depict the fuzziness than an uncertain linguistic variable does. For example, the performance evaluation result is perhaps felt to be higher than ''good'' but lower than ''very good''. If this result is expressed with an uncertain linguistic variable, it will be [s 5 , s 6 ]; however, the preference degree of either s 5 or s 6 is unclear. When IVHFLNs are used, the performance evaluation can be expressed as &lt;s 5 , {[0.4, 0.5], [0.6, 0.7], [0.7, 0.8]}&gt; or &lt;s 6 , {[0.1, 0.3], [0.5, 0.6], [0.7, 0.9]}&gt;, which are far more precise than the result expressed by uncertain linguistic variables. When compared to IVHFEs, IVHFLNs are defined by using linguistic terms, which make the membership degrees no longer relative to a fuzzy concept, but to a linguistic term. Thus, the decision-making information can be precisely reflected and expressed in different dimensions.</p><p>In fuzzy set theory, the interval values in IVHFLNs are called possible interval-valued membership degrees, which are caused by the hesitancy and uncertainty of decision-makers. Interval values can normally express fuzzy information more easily than specific or single real numbers, and they are quite adequate and sufficient to model real life decision-making problems. In the example of the performance evaluation of a car, suppose that ''good (s 5 )'' is an acceptable evaluation result for the car obtained by three decision-makers. Then, each decision-maker uses an interval value to express his/her opinion about the car under the evaluation of ''good (s 5 )''. Decision-maker A may hesitate and give the interval value [0.4, 0.5] to avoid information loss. Similarly, decision-maker B may give the interval value [0.6, 0.7] for ''good'' and decision-maker C may give the interval value [0.7, 0.8] for ''good''. In this case, IVHFLNs may be a better option, and the evaluations can be denoted by &lt;s 5 , {[0.4, 0.5], [0.6, 0.7], [0.7, 0.8]}&gt;.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Linguistic scale functions</head><p>As is well known, operations cannot be carried out in a straightforward fashion when fuzzy numbers combine directly with linguistic terms. To define the operations of IVHFLNs, it is necessary to explore and define new linguistic scale functions for linguistic modeling. To use data more efficiently and to express the semantics flexibly the new linguistic scale functions will assign different semantic values to linguistic terms under different situations. In linguistic evaluation scales where linguistic subscripts are increasing, the absolute deviation between adjacent linguistic subscripts may increase or decrease.</p><p>The linguistic scale functions outlined below are preferable in practice. This is because these functions are flexible and can give more deterministic results according to different semantics. For the linguistic term s i in a linguistic term set S, where S = {s i ji = 0, 1, 2, . . ., 2t}, the relationship between the element s i and its subscript i is strictly monotonically increasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. These new functions are provided next.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Definition 6. If h i 2 R + (R + = {rjr P 0,r<label>2</label></formula><p>R}) is a numeric value, then the linguistic scale function f that conducts the mapping from s i to h i (i = 0, 1, 2, . . ., 2t) is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">f : s i ! h i ði ¼ 0; 1; 2; . . . ; 2tÞ; where 0 6 h 0 &lt; h 1 &lt; Á Á Á &lt; h 2t .</formula><p>Clearly, function f is a strictly monotonically increasing function with regard to subscript i. The symbols h i (i = 0, 1, 2, . . ., 2t) reflect the preference of the decision-makers when they are using the linguistic terms s i 2 S (i = 0, 1, 2, . . ., 2t). Therefore, the function/value in fact denotes the semantics of the linguistic terms.</p><p>For example, the following functions can be possible choices for linguistic scale functions.</p><p>(1) The following is defined based on the subscript function I(s i ) = i:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">h i ¼ i 2t<label>ði</label></formula><p>¼ 0; 1; 2; . . . ; 2tÞ:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Here h i 2 [0, 1].</formula><p>The evaluation scale of the linguistic information given above is divided on average. Moreover, its form is simple and commonly used but lacks a reasonable theoretical basis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. (2) The exponential scale gives a basis for the change in value of the composite scale, but it can only show the unidirectional growth of the value. However, the decision-makers' mental stimulation caused by decision criteria includes both good and bad aspects. A semantic deviation will be produced if decision-makers only use the exponential scale to make assessments on the criteria. To achieve a bidirectional increase in the geometric progression of the scale value, provide a good fit with the psychological value during the evaluation process, and achieve the principle of ''proportional assignment, successive leap forward'' in scale design, a composite assessment scale expression based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> is proposed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">h i ¼ a t Àa tÀi 2a t À2 ði ¼ 0; 1; 2; . . . ; tÞ; a t þa iÀt À2 2a t À2 ði ¼ t þ 1; t þ 2; . . . ;<label>2tÞ:</label></formula><p>( In this case, with the increase in linguistic subscripts i (i = 0, 1, 2, . . ., 2t), the absolute deviation between adjacent linguistic subscripts also increases.</p><p>The value of a can be determined using a subjective method. Assuming that indicator A is far more important than indicator B, and the importance ratio is m, then a k = m (k represents the scale level) and a ¼ ffiffiffiffi ffi m k p .

For example, the decision-makers' sensitivity regarding the gap between ''good'' and ''bad'' is greater than that of the gap between ''good'' and ''very good''. This phenomenon is manifested by the value function in prospect theory, which reflects the value that is formed by the subjective feelings of decision-makers. Therefore, in some cases, it is necessary to cite the related concept of the prospect theory's value function when defining and using a linguistic scale function.</p><p>Based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the improved linguistic scale function can be defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">h i ¼ t a ÀðtÀiÞ a 2t a ði ¼ 0; 1; 2; . . . ; tÞ; t b þðiÀtÞ b 2t b ði ¼ t þ 1; t þ 2; . . . ; 2tÞ: 8 &lt; : Here a, b 2 (0, 1].

The amount of minerals consumed in China is increasing at record levels. However, China's reserves of minerals are limited and cannot meet the needs of industrial development. Consequently, more and more enterprises in China are obtaining minerals from overseas to sustain future development. In the process of investment, many factors such as the investment environment and risks should be considered to guarantee the safety and effectiveness of certain projects.</p><p>ABC Nonferrous Metals Co. Ltd. is a large state-owned company whose main business is producing and selling nonferrous metals. It is also the largest manufacturer of multi-species nonferrous metals in China, with the exception of aluminum. To expand its main business the company is always engaged in overseas investment, and a department which consists of executive managers and several experts in the field has been established specifically to make decisions on global mineral investment.</p><p>Recently, the overseas investment department decided to select a pool of alternatives from several foreign countries based on preliminary surveys. After thorough investigation, five countries (alternatives) are taken into consideration, i.e., {x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 , x 5 }. There are many factors that affect the investment environment and four factors are considered based on the experience of the department personnel, including c 1 : resources (such as the suitability of the minerals and their exploration); c 2 : politics and policy (such as corruption and political risks); c 3 : economy (such as development vitality and the stability); and c 4 : infrastructure (such as railway and highway facilities).</p><p>The decision makers, including the experts and executive managers, have gathered to determine the decision information.</p><p>The linguistic term set S = {s 0 , s 1 , s 2 , s 3 , s 4 , s 5 , s 6 } = {very poor, poor, slightly poor, fair, slightly good, good, very good} is used. The evaluation information is given in the form of IVHFLNs, where c j (x i ) is the evaluation value of the alternative x i on the criterion c j . In c j (x i ) there is a consensus on the chosen linguistic term and each decision-maker can use an interval value to express his/her opinion; in other words, the interval value denotes to what degree x i matches this given linguistic term under c j . Each decision-maker gave his/her own evaluations (interval-valued membership degrees) based on the surveys of the five countries as well as his/her knowledge and experience. Then all the possible interval-valued membership degrees under each given linguistic term are gathered together. The same interval-valued membership degrees for a given linguistic term will appear only once in an IVHFLN. Consequently, following a heated discussion, they came to a consensus on the final evaluations which are expressed by IVHFLNs as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">1</ref>.</p></div>

This is the same ranking as some of the results obtained by the proposed method, i.e. the first and third semantic situations. This reveals the validity and advantages of the proposed method because it can obtain different results under different semantic situations while the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> ignored the differing semantics. In addition, IVHFLNs used in this paper are more suitable for expressing evaluation information, because they have a more flexible and wider usage than HFLEs. The proposed method is applicable for HFLEs if the crisp membership degrees are changed to interval values with equal upper and lower limits (e.g., 0.6 can be [0.6, 0.6]). So, being compared to HFLEs and the corresponding method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, IVHFLNs along with the proposed method are more practical.</p></div>

The main reasons are as follows:</p><p>(a) The operations of IVHFLNs defined in this paper use a conservative and reliable principle; especially we note that the addition operation of IVHFLNs is more reasonable and reliable because the final interval-valued hesitant fuzzy membership is closely combined with each element of the original IVHFLNs, which can effectively avoid information loss.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, we know that the operations of ITFNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> have some limitations and may distort the given information.</p><p>(b) The ranking result x 5 1 x 4 1 x 2 1 x 3 1 x 1 is obtained by the score function values. However, according to Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>, if the expected values are used to rank the alternatives, x 5 1 x 1 1 x 3 1 x 2 1 x 4 is obtained, which is the same ranking as some of the results obtained by the proposed method, i.e. the first and third semantic situations. Therefore, similarly to Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>, the method used for ranking is why the ranking result obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> is not the same, that is, ranking by the expected values is better than ranking by the score function values.</p><p>According to the above comparison analyzes, the proposed method for MCDM problems with IVHFLNs has the following advantages.</p><p>First, IVHFLNs can express the evaluation information more flexibly. Although the representation of IVHFLNs looks complex, they can closely depict fuzzy linguistic information and retain the completeness of original data or the inherent thoughts of decision-makers, which is the prerequisite of guaranteeing accuracy of final outcomes. Besides, as far as the applicability of IVHFLNs is considered, decision-makers can trade off between the features of IVHFLNs and the relative computational cost. What is more, the complexity and amount of computation can be obviously reduced with the assistance of programming software.</p><p>Second, the operations of IVHFLNs in this paper are defined based on linguistic scale function, which can achieve different results when a different linguistic scale function f ⁄ is used. Thus, decision-makers can flexibly select the linguistic scale function f ⁄ depending on their preferences and the actual semantic situations.</p><p>Third, the proposed interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic prioritized aggregation operators can deal with MCDM problems under the interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic environment in which the criteria are in different priority levels.</p><p>What's more, the criteria weights, which are calculated by the prioritized aggregation operators according to the criteria priority levels, are more objective and reasonable than a set of known criteria weights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>To address situations where decision-making problems use qualitative variables rather than numerical ones and to reflect the uncertainty, hesitancy, and inconsistency of decision-makers, we have developed a new class of fuzzy sets named IVHFLSs. The interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic operations and some linguistic scale functions are introduced. Then, on the basis of the PA operator, two kinds of prioritized aggregation operators for IVHFLNs are proposed and extended to a grouping prioritized situation. Furthermore, an MCDM method based on these operators under an interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic environment is developed. Finally, an illustrative example demonstrates the application of the proposed It is well known that the PA operator has many advantages over other operators as it does not need to provide weight vectors and, when using this approach, it is only necessary to know the priority among the criteria. The foremost characteristic of these proposed operators is that they take into account priority among the criteria. Although traditional PA operators are generally suitable for aggregating information which is in the form of numerical values or simple fuzzy values, they are unable to deal with interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic information. The proposed IVHFL(G)PWA and IVHFL(G)PWG operators can accommodate situations where the input arguments consist of IVHFLNs. In addition, the results may change using different linguistic scale functions. Thus, decision-makers can select the most appropriate linguistic scale function f ⁄ according to their interests and actual needs. In a word, the main advantages of the proposed method are not only that the proposed operators accommodate an interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic environment, but also that they consider the priority or grouping priority among the criteria, which is more feasible and practical. In future research, the developed operators will be extended and applied to other domains.</p></div>
