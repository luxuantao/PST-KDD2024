<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>A hospital department may face the situation when patients are turned away because all beds are occupied, and the corresponding healthcare service is thus postponed due to the insufficient number of available beds. An insufficient financial support or a poor resource management often causes this situation. On the other hand, an over-provision of hospital beds or an unrealistic health service time is a waste of the already limited resources. Accordingly, there is need for a complex involvement bringing together under the same umbrella advanced analytical methods and machine learning techniques to help make better decisions regarding the allocation and use of hospital beds in order to improve patient care and save money. of an Emergency Department. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> a decision support system based on the Erlang loss model is developed to evaluate the size of nursing units.</p><p>Compartmental models have previously been shown to provide a suitable description of the patient flow through a hospital department, especially for geriatric medicine. Starting with a deterministic two-compartment mathematical model <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, further progress occurred when stochastic models along with mixed exponential distributions, continuous-time Markov model and Bayesian belief networks have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>This paper proposes a flexible strategy to improve the hospital management regarding its two main aspects: (a) bed allocation policy, and (b) financial resource utilization. First, it uses results from queuing theory to model the patient flow, where a Poisson process describes the patients' arrivals, hospital beds are servers, and the length of stay is modeled using a phase-type distribution. Second, in conjunction with the queuing system, a compartmental model describes the hospital department. Finally and most importantly, the previous approach has been enriched with the support of the evolutionary paradigm used to optimize both the bed allocation policy and the resource utilization. In addition, a ''What-if'' analysis has been performed to explore in depth the various possible options available for the hospital management. The main contributions of the paper are twofold: first, the evolutionary-based optimization of the hospital management, and, secondly, the ''What-if'' analysis allowing the evaluation of different available options.</p></div>

In such a loss model in which the customers that find all the servers busy are lost for the system, k represents the Poisson arrival rate, and the phase-type service has the probability density function given by: f ðtÞ ¼ X l i¼1 a i q i e Àa i t ; ð1Þ with the corresponding mean s ¼ P l i¼1 q i =a i , where l represents the number of phases/compartments, a i s the mixing proportions, and the q i s the transition rates with</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P l i¼1 q i ¼ 1.</formula><p>The parameters defining the above queuing model, k, s, and c are considered as variable entities being subject to an optimization process enabling the improvement of the bed occupancy and resource utilization.</p><p>The average number of arrivals occurring during a time interval of length t is given by k Á t; thereby, the offered load of the system, i.e., the average number a of arrivals during an average length of stay s is a ¼ k Á s.

Another problem that arises in the use of GAs is the appropriate choice of the parameters defining the variations operators.

Since the distribution of data is not always normal (Poisson arrivals, phase-type service), the appropriate intervals (search space) for the corresponding chromosomes were estimated as &lt;mean ± 1.96 Â SD&gt;, seen as substitutes of the 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the mean of each parameter.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.1.">Optimization of bed-occupancy management</head><p>The first task of this research is to optimize the bed-occupancy management by estimating the sufficient number of beds in order to maintain at a tolerable level the number of rejected requests.</p><p>When using the GA approach, a chromosome is represented by a vector (c, k, s), with the genes c, k and s belonging to specified domains (95% CI) matching real-world medical data. The corresponding fitness measure is given by the delay probability B(c, a).</p><p>Since, in this context, the main task is maintaining the rejection probability level as low as possible, the objective (fitness) function B(c, a) has to be minimized, depending on different thresholds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.2.">Optimization of resource utilization</head><p>The second aim of the study is to estimate the optimal model parameters enabling the best healthcare service to patients with maximum resources utilization, in other words, to find the optimal balance between holding costs and penalty costs.</p><p>Technically, a chromosome is represented this time by the vector (c, k, s, h, p), the fitness function being now represented by the corresponding cost function g.</p><p>In the end, health professionals can use the model to answer several questions regarding the management of hospital departments (arrival policy, average length of stay, optimum bed occupancy, costs, etc.) enabling them to anticipate hospital bed allocation and expected healthcare costs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7.">What-if analysis</head><p>''What-if analysis'' has been finally performed with the purpose of exploring the effects on the outcomes of the queuing system and resource utilization through systematic changes in the input parameters. Given an input change (parameters c, k, s, h, and p), this sensitivity analysis detects how the two main models' performance measures: (a) the delay probability B, and (b) the cost function g are affected by this change, and how could they be tuned to respond to the management optimization issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.8.">Department of geriatric medicine model</head><p>The methodology presented above is illustrated using bedoccupancy data collected at the Department of Geriatric Medicine -St. George's Hospital, London (1969-1984) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and January 2000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The healthcare assistance consisted of acute, rehabilitative and long-stay medical service.</p><p>During these years, different admission policies and inpatient management were considered. Admission experienced annual changes, with periodic increases and decreases due to both management policies and seasonal events (Christmas, Easter, influenza epidemic, etc.).</p><p>Three different styles were adopted for the inpatient manage- As inventory policy, the department allocated, on average, 186 beds per year. Whatever the case, a mean arrival rate equaling k = 5.9 patients per day and a mean length of stay equaling s = 24.9 days were found to be well described by the data [5].</p><p>Regarding the associated cost model, since the data came from the National Health Service (NHS), the profit was assumed zero.</p><p>Taking into account the general practice in those times, the cost parameters were estimated as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>:</p><p>376</p><p>The total cost per patient per day is £168 (£50 are incurred with 377 respect to the bed, and £118 with respect to the treatment).</p></div>

For instance, the same bed occupancy equaling around 93% is obtained both with 132 beds and with 165 beds, the other parameters playing, naturally, a significant role. Irrespective of different values of c, k, and s, comparable with the common practice, the average time spent by a patient is close to the average value (24.61 vs. 24.9), while the average number of patients varies noticeably (from 121 to 154). It follows that, given the framework complexity, it is difficult to manage the bed allocation without the aid of computer simulation and optimization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Resource utilization optimization</head><p>In what follows, we illustrate the evolutionary-based optimization of the corresponding healthcare costs, thus facilitating an efficient access to medical service. The experimental results envisaged the use of the proposed GA to estimate the near optimum values of the parameters c, k, s, h and p in order to maintain at a minimum feasible level the cost function g, but with a reasonable proportion of patients turned away. In this context, the goal is to minimize the objective (fitness) function g. In addition to the cost minimization, the corresponding average turnover per allocated bed per year (T) is also computed. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> presents some values of the cost function g in ascending order, and the corresponding turnover per allocated bed, as functions of different values of the queuing system parameters c, k, s, and the associated costs h and p. Since the chromosomes may be initialized in searching spaces where optimal solutions are likely to be found, we considered the penalty cost ranging between £1046 and £2050 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the starting value equaling the default estimation (the lowest approximation for the penalty cost).</p><p>The evolutionary approach has revealed that the minimum healthcare cost (£610.91) can be achieved with 149 beds, arrival rate around 5.51 patient/day, an average service time (length of stay) equaling 25 days, a holding cost h = £30, and a penalty cost p = £1250. These figures are close to the standard of a geriatric department, excepting the number of allocated beds (149), much lower than the yearly average (186), and the holding cost ratio p/h = 41.67 better than the optimal one reported in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>,</p><p>equaling 40.</p><p>The model we have developed, based on the strengths of the GAs, can be used as supporting tool to efficiently improve the stock policy of a geriatric department, by simultaneously using all the parameters defining the system. It can be extended without major difficulties to different medical departments.   The results corresponding to the second two scenarios 624 described in (b) are illustrated in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4</ref> and<ref type="figure">5</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref>.

Under these circumstances, the hospital manager can choose the adequate minimum number of beds and a suitable mean service time, in order to minimize the costs and maintain a proper medical care, by keeping at a low level the percentage of the lost demands.</p><p>Note that the penalty cost is just indicative, being based on the assumption that penalty may be regarded in some sense as lost revenue incurred when a patient is turned away (no empty beds available).</p><p>Unlike the previous approach focused on queuing techniques only, the methodology proposed in this paper inherits the versatility and efficiency of the evolutionary computation, encoding in a     There are, generally, two kinds of parameters defining the underlying queuing model. Thus, there are parameters the healthcare professional cannot change, such as the arrival rate or the mean service time (length of stay). We consider these parameters as ''objective'' parameters. It is noteworthy that even these objective parameters may change in some circumstances. For instance, the arrivals can vary due to external factors (e.g. demographics, epidemiology, or perceptions). On the other hand, even for particular procedures, the lengths of stays for two different patients were seen to differ by more than one week <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>. The other parameter type that can be changed by the healthcare professionals in some circumstances is seen as ''subjective'' parameter.</p><p>For the evolutionary-based optimization, we implemented a standard GA <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref> in Java.

This approach involve the construction of the corresponding mathematical model, which is time and resources consuming, due to the computational and statistical nature of most of these techniques. An attractive and effective alternative to this classical approach is represented by the use of GAs. Some of the reasons to use GAs are: (a) they can solve any optimization problem described with chromosome encoding, (b) the method is very easy to understand and implement without deep mathematical knowledge, (c) the number of parameters can be very large, and (d) there are no major constraints for the fitness function.

Associated costs 429 The inpatient hospital costs represent the largest component of 430 healthcare expenditures in most developed countries nowadays. 431 The inpatient costs are far from being uniformly and undoubtedly 432 assessed. According to [29,30], the average hospital adjusted 433 expenses per inpatient day was $1730 throughout USA, and £225 434 in UK. Consequently, the actual inpatient costs are estimated by each hospital. While the cost function g may be used as it is, the 436 parameters h and p may be adjusted by each user following the 437 same paradigm as in the geriatric model. 438 3.

Bed-occupancy optimization 445 In this subsection, the experimental results envisaged the use of 446 the proposed GA to estimate the near optimum values of the 447 parameters c, k and s to maintain at a tolerable level the probabil-448 ity of lost demands B(c, a). In this regard, the aim is to minimize the 449 objective (fitness) function B, taking into account different con-450 straints (thresholds) regarding its range of values. There is no con-451 sensus among practitioners regarding what qualifies a certain 452 percentage of lost demands as a tolerable level in geriatric medi-453 cine, but it suggests that running with percentage occupancy above 454 eighties leads to significant increases in rejection of patients [31]. 455 We consider the highest threshold equaling 10% as a maximum 456 rejection tolerable level, with the corresponding percentage occu-457 pancy ranging between 88% and 95%.The corresponding search 458 spaces for the chromosomes encoding the queuing model paramethe GA approach to optimize the queuing 466 model by presenting some values of the rejection/delay probability 467 B(c, a) in ascending order as function of different values of the 468 queuing system parameters c, k, and s, and different thresholds. 469 The GA approach has revealed that the minimum rejection 470 probability (1.5% of patients being turned away) can be achieved 471 with 146 beds, arrival rate around 5.22 patient/day, and an average 472 service time (length of stay) equaling 25 days, figures close to the 473 standard of a geriatric department. It is worth noting that this 474 potential managing performance was obtained using the GA 475 approach for 146 beds only, much lower than the standard 186 476 beds. Moreover, it is worth noting that, from the evolutionary 477 experiment, it resulted that the queuing system is extremely flex-478 ible since the same rejection probability of 5% can be achieved 479 either with 138 beds or 164 beds, but depending on different arri-480 val rates and service time (5.29/25.7 vs. 5.18/31.04).

Two scenarios have been considered in this respect: (a) evaluating B(c, s) for constant avg. k = 5.31 patient/day, and (b) evaluating B(k, s), for avg. c = 141 beds. The first scenario enables simulated experiments with different number of beds and mean medical service time for a fixed arrival rate k = 5.31 patient/day, which is close to the customary case. These changes are feasible for the hospital management, as long as it cannot change, practically, the arrival rate. The second scenario enables the exploration of the influence of the balance between the arrival rate and the mean service time upon the delay probability for a fixed number of c = 141 beds (inventory frequently encountered in reality). (b) Second, to investigate the change of the cost per day under the base-stock policy g depending on the changes of both the department facilities/policy (number of beds and mean service time) and the cost model parameters h and p. Two scenarios have been considered in this respect: (a) evaluating g(c, s) for constant avg. p = £1534, h = £64, k = 5.31 patient/day, and (b) evaluating g(p, h), for constant avg. c = 141 beds, k = 5.31 patient/day, and s = 25.54 days. Inspired by the indifference curves paradigm [32] and by the previous work [5], we can analyze under what conditions we are indifferent between neighboring values of the control variables (c, s), (k, s), and (p, h), regarding both the delay probability and cost function. Extrapolating the level/contour curves concept, the underlying equations involved in this approach are: B(c, s) = B(c + D c , s + Ds), B(k, s) = B(k + Dk, s + Ds), g(c, s) = g(c + D c , s + Ds), and g(p, h) = g(p + Dp, h + D h ), where D represents the increasing factor. Geometrically, it is about ''plateaus'' with some possible ''peaks'' and ''ravines'', illustrating the relative ''flatness'' of the response variables B and g. We have illustrated the indifference surfaces through 3D graphics obtained with the freely available R programming language. R is widely used in Statistics and Data Mining, has extensive documentation and active online community support, being a very good environment for statistical computing and graphics. The results corresponding to the first two scenarios described in (a) are illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3. 580 The graph and the corresponding data suggest that we may be 581 indifferent to the delay probability B if: 582 The number of beds ranges from 130 to 164 (D c = 34) and the 583 mean service time is 25 days (Ds = 0.02), thus yielding avg. 584 B = 2.02%, SD = 0.38%. 585 The number of beds ranges from 132 to 142 (D c = 10) and the 586 mean service time is 25.36 (Ds = 1.78), thus yielding avg. 587 B = 8.88%, SD = 0.83%. 588 589 Accordingly, the hospital manager may choose to keep a num-590 ber of beds equaling 130 for an expected lost demand percentage 591 not exceeding, on average, 2% and assuming a mean service time 592 equaling 25 days. On the other hand, 132 beds are sufficient to 593 keep the lost demand percentage around 9%, supposing an increase 594 of the mean service time up to 25.36 days. It is worth noting that 595 the significant increase of the lost demand was affected by a 596 relative small increase of the mean service time. These observa-597 tions are consistent with the analysis based on the indifference 598 surfaces that highlights the two ''plateaus'' of the graph of B. 599 The graph and corresponding data, along with the indifference 600 surfaces analysis, suggest that we may be indifferent to the delay 601 probability B if: 602 The arrival rate ranges from 5.15 to 5.68 (Dk = 0.53) and the 603 mean service time is 25 (Ds = 0.02), thus yielding avg. 604 B = 1.96%, SD = 0.36%. 605 The arrival rate ranges from 5.05 to 6 (Dk = 0.95), the mean ser-606 vice time is 25.35 (Ds = 1.78), thus yielding avg. B = 8.consistent with the previous ones. Thus, for a 610 mean service time equaling 25 days, the average lost demand per-611 centage is around 1.96%, increasing to 8.88% for a mean service 612 time equaling 25.35 days, insignificantly depending on the arrival 613 rate. 614 In both above scenarios, the hospital manager can control the 615 delay probability mainly through the mean service time. Note that 616 the arrival rate is naturally governed by randomness and cannot be 617 directly controlled. From the above results, it follows that the delay 618 probability is mainly sensitive to the change of the mean service 619 time and is not significantly affected by the relative changes of 620 the number of beds and arrival rate. This fact is also confirmed 621 by Table 2, regarding the influence of c and k upon the average 622 number of patients in hospital.</figDesc></figure>

Analogously, a bed alloca-639 tion equaling 130 and a mean service time no more than 25 days 640 may lead to minimum lost demands and minimum costs for the 641 hospital. 642 This graph and corresponding data, along with the indifference 643 surfaces analysis, suggest that we may be indifferent to the cost 644 function g if: 645 The penalty cost ranges from £1046 to £1650 (avg. p = £1332, 646 SD = £205) and the holding costs are £30, thus yielding avg. 647 g = £629.19, SD = £13.53. 648 The penalty cost ranges from £1450 to £2050 (avg. p = £1750, SD = £216) and the holding costs is £105, thus yielding avg. g = £1530.95, SD = £84.17. Consequently, the hospital manager may choose to keep the holding costs equaling £30 for an expected average cost function g = £629.19, irrespective of the penalty cost no more than £1650.</figDesc></figure>

The 761 drawbacks of such a choice consist of the largest fraction of 762 rejected patients (B = 5.7%), with possible negative conse-763 quences regarding the public perception, and the largest costs 764 (TC = £20,674, PC = £59.62); UBC = £0. 765 Adding 11 extra beds (c = 143 allocated beds). The 767 corresponding advantages of this choice consist of a 2.6 times 768 smaller fraction of rejected patients (B = 2.2%), and reduction 769 of associated costs (minus £817 for TC, and minus £73 for PC). 770 On the other hand, the cost per unstaffed beds increased by 771 £550. Scenario #3: Adding 14 extra beds (c = 146 allocated beds). 773 Although the difference towards the above scenario regarding 774 the number of beds (plus three beds) might seem insignificant, 775 the benefits related to costs are notable. TC increased by £104, 776 while PC decreased by £7.32. The cost per unstaffed beds 777 increased by £150. Compared to the first case, TC decreased 778 by £921, and PC also decreased by £44; the cost per unstaffed 779 beds increased by £700. The most consistent advantage is that 780 the fraction of rejected patients decreased by approximately 781 four times. In addition, if we assign, for instance, a penalty cost 782 p 1 = £1950 in the first scenarios, p 2 = £1450 in the second one, 783 and p 3 = £2050 in the third one, respectively, then the corre-784 sponding cost functions g's are estimated as g 1 = £1596.51, 785 g 2 = £621.22, and g 3 = £681.96. Comparing the first and the last 786 models (the largest difference of beds, 14), one can see that a 787 difference of £100 regarding the penalty cost results in a 788 decrease of about £915 of the corresponding function cost even 789 though the number of beds increased by 14. To conclude, this 790 simple example highlights the importance of considering the 791 associated function cost to any patient model. paper, we explore the feasibility of using a mix Opera-795 tions Research and Artificial Intelligence approach to support the 796 hospital bed occupancy and resource utilization. The goal is to pro-797 vide healthcare professionals a supporting computer-aided tool to 798 decide what policies could be introduced at greatest effect. It is 799 noteworthy to mention that such an approach is far to be directly 800 used by hospital administrators, its main role being to offer a sup-801 port decision-making. 802 The paper focused on three goals. First, starting from a standard 803 M/PH/c queuing model for bed-occupancy in hospitals, a novel 804 evolutionary-based approach is proposed to optimize the hospital 805 management by providing an efficient way to estimate the system 806 control parameters in order to obtain: 807 A suitable proportion of refused patients which we are prepared 808 to tolerate. 809 810 The corresponding average time spent in hospital. 811 The corresponding average number of patients in hospital. 812 The bed occupancy.</figDesc></figure>
