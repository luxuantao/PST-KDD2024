<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Deep learning methods, e.g., convolutional neural networks(CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs), have achieved great success in image processing and natural language processing especially in high level vision applications such as recognition and understanding. However, it is rarely used to solve information security problems such as attack detection studied in this paper. Here, we move forward a step and propose a novel multi-channel intelligent attack detection method based on long short term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNNs). To achieve high detection rate, data preprocessing, feature abstraction and multi-channel training and detection are seamlessly integrated into an end-to-end detection framework. Data preprocessing provides high-quality data for subsequent processing, then different types of features are extracted from the processed data. Multi-channel processing is used to generate classifiers by training neural networks with different types of features, which preserve attack features of input vectors and classify the attack from normal data. With the results of the classifier's attack detection, we introduce a voting algorithm to decide whether the input data is an attack or not. Experimental results validate that the proposed attack detection method greatly outperforms several attack detection methods that use feature detection and Bayesian or SVM classifiers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION 1</head><p>N recent years, network attack detection attracts increasing interest in social networking information security as the increasing security threats including cross-site scripting, clickjacking, DDOS, probe and identity theft. The aim of network attack detection is to distinguish the hostile activities from the network traffic. To synchronize with new or variant attacks, the detection must be accomplished in a smart and effective way. Traditional attack detection methods attempt to model all kind of attacks or anomalies, which detect the attacks based on the known knowledge. However, new types of attack have already made great damages before they are detected. As new attacks appear over time, modeling all kinds of attacks and detect the attacks accurately before the large-scale damage are difficult to achieve. To overcome this problem, a lot of efforts have been devoted to modeling the attack or anomaly by using machine learning techniques.</p><p>Machine learning is successfully used in many areas of computer science such as image processing computer vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In intrusion detection, Yihua Liao et al. applied k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) to IDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. They used k-NN classifier for the anomaly detection. Andrew H. Sung et al. took an IDS performance test with Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. They reduced features according to the influence toward classification of attacks, but the performance was similar to the result which used the original features. Maheshkumar Sabhnani et al. used several machine learning algorithms such as multilayer perceptron, k-Means and decision tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Although these methods have attracted a lot of interest, the detection accuracy rate is not high as desired.</p><p>It is believed that some characteristics in most of the novel attacks can be derived from the known attacks. The relationships are difficult to describe and represent. Deep learning is suitable to model complex non-linear relationships by learning multiple levels of data representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction. A deep neural network consists of a cascade of many layers of non-linear processing units for feature extraction and transformation, which is a promising method for detecting attacks in social networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deep Learning based Multi-channel intelligent attack detection for Data Security</head><p>Motivated by the excellent performance of long short term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNNs) in natural language processing and speech recognition in recent years, we propose a novel attack detection method based on LSTM-RNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, which consists of data preprocessing, feature abstraction and multi-channel training and attack detection. The multi-channel attack detection framework provides multi-channel classifiers based on LSTM-RNN and achieves high detection accuracy and better performance comparing with other methods. We train the model by using the NSL-KDD training dataset and evaluate the performance on the test dataset. By analyzing the experimental results, we find an optimal hyper-parameter for LSTM-RNNs and confirm the detection rate and false alarm rate.</p><p>The contributions of this work are summarized as follows:</p><p>1. We propose a multi-channel attack detection method for information security in social networks based on deep learning. To our best knowledge, it is the first time to use a multi-channel detection method based on deep learning to solve the problem of attack detection in social networks.</p><p>2. We further propose a voting algorithm to determine whether the traffic is an attack or not, which achieves high accuracy by voting to get the majority result of the multi-channel classifiers.</p><p>3. The proposed method is scalable and the selection of neural networks can be changed according to the characteristic of the data features, which makes our method applicable to detect other tasks.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents a brief review of related work. Section III elaborates the proposed attack detection method, including the architectures of LSTM-RNNs. Section IV illustrates the setting of training parameters and the solutions to detect the attacks. Experimental results are reported in Section IV. In Section 0, we conclude this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RELATED WORK</head><p>The attack detection problem is a typical classification problem, which can be effectively solved by machine learning techniques. In the literature, there are some attack detection methods based on machine learning, which make a lot of achievements. Here we only review the works which use machine learning for intrusion detection. J.Shum et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> proposed a feed forward neural network to create an IDS, which uses the back propagation algorithm to train the network. Mukkamala et al. proposed to combine neural networks and SVM to detect intrusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Xue et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed to modify recurrent neural networks for intrusion detection. Besides, Skaruz et al. also applied successfully recurrent neural networks to detect SQL-based attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Maleh et.al <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> proposed a hybrid, lightweight intrusion detection system for sensor networks. Their intrusion detection model takes advantage of cluster-based architecture to reduce energy consumption. The model uses SVM for anomaly detection and a set of signature rules to detect malicious behaviors and provide global lightweight IDS.</p><p>Different from the above one-level classification models, some 2-level classification approaches have also been proposed. One such a work uses Discriminative Multinomial Naive Bayes (DMNB) as the base classifier at the first level and Nominal to Binary supervised filtering at the second level, along with 10-fold cross validation for testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. This work was further extended to use Ensembles of Balanced Nested Dichotomies (END) at the first level and Random Forest (RF) at the second level <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. As expected, this enhancement resulted in an improved detection rate and a lower false positive rate. Another 2-level implementation used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature set reduction and then SVM with Radial Basis kernel for classification, which resulted in high detection accuracy on only the training dataset and full 41 feature set. A reduction in feature set to 23 resulted in even better detection accuracy in some of the attack classes but the overall performance was reduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. The authors improved their work by using information gain to rank the features and then a behavior-based feature selection to reduce the features, which resulted in an improvement in the reported accuracy on the training dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. The detection result of the network intrusion detection system based on machine learning not only depends on the machine learning algorithm but also the using of training data and testing data. Some studies research how to divide the training data and testing data to obtain better detection system. An important work used unsupervised clustering algorithms and found that the performance using only the training data was reduced drastically when testing data was also used <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. A similar implementation using the k-point algorithm resulted in a slightly better detection accuracy and false positive rate when using both training and test datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Although neural network achieved great success in this field, deep learning is another appealing approach, which can obtain better detection accuracy than previous approaches. <ref type="bibr">Kim</ref>  </p></div>

The contribution of the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> was to build a classifier of IDS following a deep learning approach. They found the most suitable optimizer among six optimizes for the Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM RNN) model applied in IDS. Staudemeyer et.al <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> proposed that modelling network traffic as a time series with a supervised learning approach, using known genuine and malicious behaviour, which improved intrusion detection. Roy et.al <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>  In SC, the dataset is divided into k subsets based on sample similarity using cluster centers. In DNN, the features are fed into for intrusion detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>.</p><p>There are also some studies on attack detection using deep learning for a real time environment. Bontemps et.al <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> proposed a real time collective anomaly detection model based on neural network learning and feature operating. In their approach, a LSTM RNN is trained with normal time series data before performing a live prediction for each time step. Paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> presented an application-based model for classifying and identifying attacks in a communication network, which guarantees its safety from HTTP protocol-based malicious commands. The proposed model is based on a recurrent neural network architecture, which is suitable to work online and analyze non-linear patterns in real time. Alrawashdeh et.al <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> proposed a deep learning approach for anomaly detection using a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and a deep belief network. Their method used an one-hidden layer RBM to perform unsupervised feature reduction. The resulting weights from this RBM were passed to another RBM producing a deep belief network.</p><p>In the field of industrial control system and cloud computing, some researchers also try to use deep learning methods to overcome the problem of attack detection. Feng Cheng[ <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>] presented an anomaly detection framework for industrial control systems by proposing a stacked Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network-based softmax classifier. The anomaly detection scheme can achieve higher performance compared to various current state-of-the-art techniques. Li Jin <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> proposed a new attribute-based data sharing scheme suitable for resource-limited users in cloud computing. Huang Z <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref> represented the insight of the protection for date security by formalizing the security notion of non-malleability under selective opening attacks (NM-SO security), and exploring the relations among NM-SO security notions. Abebe AbeshuDiro <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref> proposed a distributed attack detection system by adopting deep learning to enable the detection of attacks in social internet of things. Bo-Wei Chen <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[40]</ref> also tried in the area of behavior identification and intelligent marketing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. THE PROPOSED INTELLIGENT ATTACK DETECTION METHOD</head><p>In this section, we first introduce the architecture of the proposed intelligent attack detection method and then present the detailed training and detection algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Architecture of Intelligent Attack Detection Method</head><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the proposed intelligent attack detection method consists of training and testing phase. There are three steps in training phase including data preprocessing, multi-feature extraction, multi-channel training, and also there three steps in testing phase including data preprocessing, muli-feature extraction and attack detection. The first two steps are the same in the two phases. In the training phase, data preprocessing is a combination of processing steps to provide high-quality data, including data sampling, data cleansing and data dimensionality. Multi-feature extraction is used to extract different types of data feature as vectors. Multi-channel training is used to generate classifiers based on neural networks, which preserves attack features of input vectors and classify the attack from normal data. In the testing phase, after preprocessing and multi-feature extraction input vectors will be put into the multi-channel processing for classifier detection. With the result of the classifier detection, we introduce a voting algorithm to decide if the input test data is an attack or not. These components collaborate with each other and are optimized simultaneously to improve the accuracy of the attack detection.</p><p>Data preprocessing: A preprocessing step is to transform the input data into a matrix format that can be vectorized. The common operations include data sampling, data cleansing and data dimensionality reduction. The processing step is the same during the training and testing phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multi-feature Extraction:</head><p>As the traffic data in the network come from different sources, they usually have different types of features, respectively. The multi-features are assembled by the features extracted in the form of vectors, and assigned to different channels for training. For example, the traffic data of KDD dataset can be categorized into three types of features: basic features, content-based features and traffic-based features. The multi-features named "All type" is composed of basic features, traffic-based features and content-based features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multi-channel training based on neural networks:</head><p>As show in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, each training channel corresponds to a neural network, and then generates classifiers to detect network attacks. The features extracted in the previous step are input for the neural network training. The number of channels is scalable according to the actual application. The selection of neural network should take the characteristic of features into consideration. Considering the traffic data is structured as sequence, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is selected in this paper due to its advantage in sequence modeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attack detection:</head><p>As show in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, each detection channel corresponds to a classifier, and each classifier answers whether the traffic is an attack or not. Then the result is passed to the Vote and Decision, which uses a voting algorithm to decide whether the original traffic is an attack or not. Data preprocessing and feature extraction are necessary before the attack detection phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Neural Network-based Learning and Attack Detection Algorithm</head><p>In social networks the attacks to be modeled are complex with statistical regularities, interactions and characteristics between them. The complexity reflects into an intricate mesh of relationships between the neural network nodes. In classical neural networks, e.g. fully connected multi-layer neural networks, training algorithms try to describe the dependencies of the output from the input. As a well-known model, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is used to train the sequence data. Most attack behaviors are recorded in the form of network flow and logs in social networks. There will be trouble when the conventional RNN is used to train with a long step size, so we choose Long Short Term Memory to address this problem. In the following section, we briefly discuss the formal of RNN and Long Short Term Memory. Then we describe the proposed attack detection algorithm. .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Recurrent Neural Network</head><p>As an extension of a convention feedforward neural network, RNN is widely used in natural language processing. Different from feedforward neural networks, RNN is powerful for modeling sequences by having cyclic connections. We denote an input vector sequence, the hidden vector sequence, and output vector sequence with X, H and Y, respectively.

However, RNN also have problems in the aspect of the vanishing gradient and local optima while training with BPTT algorithm. Bengio et al. addressed the problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[47]</ref>. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is well-suited to learn from experience to classify time series, which is proposed by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[48]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows a single LSTM cell, and the equations to compute the values of three gates and cell state are described as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Long Short Term Memory</head><p>In LSTM, the information flow is controlled by three gates ( , , ) i f o . Firstly, the input gate and the candidate value for the state of the memory cell at time t. Eq. ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) and Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) are showed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">t 1 1 ( ) xi t hi t ci t i i W X W h W C b        , t 1 1</formula><p>tanh( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">t t c xc t c t c c f c i W X W h b       ,</formula><p>By computing Eq.

( ) As Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3</ref> shows, the LSTM-RNN model used in this paper consists of one single LSTM layer followed by a mean pooling and a logistic regression layer. The feature channel provides the sequence </p><formula xml:id="formula_7">xo t ho t co t o o W X W h W C b       ,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H ( , )</head><p>T h h h   . Mean pooling layer produces a representation h by averaging over all time steps. Finally, the output layer produces sequence which is the class label associated with the input sequence. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Training and detection algorithm</head><p>In light of all derivations above, the complete description of the proposed multi-channel training is given in Algorithm 1. The detection algorithm is described by pseudocode given as Algorithm 2.</p><p>Algorithm 2. The proposed algorithm for attack detection 1: Input: feature X extracted from test dataset with labeled information 2: Initialization: 3: for channel = 1  N do 4: Load LSTM-RNN model as a classifier 5: get the result vector R of the classifier 6: end for 7: for r in R do 8: vote to get the majority element v 9: end for 10: return v</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EXPERIMENTS</head><p>To evaluate the performance of the proposed attack detection method, we conduct experimental comparisons against other methods (e.g., Bayesian, SVM, KNN, RBNN, PNN and GRNN). Meanwhile, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we remove the channels in our method and just use one channel for training and detection. The results of all the compared methods are obtained by running the source codes of the original authors with the optimal parameters. Through this section, we use the name of the post-processing method to denote a compared method.</p><p>Following, we use the NSL-KDD dataset to train and test the proposed method. All experiments are carried out in the Tensorflow (v1.2) environment running on a computer with Inter(R) Core(TM) i5-7200U CPU 2.50GHz and an NVIDIA GeForce 920MX GPU. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Datasets for Training and Testing</head><p>As mentioned above, we use the NSL-KDD dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed intelligent attack detection method. The dataset is a benchmark dataset for network intrusion, which is an improved version of the KDD Cup 99 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[49]</ref>. The Dataset contains 125,973 training traffic samples and 22,554 test traffic samples. For training seven weeks of network traffics were collected in the form of raw tcpdump format, and the following two weeks of network traffics were also collected for testing. To make the attack detection task realistic, there are many attacks that did not appear during the collection phase of training data. Attacks fall into four main categories according to their characteristic: DOS, U2R, R2L, Probe. The details of the category are described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref>.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref>, we generate 3 datasets for the corresponding channels for training and test. The division of data features is the same as Hee-su Chae described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[50]</ref>   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Model Initialization</head><p>In the training and detection channels the model is the unified LSTM-RNN, which consists of one single LSTM layer, a mean pooling and a logistic regression layer. We initialize the weights of LSTM-RNN using random numbers in normal distributions and use stochastic gradient descent algorithm. We train LSTM-RNN using a batch size of 128. The learning rate is decayed from 0.1 to 0.0001 when we elevated the impact of learning rate on the performance. .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Experimental Results</head><p>In our experiments, we use Detection Rate (DR) and False Alarm Rate (FAR) as the metrics of attack detection evaluation. The DR signifies a ratio of the attack instances detected by the proposed method. And the FAR signifies a ratio of misclassified normal instances. The performance of a method grows better as the DR increases and FAR decreases. Equations of the metrics are as follows: For the proposed method, we first manually adjust the number of channels by using one single channel to compare the performance with different input features. We trained the model for 10 epochs and the learning rate is decayed from 0.01 to 0.0001. The detection accuracies are provided in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. We can see that the accuracy is in a growing trend as the learning rate is increased. And the result of using one single channel is obviously different when input feature differs. The detection accuracy is higher when using basic feature and traffic-based feature. According to the results above, we set the hyper-parameters for training the LSTM-RNNs. For testing purpose, input for the proposed method is the same as described in the beginning of this Section. We compare the DR, FAR and Accuracy of the proposed method with the compared method <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. Generalized regression neural network(GRNN) has a input layer, a radial basis layer and a special linear layer, which uses Normal Distribution as the probability density function. Probabilistic neural network(PNN) has four layers: a input layer, pattern layer, a summation layer and an output layer. Radial basis neural network(RBNN) has an input layer, a hidden layer and a linear output layer. Also the classic algorithms are selected including K-Nearest neighbors algorithm(KNN), Supported Vector Machine(SVM) and Bayesian for comparisons. The comparison results for all test datasets are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we propose an effective end-to-end intelligent attack detection method in social networks based on neural networks, which consists of data preprocessing, feature abstraction and multi-channel training and detection. To preserve attack features of input traffic data, LSTM-RNN is introduced in multi-channel processing to generate classifiers, which is used to classify the attack from normal traffic. These LSTM-RNNs are trained using a unified optimization method. By introducing a voting algorithm to determine whether the input data is an attack or not, the method achieves better accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed intelligent attack detection method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our work indicates that the performance of the proposed intelligent attack detection method can be significantly improved by deep learning methods, which will inspire other researchers to design better deep neural networks for intelligent attack detection along this orientation. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
