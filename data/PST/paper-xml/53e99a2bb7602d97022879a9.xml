<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Since the development of resource-bounded measure in 1991 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the investigation of the internal, measure-theoretic structure of complexity classes has produced a rapidly growing body of new insights and results. As indicated by the survey papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, this line of inquiry has shed light on a wide variety of topics in computational complexity. The ongoing fruitfulness of this research is not surprising because resource-bounded measure is a complexity-theoretic generalization of classical Lebesgue measure, which was one of the most powerful quantitative tools of twentiethcentury mathematics.</p><p>In spite of this power, there are certain inherent limitations to the amount of quantitative information that resource-bounded measure can provide in computational complexity. One of these limitation arises from the resource-bounded Kolmogorov zero-one law, which was proven by Lutz <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and has recently been strengthened by Dai <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. For any class C in which resourcebounded measure is de ned, and for any set X of languages that is | like most sets of interest in computational complexity | closed under nite variations, the zero-one law says that the measure of X in C must be 0 or 1 or unde ned. A second limitation arises from the simple fact that even a measure 0 subset of a complexity class may have internal structure that we would like to elucidate quantitatively. Of course both these limitations were already present in classical Lesbesgue measure theory.</p><p>In 1919, Hausdor <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> augmented classical Lesbesgue measure theory with a theory of dimension. This theory assigns to every subset X of a given metric space a real number dim H (X), which is now called the Hausdor dimension of X. In this paper, we are interested in the case where the metric space is the Cantor space C, consisting of all decision problems (i.e., all languages A f0; 1g ). In this case the Hausdor dimension of a set X C (which is de ned precisely in section 3) is a real number dim H (X) 2 [0; 1]. The Hausdor dimension is monotone, with dim H (;) = 0 and dim H (C) = 1. Moreover, if dim H (X) &lt; dim H (C), then X is a measure 0 subset of C. Hausdor dimension thus overcomes both of the limitations mentioned in the preceding paragraph.</p><p>In this paper we develop resource-bounded dimension, which is a complexity-theoretic generalization of classical Hausdor dimension. We carry out this generalization in two steps. We rst prove a new characterization of classical Hausdor dimension in terms of gales, which are a natural generalization of the martingales that are the basis of resource-bounded measure. (Our characterization can be regarded as an analog of Ville's martingale characterization of the Lesbesgue measure 0 sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.) We then generalize classical dimension by introducing a resource bound (a parameter of the theory) and requiring the gales to be -computable. We show that this induces a well-behaved notion of dimension in the corresponding class R( ), which is de ned exactly as in resource-bounded measure. We write dim(X j R( )) for the dimension of the set X in the class R( ). If is unrestricted, then R( ) = C and dim(X j R( )) = dim(X j C) is precisely dim H (X). However, other choices of allow R( ) to be interesting complexity classes, in which case dim(X j R( )) is a quantitative measure of the dimension of X \ R( ) as a subset of R( ).</p><p>After presenting the elements of resource-bounded dimension, we present two preliminary applications of the theory. First, for each real number 2 [0; 1], let FREQ( ) be the set of all languages that asymptotically contain at most of all strings. (This set is de ned precisely in section 5.) We prove that, for every real number 2 [0; 1  2 ], dim(FREQ(</p><p>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">j E) = H( ) and dim(FREQ( ) j E 2 ) = H( ) ;</formula><p>where E = DTIME(2 linear ), E 2 = DTIME(2 poly ), and H is the binary entropy function of Shannon information theory.</p><p>Our second application concerns Boolean circuit-size complexity in the complexity class ESPACE = DSPACE(2 linear ). For each real number 2 [0; 1], let SIZE( 2 n n ) be the set of all languages that can be decided by Boolean circuits consisting of at most 2 n n gates. We prove that for all</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">2 [0; 1], dim(SIZE( 2 n n ) j ESPACE) = :</formula><p>These applications are interesting because they show that resource-bounded dimension interacts informatively with information theory and Boolean circuit-size complexity. However, they are clearly only the beginning. Classical Hausdor dimension is a sophisticated mathematical theory that has emerged as one of the most important tools for the investigation of fractal sets. (See, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for a good introduction and overview.) Many sets of interest in computational complexity seem to have \fractal-like" structures. Resource-bounded dimension will be a useful tool for the study of such sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Preliminaries</head><p>A decision problem (a.k.a. language) is a set A f0; 1g . We identify each language with its characteristic sequence [[s</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">0 2 A]][[s 1 2 A]][[s 2 2 A]]</formula><p>, where s 0 ; s 1 ; s 2 ; : : : is the standard enumer-ation of f0; 1g and [[ ]] = if then 1 else 0. We write A[i::j] for the string consisting of the i-th through j-th bits of (the characteristic sequence of) A. The Cantor space C is the set of all decision problems. If w 2 f0; 1g and x 2 f0; 1g [ C, then w v x means that w is a pre x of x, and w &lt;</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">6 =</formula><p>x means that w is a proper pre x of x.

All logarithms in this paper are base 2.</p><p>For each i 2 N we de ne a class G i of functions from N into N as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">G 0 = ff j (9k)(8 1 n)f (n) kng G i+1 = 2 G i (log n) = ff j (9g 2 G i )(8 1 n)f (n) 2 g(log n) g</formula><p>We also de ne the functions ĝi 2 G i by ĝ0 (n) = 2n, ĝi+1 (n) = 2 ĝi (log n) . We regard the functions in these classes as growth rates. In particular, G 0 contains the linearly bounded growth rates and G 1 contains the polynomially bounded growth rates. It is easy to show that each</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">G i is closed under composition, that each f 2 G i is o(ĝ i+1</formula><p>), and that each ĝi is o(2 n ). Thus G i contains superpolynomial growth rates for all i &gt; 1, but all growth rates in the G i -hierarchy are subexponential.</p><p>Within the class DEC of all decidable languages, we are interested in the exponential com-</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">plexity classes E i = DTIME(2 G i 1 ) and E i SPACE = DSPACE(2 G i 1 ) for i 1.

The result of a constructor (i.e., the language constructed by ) is the unique language R( ) such that n ( ) v R( ) for all n 2 N. Intuitively, constructs R( ) by starting with and then iteratively generating successively longer pre xes of R( ). We write R( ) for the set of languages R( ) such that is a constructor in . The following facts are the reason for our interest in the above-de ned classes of functions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">R(all) = C. R(comp) = DEC. For i 1, R(p i )=E i .
