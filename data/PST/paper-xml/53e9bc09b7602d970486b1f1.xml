<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Introduction</head><p>T HIS paper presents a general framework for the recovery of piecewise constant signals and images using a combination of variational methods and wavelet analysis. The variational formulation of the problem allows us to build the properties of the recovered signal directly into the analytical machinery. The efficient wavelet representation allows us to capture and preserve sharp features in the signal while it evolves in accordance with the variational laws. We consider two applications of the introduced method: bar code deconvolution and image inpainting. Both lie within the same broad research area of signal recovery from incomplete and corrupted data.</p><p>Wavelet analysis has proven invaluable for dealing with a wide class of signals and images with spatially localized features <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Wavelets are designed to capture most of the signal energy using a few wavelet coefficients. This property has been leveraged into powerful, spatially adaptive, signal estimation algorithms that are based on simply shrinking the wavelet coefficients of the noisy signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ch.4</ref>], <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Discrete wavelet transforms allow for fast implementation of linear wavelet methods. At the same time, methods utilizing nonlinear operations in the wavelet domain accomplish tasks which are not possible for traditional linear/Fourier approaches to such problems as wavelet denoising, linear inverse problems, nonlinear wavelet packet approximation and nonlinear multiresolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Overall, the ability to capture sharp signal discontinuities within relatively sparse coefficient data makes wavelets convenient structural elements of discrete image analysis.</p><p>Manuscript received <ref type="bibr">July 10, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">revised</ref>  <ref type="bibr">January 9, 2008</ref>.

The seminal methods of Rudin-Osher-Fatemi <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and Perona-Malik <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> for image denoising led to a vast body of work on variational techniques for image understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Similarities between image topology issues and phase transitions in material science and fluid mechanics motivated the integration of diffuse interface models into image processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. These techniques are generally based on the phase-field model of Modica and Mortola <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and allow for topology transition between two states of a physical system. In general, nonlinear diffusion models allow the inclusion of a priori knowledge to ensure regularity while preserving important features including edges <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Anisotropic diffusion filters provide the advantage of combining image regularization with edge enhancement properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. As a result, diffusion-based methods have been extensively used in image analysis. The diffuse-interface methods appear both as self-contained techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and as tools for approximating the total variation functional (TV), used in a variety of image processing problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Variational wavelet methods were used for image inpainting, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> discusses the TV minimization in the wavelet domain, that successfully reproduces lost coefficients. A related work <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> describes an algorithm for filling in holes in overlapping texture and cartoon image layers by a direct extension of sparse representation based image decomposition method called MCA (morphological component analysis). The relationship between wavelet-based image processing algorithms and variational problems in general is analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Our method is qualitatively different, as it simultaneously imposes the wavelet-domain regularity and the spatial data consistency. It recovers and retains high frequency components without any prior texture-cartoon decomposition, within a unified procedure. The philosophy of our approach promotes looking for new types of nondifferential (pseudo-differential) energy functionals, that inherit important properties of the TV, but leave out the computational drawbacks associated with the discrete differentiation.</p><p>The key idea in this paper combines the basic geometric framework of diffuse interface methods with the nonlocality of wavelets. Wavelet based functionals are inherently multiscale and take advantage of simultaneous space and frequency localization. The main points of the algorithm are as follows.</p><p>• Eliminate blurry edges: The edge sharpness is not restricted by the diffuse interface scale as in the case of PDE methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Our approach is to take the Ginzburg-Landau energy functional <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, but replace differential operators with pseudo-differential ones that have eigen-functions that better suit the problem. Wavelet basis functions are natural candidates due to their localized structure and ability to represent images efficiently.</p><p>• Preserve the usage of fast solvers: One advantage of PDE variational techniques is the usage of FFT. Respectively, in the wavelet-based technique, one can employ the discrete wavelet transform to speed up the method. • Design a technology that does not require PDE solving (thus making the technique accessible for nonmath specialists). Wavelet techniques are common in signal processing making them a good candidate for implementation by developers unfamiliar with PDEs. There exists a well-developed theory for wavelet decomposition. • Create a technique that can be easily extended from binary images to grayscale. Our idea is to take a relatively simple PDE model and adapt it to a wavelet basis. The TV seminorm was proven to be a natural and efficient measure of image regularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. To avoid computational challenges related to equations for minimizers of this norm, we reformulate the problem using the phase-field method and approximate the TV functional (in the sense). The Ginzburg-Landau functional [10, Ch. 7], <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> (1) is a diffuse interface approximation to the TV functional in the case of binary images <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Several efficient algorithms for deconvolution and image inpainting have been proposed, using this functional as the primary regularizer for the solution of an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we replace with a wavelet-based semi-norm, with the goal of removing the "fuzzy" diffuse interface features associated with the methods described above. By characterizing signal regularity in terms of the decay of wavelet coefficients via a Besov semi-norm (see, for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>), we are able to construct a method with similar properties to the PDE-based methods but without -scale blur.</p><p>The key new idea of our method is to construct an operator, called the "wavelet Laplacian" which has wavelet basis functions as eigenfunctions, and acts on them in the same "scale-proportional" manner as the Laplace operator does on the Fourier basis. Such a construction diagonalizes the operator in the wavelet basis. While the Laplace equation can be treated as the Euler-Lagrange equation for the minimizers of let us define the "wavelet Laplacian" in a similar context. Given an orthonormal wavelet basis define for any function</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(2)</formula><p>Then the equation is a "gradient descent equation" corresponding to the problem of minimizing the following "weighted energy" functional:</p><p>(3) This expression is a square of the Besov 1-2-2 semi-norm [10, Ch.3], [23, Ch.9] if is smooth. For most examples in this paper, we choose the compactly supported, piecewise constant Haar wavelet to generate , due to its resemblance to a sharp interface jump. We will denote regardless of the choice of basis in all formulas. At the end of this paper, we show an example using the Daubechies-4 wavelet <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Prior Results on the Deconvolution of Barcodes</head><p>The idea is inspired by Esedoglu's variational algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> of recovering the original barcode by the output of a scanner with (partially) unknown parameters. The process of scanning is modeled as a convolution of an uknown binary (black and white) barcode signal, with some Gaussian kernel The amplitude (distance to the scanned surface) can be treated either as estimated a priori, or unknown; the standard deviation (width of the scanning window) is always treated as unknown, as this parameter is much harder to estimate in practice. The known data, i.e., the scanner output, is assumed to be of the form . To deconvolve, the author <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> uses a variational approach by minimizing the energy functional (4)</p><p>The first two terms of the energy functional in (4) represent a diffuse-interface approximation (in the sense <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>) for the widely used TV functional <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The algorithm proceeds by computing a minimum of the energy using gradient flow methods (applied to all unknown parameters and the minimizer itself).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Blind Deconvolution Using the Wavelet Operator</head><p>As discussed in Section I-A, we revise (4) by exchanging the Fourier basis for the Haar wavelet basis (for the convenience of notation, some coefficients were divided by 2). The gradient descent equation for the minimizer is We discretize in time using the gradient stable convexity splitting scheme as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> Here, and are chosen so that and are, indeed, convex.</p><p>Remark: The system of inequalities where is an a priori estimate for all time, provides a sufficient condition for the convex energy splitting. It guarantees the gradient stability of the associated numerical scheme.</p><p>This can be proved by straightforward estimates of the second variation of each energy term.</p><p>The numerical scheme follows:</p><p>(5)</p><p>The left-hand side of ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) is actually a diagonal matrix applied to the vector of wavelet coefficients. Thus, can be easily computed by first explicitly computing the right hand side and then inverting the operator on the left hand side in the wavelet domain. The meaning the wavelet Laplacian in the discrete scheme identical to the original definition (2). Indeed, is applied directly to the discrete wavelet coefficients of the signal, bypassing the nature of the signal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Examples of Deconvolved Barcodes</head><p>The deconvolution problem was solved numerically using the described scheme. We compare the new method with the algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Results obtained for the same set of scanning parameters show some practical advantages of the wavelet algorithm: assuming the amplitude is known, our method recovers a sharper barcode. To compare how well both methods perform in pure signal deconvolution (apart from dealing with the unknown parameters), we consider the barcode recovery from scanning data with known and in the presence of noise-Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>We consider the same sample barcode as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The unknown parameter is successfully determined for the same range of values as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Namely, the blind recovery of the barcode sample used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> is successful for assuming one uses the same setting: the barcode is supported on the interval , the width of the smallest "bar element" is several times less than the "scanning width" .</p><p>The difference with the original experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> lies in the way one treats the scanned signal: instead of taking the full  number of scanned pixels (1024), we split the signal into parts which we recover separately. This simplification helps the algorithm to withstand much higher noise levels (SNR <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> equals 5-7 dB). However, the method is equally successful when applied to the full length signal for larger SNR.</p><p>Another advantage of the splitting approach is the ability to determine faster by deconvolving only a piece of the signal, and to recover subsequent signal parts with known .</p><p>In the 1-D case, we use the standard fast discrete wavelet transform. Our algorithm performance is 0.0125 s per iteration. Recovering the barcode of length 256 with unknown requires about 250 iterations to determine and less than 100 iterations to refine the resulting barcode. In the example below (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) was recovered as in the presence of noise with (dB) = 5.9. The reconstructed bar code matches the original one up to the maximum edge shift of 1 pixel.</p><p>The process of the barcode recovery is split into two stages. The first stage starts with a large fidelity coefficient , the evolution is continued until the parameter stabilizes at some value with sufficient precision-see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (third graph). This stopping criterion is convenient since the switching can be performed automatically. At this point, the value of is assumed to be recovered, and is treated as known. Meanwhile, extrema of the recovered signal become easily distinguishable with stable positions.</p><p>The second stage includes evolution of the signal with the known value of . The fidelity coefficient is taken to be , and the diffuse interface dynamics has the most influence. As a result, the very roughly shaped barcode obtained at the first stage becomes binary-as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (fourth graph).</p><p>For the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, one has a serious time restriction coming from the completely explicit numerical scheme for the scanning width . Adaptive stepping allows to speed up the process. However, at least 200 iterations are needed to perform the recovery of a signal 256 units long with a known value of . Naturally, more iterations are needed for blind deconvolution.</p><p>The speed of both algorithms applied to a 256 units long signal are given below (all operations not related to the PDE/ wavelet change are performed in an identical manner). Those tests were performed by running the Matlab code on a laptop with CPU specifications: Intel Pentium M, 1.73 GHz, 504 MB of RAM:</p><p>As opposed to the wavelet version, the efficiency of the PDE algorithm depends on the choice of parameters and the starting value of . Those factors can influence the length of the recovery process and even its success. For "untuned" parameters the PDE method can produce artifacts, like false bars, or fail to recover the true . For the case of the wavelet recovery, the starting value of is not crucial, as long as it has the same order of magnitude. Overall, the wavelet method tends to be more tolerant to parameter inconsistencies.</p><p>The method directly generalizes to 2-D barcodes. The important practical difference lies in the necessity to use the shift-invariant stationary wavelet transform instead of the standard nonredundant method in 2-D, because of undesirable artifacts the latter produces. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows a random combination of black and white squares of size 4, serving as a 32 32 pixels barcode piece, the scanner output with unknown (originally ), followed by its perfect recovery. This technique is easily adapted to any rectangular-based bar codes by building the rescaling parameters into the convolution kernel. Moreover, it makes sense to remove all elements of the scale smaller than that of the barcode building element (i.e., to set the Haar basis coefficients of the finest level to be equal to zero). This operation increases the precision of signal recovery and enhances sharp edges in the final output. Without removing the last levels the deconvolution stays perfect for smaller values of and lower noise. We could recover the value of in the same manner as in 1-D and with the same precision, but numerical computations take significantly longer due to the need for the redundant wavelet transform. However, if we use a substitute value of , smaller than the true but of the same order of magnitude, it is equivalent to adding more noise to the scanner output. If the algorithm works efficiently with much lower signal to noise ratios, then the substitution of does not influence the recovery output.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. WAVELET-BASED IMAGE INPAINTING</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Prior Results in Image Inpainting</head><p>The notion of digital image inpainting using nonlinear PDEs appeared in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, where the authors introduced a novel technique based on a third-order nonlinear equation. Chan and Shen <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> adapted efficient variational denoising and segmentation models to the inpainting task by localizing the support of the forcing term inside the complement of the inpainting region. Consequent work by Esedoglu and Shen <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> uses this idea to convert the Mumford-Shah segmentation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> to an inpainting technique.</p><p>Our work builds on a recent phase-field approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. It describes a model for inpainting binary images using a modified Cahn-Hilliard equation (the classical CH equation is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>) which has a number of applications for high contrast images, including inpainting of degraded text, super-resolution of images, and continuation of roads on aerial photographs. The model has two scales, the diffuse interface scale, on which it can accomplish topological transitions, and the feature scale of the image.</p><p>We remark that wavelets appeared in the context of variational image inpainting in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and more. The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> consider missing or damaged regions in the wavelet domain, instead of the pixel domain. This model has shown itself to be very efficient in reconstructing the true signal from lossy wavelet data using a TV norm in the image domain. Nevertheless, it becomes less applicable when the actual damage has occurred in the spatial domain (and the lost and true information is defined spatially). The variational formulation of some traditional wavelet-based image processing algorithms is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Having in mind the advantages of Cahn-Hilliard model, we keep the same general form of the energy functional and replace differential operators by pseudo-differential wavelet operators. Despite the gains made by the CH inpainting method, the presence of the diffuse interface scale introduces a longer timescale into the computation and results in local blurring of edges. Both of these issues can be addressed by the ideas described in the previous section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Essential Idea of the Wavelet Allen-Cahn (Wac) Inpainting Method</head><p>Rather than working with the full CH model <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, we adapt a simple inpainting model based on the second-order Allen-Cahn equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Adding the inpainting fidelity term completes the energy construction where is a double-well potential, is a "known" domain in and . The corresponding gradient descent equation is Evolving this forward in time, and running to steady state, gives a solution to the inpainting problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Numerical Implementation</head><p>We describe a possible approach to the numerical implementation, which, as in the barcode problem, uses the convexity splitting method analogous to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Our scheme is <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> Remark: The numerical scheme ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) is unconditionally stable whenever parameters satisfy:</p><p>where is an a priori bound that holds for all time.</p><p>As in the barcode case, the formal meaning of the wavelet Laplacian in ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) is identical to the original definition. However, the set of wavelet coefficients to which we apply , depends on how one defines the discrete wavelet transform on a finite interval. The classic <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> discrete wavelet transform (DWT) achieves plausible reconstruction only in the case of images with edges located at some coarse level of the dyadic grid. However, in the general case, it can produce energy minima with artifacts previously observed in image denoising (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>).</p><p>The stationary wavelet transform (SWT) gives a perfect solution to this problem. With the use of redundant representation and averaging, effects of being "too discrete" are eliminated, and the dynamics of the solution looks similar to the PDE simulation. The cost of these improvements is more memory and time required. One way to address this is to simplify the SWT algorithm by storing fewer variants of coefficients and using less averaging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Examples of the Wavelet Inpainting</head><p>We compare our results with those of Cahn-Hilliard inpainting. As was described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, Cahn-Hilliard inpainting works the best in a two-step procedure: the first part connects pieces of the picture roughly, using a large interface width , the second part refines the details with after the major "energy redistribution" was done.  The wavelet algorithm can have a similar design, allowing gradual "zooming" to details of smaller and smaller scale. Since puts restrictions on the maximum level of decomposition the minimizer can have, finding a steady state for a coarser scale followed by refinement allows to reconstruct "optimal" details on each subsequent wavelet level. However, it suffices to use an intermediate value of to achieve both reconnection and refinement for most images having reasonable resolution.</p><p>The following examples (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) show the typical numerical output for inpainting based on the wavelet energy. The left hand image in each picture shows the given part of the true image, with the gray area covering the missing region, , and also serves as the initial condition when running the simulation. The right hand image is the result of inpainting, i.e., the steady state of a respective equation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inpainting of simple shapes</head><p>If the missing region is comprised of relatively thin and "spread out" pieces, there is no need to run the simulation for several values of the interface parameter , because the length of pieces that need to be connected is comparable to the dominating image scale. In the example shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, was kept constant until the steady state was reached after about 150 iterations.</p><p>The best performance is obtained with a good initial condition. One can be obtained using a standard linear extrapolation inside the unknown area. However, such minor change of initial condition does not have much influence in PDE based inpainting. As a result, the number of iterations needed to inpaint the same image for the wavelet method becomes 5-10 times less than for the PDE technique. Indeed, the difference in the number of iterations performed by each algorithm is noticeable. There is a technical obstacle that prevents the wavelet method from becoming much faster than PDE inpainting: the discrete implementation of the stationary wavelet transform in Matlab requires much more time than the fast Fourier transform. Indeed, the wavelet solver SWT implementing the " trous" algorithm for the undecimated wavelet transform performs operations over an N-element signal, while FFT-the standard fast Fourier algorithm-needs only operations. As a result, the wavelet method needs more time per iteration than the Cahn-Hilliard PDE simulation: Nevertheless, the wavelet method overperforms PDEs if it reaches the steady state after a factor of 15 fewer iterations than Cahn-Hilliard simulation. The above table estimates the speed of our method based on the Haar wavelet, which is technically one of the slowest. Choosing the Daubechies-4 wavelet instead, we can decrease the CPU time per ten iterations at least by a factor of two.</p><p>An additional idea that can speed up computations is the adaptive choice of the level of decomposition. In case the missing region has relatively small scale, it suffices to change only fine and medium details of the image (presumably, the main part of the image is present and the energy balance of the coarsest levels is preserved).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grayscale image inpainting</head><p>To generalize the solution of the inpainting problem to the grayscale case, let us split the signal bit-wise into channels Here, denotes the th component ("digit") in the binary representation of the signal, is the number of bits, and for any . In such a manner, the problem gets reduced to dyadic inpainting problems, where each fidelity term is obtained as a respective component of the known part of the image, i.e., there is absolutely no interaction between channels after they are separated in the given image and before the inpainted image is synthesized from them. We give two samples of grayscale inpainting. The occlusion removal on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, where the image has less quality and more distinct color transitions, was performed using Haar wavelet. The tiger image in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> with 256 gray levels was recovered using Daubechies-4 wavelet, with higher level of regularity and better "stripe-connecting" properties.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Road inpainting</head><p>The described technique can be utilized to perform specialized inpainting: for instance, to follow roads in aerial photos with possible defects and occlusions. In our example of the road inpainting [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9(a)</ref>] the missing area is determined by thresholding the image and treating all pixels with low intensity as unknown [black area in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>(b)] However, occlusions could be detected by other methods, e.g., using multispectral data to identify occluded regions of a photo.</p><p>As the objective of inpainting is the road recovery, the first (highest intensity) bit of the image is prioritized as the "leading channel" and treated separately. To create the predisposition for broken road connection without merging distinct neighboring roads, we choose the maximum distance R allowed between the segments of the same road (12 pixels). Let V be the set of the initially visible road parts [the white area in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8(a)</ref>]. On the first stage of the leading channel recovery we assume the unknown area to be the R-pixel neighborhood of V excluding V itself [the gray area in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

After performing the binary inpainting, we get an intermediate solution such that supp is a connected road covering [white area in Fig. 8(b)], nevertheless too wide to determine the precise road location. On the second stage, we refine the unknown area [the gray area in Fig. 8(c)] and repeat the binary inpainting. The output represents the recovered leading channel [Fig. 8(d)]. Other bit channels are recovered by usual binary inpainting with unknown area as in Fig. 9(b).</figDesc></figure>
