<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Clustering techniques have emerged as a popular choice for achieving energy efficiency and scalable performance in large scale sensor networks. Cluster formation is a process whereby sensor nodes decide which cluster head they should associate with among multiple choices. Typically this cluster head selection decision involves a metric based on parameters including residual energy and distance to the cluster head. This decision is a critical embarkation point as a poor choice can lead to increased energy consumption, thus compromising network lifetime. In this paper we present a novel energy efficient cluster formation algorithm based on a multi-criterion optimization technique. Our technique is capable of using multiple individual metrics in the cluster head selection process as input while simultaneously optimizing on the energy efficiency of the individual sensor nodes as well as the overall system. The proposed technique is implemented as a distributed protocol in which each node makes its decision based on local information only. The feasibility of the proposed technique is demonstrated with simulation results. It is shown that the proposed technique outperforms all other well known protocols including LEACH, EECS and HEED resulting in a significant increase in network life.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have emerged as the-stateof-the-art technology in gathering data from remote locations by interacting with physical phenomena and relying on collaborative efforts by large numbers of low cost devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Typically, a WSN comprises of hundreds or thousands of low cost sensor nodes. Each sensor node has an embedded processor, a wireless interface for communication, a non replenish-able source of energy, and one or more on-board sensors such as temperature, humidity, motion, speed, photo, and piezoelectric detectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Once deployed, sensor nodes collect the information of interest from their on-board sensors, performs local processing of these data including quantization and compression, and forward the data to a base station (BS) directly or through a neighbouring relay node. The ability to have direct interaction with physical phenomena resulted in the development of a vast number of applications for wireless sensor networks such as, military, commercial, intrusion detection and industrial, healthcare and disaster and rescue operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Most deployments of WSNs require unattended operation; therefore, sensor nodes have to rely on batteries for communication and information gathering. Sensor nodes are significantly constrained in available resources including storage, computational capacity, however energy accounts for the most restrictive of all factors because it affects the operational lifetime of WSN. It is a well established fact <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> that wireless communication is the major source of energy drainage in WSN. Therefore, energy efficient communication protocols and topology architectures are highly desirable. In recent years clustering has emerged as a popular approach for organizing the network into a connected hierarchy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. By using clustering, nodes are organized into small disjoint groups called clusters. Each cluster has a coordinator referred to as cluster head (CH) and a number of member nodes. Clustering results in a hierarchical network in which CHs form the upper level and member nodes form the lower level. In contrast to flat architectures, clustering provides distinct advantages with respect to energy conservation by facilitating localized control and reducing the volume of inter-node communication. Moreover, the coordination provided by the CH allows sensor nodes to sleep for extended period thus allowing significant energy savings. Despite many advantages of clustering in WSNs such as network scalability, localized route set up, bandwidth management, the fundamental objective centers around energy conservation.</p><p>Cluster formation is a process whereby sensor nodes decide with which CH they should associate among multiple choices. After the CHs are elected, the non-CH nodes are faced with the task of selecting a CH from a number of possible candidates based on the criterion of optimal energy use. For a sensor node, selecting the CH based on a single objective can lead to poor energy use because the nearest CH may be located at a greater distance from base station than the other CHs. Thus for that particular node this may not be the best choice. In addition, factors like residual energy and node degree may also be of importance when making a decision. For example, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, a sensor node i receives advertisement messages form three different CHs A, B and C. The parameters important to the choice of CH are included in the advertisement message.</p><p>If node i were to make a decision based on a single parameter it could result in a bad choice over all. For example selecting based on highest residual energy will lead to choice A which is at a greater distance from the base station as compared to B and C, thus resulting in more energy expenditure. Similarly making a choice based on shortest distance from self results in B which has the least residual energy. Hence, when a node makes a decision about associating with the CH, it is necessary that as many parameters of local and global significance as possible should be considered. This premise forms the basis of the work in this paper when tackling the multiple criteria that influence energy efficiency. We use a multi-criterion optimization technique in this decision process to minimize the energy used both in control and data transmission phases.</p><p>Multi-criterion optimization (MCOP) or multi-objective decision making is an engineering design method used in large scale complex systems to optimize the efficiency of several subsystems <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Typically, MCOP deals with problems that have several conflicting and possibly non-commensurable criteria which should be simultaneously optimized. The solutions to such problems find their roots in techniques involving linear programming, objective functions and Pareto optimality. Here MCOP is used in a novel fashion in a cluster formation scheme for WSNs. The motivation behind the MCOP-based cluster formation technique is to maximize network lifetime by selecting the best CH for a group of sensor nodes by considering multiple criteria such as distance of node to the CH, distance between CH and sink and residual energy.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of related work. Section 3 outlines the assumption for the network model. Section 4 presents the CH election process followed by a description of message types in Section 5. Our multicriterion optimization technique is presented in Section 6. Section 7 presents results of energy consumption based on the mathematical model. Simulation results are presented in Section 8. Finally, the main conclusions and directions for future research are presented in Section 9.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work</head><p>In recent years clustering for ad hoc and WSNs have been a popular area of research and several algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> have been proposed. These techniques can be classified in a number of ways such as clustering method (distributed, centralized), network architecture (single-hop, multi-hop), clustering objective (energy efficiency, coverage) or CH selection method (random, deterministic). Since our technique focuses on single-hop clustering, we limit our discussion only to such <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> techniques.</p><p>The Low-energy Adaptive Cluster Hierarchy (LEACH) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> was proposed by W. Heinzelman et al. as a single-hop self organized clustering algorithm for wireless sensor networks. In LEACH protocol, periodically, every sensor node elects itself as CH with some probability and broadcasts its decision. The remaining sensor nodes receive the broadcast from one or more CHs and make their association decision based on minimum communication cost. Since the role of CH requires more handling of data than non-CH nodes a CH's energy is dissipated at higher rate than ordinary sensor nodes. To balance the over all energy consumption across the network the role of the CH is rotated among all sensors. The LEACH protocol is energy-efficient but the expected number of clusters is pre-defined. Another disadvantage of LEACH is that it does not guarantee good CH distribution and assumes uniform energy consumption for CHs. The Hybrid Energy Efficient Distributed Protocol (HEED) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> forms single-hop clusters without the size and density of the sensor network being known. In HEED the CH election process is performed using a hybrid metric consisting of residual energy and communication cost. The primary parameter is residual energy and the secondary parameter to break ties is the average minimum reachability power (AMRP). The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> proposed a distributed weight-based energy efficient hierarchical clustering protocol (DWEHC). The DWEHC protocol was primarily aimed at improving HEED by producing non-overlapping balanced size clusters. Both HEED and DWEHC share some similarities including no assumptions about network size and density, and considering residual energy in the CH election process. Despite achieving an overall good CH distribution HEED suffers from some drawbacks. The use of tentative-CHs that do not become final-CHs leave some orphaned (uncovered) nodes. As per HEED implementation, these nodes are forced to become a CH. These forced-CHs may be in range of other CHs or may not have any member associated with them. As a result, more CHs are generated than the expected number and this also accounts for unbalanced energy consumption in the network. Moreover, the iterative nature in both HEED and DWEHC produces a relatively high control message overhead compared to other protocols. Fast Local Clustering (FLOC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> produces non-overlapping and approximately equal sized clusters. The clustering is such that all nodes within one hop from a CH belong to its cluster, and no node m hops away from the CH may belong to its cluster.</p><p>Our work is closely related to the Energy Efficient Clustering Scheme (EECS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> presented by Mao Ye et al. which takes into account the unbalanced energy dissipation. In EECS, during the cluster formation phase nodes decide to associate with a CH based on a weighted cost factor that is composed of three functions. A slightly modified version of the EECS is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> as energy efficient unequal clustering (EEUC). Although EECS has identified an important area for improvement by considering more than one parameter for cluster formation, there are few deficiencies in this technique. Each node is required to calculate the cost for all CHs. This implies that not only CHs have to send the advertisement (control packets) at high transmission power to cover the deployment area but also non-CHs nodes maintain global information for all CHs resulting in extra energy wastage. Additionally, the cost function can only contain two parameters and depends on a weight factor 'w' which is not explained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Despite the claims regarding the balanced energy consumption in the network, no results were presented in support. In contrast, our clustering formation scheme is much more flexible in handling the number of parameters used in the decision process. Additionally, the strength of our clustering scheme lies in an optimized cluster formation process which includes many parameters that govern the energy dissipation behavior in the network. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides a comparison of related work with respect to different clustering attributes.</p><p>The following discussion presents an overview of clustering/ topology control schemes that are not directly comparable with our technique. However, a summary is provided in the interest of completeness. Genetic algorithms (GA) have also been used as an alternative approach for energy efficient clustering in WSN. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> use a genetic algorithm to form a number of pre-defined independent clusters which assist in energy efficient communication by reducing the total communication distance. This work was later improved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> using a GA fitness function consisting of multiple parameters including status of sensor, choice of appropriate CH, and choice between two signal ranges from normal sensor node. On similar lines, the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> uses a GA for optimized topology control to balance and minimize energy consumption. Hussain et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> proposed hierarchical GAbased clustering for energy efficient data dissemination. In their work, a hierarchical cluster-based routing protocol (HCR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> is used to determine the number of clusters, clusters heads and the transmission schedule. The BS uses a GA to create energy efficient clusters for a given number of transmissions. The GA-based algorithm demonstrated enhanced network life when compared with LEACH and HCR-based algorithms. More recently, some authors have considered using a virtual backbone for enhanced connectivity, coverage and fault tolerance. In this regard, a k-connected kdominating set is used as a backbone to balance efficiency and fault tolerance. The algorithms proposed by the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> in the context of wireless networks are also applicable to wireless sensor networks. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> present a k-connected clustering scheme for self-healing of CH failure. The technique is based on ''cluster head clique", that is the nearest neighbourhood of the CH within a half transmission radius. In recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, an energy efficient location independent k-connected scheme for topology control was introduced. A k-connected topology is created using an existing clustering protocol. Then a Node Scheduling and Power Control Algorithm (NSPA) is applied to construct a minimum energy graph to obtain a k-connected topology under defined thresholds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">System model and assumptions</head><p>The following assumptions are made for our sensor network:</p><p>1. Nodes are dispersed randomly following a uniform distribution in a 2-dimensional space. 2. The location of the BS is known to all sensors. 3. The BS is considered a powerful node having enhanced communication and computation capabilities with no energy constraints. 4. The nodes are capable of transmitting at variable power levels depending on the distance to the receiver as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. For instance, MICA Motes use the MSP430 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> series micro controller which can be programmed to 31 different power levels. 5. The nodes can estimate the approximate distance by the received signal strength, given that the transmit power level is known, and the communication between nodes in not subject to multi-path fading. 6. A network operation model similar to that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> is adopted here, which consists of rounds. Each round consists of a clustering phase followed by a data collection phase. 7. We assume that the sensor nodes are capable of switching between sleep and active modes. Most commercially available platform such as MICAz [32], TelosB [33], TMote Sky [34] support features such as auto suspend, wake, and sleep mode that are used to minimize the sensor node's energy consumption. 8. The energy model presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> is adopted here. The amount of energy consumed for transmission E Tx , of an l-bit message over a distance d is given by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E Tx ¼ l Á E elect þ l Á e fs Á d 2 for 0 6 d 6 d crossover l Á E elect þ l Á e mp Á d 4 for d P d crossover (<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where E elect is the amount of energy consumed in electronics, e fs is the energy consumed in an amplifier when transmitting at a distance shorter than d crossover , and e mp is the amplifier energy consumed in an amplifier when transmitting at a distance greater than d crossover .</p><p>The energy expended in receiving an l-bit message is given by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">E Rx ¼ lE elect<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>The first six assumptions are very common among sensor networks and are cited in most of the discussions on clustering protocols for data gathering applications including a few well known ones, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. The eighth assumption is also reasonable given that the sensors communicate at a fixed power level. In the model adopted here, it is assumed that the clustering control messages are transmitted using fixed power levels. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Cluster head election</head><p>Cluster head election/selection is a critical phase for any clustering algorithm because CH placement in a sensor deployment region dictates how the system energy is dissipated. Algorithms which select CHs randomly with a certain probability are faced with the challenge of ensuring that the elected CHs are well distributed and cover the deployment region uniformly. For example, in LEACH <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, Heinzalman et al. have proposed a scheme which selects pre-defined K opt number of CHs randomly in order to randomize the distribution of energy consumption and load among the sensors. However, such a selection of CHs results in an uneven distribution of CHs and is not effective for uniform energy dissipation in the network. The EECS <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> protocol produces a good distribution of CHs through an election process using a competition radius and value of K opt adopted from results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. We use a similar procedure; however, we use a different value of K opt from the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, to provide a more accurate estimate for the optimal number of CHs using analytical results from stochastic geometry. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> K opt is given by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">K opt ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi e fs pðe mp d 4 À E elect Þ s Á M ffiffiffi n p<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>where n is the number of nodes and M 2 is the deployment area and d 4 is the fourth power distance to the base station.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Multi-criterion cluster formation</head><p>The core of most clustering algorithms for WSNs employs techniques that attempt to maximize the energy efficiency. In the proposed technique, the prime focus is optimizing the energy usage in cluster formation; i.e. the decision process used by an ordinary sensor node to associate itself with a CH is based on minimum overall communication cost. Many previously proposed clustering algorithms have attempted to exploit this in various ways. For example in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> the sensor nodes select their CH based on strongest signal strength. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> the authors have addressed the problem of unbalanced energy consumption by using a weighted cost function. The cost function takes into account factors such as distance of a node to the BS, distance of node to CH and distance of CH to BS to produce a composite cost metric that load balances the energy consumption. In this work, the problem is addressed by applying the MCOP technique.</p><p>The proposed technique is inspired by preference function modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[35]</ref> which has been successfully used to find an optimal path based on multiple user constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[36]</ref>. The basic idea is to use a preference function proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[35]</ref> which accepts a value from user criterion x and returns a value s(x) scaled between 1 and À1 (1 represents the best and À1 represents the worst value respectively). A decision matrix is built and used to find the optimal choice for a given criterion. The preference vector contains the scaled weighted values for each of the parameters involved in the decision process. The weight matrix is obtained by multiplying the decision matrix with the preference vector to find the weight for each of the available choices. The maximum weight in the weight vector indicates the best choice. The flow chart in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> describes the steps of the cluster formation algorithm. At the beginning of each clustering period all nodes set their state to 'PLAIN'. The timer 'T1' guarantees that the CH contender nodes successfully receive the competition message. Each node computes the probability to become a CH contender. If the computed probability is less than the defined threshold value 'T', it promotes itself to the 'CH_Contender' state and broadcasts a competition message within R compete radius. At the end of this phase there will be approximately (p Â n) CH contenders in the network. After the timer T1 expires, each contender checks if any competition messages were received. If any message was received, it checks if there is a contender with a higher residual energy. If a contender finds a node with a higher residual energy it drops out of the competition. Any ties are broken in favour of the contender with higher id. In the case where the contender does not receive any competition message meaning that there is no other contender in its R compete neighbourhood, it promotes itself to the 'Cluster_Head' state. After the cluster head election process, each elected CH broadcasts a 'CH_ADV_MSG' within R CHADV radius. The advertisement message contains the value of residual energy and CH's distance to the sink. Again, a timer 'T2' ensures that all non-CH nodes successfully receive the advertisement message. Once each node has received the advertisement message from one or more CHs, it will start computing the MCOP cluster formation algorithm.</p><p>The important steps in the whole decision process are building the Options, Decision matrices and the weight vector. A detailed explanation for each of these steps is given below:  </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">. Build OM (k Â n),</formula><p>where k is equal to the number of CHs in node's radio range and n is equal to the number of parameters important to the decision criterion. Each element x i,j in the options matrix represents the jth parameter for the ith CH.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OM ¼</head><p>x </p><p>To elaborate, the rows of the option matrix represent the CHs, which are in a sensor node's radio range. Each element in the ith row represents a parameter important to the decision criterion such as the node's distance to ith CH, distance of the ith CH to base station and residual energy of the ith CH. It is assumed that after election each CH broadcasts its willingness to be a CH in a CH_ADV_MSG message with the information about its distance to base station and residual energy. Nodes record this information for each CH from which they receive the CH_ADV_MSG message and build the options matrix.</p></div>

( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">8</ref>) are unique to each parameter. As an example, for an arbitrary sensor node the best value for residual energy is represented by the maximum value in the column of OM, representing residual energy values for CHs which are in the sensor node's range. In case of distance of sensor node to the CH, the best value is represented by the minimum value in the corresponding column (distance of closest CH to the sensor node).</p></div>

The second term signifies the energy consumed in receiving the compete messages from other CH candidates within R compete radius. The number of messages received is based on the estimate that ''np" CH candidates will fall within one R compete radius. A similar analogy is used in Eqs.

( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">10</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">15</ref>) it can be observed that a number of parameters effect the energy consumption per round. Particularly, the clustering phase involves an election and competition process; therefore the energy consumption related to parameters such as R CHADV , R compete and p with respect to the network size are of interest. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the variation in energy consumed in the clustering phase with respect to R CHADV and the number of nodes n. For network sizes of 100 and 200 nodes the energy consumption increases at a significantly lower rate than for network sizes of 400 and 500 nodes. It can be noted from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">11</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">12</ref>) that as the number of nodes is increased, more energy is spent on processing the CHs advertisement messages. It may seem desirable to have a small R CHADV , however it must be emphasised here that this parameter also governs how well the network is covered. In other words, choosing a very small R CHADV may decrease the energy costs but on the other hand it may also result in some of the sensor nodes being left uncovered because they could not receive any CH advertisement message.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows the effect of R compete and p on the energy consumed. The results follow an intuitive explanation that as the probability p is increased more nodes are elected as candidates, resulting in more energy expended in processing the competition messages. It can be observed that for a given p, there is an optimal value of R compete that will produce K opt as given in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>). Decreasing the R compete will result in more candidates as well as more CHs. Therefore more energy is consumed in competition message overheads. On the other hand if R compete is increased from the optimal value, much fewer CHs are elected and hence the sensor node to CH communication costs are significantly increased resulting in extra energy cost. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> demonstrates the effect of R compete and R CHADV on the overall energy consumed per round. The results are obtained using p equal to 0.15 and a network size of 200 nodes. Recall from Section 6, that R CHADV is the radius which is used by the cluster heads to send their advertisement messages. As R CHADV is increased, more energy is consumed in sensing the advertisements and processing the number of advertisement messages. It can be clearly observed that choosing a small R compete and large R CHADV can significantly compromise the network lifetime of a network. Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> exhibits the variation in energy consumption with respect to different values of R compete and n. It can be observed that values within the range of 20-30 m can be selected for network size of 100-500 nodes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 1. The MOECS has a control message complexity of O(n).</head><p>Proof. It can be observed that there are only three types of control messages exchanged during clustering in each round. C_COM-PETE_MSG is broadcast by sensor nodes that elect themselves as candidate to be a CH. Once elected, CHs broadcast CH_ADV_MSG to let the sensor nodes know about their presence. Finally, the non-CH nodes send CH_ADV_MSG to the CH they wish to join. Let n be the total number of nodes in the system and p be the probability for a node to become a CH candidate.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Simulation results</head><p>The simulator was developed in MATLAB which allows efficient and realistic modeling of sensor nodes by using object oriented programming support and an integrated technical computing environment. A model similar to the ones defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> is used where network operation progresses in rounds. Each round in turn consists of a clustering phase and data transmission phase. In the clustering phase, a set of new CHs is elected from the active nodes and the remaining nodes become cluster members. In the data transmission phase, each sensor node sends a fixed amount of data to its CH which is later forwarded to the BS after aggregation. Modeling the network operation in this manner also allows measurement of the network life in number of rounds until the very first node runs out of its energy or a percentage of nodes completely exhaust their battery and die. The lifetime on an individual sensor node is measured in the number of rounds before its energy is depleted. The lifetime of a network can be defined in either the  number of rounds until the first node dies or a certain percentage of nodes die. Although the network life time measured to the death of the first node is extensively used in the literature including <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, it can be argued that this definition is a bit stringent for large scale networks, since some of the sensor nodes continue to be operational maintaining a sufficient degree of connectivity required for data gathering. Therefore, in addition to the first node death, this work also considers the network life when 25% and 50% nodes are dead. Another measure of energy efficiency is the average energy consumed per round which could be obtained by summation of energy consumed in clustering and data transmission phases. In addition, the protocol performance is also analyzed in number of covered nodes, number of CH generated, and the overall energy dissipation behavior. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">2</ref> provides the common simulation parameters used in our experiments.</p><p>Network lifetime is the most important performance metric for WSNs. Using this metric the MOECS protocol is evaluated under different topology configurations and network sizes. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8a</ref> and<ref type="figure">b</ref> demonstrate the results for experiments where sensor nodes are deployed randomly on a square area of 100 Â 100 m. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8c</ref> and<ref type="figure">d</ref> show results using a grid topology. In each topology, two different network sizes are used to evaluate the protocol's behavior with respect to scalability. All results are expressed in averages taken over 20 random independent experiments. In random and grid topology for MOECS we use p (probability to become CH candidate) as 0.15 and the advertisement radius R CHADV of 55 m. The parameters for EECS, LEACH and HEED are taken as provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In random topology, the first node death occurs after 920 rounds and 980 rounds for network size of 200 and 500 nodes respectively. Under first node death criterion MOECS extends the network lifetime approximately 10% compared to EECS, 25% compared to LEACH and 200% compared to HEED. The results for the grid topology follow a similar pattern for all the protocols. On the other hand, if we also consider 25% and 50% dead nodes as the lifetime criterion we see that results for HEED are comparable for latter case with MOECS under large node densities. The residual energy of the system also provides an estimate of the network life. Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> illustrates results for the random and grid topology where y-axis indicates the mean residual energy of the system normalized to number of nodes and x-axis denotes the number of rounds. It can be observed that the mean residual energy of the system in the case of MOECS is higher than that of the other protocols. Hence, the network life under MOECS protocol is enhanced compared to EECS, LEACH and HEED. These results corroborate the results presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10</ref> depicts the contour plot of sensor node residual energy for network size of 200 nodes. The senor residual energies are measured after the death of the first node. It is evident that MOECS displays a much more balanced residual energy level among the sensor nodes compared to all other protocols. The cluster forma-tion process in MOECS includes multiple parameters that influence energy consumption. These parameters include communication cost from sensor node to the CH, communication cost from CH to the BS, and the CH's residual energy, which help sensor nodes achieve balanced energy dissipation is the system. The EECS protocol also includes a weighted cost function in cluster formation, therefore it displays relatively better results that HEED and LEACH. The residual energy map displayed by EECS consists of two distinct energy levels. Both LEACH and HEED show the distinct visible bands of different energy levels. Moreover, it is worthwhile to note the residual energy of each level is higher towards the BS.</p><p>We also analyze the average energy consumed per round with respect to node density. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">11</ref> depicts the results for average energy consumed per round for two different network sizes using random and grid topology. These statistics are collected using 1000 independent rounds with no dead nodes in the network. It can be observed that MOECS outperforms all other protocols because it renders the least amount of consumed energy for the cases considered here. In addition to the balanced energy dissipation behavior, other factors such as low protocol overheads, and optimizing on the protocol implementation factors such as R CHADV help MOECS achieve minimum energy consumption as compared to all other protocols. LEACH on the other hand performs worst because it delivers a topology where CH distribution is not well controlled and cluster formation does not take into account any parameter that optimizes the energy consumption between sensor node, CH and the BS. Hence, more energy is expended as compared to HEED, EECS and MOECS.</p><p>Finally, we verify the correctness of simulation results by comparing it with the analytical model presented in Section 7. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">12</ref> illustrates the comparison of average energy consumed during clustering phase versus network size for both models. Simulation results are represented by mean and standard deviation shown as vertical bars. It can be clearly observed that the simulation and analytical results correlate for all network sizes considered here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper we have presented a novel optimization based technique for cluster formation in WSN. With this technique it is possible to consider multiple individual metrics for cluster formation which is critical for well balanced energy dissipation of the system. Although in the current paper we have only considered three metrics more performance metrics can be used without adding significant cost of complexity to the algorithm, which makes it a more favorable choice as compared to other techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that MOECS achieves significant energy savings and enhances network lifetime when compared to EECS LEACH and HEED protocols. Multiple parameters involved in the cluster formation process for MOECS help sensor nodes dissipate their energy at a much more balanced rate as compared to other protocols. The ability of MOECS to scale both from the network deployment area and node density makes it a viable energy efficient scheme for WSNs. Also we would consider a realistic radio model such as one proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[37]</ref> for the future enchantments to the protocol. We anticipate that further improvements in energy efficiency can be achieved by considering the concept of limited mobility in sensor nodes. Adding metrics related to mobility into our current framework remains an area for future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
