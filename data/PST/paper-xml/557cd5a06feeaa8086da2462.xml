As demonstrated in the past, in conventional high speed systems, the high qfio bhtween the end-tosnd propagation delay and the message transmission time severely restricts the system performance. Thus, the increase in chapnel bandwidth may be aecompanied by only a marginal increase in actual system capacity. In this paper, we propose a combined frequency-time division-based control of the high speed channel which significqntly reduces tbis problem. We consider the design of prqtocols subject to the unique channel control penalties of the resulting multichannel system. Specifically, in addition to the relatively high cost of channel ensing, the allocation of channels on a demand assignment basis is hindewd in the multichannel configuration by the time penalty involved in locating an idle channel and by practical limitations on the transmit/receive multichannel node interface. We therefore introduce a new class of fixed "allocation" protocols in which the channel a c c w is obtained without the aforementioned penalties. The allocation protocols build on the allocation of source and destination oriented transmission rights, taking into account the implementation aspects of multichannel networks. We show that the presented class' of "multichannelr allocation" protocols covers the whole range of random access to fiied channel access control policies and introduce an analytic approach for a uniform analytic treatment. The analysis demonstrates the potential for a significant improvement in the system capacity and the average message delay when compared to the conventional single (undivided) Ch8nnel system control. As demonstrated in the past [SI, 1121, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>, in high speed networks, the network capacity is inversely proportional to the increasing ratio between the end-to-end propagation delay and the message transmission time. With high transmission rates, the message transmission time becomes small, so that this ratio increases dramatically. As a result the introduction of high bandwidth channel into the communication network may be accompanied by only a marginal increase in actual network capacity!</p><p>In a unidirectional environment, the ability to efficiently utilize the high speed medium can be partially improved by using "train-oriented" protocols, in which sequences of messages from different nodes are concatenated into larger data units. The capacity improvement obtained in this way is, however, limited, due to carrier detection, node processing time, and due to the need for correspondence between the physical order of stations on the cable, the logical order of messages in the train, and the relative node traffic requirements [ 121.</p><p>In this paper, we investigate protocols for high speed communication based on an alternative multichannel architectural approach [ 131. It has been demonstrated in 181, [ 131, [ 141 that this approach possesses the theoretical potential for providing a significantly better use of high bandwidth media in terms of capacity and response times than single channel high speed systems. The multichannel solution can be obtained by interconnection of physically disjoint lower speed channels or by frequency division of a single high speed channel. The proposed architecture possesses several advantages.</p><p>1) It increases the network capacity. By operating on slower speed channels, the message ttansmission time is increased so that the end-to-end propagation delay <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> to meswge transmission time ratio is improved. In this way, the utilization of each channel and consequently of the whole communication system becomes more efficient. The bounds computed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>, in fact, show that the high speed network capacity can be increased from 1 /( 1 + 7 / To) in a configuration of a single channel of bandwidth B, to 1 /( 1 + 7 / ( Tob)) in a system with b channels having the same combined bandwidth. Here To represents the message transmission time over a channel of bandwidth B.</p><p>2) The multichannel system can utilize existing interface components based on proven medium speed technologies.</p><p>3) System reliability is increased by offering alternate virtual paths between users.</p><p>Motivated by the potential significant capacity improvement of the multichannel system combined with properties 2) and 3) above, we introduce in this paper a new class of "allocation" protocols for the control of a multichannel system. To realize the performance potential, care must be taken in the design of multichannel protocols, so that in addition to conventional single channel access penalties, such as per channel carrier sensing and node processing time, penalties unique to the multichannel architecture are also considered. Specifically, the following factors must be accounted for: a) the channel scan time needed for selecting an idle channel for transmission, b) the minimal channel interface replication of the transmitheceive mechanism at each node, dictated by cost/ performance considerations, allows only a single reception and transmission to take place concurrently, and c) the need of managing multiple alternate paths without the overhead of real time processing. Based on these considerations the control of the high speed channel is obtained by the combined frequencytime division multichannel allocation (FTDMA) protocols. The principle of FTDMA protocols is a fixed cycle-channel control whereby transmission rights are allocated in each slot to source-destination pairs on one of the subchannels. The extend of access control is determined by the number of transmission rights allocated by the protocol in each slot. We 0090-6778/88/04oO-0430$01 .oO <ref type="bibr">O 1988 IEEE</ref> show that the presented class of "multichannel allocation" protocols covers the whole range of random access to fixed channel access control policies. A tractable analytic approach for a uniform treatment of the whole class is introduced. The performance and optimization of the FTDMA protocols are given as a function of the system load, the end-to-end propagation delay, and the system configuration. The analysis demonstrates that with the multichannel architecture, a significant improvement in the system capacity and in the average message delay can be obtained when compared to the conventional single (undivided) channel system control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. NETWORK AND PROTOCOL MODEL A . Multichannel Network</head><p>We consider a communication system with N nodes connected through b, 1 I b I N, subchannels of equal bandwidth where each node is connected to every subchannel. For representation convenience and without modeling restriction, we shall assume in the following treatment that the multichannel system is obtained by frequency division multiplexing. Consistently, with prevailing models <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, [14],</p><p>we assume a node interface implementation with minimal replication of the transmit/receive mechanism. A node can, therefore, transmit on one of the channels at a time <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and can correctly receive exactly one message among the successful (uncollided) incoming messages. In the conventional sense, we shall refer to the simultaneous transmission by two or more nodes on a single channel as message collision. We define a destination conflict as the simultaneous amval of two or more successful messages to the same destination node, leading to the successful reception of only one of the arriving messages.</p><p>For traffic modeling, we assume that every node i has N buffers where N -1 transmission buffers are dedicated each to a different destination j , 1 I j I N , j # i and one buffer is dedicated to the reception of messages. Each transmission buffer will represent a virtual user (i, j), 1 5 i, j 5 N or service point in IS0 terminology. In this way, interconnection between each pair of nodes, peer protocols, can be modeled independently.</p><p>We denote the transmission duration of a constant length message on the undivided bandwidth channel by TO. The message transmission time on each subchannel normalized to TO is thus given by b. We shall assume that the time in the system is slotted in slots of duration equal to b + p where p denotes the per message "channel control" penalty. This penalty will be the function of the end-to-end propagation delay normalized to To and possibly the directionality of the channel, unidirectional or bidirectional. Notice that in a system in which channel access is executed by fixed allocation, as opposed, for instance, to demand assignment protocols, p will not be a function of the system load.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Frequency-Time Division Multichannel Allocation (FTDMA) Protocols</head><p>We propose the class of FTDMA protocols in which channel access is governed by a fmed cycle. In each cycle source/destination oriented permissions are granted, specifying for each node, or virtual user, the channel and the slots in which to transmit. The protocols in this class differ in the number of permissions granted in each slot and in their channel allocation policy-random or deterministic. The number of permissions per slot and the channel allocation dictate the channel access associated penalties. Specifically, the loss of bandwidth due to collisions and destination conflicts can be traded against the probability of finding unused channels (idle slots) in a nonempty system. Due to the existence of this tradeoff, it is possible to define FTDMA protocols ranging from fully controlled access (collision/ conflict free transmission) to uncontrolled access of the channels.</p><p>The first presented protocol, named ''source/destination allocation protocol," is fully controlled. In each slot, exactly b permissions, equal to the number of channels, are given to disjoint source/destination pairs so that no collisions and destination conflicts occur. Similarly to single channel networks, this fixed allocation may lead to only partial use of the slots at low to medium loads. Therefore, in the next ''destination allocation" protocol, the number of permissions per slot is increased-granting permissions to N users under the condition that no destination conflict occurs. In the third "source allocation" protocol, the channel access control is further reduced by granting permissions to b source nodes for each to transmit on a different channel. Notice that in this way b(N -1) users can potentially transmit, but at most b users, belonging to different source nodes, will transmit without collision. In the last protocol, termed "allocation free" protocol, the time division allocation cycle is collapsed into a single slot and any node with a message ready for transmission can transmit on a randomly chosen channel. This approach corresponds to the granting of N x (N -1) permissions in each slot, a policy viable for low system loads.</p><p>Notice, therefore, that the number of permissions granted in these protocols increases gradually. Thus, intuitively, an optimal control of the multichannel network can be obtained by choosing the correct protocol as a function of the network configuration and the system load.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PROTOCOL DEFINITIONS</head><p>To formally define the FTDMA protocols, we let T be the size of the allocation cycle in slots. Let U(t) be an N x N allocation matrix. Each entry u"(t) of the matrix will represent the permission right granted to user (i, j) in slot t , t = 1, 2, ... , T, 1 I i, j I N. The exact interpretation of permissions will depend on the type of protocol obeyed as discussed next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A . Source/Destination Allocation Protocol (Protocol I)</head><p>This protocol is based on a fixed allocation of the channels to source/destination pairs preventing collisions and destination conflicts. In the allocation matrix of this protocol, a nonzero entry ug(t), 1 5 ug(t) 5 b, of U(t), t = 1, 2,e , T, 1 I i, j 5 N signifies the channel number on which user (i, j ) is permitted to transmit in time slot t of the cycle.</p><p>For simplicity of presentation, see the following.</p><p>Let Ind-be an indicator function assuming the values 1 or 0, given by 1, if statement true 0, if statement false. Ind (statement) = W(t)-be a binary matrix such that w,(t) = Ind (u,,(t) &gt;</p><p>The allocation matrix U(t), 1 5 t 5 T for source/ destination allocation protocol obeys the following conditions:</p><p>1) Zl w,,(t) 5 1, for destination conflict free transmissions, 2) X,Z,w,,(t) = b, for restricting the total number of 3) for every w,,(t</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">) # 0: u,,(t) f uk[(t) if i If k a n d j # I,</formula></div>

Thus, no redundant permissions are issued consistently with the transmission limitation of the nodes' interface mechanism. 3) By allocating permissions to virtual users, both source and destination nodes are uniquely determined in each transmission, Therefore, the node's reception mechanism can be further simplified as each node knows in advance the channel number of the incoming message.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Evaluation of Protocols II-IV</head><p>The analysis of Protocols 11-IV differs from Protocol I due to the existence of channel collisions and destination conflicts. Therefore, the state of the system must record the source/ destination distribution of all messages in the system at the embedded points, given as before, by the beginning of slots. We can thus denote X(t) to be the state of the system at the beginning of the tth slot. X(t) is an N x Nbinary matrix with q ( t ) assuming the value 1 or 0 according to the existence or nonexistence of a message at user (i, j). The resulting solution is exponential in the number of states [15]. Although, currently, in majority of very high speed networks, the number of nodes is very small [ 11, [3] with future applications this number can be expected to increase. We therefore introduce an approximate model with significantly reduced Complexity, in which the number of states is linear in the number of nodes. In the approximate model, the complexity of the solution is transferred from the need to solve an exponential number of linear equations to the need to correctly model the system behavior in face of only partial state information.</p><p>Let the Markov chain be now represented by the total number of messages at the beginning of each slot. For tractable solution of the approximate model we shall assume that the arrival rates to all users are equal, thus X = Xu and X' = Xi, V i , j . Let S be the system throughput and D be the average message delay as defined earlier. We can compute D similarly to [14] on the basis of the following observation. In steady state, the expected number of arrivals must equal the expected number of departures given by S. Let CL denote a node cycle defined as the average time elapsing between two consecutive arrivals of a message at the node. Since the length of cycle CL equals D + l/X', the expected num- ber of arrivals per second in the whole system becomes N' -1/D + l/X'. From this observation, we obtain</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>N'</head><p>-=s</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">1 D + - A'</formula><p>and thus finally the average waiting time D becomes with N' the number of virtual users in the system, given by N = N*(N -1).</p><p>To obtain the system throughput S, we recall that the message arrival rate forms a Bernoulli process with rate 1e-X'. Thus, where ri denotes the steady-state probability that at the beginning of a slot there are i messages in the network.</p><p>To compute D and S, we derive the steady-state probabilities ll = (TO, T ~,e , T N ~) obtained from the solution of the following system of equations: P=np @ r;=l i=O where P denotes the transition probability matrix. The transition probability plJ is defined as the probability that at the beginning of a slot, the system is in state j given the system was in state i at the beginning of the previous slot. p,, is given by <ref type="figure">-A,-l+k,l(l -e-X'</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(13)</ref> where A J r ) is the probability that exactly i messages originate from a binomial process with parameter r. given there are j messages in the system at t h ~ slot beginning. A,(r) is given by k=O the beginning of a slot. We notice that the probability SUC ( i , k ) depends on the type of protocol obeyed. In the remainder of this section, we therefore calculate SUC (i, k ) for each Protocol 11, 111, and IV.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">nun (1.6) piJ= SUC ( i , k)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I) SUC (i, k) Calculation:</head><p>In the calculation of SUC (i, k ) , we must consider the source/destination distribution of the messages in the system which, in the approximate model, is not available directly from the state definition. We use therefore the following urn model.</p><p>We shall represent the messages (backlogged users) by balls and, depending on the modeled Protocol, 11, 111, and IV, respectively, we shall represent destination nodes, source nodes, or virtual users by urns. Using the urn analogy, we can model the source/destination distribution of messages in the symmetric system as the distribution of n indistinguishable balls into m distinguishable urns with at most v balls per urn.</p><p>The number of urns m and the occupancy restriction u will depend on the specific protocol. We shall denote this model by nmv.</p><p>2) Destination Allocation Protocol: For a message to be successfully transmitted in slot t it must be: 1) in the system, and 2) be transmitted collision free on a channel. We therefore obtain We can now obtain SUC ( i , k ) by substituting ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) in (15). The system transition probabilities are then derived by substituting ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) in ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), and the system throughput in (11) is given by substituting the steady-state probabilities obtained by the substitution of ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) in (12).</p><p>Source Allocation Protocol: In this case, a message is successfully transmitted iff the transmitting user's message is received without conflict at the destination node.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. RESULTS</head><p>Using the introduced analytic models, we evaluate the performance improvement for the FTDMA protocols and compare it to conventional systems. For evaluating the system performance of the FTDMA protocols, we consider a sample network consisting of eight nodes (N = 8), having a channel access penalty value of p = 10. Figs. 2 and 3 consider the offered loadlthroughput and throughput/average message delay behavior of the source/destination allocation protocol (Protocol I), respectively. From these results, obtained from the exact model presented in Section IV-A, it can be observed that both the system throughput (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) and the average message delay improve consistently with channel division. The improvement in the system thrqyghput is due to the relative improvement in the T/TO ra io, ,since no loss of protocol due to collisions or conflicts. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> also shows that in the source/destination allocation protocol the optimal throughput/delay performance is always obtained by using the maximum division factor b = N. This is due to the fact that with this protocol the average message delay is a function of the cycle duration which is a nonincreasing function of b! Notice also that no further improvement of capacity by division is possible due to the obvious restriction of b = N being the upper bound on the maximum number of permissions allocatable in a slot. Thus, in the source/destination allocation protocol the theoretical system capacity obtained by the frequency approach is reached, C = 1/(1 + T/(To-N)) as given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Figs. <ref type="figure">4</ref><ref type="figure">5</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>give the average message delay D as a function of the throughput S for Protocols 11, 111, and IV, respectively.</p><p>Since for these protocols an approximate model is used, validation by simulation is also provided. The simulation results, represented in Figs. 4-6 by asterisks, were determined with a 99.9 percent confidence interval and are shown to be in excellent correspondence with the approximation. We observe that in these protocols the optimal division factor b, is a function of the system load. An optimal b value exists, since at low loads a high division b would result in most subchannels being unused, while at high loads a low division factor would lead to increased probability of collisions and conflicts. Notice that the existence of collisions and conflicts in Protocols 11 and IV leads to unstable system behavior at high loads, so that beyond a given system load, an actual reduction of throughput can be noticed. This behavior is due to the increasing loaddependent probability of collisions and, as can be expected, is most pronounced in Protocol IV as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>. It is also interesting to notice that a similar throughput deterioration is not found in the source allocation protocol (Protocol m). In this case, no channel collisions may occur so that the number of successful messages per slot increases with the system load. Therefore, the number of different destinations with at least one arriving message is a nondecreasing function of the offered load.</p><p>Comparison of Figs. <ref type="figure">3</ref><ref type="figure">4</ref><ref type="figure">5</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>shows that for performance optimization, at low loads the allocation free protocol obtains the best throughput/delay performance. For low to medium loads, the source allocation protocol is preferred and for high loads, the source/destination allocation protocol offers the best performance. This optimization over the class of FTDMA protocols is possible due to the fact that channel collisions and destination conflicts are a function of system load and configuration. The degree of the relative performance improvement obtainable by the different protocols will of course depend on the specific system configuration and the channel Speed.</p><p>As mentioned above for high loads, the source/destination allocation protocol reaches the capacity of a multichannel system. As previously pointed out in Section 11, this protocol also allows a simpler receiver interface since the channel of the incoming message i s always known to the receiver. These facts make the source/destination allocation protocol especially attractive if low to medium load performance optimization is not being sought. bandwidth is incurred in the source J destination allocation </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we presented a class of channel allocation protocols for multichannel network configurations obtained by frequency division multiplexing or bus multiplication. The introduced time/division oriented (FTDMA) protocols were analyzed and it was shown that the FTDMA protocols have the potential to reach the theoretical multichannel architecture capacity and to improve the system performance in terms of throughput and average message delay as compared to conventional single channel networks. We further observed that while in Protocols II-IV, the optimal bandwidth division for the throughput/delay performance optimization is dependent on the system load, in Protocol I (the source/destination allocation protocol) the optimal division is always equal to the maximum channel division factor. Thus, the optimal bandwidth control in the source/destination allocation protocol is significantly simpler while guaranteeing maximum improvement in system capacity under a fixed channel division.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>"very high speed" networks is being T motivated by new applications such as voice and video services, distributed data bases, and distributed computation, and by the evolution in wide-band communication technologies, such as broad-band coaxial cables and optical communication. The high speed local area networks [16]-[19], metropolitan area networks [23], and ISDN systems [24], using bandwidth of hundreds of megabits or higher, are the result of this marriage between the emerging applications, the envisioned distributed computation and the expected availability of high bandwidth transmission systems 1201-[22].</figDesc></figure>

The occupancy restriction becomes N -1 equaling the number of users at each (source) node.
