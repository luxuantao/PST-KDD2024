<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. A typical slide attack the equation F 1 (P 0 , K 1 ) = P 1 holds, the pair is called a slid pair. The attacker would then obtain two equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F 1 (P 0 , K 1 ) = P 1 , F r (C 0 , K r ) = C 1 ,</formula><p>where the second equation would hold for free due to sliding. These equations involve only a single round function, and thus could be solved by the attacker for the secret subkeys K 1 , K r of these rounds. The attacker may create properly slid pairs (P 0 , P 1 ) by birthday paradox or by careful construction. For an arbitrary cipher the attack has complexity of 2 n/2 known-plaintexts, where n is the blocksize. For a Feistel cipher complexity is reduced to 2 n/4 chosen plaintexts. Several ciphers or slight modifications of existing ciphers have been shown vulnerable to such attacks: for example the Brown-Seberry variant of DES <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> (rotations in key-schedule are by 7 positions, instead of varying 1,2 rotations as in the original DES), DES-X, the Even-Mansour scheme <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>, arbitrary Feistel ciphers with 4-round periodic key-schedule as well as round-reduced versions of GOST. The basic attack has been extended into a slide-with a twist, a technique where encryption is slid against decryption and complementary slide technique <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, where the inputs to the rounds do not have to be identical but may have the difference which is canceled out by a difference in the keys. In the same paper another generalization of the technique for the case of a composition of strong round functions is given.</p><p>It is clear that slide-attack would apply to any iterative construction which has enough self-similarity in its rounds. It could be applied to block-ciphers as described above, to stream-ciphers (see for example resyncronization attack on WAKE-ROFB <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>) or to MAC and hash-functions (see for example a recent slid pair discovery for SHA-1 by Saarinen <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>).</p><p>In practice the attack seems easy to avoid by breaking the similarity of the round transforms by applying round counters (as is done for example in Skipjack) or different random constants in each round (as in AES, SHA-256 and many other constructions). Whether such simple changes are indeed sufficient is a matter of further research.</p><p>-Alex Biryukov.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multiset Attack</head><p>Multiset attack is a generic class of attacks which covers several recently designed (typically chosen plaintext attacks), which appeared in the literature under three different names: the Square attack <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, the saturation attack <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>, the integral cryptanalysis <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. The first such attack was discovered by Knudsen during analysis of the cipher Square <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> and was thus called "Square attack". A similar attack was used by Lucks <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> against the cipher Rijndael and called "saturation" attack. Later Biryukov and Shamir have shown an attack of similar type breaking arbitrary 3 round SPN (see also substitution-permutation (SP) network) with secret components (the so-called SASAS scheme, which consists of five layers of substitutions and affine transforms). Gilbert-Minier's "collision" attack <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> on 7-rounds of Rijndael as well as Knudsen-Wagner's <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> "integral" cryptanalysis of 5-rounds of MISTY1 also fall into the same class.</p><p>The main feature behind these attacks is that unlike a differential attack in which the attacker studies the behavior of pairs of encryptions, in a multiset attack the attacker looks at a larger carefully chosen sets of encryptions, in which parts of the input text form a multiset. A multiset is different from a regular notion of a set, since it allows the same element to appear multiple times. The element of a multiset is thus a pair (value, multiplicity), where value is the value of the element and multiplicity counts the number of times this value appears in the multiset. The attacker then studies the propagation of multisets through the cipher. The effect of the cipher on a multiset is the changing of values of the elements but preserving some of the multiset properties like: multiplicity; or "integral" (i.e. sum of all the components); or causing a reduced set of values which would increase the probability of birthday-like events inside the cipher.</p><p>Multiset attacks are currently the best known attacks for the AES (see Advanced Encryption Standard) due to its byte-wise structure. This new type of attack is a promising direction for future research.</p><p>-Alex Biryukov.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Meet-in-the-Middle Attack</head><p>Meet-in-the-middle is a classical technique of cryptanalysis which applies to many constructions. The idea is that the attacker constructs patterns that propagate from both ends to the middle of the cipher, in some cases by partial key-guessing. If the events do not match in the middle the key-guess was wrong and may be discarded. Such attack has been applied to 7-round DES <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, to structural cryptanalysis of multiple-encryption (for example, two-key triple encryption <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3]</ref>. A recent miss-in-the-middle attack may also be seen as a variant of this technique in which the events in the middle should not match, and the keys that suggest a match in the middle are filtered as wrong keys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Miss-in-the-Middle Attack</head><p>Following the idea behind meet-in-the-middle approach, the miss-in-the-middle attack is one of the techniques to construct distinguishers for the impossible differential attack.</p><p>The idea is that one finds two events that propagate half way through the cipher top and bottom with certainty, but which do not match in the middle. This results in an event which is impossible for the full cipher, i.e. has zero probability. A typical tool for constructing such events would be truncated differentials. Note that it is sufficient that events contradict each other in a single bit in the middle. This technique was first introduced in the papers by Biham-Biryukov-Shamir <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref> to cryptanalyse round-reduced versions of Skipjack, IDEA and Khufu.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impossible Differential Attack</head><p>Impossible differential attack is a chosen plaintext attack and is an extension of differential cryptanalysis. Impossible differential attack <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> was defined in 1998 and has been shown to break 31 out of 32 rounds of the cipher Skipjack <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, designed by the NSA and declassified in 1998. Independently, an attack based on similar principles was used by Knudsen in 1998 to cryptanalyse 6-rounds of the cipher DEAL <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> which was one of his proposals for the AES (see Advanced Encryption Standard). The attack using impossible differentials was shown to be a generic tool for cryptanalysis <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> and was applied to improve on the best known attacks for such strong and long standing ciphers as IDEA and Khufu <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>, breaking round-reduced versions of these ciphers. The two main ideas were the miss-in-the-middle technique for construction of impossible events inside ciphers and the sieving technique for filtering wrong key-guesses.</p><p>Once the existence of impossible events in a cipher is proven, it can be used directly as a distinguisher from a random permutation. Furthermore one can find the keys of a cipher by analyzing the rounds surrounding the impossible event, and guessing the subkeys of these rounds. All the keys that lead to a contradiction are obviously wrong. The impossible event in this case plays the role of a sieve, methodically rejecting the wrong key guesses and leaving the correct key. It is important to note that the miss-in-the-middle technique is only one of the ways to construct impossible events and that the sieving technique is only one of the possible ways to exploit them.</p><p>In order to get a feel of the attack, consider a cipher E(•) with n-bit blocks, a set of input differences P of cardinality 2 p and a corresponding set of output differences Q of cardinality 2 q . Suppose that no difference from P can cause an output difference from Q. One may ask how many chosen texts should be requested in order to distinguish E(•) from a random permutation? In general about 2 n-q pairs with differences from P are required. This number can be reduced by using structures (a standard technique for saving chosen plaintexts in differential attacks). In the optimal case one may use structures of 2 p texts which contain about 2 2p-1 pairs with differences from P. In this case 2 n-q /2 2p-1 structures are required, and the number of chosen texts used by this distinguishing attack is about 2 n-p-q+1 (assuming that 2p &lt; nq + 1). Thus the higher p + q is the better is the distinguisher based on the impossible event.</p><p>-Alex Biryukov.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Related Key Attack</head><p>The first attacks of this type were developed independently by Biham and Knudsen <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">4]</ref> and the notion of a related key attack was defined by Biham <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The idea of the attack is that the attacker knows (or chooses) a relation between several keys and is given access to encryption functions with such related keys. The goal of the attacker is to find the keys themselves. If the relation is known but can not be changed by the attacker the attack is called a known related key and if the attacker may choose the relation it is called a chosen related key attack. The scenario of the attack is very powerful in terms of the attacker's capabilities and thus quite unrealistic in practice. Still these attacks may be seen as important certificational weaknesses for the key-schedule of a cipher. A line of ciphers have been shown to have weaknesses in this attack scenario <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3]</ref> ). These operations work with 16-bit words. One round of IDEA is split into two different half-round operations: key mixing (denoted by T ) and M -mixing denoted by M = s • M A, where M A denotes a multiplication-addition structure and s denotes a swap of two middle words. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> T divides the 64-bit block into four 16-bit words X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , X 4 and mixes the key words Z 1 , Z 2 , Z 3 , Z 4 with the data using ⊙ and ⊞:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , X 4 ) T -→ (X 1 ⊙ Z 1 , X 2 ⊞ Z 2 , X 3 ⊞ Z 3 , X 4 ⊙ Z 4 ).</formula><p>The transform M A provides diffusion between different words and mixes in two more key words Z 5 , Z 6 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Y 1 = ((X 1 ⊕ X 3 ) ⊙ Z 5 ⊞ (X 2 ⊕ X 4 )) ⊙ Z 6 , Y 2 = Y 1 ⊞ ((X 1 ⊕ X 3 ) ⊙ Z 5 ), (X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , X 4 ) MA -→ (X 1 ⊕ C 2 , X 2 ⊕ C 1 , X 3 ⊕ C 2 , X 4 ⊕ C 1 ).</formula><p>Both M A and s are involutions. The full 8.5-round IDEA can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">IDEA = T • s • (s • M A • T ) 8 = T • s • (M • T ) 8 .</formula><p>The only changes between IDEA and its predecessor PES, are in the order of operations in the key mixing sub-round T : PES uses the order (⊙, ⊙, ⊞, ⊞), while IDEA uses the order (⊙, ⊞, ⊞, ⊙), and in the swap of the words after the M A subround. In IDEA the outer words X 1 , X 4 are not swapped. These changes were motivated by a differential attack on PES given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[12]</ref>. Since its publication IDEA resisted intensive cryptanalytic efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>. In [10, page 79] IDEA reduced to four rounds was claimed to be secure against differential attacks. Progress in cryptanalyzing round-reduced variants was very slow, starting with an attack on a two round variant of IDEA in 1993 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[13]</ref> by Meier, an improvement to 2.5 rounds by Daemen et al. <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>, then an attack on 3.5 rounds published in 1997 <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> by Borst et al. Impossible differential attack singificantly improved previous results for 3 and 3.5 rounds and could break up to 4.5 rounds <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> using the full codebook and 2 112 steps. Finally the currently best attack marginally breaks 5 rounds with a new variant of meet-in-the-middle attack due to Demirci et al. <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> and uses 2 24 chosen plaintexts, 2 58 memory and 2 126 steps of analysis. This approach has higher analysis complexity than the impossible differential attack for 4 and 4.5 rounds, but requires less data.</p><p>In addition to these attacks three relatively large easily detectable classes of weak keys were found: in [5] 2 51 weak keys out of the 2 128 keys were found to be detectable with 16 chosen plaintexts and 2 17 steps using differential membership tests, and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[7]</ref> 2 63 weak keys were found to be detectable given 20 chosen plaintexts with a negligible complexity under differential-linear membership tests. Recently a boomerang membership test allowed to find a class of 2 64 keys <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> with 2 16 steps and queries for the membership test. Still the chance of choosing a weak key at random is about 2 -64 which is extremely low. Using this approach for a 5-round reduced IDEA one key out of 2 31 can be recovered with just 2 10 adaptive chosen plaintext and chosen ciphertext queries, which compares favourably to the currently best attacks. Also related key attacks on 3.5 rounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[9]</ref> and on 4 rounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[7]</ref> of IDEA were developed.</p><p>-Alex Biryukov.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Skipjack</head><p>Skipjack <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> is the secret key encryption algorithm developed by the NSA for the Clipper chip initiative (including the Capstone chip and the Fortezza PC card). It was implemented in tamper-resistant hardware and its structure was kept secret since its introduction in 1993.</p><p>On June 24th, 1998, Skipjack was declassified, and its description was made public on the web site of NIST <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. It is an iterative block cipher with 64-bit block, 80-bit key and 32 rounds. It has two types of rounds, called Rule A and Rule B. Each round is described in the form of a linear feedback shift register with an additional non linear keyed G permutation. Rule B is basically the inverse of Rule A with minor positioning differences. Skipjack applies eight rounds of Rule A, followed by eight rounds of Rule B, followed by another eight rounds of Rule A, followed by another eight rounds of Rule B. The original definitions of Rule A and Rule B are given in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, where counter is the round number (in the range 1 to 32), G is a four-round Feistel permutation whose F function is defined as an 8x8-bit S box, called F Table , and each round of G is keyed by eight bits of the key.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Rule A Rule B w k+1 1 = G k (w k 1 ) ⊕ w k 4 ⊕ counter k w k+1 1 = w k 4 w k+1 2 = G k (w k 1 ) w k+1 2 = G k (w k 1 ) w k+1 3 = w k 2 w k+1 3 = w k 1 ⊕ w k 2 ⊕ counter k w k+1 4 = w k</formula><p>The key schedule of Skipjack takes a 10-byte key, and uses four of them at a time to key each G permutation. The first four bytes are used to key the first G permutation, and each additional G permutation is keyed by the next four bytes cyclically, with a cycle of five rounds.</p><p>Skipjack has been subject to intensive analysis <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4]</ref>. For example, Skipjack reduced to (the first) 16 rounds can be attacked with 2 17 chosen plaintexts and 2 34 time of analysis <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, which may be reduced to 2 14 texts and 2 16 steps using the yoyo-game approach <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Attacking the middle 16 rounds of Skipjack requires only 3 chosen plaintexts and 2 30 time of analysis. The currently most successfull attack against the cipher is the imposible differential attack which breaks 31 rounds out of 32 marginally faster than exhaustive search.</p><p>In addition, it is worth noting that Skipjack can be attacked by a generic time-memory tradeoff approach requiring 2 80 steps of precomputation and 2 54 80-bit words (i.e., 2 60 bits) of memory, but then each search for a key requires only 2 54 steps of computation.</p><p>-Alex Biryukov.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Cryptanalysis</head><p>Structural Cryptanalysis is a branch of cryptanalysis which studies the security of cryptosystems described by generic block diagrams. It analyses the syntactic interaction between the various blocks, but ignores their semantic definition as particular functions. Typical examples include meet in the middle attacks on multiple encryptions, the study of various chaining structures used in modes of operation, and the properties of Feistel structures or substitution-permutation networks with a small number of rounds. Structural attacks are often weaker than actual attacks on given cryptosystems, since they cannot exploit particular weaknesses (such as bad differential properties or weak avalanche effect) of concrete functions. The positive side of this is that they are applicable to large classes of cryptosystems, including those in which some of the internal functions are unknown or key dependent. Structural attacks often lead to deeper theoretical understanding of fundamental constructions, and thus they are very useful in establishing general design rules for strong cryptosystems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feistel Cipher</head><p>One popular class of the modern iterative block-ciphers are the Feistel ciphers (named so after Horst Feistel -cryptanalyst who worked with the IBM crypto group in the early 70-s). The round of a Feistel cipher uses the product of two involutions (a function G is called an involution if it is its own inverse: G(G(x)) = x) in order to achieve the very comfortable similarity of encryption and decryption processes. Given an n-bit block a Feistel round function divides it into two halves L (left) and R (right). Then some function F (R, k) is applied to the right half and the result is XORed with the left half (this is the first involution):</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L, R) → (R, L ⊕ F (R, k)).</formula><p>Here k is the round subkey produced by the key scheduling algorithm, it may vary from round to round. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Product Cipher, Superencryption</head><p>Product ciphers are ciphers that are built as a composition of several different functions. In a special case when all the functions are the same the cipher is called iterative cipher and the functions are called rounds. The intuition behind such constructions is inspired by the analogy with mixing transformations studied in the theory of Dynamical Systems, which was first noted by Shannon <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. The IBM team followed this approach in the design of Lucifer and DES. Rounds of iterative ciphers are typically keyed with different subkeys or at least involve different round constants to break self-similarity, which otherwise would be vulnerable to slide attacks. Note that the individual round transformation might be cryptographically weak. The strength of the whole construction relies on the number of iterations. The choice of the proper number of rounds is a difficult task, which is performed via cryptanalysis of the cipher. Most of the modern block-ciphers have an iterative structure for the reasons of compact hardware, software implementation and to facilitate the analysis. The typical number of rounds in modern ciphers ranges between 8 and 32. By their structure iterative block ciphers may be divided into two large classes: Feistel ciphers and Substitution-permutation networks (SPN).</p><p>If one takes composition of several ciphers one gets what is called multiple encryption or cascade cipher or superencryption (this term is often used in communications when some information which was encrypted off-line is transmited via an encrypted communication link). Multiple encryption is often used to enhance security of a single encryption function, though at the expense of speed. Note that multiple encryption does not necessarily improve security, consider for example simple substitution ciphers, where the product of substitutions is another substitution. One may prove that multiple encryption is at least as secure as the first component <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref> if the keys are chosen independently. A typical example of multiple encryption is Triple-DES.</p><p>-Alex Biryukov.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>3 w k+1 4 = w k 3 Fig. 1 .</head><label>3431</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

Recently a new type of cryptanalytic attack called slide attack has been developed. It can be viewed as a variant of a related key attack, in which a relation of the key with itself is exploited. Slide attacks are known plaintext or chosen plaintext attacks and thus are more practical then related key attacks since they do not require the attacker to know relations between different encryption keys.IDEAIDEA (previous name IPES) is a 64-bit, 8.5-round non-Feistel block cipher with 128-bit keys, proposed by Lai and Massey in 1991<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[12]</ref>. It is a modified version of a previous design called PES (Proposed Encryption Standard) by the same authors<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[11]</ref>, with added strength against differential attacks. The key-schedule of the cipher is completely linear. The main idea behind the design is the mix of noncommuting group operations: addition mod 2 16 (denoted by ⊞), XOR (denoted by ⊕), multiplication mod (2 16 -1) (denoted by ⊙, with 0 ≡ 2 16</figDesc><table /></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Then the halves are swapped (the second involution) and the process is repeated. Another convenience in this construction is that it is always a permutation, and thus is invertible no matter what function F is used and thus a designer may now concentrate on the security properties of this function. Many modern ciphers are designed as Feistel ciphers. One prominent example of a Feistel cipher is the Data Encryption Standard.Notice that the division into halves in a Feistel cipher can be replaced by division into quarters, octets, etc., such ciphers are called generalized Feistel ciphers. Several modern ciphers are of this type, for example the CAST family of ciphers or the cipher Skipjack.</figDesc><table /></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Substitution Permutation (SP) Network</head><p>Shannon <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> suggested to use several mixing layers interleaving substitutions and permutations to build strong ciphers. Such design is called substitutionpermutation sandwich or a substitution-permutation network (SPN). Although weak on its own, a line of substitutions followed by a permutation has good "mixing" properties: substitutions add to local confusion and permutation "glues" them together and spreads (diffuses) the local confusion to the more distant sub-blocks. If one considers flipping a single bit at the input of such a network, it effects the m output bits of particular S-box which in turn are sent to different S-boxes by a permutation. Thus inputs/outputs of up to m S-boxes would be effected by the avalanche of change. These are again permuted into different S-boxes, covering almost all the S-boxes of the network. On the output of such network about half of the bits are effected by change and are flipped and about half of the bits are not flipped. This makes an outcome of a single bit change at the input hard to predict, especially if secret key bits are mixed into the block between the layers of encryption. Without a secret key the SPN performs a complex but fully deterministic function of its inputs. The current block encryption standard AES is an SPN cipher.</p></div>			</div>
