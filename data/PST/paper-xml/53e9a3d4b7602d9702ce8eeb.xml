<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Motion degrades magnetic resonance (MR) images and prevents acquisition of self-consistent and high-quality volume images. A novel methodology, Snapshot magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with Volume Reconstruction (SVR) has been developed for imaging moving subjects at high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The method combines registered 2-D slices from sequential dynamic single-shot scans. The SVR approach requires that the anatomy in question is not changing shape or size and is moving at a rate that allows snapshot images to be acquired. After imaging the target volume repeatedly to guarantee sufficient sampling every where, a robust slice-to-volume registration method has been implemented that achieves alignment of each slice within 0.3 mm in the examples tested. Multilevel scattered interpolation has been used to obtain high-fidelity reconstruction with root-mean-square (rms) error that is less than the noise level in the images. The SVR method has been performed successfully for brain studies on subjects that cannot stay still, and in some cases were moving substantially during scanning. For example, awake neonates, deliberately moved adults and, especially, on fetuses, for which no conventional high-resolution 3-D method is currently available. Fine structure of the in-utero fetal brain is clearly revealed for the first time and substantial SNR improvement is realized by having many individually acquired slices contribute to each voxel in the reconstructed image.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I MAGING in the presence of subject motion has been an ongoing challenge for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Motion makes MRI data inconsistent, causing artifacts in conventional multishot imaging methods. Where motion is approximately periodic, such as in the heart, time gated methods can be effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. For more complex motions or nonperiodic behavior data has been prospectively or retrospectively corrected using motion estimates from navigators or external motion sensors. Navigators and external optical trackers have been used extensively for cardiac imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and for brain imaging both to deal with large motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and to correct motion induced errors in diffusion imaging where sensitivity to motion is greatly enhanced <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Other related methods use k-space sampling strategies that contain repeated samples so that data consistency can be enforced. Examples include motion compensation projection-reconstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, self navigated spiral imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and PROPELLER <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. More recently, general methods based on matrix formulations have been developed for motion artifact correction when there is localized or nonlinear spatial change <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. These make use of array coil data to enforce self consistency or external measurements to directly estimate motion or other parameters.</p><p>An alternative approach is to freeze subject motion using rapid snapshot imaging, in which the data for complete images is acquired in a short period of time, often using single shot multiecho techniques. Extended spatial coverage is achieved by sequential acquisition, usually one slice at a time. This approach has found favor in diffusion and perfusion imaging and for time course studies such as in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Traditionally in fMRI, motion correction is performed in postprocessing by applying affine (usually rigid body) registration to successive blocks of slices covering the whole brain volume in a time series <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>; averaging the corrected volumes together generates a mean template image that can be used to further improve registration accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. A problem with this kind of volume-to-volume registration can occur if severe motionui happens during the acquisition of multislice packages, since then individual volumes may be substantially inconsistent and so undermine the motion correction scheme. In addition, the snapshot images are frequently acquired with small gaps between slices, so that there may be insufficiently dense sampling to accurately interpolate the data when it is resliced to correct for changes in subject position <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>This work was motivated by the challenge of fetal brain imaging. Current practice in fetal brain imaging by MRI is to use single shot methods to freeze fetal motion and so acquire individual slices that are relatively free of motion artifacts. Early work used echo planar imaging (EPI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, but more recently single shot fast spin echo (ssFSE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> methods have been widely adopted because they offer improved tolerance of magnetic field inhomogeneity and do not require fat suppression. Real-time user interactive ssTSE sequences that employ driven equilibrium to realign transverse magnetization remaining at the final echo have also been introduced to assist the MR technologist image the fetus that changes position by interactively controlling parameters such as slice position, orientations, field-of-view, and the slice thickness <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Imaging is normally performed with array receiver coils that envelop the mothers' abdomen to improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and these also allow parallel imaging methods (e.g., SENSE, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>) to be used to shorten the echo train lengths and so increase resolution. Following acquisition of scout images, a series of parallel slices is prescribed that cover the fetal brain, but fetal motion during acquisition frequently results in spatially variable views from slice to slice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This precludes viewing the fetal brain as a self consistent 3-D structure [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b)-(d)</ref>] and limits analysis to subjective interpretation, measurements in single slices only or statistical approaches. It is quite common to scan while the mother holds her breath to minimize motion between shots, but this limits the time available for individual brain acquisitions to about 20 s. This single shot approach has proved robust and highly practical for clinical work <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, but has to be operated at limited resolution (typically 1.4 mm) with moderate slice thickness (typically 4 mm) to ensure full brain coverage in a breathhold and adequate SNR in the individual images. In addition, because of fetal motion it is common to repeat individual acquisitions multiple times to achieve sufficient images in standard anatomical planes required to facilitate radiological interpretation. Each dataset requires its own manual placement based on the most recent evidence of fetal position and orientation, so that examinations may become extended even though the final images used were acquired in a few seconds.</p><p>Multishot motion corrected methods could offer the benefit of increased SNR and resolution, but achieving data consistency is complicated by the differential motion of the fetus and mother, which makes simple motion models unsuitable for correction of k-space data, and the need for any motion detection method to track movements in all six degrees-of-freedom (three translations and three rotations) for every shot.</p><p>To achieve high-resolution 3-D brain images of the fetal brain, we have developed a complementary approach that uses dynamic single shot scanning to sample the spatial region containing the brain with multiple overlapping slices. Repeated sampling of slice planes makes it highly probable that every part of the fetal brain is sampled even when there is significant motion. Image registration is then used to retrospectively align the images obtained based on the assumption that they represent a single rigid body undergoing an unknown motion. Having determined the correct location of each image in a self consistent anatomical space of the fetal brain, we regard the measured voxel intensities from all the slices as valid samples at known although irregularly spaced locations and use a scattered interpolation approach to reconstruct an optimal estimate of the 3-D fetal brain. The final result is a 3-D image dataset on a Cartesian voxel lattice that can then be resliced into any desired plane for viewing or analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. A related approach using different registration and reconstruction methods as well as different sampling, i.e., acquisition pattern has recently been presented <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In their application, nonoverlapping slices with 3-mm-slice thickness from all three orthogonal orientations were acquired first. Then, a local optimization method with normalized mutual information (NMI) as its cost function was performed for motion correction. In the final reconstruction, a weighted mean of signal values within a local neighborhood was calculated as the intensity on a regular grid using a Gaussian kernel.</p><p>We term this concept of using dynamic single shot slice by slice imaging combined with retrospective alignment and data fusion to produce self consistent 3-D volume images snapshot MRI with volume reconstruction or SVR. Although inspired by fetal scanning it has wide application to imaging moving objects that can be assumed to have a constant shape, particularly when there may be other objects in the field-of-view that undergo differential motion and/or changes in shape. We have, therefore, tested the method in the general context of imaging the brains of subjects who cannot remain sufficiently still for conventional MRI examinations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. METHOD</head><p>Consider an unknown 3-D structure undergoing an unknown motion. We will restrict the discussion to structures that can be treated as rigid bodies, changing position and orientation during the examination, but not changing in shape, size, or signal properties. We shall take the brain as an exemplar of such structures. The scenario of interest involves motion that is fast enough to preclude conventional high-resolution 3-D MRI, but slow enough to allow snapshot imaging methods such as EPI or ssFSE to produce individual high-quality images. An example is illustrated for in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Here, the fetal brain is the rigid body and each acquired snapshot image is an accurate sample of the anatomy being imaged, although successive slices do not form a consistent representation. Note that the surrounding tissues of the mother's abdomen are also changing nonrigidly in a way that is not necessarily correlated with the fetal motion. Working in the image domain it is possible to segment the anatomy of interest and separate it from the rest of the field of view. The acquired slices consist of voxels which have a measured intensity at prescribed positions in the scanner frame of reference,</p><p>. We now adopt a 3-D Cartesian coordinate system fixed relative to the anatomy of interest. This coordinate frame is moving relative to the scanner coordinate frame. The acquired voxel data are legitimate samples in , but at unknown locations . Because of the motion the samples are irregularly spaced in . Provided their locations can be determined and the samples are sufficiently dense throughout the region of interest in , data interpolation can be used to generate a full representation on a regular Cartesian lattice in . Successful reconstruction of a 3-D representation that can then be reformatted into any desired plane thus has three requirements.</p><p>1) Sufficient samples in to allow full representation of the structure. 2) Determination of the mapping from to for each sample.</p><p>3) Interpolation of the scattered, irregularly spaced samples onto a regularly sampled 3-D image</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Achieving the Required Sample Density</head><p>We first consider the case of a static brain imaged with 2-D slices. The slice data will be acquired with a single shot technique. In practice, we used a single shot fast spin echo (ssFSE) sequence with half Fourier acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and SENSE <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. In the slice plane, the data is acquired in the Fourier domain with k-space sampled at the Nyquist spacing for the desired field of view up to a maximum value that sets the in plane resolution. The acquisition sequence is single shot, so there will be some signal modulation across k-space. In the absence of this, there would be equal weighting of all k-space samples and the image domain point spread function (PSF) would be a Sinc function. The actual signal is likely to be attenuated at higher spatial frequencies so the spectral content will be slightly attenuated and the PSF will also be slightly modified. The images are strictly bandlimited.</p><p>In the through slice direction, the PSF is the slice profile. Following Noll <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, we view slice selection as a process of first convolving the target anatomy with the slice profile, and then sampling the resulting modified structure. Each selected slice is then a single sample, and the sampling density required to ensure there is no spectral aliasing is determined by the spectral content of the slice profile. The traditional idealized rectangular profile has an extended spectrum requiring very dense spatial sampling which would be very inefficient. However, use of a softer slice profile, such as a Gaussian, results in a more practical sampling requirement. In practice, we measured the slice profile produced by the ssFSE sequence and found it approximately Gaussian. In this case, sampling at intervals of about half the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the slice profile is required. We, therefore, adopt a strategy of imaging with slices separated by FWHM. It is then logical to regard as the nominal resolution length in the slice direction.</p><p>Since the objective is to produce a 3-D image volume we choose imaging parameters that result in approximately isotropic resolution. For the in-plane Sinc PSF the FWHM of the central peak is 1.2 and the first zero crossings are separated by 2 , where is the acquired pixel resolution. In what follows, we generally set . Thus, the 3-D PSF is anisotropic with a central peak that is slightly narrower in the in-plane direction, but is more localized in the slice selection direction. The sampling strategy ensures full sampling in all three dimensions and the effective maximum spectral content is approximately equal in all directions, although the k-space filtering is likely to be more pronounced in the slice select direction.</p><p>In the proposed application, the brain to be imaged may move between individual slice acquisitions. This causes uneven slice samples when viewed in the anatomical reference frame and is likely to result in violation of the Nyquist sampling criterion at some locations. To avoid this problem, the target volume in is repeatedly imaged by simply looping through all slice positions so that in the absence of motion each location is sampled multiple times. We refer to each complete set of slices spanning as a loop. The number of loops required depends on the motion. In these experiments, we used four to eight loops.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Determine the Mapping from to for Each Sample</head><p>A multitime scale registration and combination approach is employed to determine the transformation from laboratory coordinates to anatomy coordinates for each slice.</p><p>The data is first divided into temporally contiguous blocks each containing multiple slices that together provide full coverage of the volume of of interest (i.e., 1 loop). Neglecting subject motion, these slice blocks are treated as 3-D volumes and registered together using rigid body transformations. One block is chosen as the target for these registrations. For cases of extreme motion the volume with least motion, i.e., the loop that is most self-consisted when viewed from three dimensions, is chosen as registration target.</p><p>Once the data is aligned, it is combined together to form an average data set. The time scale is then reduced so the data is divided into subpackages that are temporally contiguous although the slices in each subpackage may not be spatially contiguous. These subpackages are each registered to the average brain created form the rest of the data using the previously determined transformations. Since the slices in a subpackage may not be adjacent to one another, the registration process involves moving the subpackage with the average brain held fixed in space. When the transformations of all subpackages have been determined, an updated average brain is calculated. The time scale is then reduced again and the process repeated until each slice is treated in isolation and registered to the latest estimate of the brain composed of all the other slices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Interpolation of Irregular Sampled Data</head><p>Having determined the correct spatial alignment of the slice data it must be combined into a single 3-D space . Each acquired slice pixel is a valid sample of the brain being imaged and its location is known as a consequence of the image registration process. Because of the motion these samples are irregularly scattered in and if sufficient loops have been obtained we expect there to be samples separated by or less everywhere, so that the underlying structure is fully sampled at the imaging resolution. To convert from this scattered data to a regular Cartesian grid of samples requires interpolation. The required interpolator must preserve spectral content to avoid blurring the final reconstruction or introducing intensity errors. An ideal interpolator from this perspective is a Sinc convolution with unlimited support, but this is computationally expensive, so other interpolators may be preferred (see later). An alternative approach was adopted by Rousseau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and in our early work on the SVR method <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, in which a model of the slice profile is used as an interpolator specifically in the slice direction. A Gaussian slice profile was used in both methods, however this can substantially reduce spatial frequency content and result in excessive blurring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. IMPLEMENTATION AND VALIDATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Acquisition Details</head><p>Fetal brain images were acquired on a Philips 1.5 T Intera system. Test data and images of the brains of neonates, children, and adults were acquired at 3 T. The basic sequence uses ssFSE methods with half Fourier data collection to acquiring multiple T2 weighted 2-D slices. The imaging was performed as dynamic loops with the scanner operating continuously to acquire parallel slices at a rate of about 1/s. The scans were specified as loops of continuous and overlapping slices with slice thickness 2 and slice gap -to allow slice separation and dense sampling as described before. Slices were acquired in four packages and within each packages starting at one extreme end in an interleaved order, i.e., 1,17,33,49,5 , 2,18,34,50,6, , 3,19,35,51,7, , and 4,20,36,52,8, to avoid slice crosstalk by ensuring that for each slice the previously excited closest slices were separated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> and sequentially acquired. For a slice acquisition rate of /s with 60 slices covering the region of interest the total loop time would be 60 s and for each acquired slice the closest slices were excited at least 15 s previously or subsequently so that the relaxation history in the vicinity of the current slice is effectively uniform.</p><p>For fetal imaging at 1.5 T, the echo time (TE) was chosen as 120 ms to achieve good grey/white matter contrast while the repeat time (TR) was kept as the shortest (typically 1046 ms) to minimize acquisition time. The echo train length was 90 and a SENSE factor of 1.5 was used to acquire images with in-plane resolution of 1.08 1.45 mm. The slice thickness (2 ) was reduced from our clinical standard of 4 mm to 2.5-2.8 mm depending on the maturity of the fetus. Sixty overlapping slices gave sufficient spatial coverage. Images were acquired using a 4 channel torso array coil with the mother free breathing and without sedation. Images were automatically intensity corrected using knowledge of the coil sensitivity profile.</p><p>Both the adult and neonatal images were acquired on a Philips 3 T Intera system using the standard 6 channel SENSE head array coil. The basic dynamic scanning pattern were the same as for the 1.5 T studies, with protocols modified according to different T2 values of the brain tissues with age and at 3 T. For adult studies, T2 weighted ssFSE images were acquired with ms, in-plane resolution 0.98 0.98 mm and slice thickness (2 ) 2-2.8 mm depending on required image quality and scanning time. For neonatal studies, ms and acquired in-plane resolution 0.98 0.98 mm, slice thickness (2 ) 2 mm was used to achieve both high Grey/White matter contrast and final isotropic reconstruction of mm. In both the 1.5 T and 3 T studies, either four or eight basic loops of dynamic scans were acquired in a transverse orientation. We also acquired sagittal and coronal slices in blocks of four loops to explore the effects of combining data from different imaging plane orientations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Subjects</head><p>Twenty fetuses including eighteen singletons and two twins were examined with gestational age between 19 and 35 weeks. Eleven were diagnosed from ultrasound and conventional fetal MRI as normal while four had enlarged ventricles and one had a reduced cerebellum. All examinations were performed with approval from the local research ethics committee.</p><p>Two adult volunteer studies were performed in which the subject deliberately moved almost every second involving both translations of a few millimeters and rotations of up to 15 . Two neonatal brain studies were performed in which the subject was awake and moving during scanning. These latter cases were performed at the end of standard examinations in which the neonate woke up prematurely perhaps as a result of the acoustic noise from the scanner.</p><p>Additional adult data were acquired at 1.5 T with the same protocol as those used for fetal scanning to explore possible effects of slice bending when the slice orientation was changed.</p><p>The fetal brain images were preprocessed to isolate the region containing the head from the womb using ImageJ<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> by roughly tracing the edge of the head manually while excluding the outside maternal tissue. For a fetal data set consisting of 60 slices, the whole process takes around 20 min. All slices were inspected and the occasional slices that were corrupted by in-plane motion were excluded before registration and reconstruction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Registration Algorithm</head><p>The method requires individual 2-D slices to be registered to a 3-D volume. This is a difficult problem, particularly in the premature brain which has less complex patterns of sulcation than adult brains. Accordingly, a brute force search method was developed based on a multistart, multiresolution approach using the Powell method to optimize each transformation parameter in turn. Because the data has consistent contrast properties, cross correlation was chosen as an appropriate cost function <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Mean square difference could also be used as the cost function, but this place more rigorous constraints on the signal levels in the slices remaining precisely matched. Mutual information or normalized mutual information are also possible choices, however, these are less robust optimizers for same contrast images.</p><p>For the fetal data registration, the initial range of angles tested was typically to 18 degree of rotation in all three directions to ensure that the possible motion of the fetus is covered. In later stages, finer ranges of rotation can be accepted to accelerate registration, as the starting estimate is known with increasing confidence. We used to 9 degree of rotations for the second stage, to 6 degree rotations for the third and to 4 degree rotations for the fourth. At the final single slice stage, to 2 degree rotations are used. Cubic Bspline interpolation is used at the final stage of multispatial resolution and multistart stack/slice to volume registration algorithm, while at the previous stages, trilinear interpolation is used. Detailed procedures about the complete multitime scale registration and combination algorithm are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> For registration of the adult and neonatal data, the same algorithm was used with different rotation ranges for each stage, since the head motion generally covers a smaller range of translations and rotations than for the fetus. Therefore, after initial volume-to-volume registration, a narrower range of rotations was adopted (e.g., to 9 or to 6), and some stages with intermediate numbers of slices could be skipped to save computational time. If severe motion does occur, strictly following the fetal registration scheme provides excellent results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Interpolation Reconstruction Details</head><p>Having identified the correct location of each acquired 2-D slice in 3-D anatomical space a reconstruction from scattered data is required. We adopted an optimized multilevel scattered data interpolation method using B-spline refinement to a control lattice hierarchy <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> to calculate intensity values on a regular 3-D grid. The use of cubic B-splines can allow both high accuracy and computational efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>Scattered data interpolation refers to the problem of fitting a smooth surface through a scattered, or nonuniform, distribution of data samples. The goal of interpolation is to reconstruct an underlying function (e.g., surface or volume) that may be evaluated at any desired set of positions. This serves to smoothly propagate the information associated with the scattered data onto all positions in the domain.</p><p>Let be a cuboid domain in the --space in the target image coordinates defined in the registration scheme. Consider a set of scattered points in a 4-D space</p><p>, where is a scattered point in and is the corresponding pixel intensity. We define to be an lattice of control points with control point spacing 1 that spans an integer grid in . Let be the value of the control point on lattice , located at ( , , ) for . An image intensity approximation function is defined in terms of these control points by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where and . are uniform cubic B-spline basis functions defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> where . In contrast to thin-plate splines <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> or elastic-body splines <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, B-splines are locally controlled, which makes them computationally efficient even for a large number of control points. In particular, the basis functions of cubic B-spline have a limited support, i.e., changing control point affects the approximation only in the local 4 4 4 neighborhood of itself. The density of control lattice overlaid on domain directly affects the shape of approximation function . As becomes coarser, the proximity data set of each control point covers a larger number of points in . This causes many data points to be blended together to yield a smoother shape for at the expense of approximation accuracy. However, as becomes finer, the influence of a control point is limited to smaller neighborhoods and is ever more closely approximated.</p><p>In the multilevel B-spline approximation, a hierarchy of control point meshes , at difference control point spacing are used (in this case we progressively halved the lattices spacing) starting with the coarsest control lattice . The resulting function provides a smooth initial approximation that possibly leaves large discrepancies at the data points in . In particular, leaves a deviation for each point in . The next finer control point lattice is then used to obtain function that approximates the difference . Then, the sum yields a smaller deviation and so on. In general, for a level in the hierarchy, we derive function by using control lattice to approximate data , where and the final approximation function is defined as the sum of functions , i.e., . The density of the finest lattice controls the precision with which approximates the data points. When is sufficiently fine compared to the data distribution, can interpolate the data without an approximation error by exactly fitting splines to every data point. Since the neighboring data points are likely to come from different acquired slices they have independent additive noise. The choice of final lattice spacing controls a trade off between preserving fine structure and suppressing noise by data aggregation. The optimal lattice spacing will just accommodate the actual acquired resolution so that structure is preserved while noise propagation is minimized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Test Data for Registration and Reconstruction Accuracy</head><p>In order to test the accuracy of slice-to-volume registration, we first used a set of adult MR images scanned with a T2-W ssFSE protocol using a T/R head coil. During a single examination with the subject remaining as still as possible, four sets each of transverse, sagittal, and coronal multi-2-D stacks were acquired with in-plane resolution 0.9 0.9 mm, slice thickness 2.5 mm. Each stack was angulated away from its standard plane by varying amounts up to 30 to simulate the effects of variations in head position that would be caused by motion. One stack out of these 12 was chosen as the target volume. Every fourth slice from the other stacks was extracted and treated in isolation, providing equally spaced example slices that covered the majority of the brain. Each of the individual slices was registered to the target volume using slice-to-volume registration.</p><p>In a second set of experiments, we used a dataset acquired from the brain of a preterm neonate scanned at similar gestational age (30 weeks) to the fetuses in the study. This neonate was scanned with T2 TSE protocol using the 6 channel SENSE head coil at 3T. The in-plane resolution is 0.98 0.98 mm while the prescribed slice thickness was 2 mm with 1 mm slice separation. One loop of overlapping slices were acquired and reconstructed to form a 3-D volume of 0.98 mm 0.98 mm 1 mm, which was considered as the true object (gold standard neonatal data). The noise standard deviation (STD) in this data was 19 with the maximum intensity value 1510 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> top row). This data was used both to test registration accuracy and reconstruction fidelity. For the registration tests slices were extracted from the gold standard data using cubic B-spline interpolation at locations determined from registration results obtained from one of the fetal subjects. This produced a corrupted dataset with known motion history that included estimates of both the induced motion caused by the mother's respiration and the motion of the fetus itself. The model contained sudden motions and the rotation range was wide, up to 20 . This synthesized data consisted either of eight loops of transverse slices or of four loops of transverse, two loops of coronal, and two loops of sagittal slices. All the data was then processed in the standard way.</p><p>To test the reconstruction accuracy, a set of scattered data samples was created by sampling the gold standard object at random positions in all three dimensions. The number of samples was eight times the number of gold standard voxels and the maximum sample separation was equal to the gold standard voxel size, so the data was both over-sampled and dense. This scattered data was then reconstructed onto a regular grid using the multilevel scattered data approximation and compared with the gold standard.</p><p>For both the registration and reconstruction tests noise was added to the gold standard data to recreate SNR levels similar as that of the actual fetal scans at 1.5 T. To cover the entire neonatal brain required 72 slices for each loop in the transverse orientation, 80 slices for each loop in the coronal orientation, and 64 slices for each loop in the sagittal orientation to be synthesized.</p><p>Registration accuracy for the adult data was assessed by visual comparison of the anatomy in the slices and the aligned volumes and directly compared with the gold standard-volume-tovolume registration. For the synthesized motion data, the square root of the mean square (rms) difference in millimeters between the registration transformation for each slice and the known input transformation of that slice was used as a figure of merit. This is measured on a set of four points at the corners of a box within the brain tissue of size 100 100 mm for each slice as follows:</p><p>where TRE is the target registration error defined as . denotes the estimated geometric transformation and denotes the known input transformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Reconstruction fidelity was assessed visually using difference images and by calculating the voxel-by-voxel rms difference between the gold standard and the reconstruction signal intensities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Test Data for Control Point Spacing in the Scattered Data Interpolation</head><p>After the slices have all been aligned, the data has voxel signals at a set of scattered points, so although the resolution remains unchanged, the data samples may be much more closely spaced. Each data point has a noise contribution so the spatial frequency content of the noise may be larger than that of the data and there is a tradeoff to be made between the reconstruction resolution and SNR. Ideally, the reconstructed resolution would equal the acquired resolution. To determine the optimal control point spacing for the spline interpolation methods employed 1-D simulation experiments were performed. A gold standard band limited model of a point object was created with a uniform spatial frequency pass band of 127 units. This was zero filled 16 fold and Fourier transformed to produce a 16 times oversampled PSF [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4(a)</ref>]. Independent Gaussian noise with zero mean and standard deviation of 8% of the peak signal was added to every sample point, then 50% of the points were selected at random to produce a trial dataset. This data was then reconstructed back onto a regular grid using the finest control point spacings from 1 unit (the actual resolution of the bandlimited gold standard) to units in steps decreasing by a factor 2 each time, given the coarsest control point spacing fixed as 8 units. The results were compared to the noise free gold standard in the image space and in k-space.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. SNR Test</head><p>The effect of data compounding and of the reconstruction on SNR and resolution were also tested with the neonatal dataset. Four copies of the data were created with regular samples at unit intervals, but shifted progressively by 1/4 of a slice thickness in the slice direction and with independent Gaussian noise added. Another numerical experiment was performed by adding independent Gaussian noise with increasing STD to the synthesized motion corrupted neonatal dataset to create data sets with SNR 11, 8.3, and 6.7 corresponding to SNR values for slice thicknesses of 3.3, 2.5, and 2 mm, respectively, at typical 1.5 T performance. These data were then reconstructed by SVR and compared to the original data.</p><p>Finally, motion corrupted fetal, neonatal and adult data sets were each reconstructed by SVR using a final lattice control point spacing of 0.5 ( slice spacing in the scanner frame). The reconstruction programs were written in C++ and processing was done on a 1-GHz Pentium PC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Slice-to-Volume Registration Accuracy</head><p>The slice-to-volume registration algorithm correctly placed randomly selected slices into corresponding 3-D volumes in all cases tested even when given no initial guess, although, a reasonable starting point allows use of a smaller search range, dramatically accelerating the optimization process. When tested on adult and neonatal data for which a ground truth could be known, the rigid body transformation determined by 2-D to 3-D registration was in excellent agreement with the reference 3-D to 3-D registration using Image Registration Toolkit<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> which we used as a gold standard since the same 2-D slices were then registered as part of 3-D volumes (see Table <ref type="table">I</ref>). It was found to be accurate to 0.2 mm (STD 0.2 mm) in translation and 0.2 deg (STD 0.2 deg) in rotation, and anatomical correspondence was confirmed by detailed visual comparison.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Reconstruction Accuracy and Interpolation Trade Off-Resolution Versus SNR</head><p>Results from the 1-D simulation are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. It is clear that with control points at unit intervals (i.e., the original resolution) there is a substantial loss of spatial frequency content [blue line in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4(b)</ref>]. Reducing the control point spacing recovers bandwidth Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>(b) and, hence, signal fidelity Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4(a</ref>), but at the cost of SNR Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>(a). Based on these results, we adopted a control point spacing of 0.5 the acquisition resolution.</p><p>A reconstruction form randomly located samples of the gold standard neonatal data interpolated back to a regular grid using a finest control point spacing of 0.5 voxel size is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> (second row). The difference images (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, bottom row) show the distribution of errors, which were located at edges (intensity gradients) as would be expected. The rms error was 13, which was less than the standard deviation of the noise in the original data , so that such errors would not generally be detectable in a real case. The efficiency of the reconstruction is dependent on the hierarchy chosen-selecting a large initial control point spacing allows rapid initial convergence assisting in successive approximation to the final desired result, but requires more iterations of the algorithm. In practice, we found that a control point hierarchy with six levels starting from 16 times of the actual resolution and decreasing progressively until half actual resolution was effective. It takes 3 min to reconstruct a 128 128 60 volume on a 1-GHz Pentium PC.</p><p>The reconstructed SNR will be proportional to the square root of number of voxels that contribute to one reconstructed voxel. For instance, if the average contributing voxel number is 4, the SNR should double as compared to the input images (an improvement of 100%). The measured mean SNR improvement under this condition is 86.7% which is in reasonable agreement with this theoretical expectation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. SVR Accuracy</head><p>Tests of the registration accuracy using synthesized motion corrupted data consisting of four loops in a transverse orientation with each slice undergoing a different rigid motion showed that all 249 slices were positioned accurately with cross correlation values above 0.93 after the final registration step. Although the initial misalignment is up to 20 in rotations and the start rms error is up to 18 mm, all slices are well matched with a mean error of 0.13 (STD 0.33 ) in rotation and within 0.09 mm (STD 0.15 mm) in translation as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> and summarized in the top row of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref>. The rms error is reduced to an average 0.34 mm (STD 0.25 mm) with the maximum 1.68 mm (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">III</ref>). This leads to faithful reconstruction, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6(g)-(i)</ref>.</p><p>We found that these results were robust to the SNR of the individual images and the noise in the reconstructed image all almost Gaussian as well. Adding noise to decrease the SNR from 11 to 6.7 had no detectable effect on registration accurate, as the t-test for significant differences in mean error 0 gave for all parameters, i.e., three rotations and three translations. This decline in SNR would correspond to a decrease in slice thickness from 3.3 to 2 mm at constant in plane resolution. Provided the registration is correct, the reconstructed SNR will then depend on the number of loops contributing.</p><p>SVR reconstruction also preserved original high resolution while making the whole volume consistent in space as well as increase the SNR. We measured the edge sharpness in a phantom that has both sharp edge and simplex intensity pattern. It does   show almost identical sharpness at the edge. However, it is difficult to measure it in anatomy because of lots of different underlying tissues there. Thus, two profiles at the corresponding edge of both reconstructed volume and original slice are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7(j)-(k</ref>) besides the direct visual comparison. The edge sharpness in anatomy is well preserved as well.</p><p>It is perhaps surprising that the use of parallel acquired slices combined into a 3-D volume after each stage results in the correct slice offsets as this is the direction with least well defined information. We tested the benefit of using orthogonally acquired slices both in simulation and with prospectively acquired data. In the simulations with slices extracted from the gold standard data, the effect of replacing transverse slices with nominally sagittal and coronal acquired slices reduced the registration errors to 0.054 mm in translation and 0.17 in rotation and reduce the mean rms error to 0.1728 mm (see Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_1">III</ref>). Thus, addition of data from orthogonally selected slices can halve the registration errors and is particularly useful for the slices at the top and bottom of the volume, which are not well handled when only parallel acquired slice data is available. Moreover, as those top and bottom part of the volume are very likely to appear as the nonedge information from orthogonal orientations, include those orthogonal slices can increase the sampling in those areas and, therefore, lead to more faithful reconstruction. A reconstruction based on data from transverse, sagittal, and coronal slices is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6(m)-(o)</ref>. When compared to reconstruction based on similar amount of data but from transverse only [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>(j)-(l)], obviously improvement is found in the very top and bottom parts of the brain because of remarkable enhancement of registration accuracy there and increased sampling there as well. Whereas there is no noticeable difference other where as the registration accuracy and sampling are already sufficiently high [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>(q)-(r)].</p><p>However, for the 3 T acquired data on adult brain we found that changing slice orientation resulted in differences in the data that introduced errors larger than the registration uncertainties. We interpret this result as evidence of slice distortion caused by changing interactions between the image encoding gradients and background susceptibility effects caused by the subject being in the scanner. With similar gradient performance, such effects would be halved when imaging at 1.5 T, and in the adult brain data we collected we did not find this a significant problem at the lower field. We did not detect any slice distortion effects in the fetal data acquired, however since there is no motion free reference in this case we cannot rule this out.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Fetal Examples</head><p>All twenty fetal data was successfully reconstructed. Two examples are illustrated here to display reconstructed results with different acquired slice thickness and with only parallel slices or slices from all three orthogonal orientations. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> shows data from a fetus of 33 gestation weeks scanned using four dynamic loops of 60 2.8 mm slices (1.4 mm slice separation) prescribed as nominally in the transverse orientation. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> shows data from a less mature fetus of 28 gestation weeks combining four loops of transverse, two loops of coronal, and two loops of sagittal slices with slice thickness 2.5 mm and 1.25 mm slice separation. In these figures, the top row shows a single loop of the original fetal image data in a three-plane view (transverse, coronal and sagittal). Although the native (transverse) plane is as expected, the other views reveal motion corruption. Simply combining all the acquired slices without correcting for fetal motion resulted in blurred images (second row in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>).</p><p>At the final stage of image registration, Data 1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>) uses 208 slices and Data2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>) uses 327 slices. In each case, a 0.74 mm isotropic reconstruction of a 3-D self-consistent volume with improved SNR and high contrast between cortical grey and white matter is produced. Details of cortical folding and small structures in the cerebella are well displayed in all three planes (third row in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>). Additionally, when compared to preterm born infants scanned at similar gestational age but at 3 T (last row in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>), strong correlations in brain anatomy including cortical folding, deep white matter tracts and cerebellar structures can be found.</p><p>Although the original 2-D slices have poor SNR because of the thin slices used, the final reconstruction has an average of four slices from each loop contributing to each voxel, thus substantially improving the SNR. If four loops of transverse slices are used, the SNR in the reconstructed image is 87% higher than individual acquired slices and it is even 25% better than the conventional clinical scan with much thicker slice thickness of 4 mm. By using four loops of transverse slices plus two loops of coronal and two loops of sagittal slices, the final reconstructed SNR is almost 2.5 times that of the original slice data.</p><p>Since transformation required to place every image slice into the correct position in the final 3-D volume has been determined, we can calculate the distance from each reconstructed voxel location to the nearest actual data value and so can directly verify if the Nyquist criterion is satisfied. The result depends on the details of the motion of the fetus. In particular fetal motion can result in damaged data and we reject slices that are clearly motion corrupted. These can amount to between 15%-40% of the acquired slices depending on the severity of the motion However, as displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>, using the current 22 datasets we find that if only one loop was used, only 65.15% 10% of voxels in the final reconstructed image have at least one sampled point within each cubic reconstructed voxel. The fully sampled fraction increases with increasing numbers of loops, and reaching 94% 3% for four loops and 98% 1% for the minority of cases where we have up to eights loops. Use of a hierarchical B-spline reconstruction ensures that reconstruction can always operate at the resolution supported by the local sample density.</p><p>The motion parameters determined as part of the reconstruction provide a direct record of the trajectory of the fetal brain during the scanning period. As the dynamic scan is performed sequentially with the mother free-breathing and without any sedation, this may provide useful information about how the fetus behaved naturally during this period of time. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref> illustrates the motion history of Data 2 as represented by displacements of the central location of the brain. The periodic fluctuations may be associated with maternal respiration. This is the basic motion pattern that we used to synthesize simulated motion corrupted images with preterm neonatal data for validating the methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Fetal Cortical Rendering</head><p>Surface rendering using MRICro<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> was performed based on current eleven normal subjects to view the in-utero fetal cortical development, as displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>. It is obvious that in addition to the visible volume growth with GA, the cortical folding has also changed dramatically. Starting from GA 19 weeks plus five days and until GA 23 weeks, the superior cortex is very smooth. Later on, at GA 27 weeks, it starts to fold; then GA 33 weeks and 35 weeks, complicated gyri and sulci are gradually developed. These surface rendered examples serve to illustrate the extra information that is made available by SVR method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Adult Examples</head><p>This method can also be applied to other brain studies in both children and adults, wherever motion is a problem. This has been first tried on an adult volunteer study in which the subject deliberately moved about once per second, including making head rotations of up to 15 . For comparison, images were also acquired with the same protocol while the subject was still. Because of this intense motion, some slice images were found to be degraded by movement during the single shot itself. All the slices that were not corrupted by in-plane motion were accurately registered and used for reconstructing a 0.98 0.98 1.4 mm volume, which is almost identical to the motion free image with doubled SNR as displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">12</ref>. Thus, even in this extreme case, the method is able to recover detailed artifact free images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Neonatal Examples</head><p>A general application of SVR can be found in pediatric MR scanning including both neonates, who may move during natural sleep or sedation and young children who have difficulty staying still during scanning. By prescribing the slices as overlapped in their native planes, there is full sampling even if the subject does not move. Then no registration is needed, but reconstruction can still improve the image quality by doubling the SNR. However, if the neonate does move as displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13</ref>, this method can correct motion for each 2-D slice and then achieve 3-D coherent imaging with 1 mm isotropic resolution and almost doubled SNR. The result compares well with   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</head><p>We have described a novel methodology, SVR, for imaging moving subject at high resolution and high SNR by combining registered 2-D slices from sequential dynamic single-shot scans. The SVR method requires that the anatomy in question is not changing shape or size and is moving at a rate that allows snapshot images to be acquired. It has been performed successfully on neonates, adults, and especially on fetuses, for which no conventional high resolution 3-D method is currently available. Fine structure of the in-utero fetal brain is clearly revealed for the first time and substantial SNR improvement is realized by having many individually acquired slices contribute to each voxel in the reconstructed image. Employing images obtained with the same protocol also guarantees the same pattern of contrast and intensity for all slices, thus no contrast correction is necessary. A striking feature of the method is that registration to a target 3-D volume consisting of the compounded slices has been found to be robust and even though the native orientation of all slices is parallel, each slice can be correctly located to produce an appropriate 3-D volume. Adding more information especially from orthogonal orientations can further improve reconstruction accuracy, but may also be compromised by differential slice distortion in images acquired in orthogonal planes, particularly at higher field strength. The registration process was found to be robust in the presence of noise, so that thinner higher resolution slice data can be used without loss of accuracy in the position estimation. In fact it seems that the limiting factors for slice thickness are that thinner slices imply more slices to achieve the same coverage and this makes the process slower and, even with signal compounding, the SNR of the final images may be too low to be acceptable. This is obviously highly application dependent.</p><p>The other key feature of the SVR method is data interpolation to combine scattered data from realigned slices into a regular grid for the final reconstructed images. The data may contain samples that are spatially very close together, and because these may come from separately acquired slices, they are subject to uncorrelated noise. The interpolation method should thus provide just sufficient spatial frequency bandwidth to faithfully reconstruct at the acquired resolution, but should not have excessive bandwidth because this increases the noise in the final reconstruction. Many interpolators could be used. We chose a cubic B-spline approach because it is computationally efficient as a result of the limited region of support it requires. Simulations were used to determine the required control point spacing to achieve the desired matched resolution and noise performance. Superresolution approaches have been proposed by Peled et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> to calculate high-resolution images from a set of spatially shifted, low-resolution images In this work, we have adopted a simpler strategy. By matching the sampling density and associated slice thickness to the in plane Fourier resolution we have endeavored to create isotropical sampled data within the limits of the different point spread functions in plane and through plane. We combined these using an interpolation method designed to preserve spatial frequency content, so that the final 3-D image data has approximately isotropic resolution combined with avoiding signal-to-noise ration penalties that can occur when higher spatial frequencies are accentuated by post processing.</p><p>In addition to the structural information available from SVR images, the registration process also yields directly information about the motion history of the object of study. This could be useful for dynamic studies, such as for observing fetal motion.</p><p>The price of the benefits offered by this technique is increased scan time to allow multiple loops to be acquired. In the case of fetal scanning, since no breath hold or sedation is required, this has been found to be easily tolerated by the subjects scanned so far. In fact, the total examination time can often be reduced in cases where the fetus is very active because in such circumstances it is often necessary to attempt to scan desired planes repeatedly because changes in position means that the expected anatomy is not seen in the images obtained. The ability to acquire data with certainty that it will yield artifact free images allows a reduction in set up time and in repeated examinations that can in fact increase examination efficiency. For adult and pediatric subjects, the method offers a capability to obtain highquality volume data even when the subject is unable to cooperate with the examination and may be moving by many millimeters or turning by many degrees during the acquisition period. Validation using both adult and neonate simulated data has been performed to verify that the results obtained are consistent with the known ground truth and the reconstruction faithful.</p><p>The capability to observe the fetal brain in-utero using high resolution, high contrast images provides a new opportunity to study the developing human brain and will allow direct comparison between preterm and post partum brains for the first time. This is likely not only to be a very valuable clinical tool, but it will also empower studies employing volumetric and morphometric approaches that may lead to new insights into the process of human brain development. It will also allow detailed comparison between fetuses and preterm neonates at the same gestational age imaged with the same sequences and processed in the same way. This may be an essential tool for further understanding the effects of prematurity on brain development. An example of the new information that is available is seen in the surface rendered images of the cortex shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>.</p><p>Working on the image domain and relying on standard single-shot sequences with standard reconstructions make this method straightforward to implement and widely applicable to existing MRI facilities. This should allow the method to be easily adopted for use in cases where subject motion compromises conventional imaging or makes it impossible. Although extensive postprocessing is involved and at present this is too slow to allow real time presentation of the final results, the native images produced by the snapshot sequence are available on the scanner console so that an intermediate assessment can immediately be obtained by directly viewing the source. So far we have only extensively tested the method with ssFSE T2 weighted images, but other rapid sequences such as EPI, snapshot FLASH and balanced fast field echo, and other contrasts are likely to equally suitable.</p><p>Semi-automated segmentation method for extracting the fetal brain from the rest of the maternal images has been explored. We first roughly segment one loop of the fetal brain, typically the one that initially considered as the target, and then run a registration based segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> to segment slices from the other loops. This will be interleaved with the current registration process allowing both registration and segmentation to be iteratively improved.</p><p>In summary, the SVR method provides a robust technique for imaging moving structures that behave as rigid bodies and so do not change size or shape. Brain imaging in uncooperative subjects is a clear application with fetal imaging as a particularly exciting exemplar. However, other applications including bone imaging are possible. It may also be feasible to extend the method to work with less constrained realignment strategies, such as to allow correction of slice distortion. An appealing feature of the method is that it can readily accommodate scenarios where there is differential change within the field of view. In these kinds of applications efficient segmentation methods will be required to avoid extensive manual intervention in what is otherwise a completely automatic process.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

(a) Displays enlarged detail of original noise free band limited object and results of the multilevel scattered interpolation given eight samples per original pixel with independent Gaussian noise added to each (mean = 0; STD = 50) with different finest control point lattice density 8 and (b) displays corresponding frequency characteristics. If 8 is only set to be the actual resolution, the bandwidth is not wide enough to reserve the high-frequency information as shown in blue. However, if 8 is 1=4 actual resolution or lower excessive high-frequency noise is retained. Choosing 8 with control point spacing at half the actual resolution provides a balance between preserving resolution and avoiding excessive noise reduced by factor 15.</figDesc><graphic coords="7,311.70,67.06,229.00,302.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>

Comparison of registration accuracy for rotations when using four transverse loops of transverse slices. Rotations determined by slice to volume registration closely follow the original ones even for excursions of up to 20 , and the majority of rotation differences were within 0.2 . Mean rotation difference in Rotation X(RX) was 0.0295 deg (STD 0.1538 deg), as shown in the bottom left figure.</figDesc><graphic coords="9,45.78,66.34,235.00,158.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>

(d)-(f) Display corresponding views of a simulated motion corrupted dynamic loop. Although the in-plane view retains high resolution, the other two orientations are damaged. (g)-(i) Corresponding views of reconstructed images using four-loops of transverse slices (249 slices in total). Anatomic details are faithfully recovered in all three orientations. Images (j)-(l) and (m)-(o) are corresponding views of reconstructed image using eight-loops of transverse slices (490 slices in total) and four-loops of transverse slices, two-loops of coronal slices, and two-loops of sagittal slices (492 slices in total). (p-r) Display signal differences between (a)-(c) and (g)-(i). The reconstruction achieved sharp edges in all three directions and they are almost identical to the gold standard. With eight-loops of slices the reconstruction result is better than just with four-loops [(j)-(l)] while adding orthogonal slices achieves improvement at the very top of the brain [(m)-(o)]. No obvious reconstruction difference (p-r) is observed in other parts of the brain where the registration is already accurate enough and the sampling is already sufficient even if only adopting slices from parallel orientation.</figDesc><graphic coords="10,122.94,65.26,357.00,191.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
