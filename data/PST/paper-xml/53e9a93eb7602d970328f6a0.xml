<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>A. History and Summary of the Literature I N THE WORLD of recursive control designs for nonlinear systems, two basic classes of systems are the most easily recognizable-the systems with (strict-)feedback structure and the systems with (strict-)feedforward structure. The strict-feedback systems, which occupied the attention of the nonlinear control community in the first half of the 1990s, are controlled using backstepping, a method that employs aggressive controls<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> necessary to suppress finite escape instabilities inherent (in open loop) to strict-feedback systems. In contrast, the strict-feedforward systems, which were studied intensively in the mid-and late-1990s, can be only marginally unstable in open loop, <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> and permit (and in many cases call for) cautious controllers.</p><p>The theoretical foundation of how to exercise "caution" in the control design for feedforward systems was laid out by Teel in his 1992 dissertation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, where he introduced the technique of nested saturations whose parameters are carefully selected to essentially achieve robustness of linear controllers to nonlinearities (of superlinear and other types). Soon after this first design, Teel <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> developed a series of results that, among other things, Manuscript received July 8, 2003; revised <ref type="bibr">January 15, 2004</ref>. Recommended by Associate Editor Z.-P. Jiang. This work was supported by the National Science Foundation.</p><p>The author is with the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0411 USA (e-mail: krstic@ucsd.edu).</p><p>Digital Object Identifier 10.1109/TAC.2004.835361 interpreted and generalized <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> in the light of nonlinear small gain techniques that he developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. The earliest use of the nonlinear small gain techniques as a design tool appears in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>The next major spurt of progress on feedforward systems came with <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, which introduced a Lyapunov approach for stabilization of feedforward systems. This approach, initially conceived in March 1993, has roots that go further back to Praly's 1991-1992 designs for adaptive nonlinear control <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and output feedback stabilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> where he was designing forwarding like coordinate changes involving a stable manifold that can be written as a graph of a function. A related idea was used by Sontag and Sussmann <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> for stabilization of linear systems with saturated controls. Recently, Praly et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> relaxed the conditions under which such manifolds can be found.</p><p>Jankovic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> developed a different Lyapunov solution to the problem of forwarding (and stabilization of a broad class of cascade systems), which, rather than a coordinate change or domination of (certain) "cross terms" (as Mazenc and Praly), employs an exact cross term in the Lyapunov function. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, they presented an algorithmic, inverse optimal design for a class of feedforward systems and provided a detailed insight into the structure of the target system in the forwarding recursion.</p><p>Further developments on feedforward systems have gone in several directions. The nested saturation ideas have been expanded upon by Lin and Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, Arcak et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, Marconi and Isidori <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and Xudong <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Implicit (or explicit) in the first three papers are robustness results with respect to certain classes of unmodeled dynamics. The Lyapunov approach has been developed further by Sepulchre et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, Mazenc et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and Mazenc and Praly <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Lin and Qian <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> proposed designs for systems satisfying certain growth conditions.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, Teel designed stabilizing controllers for feedforward systems ( disturbance attenuation, while impossible in general, remains a problem of interest for subclasses of feedforward systems). Trajectory tracking, while hard to achieve for arbitrary trajectories, has been solved under reasonable conditions by Mazenc and Praly <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and Mazenc and Bowong <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Extensions to nonlinear integrator chains have been proposed by Mazenc <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and Tsinias and Tzamtzi <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Even a generalization to feedforward systems with exponentially unstable linearizations has been reported by Grognard et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Discretetime feedforward systems have also been studied, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Linear low-gain semiglobal stabilization of feedforward systems was proposed by Grognard et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. An output feedback problem for feedforward systems was recently solved by Mazenc and Vivalda <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Feedforward systems do not lend themselves easily to adaptive control-one related result is by Jankovic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Nonparametric robust control, i.e., disturbance attenuation in the style of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> (for example) with disturbances entering through a nonlinear vector field, has so far remained intractable (except in the case when the vector field is constant).</p><p>Starting with Teel's original interest in the ball-and-beam problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> and Mazenc and Praly's design for the pendulumcart problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the research on forwarding has continuously been driven by applications. The following papers on forwarding are fully (or almost fully) dedicated to applications: <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> (pole-cart), <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> (ball-and-beam), <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> (spherical inverted pendulum), <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> (inverted pendulum with disk inertia), <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> (pendulum-cart), and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> (satellite orbit transfer with weak but continuous thrust).</p><p>Differential geometric characterization of feedforward systems has eluded researchers until recent major progress was reported by Tall and Respondek <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>For tutorial coverage of forwarding, the reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Some coverage of forwarding is also available in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Contribution and Organization of the Present Paper</head><p>The idea of exact forwarding coordinate transformations as a Lyapunov avenue toward performance improvement relative to the "cautious" saturation-based approaches first appeared in [26, Sec. IV]. However, it is not until the result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, which considers a special subclass of the systems studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, that this idea crystalized into a conceptually transparent, elegant recursive procedure, which is easy to compare with backstepping. Still, the crucial element that remained lacking in the procedure was computability. In principle, one has to solve (analytically) a series of nonlinear systems and compute (again analytically) a series of integrals. This paper is dedicated to providing closed-form solutions to these nonlinear systems and integrals.</p><p>We start in Section II by reviewing the Sepulchre-Jankovic-Kokotovic (SJK) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> design procedure. While it has been long believed that feedforward systems are "generically not feedback linearizable," in Section III we show that many of them are and provide a parametrization of linearizable feedforward systems. For those systems, the SJK procedure provides the needed change of coordinates, which is given explicitly in Section IV. The coordinate change does not require the solution of a series of nonlinear systems (as in the general SJK procedure) but does require analytical computation of a series of integrals. For two important subclasses of linearizable feedforward systems, those integrals are calculated explicitly in Sections V and VI. Second-and third-order examples of those classes of systems are presented in some detail in Section VII, shedding light on how typical, or atypical, linearizability is for feedforward systems. In Section VIII, we exploit the closed-form nature of the designs in Sections V and VI to develop closed-form SJK formulas for two classes of feedforward systems that are not linearizable, followed, in Section IX, by an example similar to (but more challenging than) the celebrated Kokotovic-Teel third-order "benchmark" example. The SJK procedure is extended to a class of "block-feedforward" systems in Section X, where closed-form feedback laws are also developed for two subclasses. Following an idea in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, interlacing of forwarding and backstepping is formalized for two classes of systems for which feedback linearization formulas are given in Section XI. Block-forwarding and interlacing are then all illustrated on an example (which is not feedback linearizable) in Section XII. Bounds on control effort are given in Section XIII. Finally, in Section XIV, we pose a question of how generic linearizability is within the feedforward class.</p><p>To keep this paper at reasonable length, we give the proofs very concisely. Throughout the paper, all of the plant nonlinearities are assumed to be Lipschitz continuous (or smoother, if specified).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SJK ALGORITHM</head><p>Consider the class of strict-feedforward systems </p><p>for . (This notation implies that .) Relative to the class of systems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> we make a trade of generality for conceptual clarity by requiring that the drift term be of the form , where the 's, in addition to being higher order, vanish whenever vanish. In Section IX we show that this restriction can be relaxed in some cases, however we keep it throughout most of the paper for notational and conceptual convenience. We note that (2) means, in particular, that . The control law for this class of systems is designed as follows. <ref type="bibr">Let</ref> . For , see (3)-( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) as shown at the bottom of the page, where the</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(3) (4) (5) (6)</formula><p>notation in the integrand of (6) refers to the solutions of the (sub)system(s) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> for , at time , starting from the initial condition . The control law is <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> It is important to first understand the meaning of the integral in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Clearly, the solution is impossible to obtain analytically in general. Dealing with this issue is the main subject of this paper. Note that the last of the 's that need to be computed is ( is not defined). The stability analysis of the closed-loop system is straightforward. Starting with the observation that , it is easy to verify that . Noting from ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) that <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> we get (note that this notation implies that</p><p>). Taking the Lyapunov function , one obtains <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> Theorem 1: <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> The feedback system (1), ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) is globally asymptotically stable at the origin.</p><p>Although the proof of this theorem is available in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, we provide some of its elements here for two reasons-one is to ease a nonexpert reader into the topic of forwarding, and the other is that some of our further arguments mimic those used in the proof of this theorem (and we will not repeat them). First, a careful inspection of the design algorithm reveals that , which means that the triangular coordinate transformation is a global diffeomorphism with . From (10) it then follows that the equilibrium is globally stable. LaSalle's theorem guarantees that as . Since and , it follows that . One can verify recursively that for all [this is a consequence of the fact that and of the presence of the linear term in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>]. Thus, it follows that , which, along with , implies that . Continuing in this fashion, one recursively shows that for each and, thus, that as .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. LINEARIZABILITY OF FEEDFORWARD SYSTEMS</head><p>The main interest in this paper is in making the computation of the integral in ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) tractable. Toward that end, let us start by noting that <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, which needs to be solved analytically, can be written in the -coordinates<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> as <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> which is obtained with</p><p>. Suppose now that (somehow, miraculously, ) all of the 's were equal to 1 (for all values of their arguments, rather than just</p><p>). We would have a lower triangular linear system , which is easily solvable in closed form. Then, the only difficulty remaining would be the integration with respect to of the integral (6) (using an appropriate coordinate change from to</p><p>). Calculating the integral is by no means trivial, but it is a much easier task than solving the nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> and calculating the integral.</p><p>Before we start exploring the conditions under which one would get <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> let us note another consequence of this. In this case, the coordinate change, before applying the feedback, would yield . . . </p><p>We refer to this as the Teel <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> canonical form. This is a completely controllable linear system. Hence, the systems that satisfy condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> are linearizable (into this linear form, and, ultimately, into the Brunovsky canonical form). Thus, the exploration of analytical computability of control laws for strict-feedforward systems that we undertake in this paper amounts, to a large extent, to a study of linearizability. Clearly, merely checking the coordinate-free conditions for linearizability <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> will not get us any closer to actually finding the control laws. Such a test would lead to conditions on the 's in the form of partial differential equations that they have to satisfy (these conditions would arise from the involutivity test).</p><p>Up until now we have used the word "linearizable" somewhat loosely. In the next definition, we make this notion precise.</p><p>Definition 1: If there exists a diffeomorphism</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(14)<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>)</p><p>transforming the strict-feedforward system (1)-(2) into a system of the form (17) ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>)</p><p>system ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">2</ref>) is said to be diffeomorphically equivalent to a chain of integrators (DECI).</p><p>We point out that the term DECI does not reflect that ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">15</ref>) restrict the class of admissible diffeomorphisims to a "triangular" form. In the next theorem, we give sufficient conditions for characterizing DECI strict-feedforward systems.</p><p>Theorem 2: All strict-feedforward systems ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">2</ref>) with that can be written as , and</p><p>for , using some scalar-valued functions satisfying <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>, are DECI. Proof: Straightforward to verify using ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">15</ref>). Theorem 2 is not a substitute for a geometric test of linearizability, nor is it a control design tool. It is just a parametrization of a subclass of strict-feedforward systems that are DECI.</p><p>For instance, all third-order strict-feedforward systems of the form , which is locally quadratic. We get that the strict-feedforward system <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> is linearizable using the coordinate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> Unfortunately, there is no easy systematic way to obtain this coordinate change (we know what it is because we started with and constructed the system). The only systematic way to arrive at it is the SJK procedure. In the next section we show that the SJK procedure greatly simplifies for DECI strict-feedroward systems, and, in particular, directly leads to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> for <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> without having to solve nonlinear ODEs of the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</p><p>Before we move on, it is interesting to note that the equations in Theorem 2, if viewed as partial differential equations in the 's, fit the single-step feedback linearization framework of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. ALGORITHM FOR ALL LINEARIZABLE FEEDFORWARD SYSTEMS</head><p>For linearizable strict-feedforward systems we present the following design algorithm, which eliminates the requirement to solve the ODEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> and reduces the problem to calculating a set of integrals with respect to time.

This calculation is particularly straightforward (and can be done, in principle, by hand) when the nonlinearities are polynomial. In that case, the following identity is useful in calculating (30): <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> Theorem 3: If the strict-feedforward plant (1)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">2</ref>) is DECI, then the feedback system (1), ( <ref type="formula">31</ref>) is globally asymptotically stable at the origin.</p><p>Proof: One can verify that in the coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> the control system becomes (13), and under the feedback control (31), the resulting system is . . . </p><p>The rest of the proof is as in Theorem 1.</p><p>As we indicated in Section III, checking the geometric conditions for linearizability is easy, whereas actually constructing the linearizing coordinates is not. The algorithm ( <ref type="formula">26</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">30</ref>) constructs the coordinate change into the (non-Brunovsky) Teel canonical form <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. The next theorem gives the coordinate change into the Brunovsky/chain-of-integrators form.</p><p>Theorem 4: If the strict-feedforward plant ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">2</ref>) is DECI, it has a relative degree <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> with respect to the output <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref> Furthermore, the coordinate change ( <ref type="formula">26</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">30</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref> converts system (1) into the chain of integrators ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</p><p>Proof: By verification.

In the second part, we note that the system has closed-loop poles at and use that fact that the coordinate change is diffeomorphic.</p><p>We note that in the design ( <ref type="formula">42</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">44</ref>) we have completely circumvented the SJK procedure. It is therefore worth noting that, following the SJK procedure, one would have obtained (45) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref> where denotes the Kronecker delta. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref> However, the most important product of the SJK procedure is the coordinate shift (from to ), which is given in the context of the following result.</p><p>Corollary 1: The control law <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>, with defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>, applied to the plant (39)-( <ref type="formula">41</ref>) achieves the result of Theorem 5 with (47) for . While in Section IV we showed that one can avoid having to solve the nonlinear ODEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, in Theorem 6 we showed that, for the feedforward subclass ( <ref type="formula">39</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>, one can also avoid having to calculate the integrals <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>. In the next result, we go even further and show that, not only does one have a closed-form formula for the control law <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref> but one can even get a closed-form formula for the solutions of the system under that control law. This is not just an aesthetically pleasing result-it will allow us, in Section VIII, to extend the constructive methodology to a class of strict-feedforward systems that are not linearizable.</p><p>To prevent confusion about the notation in the theorem, before its statement we emphasize that , which denotes the initial condition, is constant.

TYPE-I AND -II SYSTEMS IN DIMENSIONS TWO AND THREE</head><p>We start by pointing out that in dimension two all strict-feedforward systems are simultaneously of Types I and II. This implies that all second order strict-feedforward systems are linearizable.</p><p>Theorem . This example was worked out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. In this case the formula (81) gives 7   (82) One should recognize that the " " portion of the control law (82) is responsible for exponential stabilization of the linearized system. To see that this linear controller is not sufficient for global stabilization, we plug it back into the plant and obtain a closed-loop system, written in the form of a secondorder equation, as <ref type="bibr">(83)</ref> This is a Van der Pol equation with an unstable limit cycle, which exhibits a finite escape instability. Hence, the nonlinear term "</p><p>," designed to accommodate the input nonlinearity , is crucial for global stabilization. The possibilities, as well as the limits, of Type I/II linearizability for strict-feedforward systems are best understood in dimension three. For the following class of systems, which represents a union of all Type I and Type II feedforward systems in dimension three, a linearizing coordinate change and a stabilizing control law are designed in the next theorem. 7 A reader checking back the details in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> will notice that this control law differs from [36, eq. (6.2.12)]. This is due to an extra "x " term that has crept into the calculations in [36, eq. (6.2.7)]. </p><p>(90) and , achieves global asymptotic stability of the origin.</p><p>Proof: One can verify that . A Type II example of a system from this class is (91) which is stabilized (and feedback linearized) using (92)</p><p>We point out that the key restriction in this example is the boldfaced 1/2. If this value were anything else (say, 1 or 0), this system would not be linearizable. It would, however, be stabilizable using the procedure we present in Section VIII.</p><p>The focus on third-order systems is partly motivated by the fact that the celebrated "benchmark problem" (93) (94) (95) (77) first solved by Teel <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> using his method of nested saturations, is of third order. The system (93)-( <ref type="formula">95</ref>) is not feedback linearizable. However, the following similar (at least visually) systems, are linearizable. The system (96) is linearizable, as it is of both Type I and II. The system (97) is of Type I, and therefore linearizable. Other such systems exist, outside of Types I or II, that are linearizable. For example (98) (which is temptingly close in appearance to Type I but is not in that class), is linearizable using the coordinate change (99)</p><p>The previous examples all had the last two equations actually linear. The neither-Type-I-nor-II feedforward system (100) which includes nonlinearities in both of the first two equations, is linearizable using (101) Clearly, since (98) and (100) are neither of Type I nor II, the coordinate changes (99) and (101) cannot be obtained from the explicit formulae in Sections V and VI. However, they can be obtained following the simplified SJK procedure in Section IV, which, we remind the reader, avoids the requirement to solve the nonlinear ODEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</p></div>

ALGORITHMS FOR NONLINEARIZABLE FEEDFORWARD SYSTEMS</head><p>In this section, we expand upon the Type I and II feedforward systems, to develop algorithms for feedforward systems that are not linearizable. Two classes of systems that we consider consist of a linearizable subsystem and a scalar equation that is (possibly) not linearizable.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XI. INTERLACED FEEDFORWARD-FEEDBACK SYSTEMS</head><p>The ability to stabilize systems that are neither in the strictfeedback nor in the strict-feedforward form was nicely illustrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XIII. PERFORMANCE</head><p>The general performance advantages of the SJK-type integrator forwarding were thoroughly illuminated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr">Sec. 6.2.6]</ref>. It was shown there that "overly cautious" nested saturation designs, whose form is in many cases the same irrespective of the sign of the plant nonlinearities, don't perform as well as Lyapunov-based designs. In these, and various other simulations presented in the literature, the nested saturation (and other bounded) controllers display the trademark linear (nonexponential) decay resulting from saturating the control. Saturation itself leads to large overall control effort (at least in ) by letting the states linger at large values for extended periods of time. On the other hand, there is an inherent engineering merit in having control laws that are robust to actuator saturation (by means of "caution"), which the nested saturation controllers are.</p><p>The Lyapunov-function equipped SJK algorithm not only shows good performance in simulations, this performance can be quantified. This is already implicit in the inverse optimality result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> for , but is actually true even for . Theorem 18: The control effort for the feedback system (1), (8) satisfies the following bound: <ref type="bibr">(194)</ref> Proof: By rewriting <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> as with the help of ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>), and by integrating it in time from 0 to .</p><p>An additional desirable property arises from linearizabilitythat the performance and control effort can be quantified in terms of the original problem data (in terms of the plant vector fields). In the case of Type I and II systems, we have closed-form solutions for the state and control which allow such quantification. In the next two theorems, which are proved using <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>, the identity <ref type="bibr">(195)</ref> and, respectively, Lemmas 1 and 3, we calculate explicit and bounds on the control effort in stabilizing feedforward systems of Types I and II.</p><p>Theorem 19: The control law (44) applied to the plant (39)-( <ref type="formula">41</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">42</ref>  where are the initial conditions of the state. Stabilization by bounded controls is unquestionably a major accomplishment (of <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> and the papers it directly inspired, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>) especially from the engineering point of view. However, given the character of open loop instability in feedforward systems, it should be less surprising that one can stabilize them with bounded controls than that one can actually indulge in controls with large nonlinear growth (in quest of performance), like those represented by the SJK Lyapunov procedure. For strict-feedback systems, due to their finite escape instabilities, the challenge was to design bounded stabilizing controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. By analogy, for feedforward systems, a (theoretically) worthy future challenge would be to design high-performance controllers with unrestricted nonlinear growth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XIV. (IN LIEU OF) CONCLUSIONS: MORE ON TYPE I AND II SYSTEMS</head><p>How generic, or nongeneric, is linearizability within the class of strict-feedforward systems? It is hard to quantitatively state what "percentage" of feedforward system are linearizable, or, how close (in some metric) a feedforward system is to a linearizable feedforward system. However, it is clear from the results of this paper that one should not expect the majority of feedforward systems to be linearizable.</p><p>The Type II class is particularly interesting because of its structural peculiarity (recall (54)-( <ref type="formula">58</ref>)). Based on the third-order case where any linearizable system with is of Type II, one might be tempted to conjecture that all linearizable systems (of any order) with are of Type II. 8 A fourth-order counter-example to this conjecture is (200) (201) 8 We remind the reader that (x ) 0.</p><p>which is linearizable via coordinate change (202) but is not of Type II.</p><p>It is not clear at this point what the avenues for possible generalization of the results of this paper might be. The most immediate idea would be to start by exploring the possibilities for combining the systems of Type I and Type II. Theorem 9 does this, at least notationally, for systems of order three. Condition (87) shows actually that these two classes do not mix well, i.e., that Theorem 9 is a concise statement of two results, not a statement for a mixed Type I/II class. However, while mixing is impossible in order three, it is not impossible in higher orders. For example, the fourth-order system (203) (204) (205) (206) where and are any nonlinearities vanishing at zero ( also must be ), is a system that mixes the features of Types I and II and is linearizable via (207) (208) (209) (210) where . As a final comment, we do concede that linearization (by coordinate change) may be viewed as a step backward, if seen as a procedure that eliminates all the nonlinearities-the "harmful," as well as the "useful" ones-and applies controls with high nonlinear growth, in contrast to the nested saturation designs. To clarify what we mean by "useful" nonlinearities in the case where 'feedback linearization' amounts to just a coordinate transformation (without feedback, i.e., without direct cancellation), consider the system from Theorem 8. In Example 2, we presented a case of a harmful nonlinearity that had to be eliminated. However, if (just a sign change), the linear control law , resulting in , would be more sensible than the linearizing control law resulting in . Since the linear control law can be viewed as a close cousin of the nested saturation controllers, we point out that linearization (by forwarding coordinate change) and nested saturation need not be regarded as alternatives. Linearization can be performed first, followed by a nested saturation implementation of a linear controller, like in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, or various saturation related techniques covered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In this way, the performance advantage of the linearizing design would be lost but the robustness to magnitude saturation would be achieved.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Feedback</head><label></label><figDesc>Linearizability and Explicit Integrator Forwarding Controllers for Classes of Feedforward Systems Miroslav Krstic, Fellow, IEEE Abstract-We identify a class of feedforward nonlinear systems that are linearizable by a coordinate change.

The explicit expressions that we develop allow us to also find closed-form control laws for several classes of systems that are not feedback linearizable, including some that are in the feedforward form and others that are in what we refer to as the "block-feedforward" form. Performance advantages of Lyapunov-based forwarding controllers over nested saturation controllers have been well illustrated in the literature on examples.
