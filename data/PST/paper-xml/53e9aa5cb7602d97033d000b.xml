<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The theory of (tight) wavelet frames has been extensively studied in the past twenty years and they are currently widely used for image restoration and other image processing and analysis problems. The success of wavelet frame based models, including balanced approach and analysis based approach, is due to their capability of sparsely approximating piecewise smooth functions like images. Motivated by the balanced approach and analysis based approach, we shall propose a wavelet frame based 0 minimization model, where the 0 "norm" of the frame coefficients is penalized. We adapt the penalty decomposition (PD) method of Lu and Zhang to solve the proposed optimization problem. Some convergence analysis of the adapted PD method will also be provided. Numerical results showed that the proposed model solved by the PD method can generate images with better quality than those obtained by either analysis based approach or balanced approach in terms of restoring sharp features as well as maintaining smoothness of the recovered images.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Mathematics has been playing an important role in the modern developments of image processing and analysis. Image restoration, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, tomography, etc., is one of the most important areas in image processing and analysis. Its major purpose is to enhance the quality of a given image that is corrupted in various ways during the process of imaging, acquisition and communication, and it enables us to see crucial but subtle objects residing in the image. Therefore, image restoration is an important step to take towards accurate interpretations of the physical world and making optimal decisions. 1.1. Image restoration. Image restoration is often formulated as a linear inverse problem. For the simplicity of notation, we denote the images as vectors in R n with n equals to the total number of pixels. A typical image restoration problem is formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(1.1) f = Au + η,</formula><p>where f ∈ R d is the observed image (or measurements), η denotes white Gaussian noise with variance σ 2 , and A ∈ R d×n is some linear operator. The objective is to find the unknown true image u ∈ R n from the observed image f . Typically,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>996</head><p>YONG ZHANG, BIN DONG, AND ZHAOSONG LU the linear operator in (1.1) is a convolution operator for image deconvolution problems, a projection operator for image inpainting and partial Radon transform for computed tomography.</p><p>To solve u from (1.1), one of the most natural choices is the following least square problem min</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">u∈R n Au -f 2 2 ,</formula><p>where • 2 denotes the 2 -norm. This is, however, not a good idea in general.</p><p>Taking an image deconvolution problem as an example, since the matrix A is illconditioned, the noise η possessed by f will be amplified after solving the above least squares problem. Therefore, in order to suppress the effect of noise and also preserve key features of the image, e.g., edges, various regularization based optimization models were proposed in the literature. Among all regularization based models for image restoration, variational methods and wavelet frame based approaches are widely adopted and have been proven successful.</p><p>The trend of variational methods and partial differential equation (PDE) based image processing started with the refined Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (ROF) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> which penalizes the total variation (TV) of u. Many of the current PDE based methods for image denoising and decomposition utilize TV regularization for its beneficial edge preserving property (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>). The ROF model is especially effective on restoring images that are piecewise constant, e.g., binary images. Other types of variational models were also proposed after the ROF model. We refer the interested readers to <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref> and the references therein for more details.</p><p>Wavelet frame based approaches are relatively new and came from a different path. The basic idea for wavelet frame based approaches is that images can be sparsely approximated by properly designed wavelet frames, and hence, the regularization used for wavelet frame based models is the 1 -norm of frame coefficients. Although wavelet frame based approaches take similar forms as variational methods, they were generally considered as different approaches than variational methods because, among many other reasons, wavelet frame based approaches are defined for discrete data, while variational methods assume all variables are functions. Some studies in the literature (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>) indicated that there was a relation between Haar wavelet and total variation. However, it was not clear if there exists a general relation between wavelet frames and variational models (with general differential operators) in the context of image restorations. In a recent paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the authors established a rigorous connection between one of the wavelet frame based approaches, namely the analysis based approach and variational models. It was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> that the analysis based approach can be regarded as a finite difference approximation of a certain type of general variational model, and such approximation will be exact when image resolution goes to infinity. Furthermore, through Gamma-convergence, the authors showed that the solutions of the analysis based approach also approximate the solutions of the corresponding variational model. Such connections not only grant geometric interpretation to wavelet frame based approaches, but also lead to even wider applications of them, e.g., image segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and 3D surface reconstruction from unorganized point sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. On the other hand, the discretization provided by wavelet frames was shown, e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>, to be superior to the standard discretizations for some of the variational models, due to the multiresolution structure and redundancy of wavelet 0 MINIMIZATION FOR WAVELET FRAME BASED IMAGE RESTORATION 997 frames which enable wavelet frame based models to adaptively choose a proper differential operator in different regions of a given image according to the order of the singularity of the underlying solutions. For these reasons, as well as the fact that digital images are always discrete, we use wavelet frames as the tool for image restoration in this paper.</p><p>1.2. Wavelet frame based approaches. We now briefly introduce the concept of tight frames and tight wavelet frames, and then recall some of the frame based image restoration models. Interesting readers should consult <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> for theories of frames and wavelet frames; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> for a short survey on theory and applications of frames, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> for a more detailed survey.</p><p>A countable set</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">X ⊂ L 2 (R) is called a tight frame of L 2 (R) if f = h∈X f, h h ∀f ∈ L 2 (R),</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">•, • is the inner product of L 2 (R).</formula><p>The tight frame X is called a tight wavelet frame if the elements of X are generated by dilations and translations of finitely many functions called framelets. The construction of framelets can be obtained by the unitary extension principle (UEP) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. In our implementations, we will mainly use the piecewise linear B-spline framelets constructed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Given a 1-dimensional framelet system for L 2 (R), the s-dimensional tight wavelet frame system for L 2 (R s ) can be easily constructed by using tensor products of 1-dimensional framelets (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>).</p><p>In the discrete setting, we will use W ∈ R m×n with m ≥ n to denote fast tensor product framelet decomposition and use W to denote the fast reconstruction. Then by the unitary extension principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, we have W W = I, i.e., u = W W u for any image u. We will further denote an L-level framelet decomposition of u as W u = (. . . , W l,j u, . . .)</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">for 0 ≤ l ≤ L -1, j ∈ I,</formula><p>where I denotes the index set of all framelet bands and W l,j u ∈ R n . Under such notation, we have m = L × |I| × n. We will also use α ∈ R m to denote the frame coefficients, i.e., α = W u, where α = (. . . , α l,j , . . .) , with α l,j = W l,j u.</p><p>More details on discrete algorithms of framelet transforms can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Since tight wavelet frame systems are redundant systems (i.e., m &gt; n), the representation of u in the frame domain is not unique. Therefore, there are mainly three formulations utilizing the sparseness of the frame coefficients, namely, analysis based approach, synthesis based approach, and balanced approach. Detailed and integrated descriptions of these three methods can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>The wavelet frame based image processing started from <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> for high-resolution image reconstructions, where the proposed algorithm was later analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. These works led to the following balanced approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> (1.2) min</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">α∈R m 1 2 AW α -f 2 D + κ 2 (I -W W )α 2 2 + L-1 l=0 ⎛ ⎝ j∈I λ l,j |α l,j | p ⎞ ⎠ 1/p 1 ,</formula><p>where p = 1 or 2, 0 ≤ κ ≤ ∞, λ l,j ≥ 0 is a scalar parameter, and • D denotes the weighted 2 -norm with D positive definite. This formulation is referred to as the balanced approach because it balances the sparsity of the frame coefficient and the smoothness of the image. The balanced approach (1.2) was applied to various applications in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. When κ = 0, only the sparsity of the frame coefficient is penalized. This is called the synthesis based approach, as the image is synthesized by the sparsest coefficient vector (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>). When κ = +∞, only the sparsity of canonical wavelet frame coefficients, which corresponds to the smoothness of the underlying image, is penalized. For this case, problem (1.2) can be rewritten as <ref type="bibr">(1.3)</ref> min</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">u∈R n 1 2 Au -f 2 D + L-1 l=0 ⎛ ⎝ j∈I λ l,j |W l,j u| p ⎞ ⎠ 1/p 1 .</formula><p>This is called the analysis based approach, as the coefficient is in range of the analysis operator (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>).</p><p>Note that if we take p = 1 for the last term of (1.2) and (1.3), it is known as the anisotropic 1 -norm of the frame coefficients, which is the case used for earlier frame based image restoration models. The case p = 2, called isotropic 1 -norm of the frame coefficients, was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and was shown to be superior to the anisotropic 1 -norm. Therefore, we will choose p = 2 for our simulations.</p><p>1.3. Motivations and contributions. For most of the variational models and wavelet frame based approaches, the choice of norm for the regularization term is the 1 -norm. Taking wavelet frame based approaches for example, the attempt of minimizing the 1 -norm of the frame coefficients is to increase their sparsity, which is the right thing to do since piecewise smooth functions like images can be sparsely approximated by tight wavelet frames. Although the 1 -norm of a vector does not directly correspond to its cardinality in contrast to the 0 "norm", it can be regarded as a convex approximation to the 0 "norm". Such approximation is also an excellent approximation for many cases. It was shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, which generalizes the exciting results of compressed sensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, that for a given wavelet frame, if the operator A satisfies certain conditions, and if the unknown true image can be sparsely approximated by the given wavelet frame, one can robustly recover the unknown image by penalizing the 1 -norm of the frame coefficients.</p><p>For image restoration, however, the conditions on A as required by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> are not generally satisfied, which means penalizing the 0 "norm" and the 1 -norm may produce different solutions. Although both the balanced approach (1.2) and analysis based approach (1.3) can generate restored images with very high quality, one natural question is whether using the 0 "norm" instead of the 1 -norm can further improve the results.</p><p>On the other hand, it was observed, e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> (also see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>), that the balanced approach (1.2) generally generates images with sharper features like edges than the analysis based approach (1.3), because balanced approach emphasizes more on the sparsity of the frame coefficients. However, the recovered images from a balanced approach usually contain more artifacts (e.g., oscillations) than an analysis based approach, because the regularization term of the analysis based approach has a direct link to the regularity of u (as proven by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>) when compared to a balanced approach. Although such a trade-off can be controlled by the parameter κ in the balanced approach (1.2), it is not very easy to do in practice.</p></div>

Intuitively, this should provide us a balance between sharpness of the features and smoothness for the recovered images. The difficulty here is that 0 minimization problems are generally hard to solve. Recently, penalty decomposition (PD) methods were proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> for a general 0 minimization problem that can be used to solve our proposed model due to its generality. Computational results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> demonstrated that their methods generally outperform the existing methods for compressed sensing problems, sparse logistic regression and sparse inverse covariance selection problems in terms of quality of solutions and/or computational efficiency. This motivates us to adapt one of their PD methods to solve our proposed 0 minimization problem. As proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, the same block coordinate descent (BCD) method is used to solve each penalty subproblem of the PD method. However, the convergence analysis of the BCD method was missing from <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> when the 0 "norm" appears in the objective function. Indeed, the convergence of the BCD method generally requires the continuity of the objective function as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. In addition, the BCD method for the optimization problem with the nonconvex objective function has only been proved to converge to a stationary point which is not a local minimizer in general (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> for details).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contributions.</head><p>The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.</p><p>1) We propose a new wavelet frame based model for image restoration problems that penalizes the 0 "norm" of the wavelet frame coefficients. Numerical simulations show that the PD method that solves the proposed model generates recovered images with better quality than those obtained by either balanced approach and analysis based approach. 2) Given the discontinuity and nonconvexity of the 0 "norm" term in the objective function, we have proved some convergence results for the BCD method which is missing from the literature. We now leave the details of the model and algorithm to Section 2 and details of simulations to Section 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Model and Algorithm</head><p>We start by introducing some simple notation. The space of symmetric n × n matrices will be denoted by S n . If X ∈ S n is positive definite, we write X 0. We denote by I the identity matrix, whose dimension should be clear from the context. Given an index set J ⊆ {1, . . . , n}, x J denotes the subvector formed by the entries of x indexed by J. For any real vector, • 0 and • 2 , denote the cardinality (i.e., the number of nonzero entries) and the Euclidean norm of the vector, respectively. In addition, x D denotes the weighted 2 -norm defined by x D = √ x Dx with D 0.</p><p>2.1. Model. We now propose the following optimization model for image restoration problems, <ref type="bibr">(2.1)</ref> min</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">u∈Y 1 2 Au -f 2 D + i λ i (W u) i 0 , Licensed to AMS.</formula><p>License or copyright restrictions may apply to redistribution; see http://www.ams.org/journal-terms-of-use</p><p>where Y is some convex subset of R n . Here we are using the multi-index i and denote (W u) i (similarly for λ i ) the value of W u at a given pixel location within a certain level and band of wavelet frame transform. Comparing to the analysis based model, we are now penalizing the number of nonzero elements of W u. As mentioned earlier that if we emphasize too much on the sparsity of the frame coefficients as in the balanced approach or synthesis based approach, the recovered image will contain artifacts, although features like edges will be sharp; if we emphasize too much on the regularity of u like in the analysis based approach, features in the recovered images will be slightly blurred, although artifacts and noise will be nicely suppressed. Therefore, by penalizing the 0 "norm" of W u as in (2.1), we can indeed achieve a better balance between sharpness of features and smoothness of the recovered images.</p><p>Given that the 0 "norm" is an integer-valued, discontinuous and nonconvex function, problem (2.3) is generally hard to solve. Some algorithms proposed in the literature, e.g., iterative hard thresholding algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, cannot be directly applied to the proposed model (2.1) unless W = I. Recently, Lu and Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> proposed a penalty decomposition (PD) method to solve the following general 0 minimization problem,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">(2.2) min x∈X f (x) + ν x J 0</formula><p>for some ν &gt; 0 controlling the sparsity of the solution, where X is a closed convex set in R n , f : R n → R is a continuously differentiable function, and x J 0 denotes the cardinality of the subvector formed by the entries of x indexed by J. In view of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, we reformulate (2.1) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">(2.3) min u∈Y,α=W u 1 2 Au -f 2 D + i λ i α i 0</formula><p>and then we can adapt the PD method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> to tackle problem (2.1) directly. As proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, the same BCD method is used to solve each penalty subproblem of the PD method. In addition, we apply the nonmonotone gradient projection method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> to solve one of the subproblems in the BCD method.</p><p>2.2. Algorithm for problem <ref type="bibr">(2.3)</ref>. In this section, we discuss how the PD method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> solving (2.2) can be adapted to solve problem (2.3). Letting</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">x = (u 1 , . . . , u n , α 1 , . . . , α m ), J = {n + 1, . . . , n + m}, J = {1, . . . , n}, f (x) = 1 2 Ax J -f 2 D and X = {x ∈ R n+m : x J = W x J and</formula><p>x J ∈ Y}, we can clearly see that the problem (2.3) takes the same form as (2.2). In addition, there obviously exists a feasible point (u feas , α feas ) for problem (2.3) when Y = ∅, i.e., there exist (u feas , α feas ) such that W u feas = α feas and u feas ∈ Y. In particular, we can choose (u feas , α feas ) = (0, 0), which is the choice we make for our numerical studies. We now discuss the implementation details of the PD method when solving the proposed wavelet frame based model <ref type="bibr">(2.3)</ref>.</p><p>Given a penalty parameter &gt; 0, the associated quadratic penalty function for (2.3) is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">(2.4) p (u, α) := 1 2 Au -f 2 D + i λ i α i 0 + 2 W u -α 2 2 .</formula><p>Then we have the following PD method for problem (2.3) where each penalty subproblem is approximately solved by a BCD method (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> for details).</p><p>Licensed to AMS.</p><p>License or copyright restrictions may apply to redistribution; see http://www.ams.org/journal-terms-of-use</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">0 MINIMIZATION FOR WAVELET FRAME BASED IMAGE RESTORATION 1001</formula><p>Penalty Decomposition (PD) Method for (2.3): Let 0 &gt; 0, δ &gt; 1 be given.

We summarize the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. The names of three wavelets are listed in the first column. The CPU time (in seconds) and PSNR values of all three methods are given in the last six columns.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, we can see that the quality of the restored images by using the piecewise linear framelets and the piecewise cubic framelets is better than that by using the Haar framelets. In addition, all three methods are generally faster when using Haar framelets and slower when using piecewise cubic framelets. Overall, all three approaches when using the piecewise linear method have balanced performance in terms of time and quality (i.e., the PSNR value). Finally, we observe that the PD method consistently achieves the best quality of restored images among all of the approaches for all three different tight wavelet frame systems. Finally, we test how different noise levels affect the restored images obtained from all the three methods. We choose three different noise levels (i.e., σ = 3, 5, 7) for the image "Portrait I", and test all the three methods by using piecewise linear framelets. We summarize the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. The variances of noises are listed in the first column. The CPU time (in seconds) and PSNR values of all three methods are given in the last six columns. We observe that the qualities of the restored images by all three methods degrade when the noise level increases. Nevertheless, the PD method still outperforms the other two methods.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we proposed a wavelet frame based 0 minimization model, which is motivated by the analysis based approach and balanced approach. The penalty decomposition (PD) method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> was used to solve the proposed optimization problem. Numerical results showed that the proposed model solved by the PD method can generate images with better quality than those obtained by either analysis based approach or balanced approach in terms of restoring sharp features like edges as well as maintaining smoothness of the recovered images. Convergence analysis of the subiterations in the PD method was also provided.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
