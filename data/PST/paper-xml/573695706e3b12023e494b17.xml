<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Maximizing energy efficiency for data transmission becomes one of the most important design considerations in energyconstrained wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Moreover, in a clustered WSN, the relay nodes near cluster heads (CHs) will deplete their energy rapidly due to carrying out heavy tasks of data forwarding. Such nonuniform energy consumption may easily cause the network disconnected. It has been shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> that cooperative transmission is more effective to balance energy consumption among nodes and improve energy efficiency of data transmission in WSNs. Recently, there have been some research efforts on developing cooperative schemes in clustered WSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, in which sensors within a cluster relay data packets to nearby clusters using cooperative communication. A key element of cooperative transmission schemes is the selection and coordination of cooperative nodes.</p><p>In the meanwhile, energy harvesting technology has also been recognized as a promising cost-effective technique to maximize energy efficiency in WSNs. Unlike the conventional energy harvesting technique, which scavenges energy from the natural sources such as solar, wind and thermal, wireless power transfer (WPT) is an emerging energy harvesting technique, where sensors S. <ref type="bibr">Guo</ref>  charge their batteries from electromagnetic radiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In WPT, green energy can be harvested through either strongly coupled magnetic resonances or radio frequency (RF) signals. The former requires that each sensor as an energy receiver to mount a coil tuned to resonate at exactly the same frequency as the coil on the energy transmitter <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. However, in practice, sometimes it is difficult to mount a resonant coil in a small sensor. Moreover, energy transfer based on magnetic resonances is usually activated by near field induction from more powerful nodes (e.g., base stations and vehicles). Clearly, the application of this technology has some limitations in certain applications where there are no base stations near sensor nodes or the vehicle cannot travel or migrate very close to sensors, such as in wild forests and steep mountains.</p><p>On the other hand, compared to strongly coupled magnetic resonances, radio frequency (RF) signal can convey both energy and information simultaneously. Thus it is a promising energy source of wireless power transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, since it can achieve both wireless information transmission and energy transfer, even in a hostile environment. Recently, a RF-based energy harvesting technique, called simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), becomes very appealing since it utilizes both information and energy carried by RF signals at the same time, and potentially offers great possibility to replenish the energy of sensor nodes. The core idea of SWIPT is that the receiver has two circuits to perform energy harvesting and information decoding separately <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>SWIPT as an appealing energy harvesting technique has been applied to various types of wireless communication networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Lee, et. al.</ref> considered the application of SWIPT to cognitive radio networks. SWIPT for multi-antenna systems also attracts much attentions from researchers. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, Zhang, et. al. studied a three-node multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcasting system with SWIPT. Furthermore, Chen, et. al. extended the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> by considering SWIPT in large-scale MIMO systems employing energy beamforming. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Xu, et. al</ref>. studied a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast SWIPT system. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Chen, et. al.</ref> analyzed the tradeoff of wireless energy and information transfer for limited-feedback multi-antenna systems. In the meanwhile, the application of SWIPT in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems has gained the attention in academia. The resource allocation algorithm was designed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> for energy efficient communication in OFDMA systems with SWIPT as an optimization problem. Subsequently, Zhou, et. al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> provided the optimal design for SWIPT in downlink multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.</p><p>Energy harvesting in wireless cooperative networks is particularly important as it can enable information relaying. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the problem of SWIPT in an amplify-and-forward (AF) wireless cooperative network was studied. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Ding, et. al. considered</ref> the application of SWIPT to wireless cooperative networks with one source-destination pair and multiple energy harvesting relays. However, these existing works did not consider how to optimally allocate transmit power and provide power splitting ratio to maximize energy efficiency. Compared to existing works in the literature, the contribution of this paper is that (i) we address the problem of energy efficient data transmission between clusters in WSNs by integrating RF-based SWIPT with cooperative relay, and (ii) we provide the optimal solution of power allocation, relay selection and power splitting to maximize system energy efficiency.</p><p>In this paper, therefore, we consider applying SWIPT to wirelessly charge the relay nodes with low energy in clustered WSNs. The superiority of this scheme lies in two aspects: (i) the network system can enjoy the benefit of cooperative transmission using intermediate sensors as relays in significantly saving energy; (ii) the relay nodes can be powered by the harvested energy as the energy compensation for data forwarding. This work aims at determining the optimal transmission power and relay selection, and finding the optimal power splitting ratio for energy harvesting and information decoding so that the system energy efficiency is maximized.</p><p>To this end, we first formulate the energy-efficient cooperative transmission (eCotrans) problem for SWIPT in clustered WSNs as a non-convex optimization problem constrained by the minimum harvested energy, the minimum system data rate, and the maximum transmission power. The non-convex optimization problem is solved by an iteration algorithm which combines nonlinear fractional programming and dual decomposition via appropriate objective function and optimization variable transformations. It is worth noting that although we employ a similar mathematical method to that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> for formulating and solving the energy efficiency maximization problem, our work in this paper is significantly different from the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, which aimed at finding optimal policies of power allocation, subcarrier allocation and power splitting for energy efficiency optimization in OFDMA systems, instead of solving the problem of cooperative transmission with relay selection and energy harvesting in clustered WSNs.</p><p>Furthermore, we provide a distributed algorithm for power allocation, power splitting and relay selection. In particular, we find that power splitting ratio plays an imperative role in relay selection and it depends on the minimum harvested energy requirement. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can converge within a few iterations and its energy efficiency depends on the number of relay nodes and the inter-cluster distance. More importantly, we observe that the maximum allowed transmission power has a limited impact on average harvested energy. Compared to existing algorithms without adopting energy harvesting or energy efficiency maximizing, our proposed algorithm can achieve higher energy efficiency and more remaining energy. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATION MODELS</head><p>In this section, we first introduce the system model and communication model, and then formulate the optimization problem for energy-efficient resource allocation in a clustered WSN with SWIPT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. System Model</head><p>We consider a wireless sensor network consisting of multiple clusters of sensor nodes and a sink node as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, where sensor nodes are statically and randomly scattered over the sensing field. Each sensor node has a single antenna. The sink node is responsible for collecting data from all the sensor nodes. The nodes within the same cluster are distributed closely around the cluster head (CH), and can cooperate on signal transmission and/or reception. Suppose that the cluster head (CH) in a cluster (the source) wants to transmit data to the CH of its nearby cluster (the destination). Since the transmission distance is relatively long between clusters, the source can first broadcast the data to the member nodes in the cluster, select the "best" relay from a set of potential cluster member nodes, and then use this relay to aid the source-to-destination communication. Clearly, the transmission is the single-relay-selection cooperative communication scheme. It is worth noting that the destination here refers to the CH of the source's nearby cluster instead of its final data sink node. In general, the CHs of two adjacent clusters can communicate directly or by one-hop relay. If the sink node is far away from the source, it may require multiple hops.</p><p>To enable SWIPT, each CH works as both an information transmitter and a power transferrer. While a source CH transmits data to its relay/destination node, in practice, the RF energy is also transferred to the node. The receiver harvests the RF energy from the source CH and uses the energy to replenish its rechargeable battery as a compensation for supporting the energy consumption of forwarding. In particular, to concurrently decode information and harvest energy from the received radio signals, the receiver node is composed of a power splitting unit, an energy harvesting unit, a conventional signal processing core unit and a rechargeable battery, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Since the signal used for decoding the information in the receiver cannot be used for harvesting energy due to hardware circuit limitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, we employ a separated information decoding unit and energy harvesting unit.</p><p>In this paper, we adopt a practical dynamic power splitting (DPS) scheme, which is implemented by power splitting unit at the receiver, to enable the receiver to harvest energy and decode information from the same received signal at any time. The core idea of the DPS scheme is that a receiver i dynamically splits the received signal into two power streams in the radio frequency (RF) front end with power splitting ratio ρ I i and ρ E i as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, which are used for decoding information and harvesting energy, respectively, where 0 ≤ ρ I i ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ ρ E i ≤ 1. In order to improve energy efficiency, we adopt the cooperative communication scheme in a decode-and-forward (DF) and time division relaying manner. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the energy harvesting cooperative transmission is carried out in two phase as follows.</p><p>Phase 1: The intracluster broadcasting transmission. When a CH has data to transmit, it first broadcasts a request-to-send (RTS) message to the cluster member nodes (CNs) within the same cluster to contend for the shared wireless channel. Once receiving the RTS message, the member nodes reply a clear-to-send (CTS) message to show being ready to communicate. These ready CNs also belonging to the receiving cluster form the set of candidate relays. After the RTS/CTS exchange, all candidate relay nodes will calculate their priority according to some predefined policies, which will be described in Section IV-D, based on the available channel state information fed back by RTS/CTS messages. The cluster member node with the higher priority will transmit and "win" the competition to serve as the relay for cooperative data transmission.</p><p>Phase 2: The intercluster cooperative transmission. After the relay is determined, the source sends out data to the relay/destination. The relay/destination first tries to direct the received data flow to the signal processing unit to decode and detect whether the minimum targeted data rate is satisfied, following the DPS approach. If the detection is successful and there is some energy left, the remaining signal flows will be directed to the energy harvesting unit, and the harvested energy will be used to support relay transmission. Then the source and relays will simultaneously transmit the packets to the destination (i.e., the CH of the receiving cluster).</p><p>The single-relay selection cooperative scheme is fully distributed and easy to implement. The underlying reasons are that it is much simpler than the multi-relay cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The former only selects one "best" relay to forward data while the latter requires the distributed space-time coding or beamforming. In particular, the selected relay can use the energy harvested to support relay transmission so as to avoid its energy being drained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Communication Model</head><p>We consider two types of transmission modes for wireless communications: direct transmission mode (DT) and cooperative relay transmission mode (RT). Depending on whether the relay is helpful, each source may work in either the DT mode or the RT mode. Let P s and P r be the transmission power of source s in Phase 1 and relay r in Phase 2, respectively; N s and N d be the set of cluster member nodes (CNs) of source node s (the CH in the transmitting cluster) and the destination node d (the CH of the receiving cluster), respectively. Then the candidate relay set N = N s ∩ N d . We assume that all the links are symmetrical, i.e., the channel from node i to node j is the same as the channel from node j to node i, and the channel from the source to the relay/destination follows quasi-static block fading. The channel is unchanged over the block time T and independently and identically distributed from one block to the next, following a Rayleigh distribution. The use of such channels is motivated by prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. We take a relatively short block duration compared to the minimum coherence time of the channel and interference such that both the channel and interference can be treated as unchanged during each block transmission. Let h sd and h sr , r ∈ N , denote the channel gains between source s and destination d and between source s and its relay r, respectively, h rd , r ∈ N , denote the channel gain from relay r to destination d, and σ 2 sd , σ 2 sr and σ 2 rd denote the variances of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) in the corresponding channels.</p><p>It is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> that it is difficult to obtain perfect channel state information (CSI) due to noisy channel estimation and the unavoidable delay between the time channel estimation is performed and the time the estimation result is used for actual transmission. Therefore, we will consider imperfect CSI in this paper, i.e., the receiver knows the value of CSI, and both the transmitter and the receiver know the distribution of CSI, since transmitting CSI information would lead to extra overhead and considerable additional complexity.</p><p>To perform relay selection and power allocation, the source can obtain the channel gains by the feedback of the CTS message in Phase 1 via the dedicated control channel. To elaborate, in practical implementation, during the training period, i.e., RTS/CTS exchange in Phase 1, before data transmission in the first time slot, the source transmits training signals by RTS message so that the relay and the destination measure the SR and SD channels and get the corresponding channel gains, respectively. The relay then transmits training signals in the second time slot to the destination so that the destination measures the RD channel and obtain its channel gain. The measured channel gains can be fed back to the source by CTS message on dedicated reverse control channels. Since all the links are assumed to be symmetrical, the source can obtain the SR and SD channel gains.</p><p>The normalized effective channel gains can be represented by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">a sd = |h sd | 2 /σ 2 sd , a sr = |h sr | 2 /σ 2 sr ,<label>and</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">a rd = |h rd | 2 /σ 2 rd , where h ij = k ij L -α</formula><p>ij , L ij is the distance between transmitter i and receiver j, α is a constant path loss exponent and k ij is a normalization constant depending on the radio propagation properties of the environment. As aforementioned, source s via direct link would actively transmit data in both time slots while source s via relay link would only transmit data in the first time slot. Thus, the end-to-end data rate from source s to destination d during the two phases is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">R sd =    B log(1 + ρ I d a sd P s ), DT mode B 2 min(log(1 + ρ I d a sd P s + ρ I d a rd P r ), log(1 + ρ I r a sr P s )), RT mode,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where B denotes the base-band width and the rate is scaled by 1 2 since the entire transmission takes two phases. A criterion to decide the working mode of the source in selective DF mode was given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, that is, using relay is advantageous when min ρ I r a sr , ρ I d a rd &gt; ρ I d a sd . Otherwise, the relay keeps inactive in the relay phase.</p><p>In particular, the effect of best relay selection on the rate for the RT mode is reflected by the following two aspects. (1) Best relay selection as a single relay cooperative scheme can avoid the complex mathematical expression for data rate since compared to multi-relay cooperative schemes, single-relay cooperation requires neither cooperative beamforming nor distributed space time coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. (2) Best relay selection can ensure that the candidate relay that can provide the maximum data rate is always selected as the actual relay of source s as shown in relay selection subalgorithm in Section IV.D. Moreover, the increase of the number of relays will increase the cooperation overhead and degrade the energy efficiency of cooperative communication, i.e., more cooperators may lead to less energy-efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. This also motivates us to adopt the best relay selection.</p><p>We first consider the data rate R sd in the RT mode. Let P sd indicate the total transmission power between source s and destination d in the two phases. As mentioned in Section II-A, the harvested energy from the source is used by the relay as the energy compensation of data forwarding. This means that the harvested energy may not be enough for data forwarding to ensure the minimum data rate requirement, as shown in constraint C5. In this case, the relay has to consume part of its own energy for data forwarding. Therefore, the total consumed power should be the sum of the transmission powers of the source and the relay, i.e., P s,d = P s + P r . If the harvested energy from the source is sufficient for data forwarding, then P s,d = P s . Clearly, the transmission power of relay r, P r , includes two parts: one is the harvested power, denoted by P r,harv , from the source, which is given by P r,harv = ηρ E k P s |h sk | 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, where 0 &lt; η &lt; 1 is the energy conversion efficiency. The other is the power from the relay itself, denoted by P r,own . Therefore, we have P r = P r,harv + P r,own .</p><p>We can observe from (1) that the achievable rate is maximized when the amount of decoded information at the relay node is the same as the destination, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">1 + ρ I d a sd P s + ρ I d a rd P r = 1 + ρ I r a sr P s .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Together with P sd = P s + P r and P r = P r,harv + P r,own , we obtain   </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P s = ρ I d a rd ρ I r asr+ρ I d a rd -ρ I d a sd P sd , P r,own = ρ I r asr-ρ I d a sd -ρ I d a rd ηρ E k |h sk | 2 ρ I d a rd +ρ I r asr-ρ I d a sd P sd .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>In the DT mode, we can easily obtain P s = P sd and P r = 0. Let λ sd be the equivalent channel gain given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">λ sd = ρ I r asrρ I d a rd ρ I r asr+ρ I d a rd -ρ I d a sd , RT mode, ρ I d a sd , DT mode.<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Accordingly, by introducing a binary indicator ϑ s , which is 1 if source s transmits data in the DT mode, and 0 in the RT mode, we can unify the data rate as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">R sd = B 2 (1 + ϑ s ) log (1 + λ sd P sd ) .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>We can observe from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">5</ref>) that as the equivalent channel gain in (4) is directly proportional to power splitting ratio ρ I , increasing ρ I can improve the unified data rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>In this section, we formulate the SWIPT based resource allocation optimization problem for cooperative transmission, aiming to maximize system energy efficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Network Energy Efficiency</head><p>Let K denote the set of CHs in the network and |K| = K, and N denote the candidate relay set for source s and |N | = N . We assume t s,r is a binary indicator which is 1 if relay node r is selected for forwarding data from source s, and 0 otherwise. Next, we give the definition of the weighted system throughput.</p><p>Definition 1 (Weighted System Throughput). The weighted system throughput is defined as the weighted sum of the data rates that all the sources deliver to the destinations in the network and is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">U (P, ρ, T ) = K s,d=1 N r=1 α r t s,r R sd [bit/s] (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>where P = {P sd ≥ 0, ∀s, d ∈ K}is the power allocation policy, ρ = ρ I i , ρ E i ≥ 0, ∀i ∈ K ∪ N is the power splitting policy and</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">T = {t s,r ∈ {0, 1} , ∀s ∈ K, r ∈ N }.</formula><p>Let α r denote a non-negative weight which accounts for the priorities of different receivers to enforce certain fairness and is specified by the application layer. In practice, proportional fairness and max-min fairness can be achieved by varying the values of α r over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, by considering the constant circuit power consumption and the inefficiency of power amplifier, we model the weighted power consumption as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">UT P (P, ρ, T ) = KPCH + KN PCR + K s,d=1 N r=1</formula><p>εts,rP sd <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> where P CH &gt; 0 and P CR &gt; 0 denote the constant circuit power consumption in the CH and relay node, respectively. Thus the first two terms indicate the total circuit power consumption in the K CHs and all relay nodes. The last term is the total power dissipation in the power amplifiers of all sources and the corresponding relays. ε ≥ 1 is a constant which accounts for the inefficiency of power amplifier in the source and relay nodes.</p><p>Next, we give the definition of weighted energy efficiency similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Definition 2 (Weighted Energy Efficiency). The weighted energy efficiency of the considered system is defined as the total average number of bits successfully conveyed by the sources and relays to the destinations per Joule consumed energy and is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">U ef f (P, ρ, T ) = U (P, ρ, T ) U T P (P, ρ, T )<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Compared to the energy efficiency in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, the harvested energy at the receiver is not taken as the replenishment for the total system power consumption, which is because that from the whole network system point of view, the total energy of the whole system does not get replenished but is recycled and transferred from one node to another so as to achieve energy balance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Optimization Formulation</head><p>As aforementioned in Section II, the power splitter splits the received signal y r in ρ I i : ρ E i , such that the portion of the received signal, ρ I i y r , is sent to the information decoding unit and the remaining signal strength, ρ E i y r , drives the energy harvesting unit. Using the signal received at the input of the energy harvesting unit, similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the harvested energy at receiver k from transmitter s during a half of the block time, T /2, is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Q k = ηρ E k t s,k P s |h sk | 2 (T /2)<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where 0 &lt; η &lt; 1 is the energy conversion efficiency.</p><p>In this paper, we aim to provide the optimal power allocation policy P * , power splitting policy ρ * , and relay selection policy T * such that the weighted energy efficiency is maximized. To this end, the energy-efficient cooperative transmission (eCotrans) problem for SWIPT in clustered WSNs can be formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">OPT -1 max P,ρ,T U ef f (P, ρ, T )<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Subject to</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">C1 : Q k + Q C,k ≥ E min k , ∀k ∈ K, C2 : N r=1 t s,r P sd ≤ P max sd , ∀s, d ∈ K C3 : P CH + εt s,r P sd ≤ E max C4 : K s=1 N r=1 t s,r R sd ≥ R min , ∀d ∈ K, C5 : N r=1 t s,r R sd ≥ R min d , ∀s, d ∈ K ′ , C6 : t s,r ∈ {0, 1} , ∀s ∈ K, r ∈ N , C7 : Nr r=1 t s,r ≤ 1, ∀s ∈ K, C8 : ρ E min ≤ ρ E i ≤ ρ E max C9 : ρ I min ≤ ρ I i ≤ ρ I max , C10 : ρ E i + ρ I i ≤ 1</formula><p>, ∀i where C1 is energy harvesting constraint which specifies that the sum of the harvested energy Q k and the remaining energy Q C,k should be bounded by the minimum required energy transferred to receiver k, E min k . We assume E min k ≥ Q C,k so as to guarantee the harvested energy Q k ≥ 0. Transmission power constraint C2 ensures that the power radiated by transmitter s is upper bounded by maximum transmission power P max sd . Power consumption constraint C3 restricts the maximum power supplied by the source for supporting the power consumption on its circuit and power amplifier to the maximum battery capacity E max . C4 is a quality of service (QoS) constraint for the system that the aggregate network throughput should satisfy the minimum system data rate requirement, R min . Note that although R min is not an optimization variable in this paper, we can strike a balance between energy efficiency and aggregate system throughput by varying its value. C5 is the minimum required data rate R min d for the delay constrained services of receiver d, and is specified by the application layer, and K ′ denotes a set of receivers having delay constrained services. C6 and C7 are relay selection constraints which require that each relay node is only allocated to at most one source exclusively. C6 and C7 implicitly impose a fairness constraint, since each relay node is only allocated to at most one source exclusively. In other words, the relay allocated to a source is not allowed to forward the data from other sources. This implies that a weaker source also has a higher chance to be selected as a relay. C8 specifies that the power splitting ratio for harvesting energy is limited by the constant lower bound, ρ E min , and upper bound, ρ E max . These bounds reflect the limited capability of receivers in splitting the received power. ρ I min and ρ I max in C9 denote the constant lower and upper bounds of the power splitting ratio for decoding information, respectively, where ρ E min + ρ I max = 1 and ρ E max +ρ I min = 1. C10 reflects that the power splitting unit as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> is a passive device and no extra power gain can be achieved during the power splitting process.</p><p>The key challenge in solving the optimization problem OPT-1 in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">10</ref>) is its lack of convexity due to the fractional form of the objective function and the couplings of optimization variables {P, ρ, T } in constraints C1-C5 and the objective function.</p></div>

Then we update parameter q and use it to solve the main loop problem in the next iteration until the condition U (P, ρ, T ) -qU T P (P, ρ, T ) &lt; ǫ is satisfied, which implies that the iterative algorithm converges and the obtained allocation policy achieves optimum, i.e., (P, ρ, T ) → (P * , ρ * , T * ).</p><p>The transformed problem (OPT-2) for given energy efficiency q can be given by OPT -2 max P,ρ,T U (P, ρ, T ) -qU T P (P, ρ, T )</p><p>Subject to constraints C1-C10.

The proposed algorithm of energy efficiency maximization in Algorithm 1 converges to the optimal energy efficiency if the optimization problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">13</ref>) can be solved in each iteration.</p><p>Proof: See Appendix A. In fact, the transformed objective function has an interesting pricing interpretation from the economy point of view. U (P, ρ, T ) indicates the system profit due to data cooperative transmission while U T P (P, ρ, T ) represents the associated cost due to energy consumption. The optimal value of q indicates a scaling factor for balancing profit and cost.</p><p>Although the transformed optimization problem (OPT-2) has an equivalent objective function in subtractive form which is easier to handle, there are still two obstacles in tracking the problem. First, ρ I i and ρ E i are coupled with the power allocation variables in both the objective function and constraints C1, C4 and C5, which complicates the solution. Second, the binary constraint C6 on relay selection variables creates a disjoint feasible solution set and makes constraints C1-C5 become the combinatorial constraints, which is a hurdle for solving the OPT-2 problem.</p><p>In order to strike a balance between solution tractability and computational complexity, we handle the above issues in following two steps. In the first step, due to the integer constraint t s,r ∈ {0, 1}, problem OPT-1 is a mixed integer programming problem, which is in general non-convex and NP-hard. Thus, we first adopt the time-sharing relaxation technique that has been employed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> to guarantee the convexity and tractability of the optimization problem. We relax the relay selection variable t s,r in C6 to a real number between 0 and 1, i.e., 0 ≤ t s,r ≤ 1. Then t s,r can be interpreted as a time-sharing factor for the K sources to utilize relay node r.</p><p>In the second step, we introduce a new auxiliary variable P sd , which is defined as P sd = t s,r P sd and represents the actual transmitted power from source s to its destination d through relay node r. In addition, we assume that the power splitting ratio for information decoding at relay r is the same as that at the corresponding destination d, i.e., ρ I r = ρ I d . This is justified since if ρ I r = ρ I d , it can be observed from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">4</ref>) that the update of ρ I r at relay node r depends on the update of ρ I d at its destination d in the proposed power splitting subalgorithm, and vice versa, which greatly increases the computation complexity and consumes much more energy for exchanging a large number of intermediate computation messages.</p><p>As for the suboptimality caused by the assumption, let ρ I * d and ρ I * * d denote the suboptimal and optimal power splitting ratios for information decoding at destination d, respectively, and we can obtain for DT mode. The latter is because the channel gain λ sd is not related to ρ I r . Clearly, for RT mode, when a rd → a sd , ρ I * d will approximately equal ρ I * * d . In practice, this case occurs frequently since the relay usually lies in the middle between the source and the destination, and the channel gain a rd between the relay and the destination is close to the channel gain a sd between the source and the destination.</p><p>Based on this assumption, we follow the approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and approximate the data rate as</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">R sd = B 2 (1 + ϑ s ) log ρ I d λ sd P sd /t s,r<label>(14)</label></formula><p>which is a tight approximation for high SINR, i.e., λ sd P sd ≫ 1.

Theorem 3. The transformed OPT-2 problem with constraints C1 ′ -C10 is convex with respect to (w.r.t) the optimization variables P sd , ρ I d , ρ E d and t s,r . Proof: See Appendix B. Theorem 3 reveals that the transformed OPT-2 problem in (13) has a zero duality gap and satisfies the Slater's constraint qualification. The zero-duality-gap result provides an avenue to obtain the optimal solution of the primal problem in (13) derived from its corresponding dual problem as will be seen later.</p></div>

Besides, Lagrange multiplier υ forces the receiver to split larger ratio of power used to decode information in order to ensure that the aggregated network throughput satisfies the minimum system data rate requirement.

Relay Selection Subalgorithm</head><p>The goal of the relay selection subalgorithm is to provide a relay selection criterion by which all overhearing nodes calculate their priority.

In other words, relay r is selected to cooperatively forward the data of source s if it can provide the maximum marginal benefit to the system, which implies that relay r has the highest priority to be selected among all candidate relay nodes of source s. Besides, if relay r has a high priority, it will have a large value of α r and the resource allocator at the transmitter will have a higher preference to select relay r. On the other hand, we can observe from (23) that although constraint relaxation is used in constraint C6 for facilitating the design of the resource allocation algorithm, the relay selection policy on each relay for the relaxed problem remains Boolean.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SIMULATION AND DISCUSSIONS</head><p>In this section, we first verify the convergence of the proposed eCotrans algorithm. Furthermore, we compare and evaluate the performance of our solution for different parameters.</p><p>We assume that 50 cluster member nodes (CNs) are randomly located within a circular area within a radius of 120 meters. Here, we only use LEACH algorithm as an example to organize the clusters. Note that many other clustering protocols can also be used in our algorithm. We let α = 2, ε = 5 and k ij = 1. The channel gains are generated according to a Rayleigh fading model. Without loss of generality, we assume that all receivers have the same priority α r = 1, and all nodes have the same circuit power consumption, i.e., P CH = P CR = 10dBm. We let ρ E min = ρ I min = 0 and ρ E max = ρ I max = 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Convergence and Performance Analysis</head><p>In this subsection, we study the convergence of the proposed eCotrans algorithm. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> illustrates the evolution of energy efficiency for different maximum transmit power allowance P max , and the number of relays N in a cluster. By analyzing the results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, we can see that the energy efficiency increases with the number of iterations and then converges within 12 iterations in every considered scenario. Note that the number of iterations in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> indicates only the main loop iterations for the Dinkelbach method, but not that for the gradient method. Another important observation is that the energy efficiency is directly proportional to P max . This is justifiable since a higher transmit power allowance leads to the larger transmit power and data rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Impact of Relay Nodes on Energy Efficiency</head><p>In this subsection, we evaluate the impact of the number of candidate relay nodes in a cluster on energy efficiency under the DT and RT modes, respectively. To reflect the DT and RT modes, we let ρ I r = ρ I d and a sr ≥ a rd , which implies that if a rd &gt; a sd , the CH works at the RT mode, otherwise, it works at the DT mode. We define IN R = a rd /a sd and let IN R be 0.5, 0.8, 1.2 and 1.5. Clearly, the first two ratio values indicate the DT mode is valid while the latter two values imply that the RT mode is available. We observe from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> that compared to the DT mode, the energy efficiency of the proposed algorithm at the RT mode increases remarkably with the number of candidate relay nodes. However, the increase of energy efficiency becomes slower and finally stable with further increase of the number of relays. This is mainly due to that (i) it induces more collisions and energy consumption of all control messages such as RTS/CTS; (ii) the relay selection subalgorithm has to traverse more candidate relays and execute more iterations to find the optimal relay. Another important observation is that for the same transmission mode, the energy efficiency is directly proportional to the normalized effective channel gain.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Impact of Power Allowance on Average Harvested Energy</head><p>In this subsection, we explore the impact of the maximum allowed transmit power P max on the average harvested energy for different INR levels. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> depicts the average harvested energy at the CH versus the maximum power allowance for different IN R levels. We set IN R to be 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0, which means that the CH works at the RT mode. It can be observed from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> that in lower P max , only a small portion of received energy is harvested by the CH for energy efficiency maximization. This is due to the fact that for small values of the transmit power allowance, the received power of the desired signal at the receivers may not be sufficiently large for simultaneous information decoding and energy harvesting. On the contrary, for the higher level of the transmit power allowance, the receiver has a higher tendency to split a larger proportion of the received power for energy harvesting until the amount of average harvested energy is saturated. This is because that once the constraints on the minimum required energy transfer to receiver k, E min k , and the minimum system data rate requirement, R min , are satisfied, the transmitter stops increasing the transmit power for energy efficiency maximization. On the other hand, we can observe that a higher amount of energy is harvested by the receiver when the IN R level increases. As a result, splitting more received power for energy harvesting can enhance the system energy efficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Impact of Inter-Cluster Distance on Energy Efficiency</head><p>In this subsection, we discuss how the distance L ij between the CH i and the CH j affects the energy efficiency under the different maximum transmit power allowance. In this case, we set the number of CN nodes in a cluster as N = 8 and let P max be 30dBm and 40dBm. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> reflects the evolution of energy efficiency with inter-cluster distance. It can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> that when the inter-cluster distance L ij increases, the energy efficiency decreases, correspondingly. This is justified since when L ij increases, the proposed algorithm needs more sensor nodes to participate in cooperation to reach long transmitting distance for a given P max , which leads to more energy consumption. Another observation is that the energy efficiency at the RT mode is always larger than that at the DT mode as L ij increases. This is because that the long transmitting distance will hinder the direct transmission between the two CHs and even make the direct transmission invalid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Comparison on Energy Efficiency and Remaining Energy</head><p>In this subsection, we compare the performance of the proposed eCotrans algorithm and several existing cooperative schemes, such as the eCocom scheme in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the coCoalition scheme in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the eCooperation algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and the coNetspa scheme in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> in terms of energy efficiency and remaining energy for different maximum allowed transmit powers. The eCocom is an energy efficient selective single-relay cooperative scheme with physical-layer power control. The coCoalition is a cooperative communication scheme based on coalition formation game in clustered WSNs. The eCooperation is an energy-efficient cooperative transmission strategy using cooperative multi-input-multioutput (CMIMO) technique. The coNetspa scheme is an energy harvesting cooperative scheme for wireless information and power transfer in cooperative networks with spatially random relays. The first three schemes are energy efficient cooperative schemes, but without energy harvesting, while the coNetspa scheme involves the application of SWIPT to wireless cooperative networks, but it does not consider energy efficiency maximization.</p><p>In the simulation, we let N = 8 and IN R = 1.5. We consider the scenario that all cluster member nodes (CNs) have the same amount of data to be sent and the same initial remaining energy. Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> illustrates the comparison of energy efficiency between the proposed eCotrans algorithm and the existing schemes. It can be observed that all the cooperative schemes have an increasing energy efficiency with the maximum transmit power allowance until the achieved energy efficiency gain attains its maximum in the high transmit power allowance region. However, our proposed eCotrans algorithm achieves the highest energy efficiency. This is justified since we employ the energy harvesting cooperative transmission, combining the optimal cooperative relay selection with the optimal power control and power splitting at the physical layer.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> depicts the remaining energy in the battery for receivers CH1, CN1, CN2 and CH3 as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> after transmitting the same amount of data by different cooperative schemes. It is observed that the proposed eCotrans algorithm has more remaining energy in the batteries of all receivers while also having the best remaining energy balance among receiver nodes. In particular, for the receivers CN1 and CN2, the superiority of the eCotrans algorithm is more obvious. The reason is that by using eCotrans algorithm, the receivers are able to harvest the energy from the received signals and replenish the harvested energy in the battery while forwarding the data from their upstream nodes. More importantly, although the CH3 node has more data to forward from its neighbor nodes as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, it still has more remaining energy in its battery. This is because the CH3 node is capable of harvesting the energy of ambient RF signals from the transmitters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we consider applying SWIPT to cooperative clustered WSNs, where energy-constrained relay nodes avail the ambient RF signal and simultaneously harvest energy and process information to prolong their lifetime. Our goal is to provide the optimal policies for power allocation and relay selection and determine the optimal power splitting ratio so that the system energy efficiency is maximized. To achieve this goal, we formulate the eCotrans problem as a non-convex constrained optimization problem. Furthermore, we propose a distributed iteration algorithm with closed-form transmission power, power slitting ratio and relay selection by exploiting dual decomposition. In particular, we find that power splitting ratio plays an imperative role in relay selection, however, it depends on the minimum harvested energy requirement. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed iterative algorithm converges within a small number of iterations. Compared to existing algorithms without energy harvesting or energy efficiency maximizing, our proposed iterative algorithm can achieve higher energy efficiency and more remaining energy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX A PROOF OF THEOREM 2</head><p>We employ a similar approach to that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> to prove the convergence of Algorithm 1. We first introduce two propositions to demonstrate the properties of the equivalent objective function in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. For the sake of notational simplicity, we define F as the set of feasible points of the optimization problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and let F (q) = max P,ρ,T U (P, ρ, T ) -qU T P (P, ρ, T ). Proposition 1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> F (q) is a strictly monotonically decreasing function with respect to (w.r.t) q, i.e., F (q ′ ) &gt; F (q) if q &gt; q ′ . Proposition 2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> Let {P ′ , ρ ′ , T ′ } ∈ F be an arbitrary feasible solution and q ′ = U(P ′ ,ρ ′ ,T ′ ) UT P (P ′ ,ρ ′ ,T ′ ) . Then F (q ′ ) &gt; 0. Next, we prove the convergence of Algorithm 1. This proof includes two parts: the first part is to prove that energy efficiency q increases with the number of iterations; the second part is to prove that if the number of iterations is large enough, then energy efficiency q converges to the optimal q * such that it satisfies the optimality condition in Theorem 1, i.e., F (q * ) = 0.</p><p>Let {P n , ρ n , T n } be the optimal resource allocation policies in the n-th iteration. We assume q n = q * and q n+1 = q * represent the energy efficiency of the system in iterations n and n + 1, respectively. By Proposition 2, we have F (q n ) &gt; 0 and F (q n+1 ) &gt; 0. On the other hand, in the proposed Algorithm 1, we calculate q n+1 as q n+1 = U(Pn,ρn,Tn) UT P (Pn,ρn,Tn) . Thus we can compute F (q n ) by F (q n ) = U (P n , ρ n , T n )q n U T P (P n , ρ n , T n ) = q n+1 U T P (P n , ρ n , T n )q n U T P (P n , ρ n , T n ) = U T P (P n , ρ n , T n )(q n+1q n ) Since F (q n ) &gt; 0 and U T P (P n , ρ n , T n ) &gt; 0, it is not difficult to obtain q n+1 &gt; q n . That completes the proof of the first part.</p><p>By q n+1 &gt; q n and Proposition 1, we can obtain that F (q n ) will eventually approach zero and satisfy the optimality condition in Theorem 1. That completes the proof the second part.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX B PROOF THEOREM 3</head><p>We first prove that the transformed objective function U (P, ρ, T )-qU T P (P, ρ, T ) is jointly concave w.r.t. the optimization variables P sd , ρ I d , ρ E d and t s,r . Then we show the convexity of constraints C1 ′ -C10.</p><p>The concavity of the transformed objective function can be proved by the following steps. First, we consider the concavity of function U (P, ρ, T ) based on a relay selection w.r. It is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> that the perspective transformation preserves the concavity of the function. Thus function u sd (x sd ) is jointly concave w.r.t. P sd , ρ I d , ρ E d and t s,r . Function U (P, ρ, T ) is the sum of u sd (x sd ) over indices s, d and r, which preserves the concavity of the function <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>In the following, we prove the convexity of function U T P (P, ρ, T ). Since the function U T P (P, ρ, T ) is an affine function of the variable P sd , the function is convex w.r.t the variable P sd . Therefore, it is not difficult to obtain that the transformed objective function U (P, ρ, T ) -qU T P (P, ρ, T ) is jointly concave w.r.t. the optimization variables P sd , ρ I d , ρ E d and t s,r . Now, we verify the convexity of constraints C1 ′ -C10. The left term of constraint C1 ′ is linear, which implies that it is both convex and concave, and its right term is convex. Therefore, constraint C ′ is convex. Since all the inequalities in constraints C2 and C3 are linear function of variable P sd , clearly, the constraints C2 -C3 are convex. The relaxed constraint C6 and constraints C7 -C10 span a convex feasible set. As for constraints C4 and C5, it is easy to show that the constraints are convex due to the concavity of function U (P, ρ, T ).</p><p>As a result, the transformed OPT-2 problem is a convex optimization problem w.r.t. P sd , ρ I d , ρ E d and t s,r .</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
