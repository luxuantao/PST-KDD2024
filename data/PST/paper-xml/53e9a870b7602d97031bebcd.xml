<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Femtocells can effectively resolve the poor connectivity issue of indoor cellular users. This paper investigates the economic incentive for a cellular operator to add femtocell service on top of its existing macrocell service. We model the interactions between a cellular operator and users as a Stackelberg game: the operator first determines spectrum allocations and pricings of femtocell and macrocell services, and then heterogeneous users choose between the two services and the amount of resource to request. In the ideal case where the femtocell service has the same full spatial coverage as the macrocell service, we show that the operator will choose to provide femtocell service only, as this leads to a better user Quality of Service and a higher operator profit. However, if we impose the constraint that no users' payoffs decrease after introducing the femtocell service, then the operator will always continue providing the macrocell service (with or without the femtocell service). Furthermore, we study the impact of operational cost, limited coverage, and spatial reuse on femtocell service provision. As the operational cost increases, fewer users are served by femtocell service and the operator's profit decreases. When the femtocell service has limited spatial coverage, the operator always provides the macrocell service beside the femtocell service. However, when the coverage is high or the total resource is low, the operator will set the prices such that all users who can access femtocell will choose to use the femtocell service only. Finally, spatial reuse of spectrum will increase the efficiency of femtocell services, and gives the operator more incentives to allocate spectrum to femtocells.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HE next generation 4G cellular systems aim at pro- viding end users with high data rates and reliable services by operating at wider and higher frequency bands (e.g., 2496MHz-to-2690MHz for TD-LTE in U.S.). However, severe signal attenuation at these high frequencies often causes poor signal receptions for indoor users, who are separated by walls from outdoor cellular base stations of macrocells. 1  To solve the poor signal reception problem for indoor users, researchers have proposed the idea of femtocell (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>). Compared to macrocells, femtocells are short-range, low deployment cost, and low power userdeployed tiny base stations. A user can deploy a femtocell at home and connect it to the wireline broadband Internet connection, e.g., the digital subscriber line (DSL). Femtocells are often managed by the same operator that controls the macrocells, and they can provide better quality of service (QoS) to indoor users as they are very close to users' cell phones. Currently, the operator can provide the femtocell service via one of the two modes: closed access or open access <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In both modes, femtocell users need to purchase the femtocells from the operator and deploy the devices at their homes. In the closed access mode, a user needs to register with a femtocell before enjoying the femtocell service (when the user is close to the femtocell). The femtocell will never serve unregistered users. In the open access mode, however, a femtocell serves all users close by without require prior registration. Most femtocell owners prefer closed access mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, as this helps to preserve limited network capacity and reduce privacy loss. We will focus on the closed access mode in this paper.</p><p>Despite the obvious motivation to deploy femtocell service, the operator needs to carefully consider several issues that will affect the economic return of the femtocell service.</p><p>First, the femtocell service needs to share the limited licensed bands with the macocell service. There are two types of sharing schemes. The first scheme is "separate carriers", where the femtocells and macrocells occupy non-overlapping spectrum bands (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>). The second scheme is "shared carriers" (or "partially shared carriers"), where macrocells and femtocells operate on (partially) overlapping bands (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>). Each scheme has its certain advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>• "Separate carriers" scheme is easy to manage and can avoid interferences between macrocells and femtocells. For example, China Unicom (one of the three main wireless service providers in mainland China and the first one deploying femtocell since 2009) is in strong favor of this scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. This scheme can support two types of access schemes: the public access where femtocell network becomes an extension of the macrocell network and can be used by any user of the operator, and the private access scheme where only registered femtocell users can gain access <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. However, "separate carriers" scheme reduces the available spectrum for both services.</p><p>• "Shared carriers" (or "partially shared carriers") scheme is an efficient frequency allocation scheme where macrocells and femtocells operate on (partially) the same spectrum (i.e., co-channel operation).</p><p>In this case, the operation of femtocells leads to increased interferences for macrocell users, and affects macrocell capacity and service quality ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>). Proper interference management is very challenging, as femtocells are deployed by users and thus the interference is often hard to predict by the operator. Also, a key requirement for co-channel operation is to allow public access on all femtocells (and thus may not support private access) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The purpose of this requirement is to mitigate femtocells' interferences to macrocell users by forcing macrocell users to switch to femtocell service whenever possible. However, such public access leads to significant signaling overhead due to increased handovers <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In this paper, we will focus on the first "separate carriers" scheme.</p><p>Second, when an operator introduces the femtocell service and charges a higher price, some users who originally experience good macrocell service quality may experience a decrease in payoff with the femtocell service due to a higher femtocell payment. It is important to ensure the satisfaction of these users by keeping the original macrocell service available at the original price. This will limit the resource allocation to femtocell service.</p><p>Third, although femtocells are low in deployment costs, the femtocell service may incur additional operational cost compared to macrocells. Femtocell users' traffics need to go through wireline broadband Internet connections. The wireline Internet Service Providers (ISPs) may impose additional charges on the femtocell related traffics <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Also, since the femtocell users' traffics will go through the ISP's network before reaching the cellular operator's own network, issues such as synchronization with macrocells become more challenging to resolve <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Moreover, femtocell service needs billing system integration with macrocell service, and requires additional customer support.</p><p>In this paper, we will discuss the economic incentive of the operator's femtocell service provision, by considering three issues discussed above. We want to understand when and how the operator should offer the femtocell service, and the corresponding impacts on the original macrocell service. Our main results and contributions include:</p><p>• A Dynamic Decision Model: We model and analyze the interactions between a cellular operator and users as a two-stage Stackelberg game. Users experience different channel conditions and spectrum efficiencies with the macrocell service, but all of them achieve a high spectrum efficiency with the femtocell service. Thus users have different preferences between macrocells and femtocells. The operator makes spectrum allocations and pricing decisions for both macrocell and femtocell services to maximize its total profit. • Profit-Maximizing with Femtocell Service Only: If femtocell service has the same maximum coverage as macrocell service, then a profit-maximizing operator will choose to only offer femtocell service to all its users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Dual Service Provision Considering Users' Reservation</head><p>Payoffs: If we consider users' reservation payoffs as what they can achieve with the original macrocell service, then offering femtocell service only may force some users to leave and thus may not be optimal to the operator. In this case, we characterize when and how the operator should provide the femtocell service together with the macrocell service (i.e., dual services) so that all users achieve payoffs no worse than their reservation payoffs. • Impact of Femtocell Spatial Reuse, Operational Cost, and Limited Coverage: When multiple femtocells can reuse the same spectrum resource, the operator has more incentives to allocate spectrum to femtocell, and the femtocell price will be reduced to reflect this "small cell" advantage. Moreover, when femtocell service incurs operational cost to the operator or has a smaller coverage than the macrocell service, the operator will always serve users by dual services. Furthermore, as cost decreases or coverage increases, more users are served by the femtocell service. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We introduce the network model of macrocell service in Section 2, which serves as a benchmark for later analysis. In Section 3, we introduce the network model of femtocell service and analyze how the operator provides dual services in terms of spectrum allocations and pricing. Then we extend the results in Section 3 to Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7, by examining the impacts of users' reservation payoffs, femtocell frequency reuse, femtocell operational costs, and limited femtocell coverage. We conclude our work in Section 8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Related Work</head><p>Most prior work on femtocells focused on various technical issues in service provision (e.g., access control and resource management <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>). Chandrasekhar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> analyzed the uplink capacity and proposed an interference avoidance strategy for the coexistence of femtocells and macrocells in a CDMA network. Benmesbah et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> proposed a decentralized spectral resource allocation for OFMDA downlink of coexisting macro and femto network. Rangan <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> proposed to control femto-macro interference by interference cancelation and subband scheduling. Shi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> proposed an analytical model to explicitly investigate the uplink capacity and coverage of femtocells which coexist within macrocells. Tan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> studied the power control problem in Rayleigh-fading heterogeneous networks.</p><p>Only few papers have studied the economic issues of femtocell service ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>). Claussen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> explored the financial impact of femtocells on a macrocell network, with a focus on the network deployment costs. Lin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> compared three deployment types of femtocells, i.e., joint deployment, operator deployment, and user deployment frameworks. Yun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> studied whether it is economically beneficial for the cellular operator or femtocell owners to provide femtocell service to guest users. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> further studied how to motivate femtocell owners to open their resource to guest macrocell users. Shetty et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> analyzed the interplay of interferences and service pricing on users' adoption of femtocells. The key difference between our paper and the existing literature is that we study the operator's provision of dual services in terms of both spectrum allocations and pricing decisions. We also characterize the impacts of users' reservation payoffs, the femtocell operational cost, and the limited femtocell coverage on the service provision.</p><p>Our model on dual services is related to the dualchannel model in supply chain management, where a seller adds a direct channel (e.g., online selling) to the existing retailing channel to sell the same products ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>). There was no constraint on the operator's availability in obtaining resource. In our model, however, the operator's spectrum is limited, and the dual services (i.e., femtocell and macrocell services) are different in both QoS and coverage, which lead to an interesting new formulation and different engineering insights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">BENCHMARK: MACROCELL SERVICE ONLY</head><p>As a benchmark, we first look at how the operator prices the macrocell service to maximize its profit without the choice of the femtocell service. When we consider the introduction of femtocell service in Sections 3, 4, 6, and 7, the operator should achieve a profit no worse than this benchmark. Also, what users get in this benchmark will serve as their reservation payoffs in Section 4.</p><p>We consider an operator who owns a single macrocell. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> It owns a total B Hz wireless spectrum bandwidth to provide macrocell service, where each macrocell user is allocated part of the bandwidth and transmits over the allocated part accordingly. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we model the interactions between the operator and the users as a two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, the operator determines the macrocell price p M (per unit bandwidth) to maximize its profit. Here, subscript M denotes macrocells. In Stage II, each user decides how much bandwidth to purchase to maximize its payoff.</p><p>This usage-based pricing scheme is widely used in today's cellular macrocell networks, especially in Europe and Asia <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. In US, AT&amp;T (since December 2009) and Verizon (since July 2011) have adopted the usage-based pricing for wireless data services. Usagebased pricing for femtocell has just started. For example, AT&amp;T's femtocell service counts the femtocell data usage as part of the regular cellular usage (together with the macrocell data usage), which is subject to usage based pricing <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Due to the exponential growth of wireless data traffic and the scarce spectrum resource, we envision that usage-based pricing for both macrocell and femtocell services will become more common in the near future.</p><p>We next solve this two-stage Stackelberg game by backward induction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Users' Bandwidth Demands in Stage II</head><p>Different users experience different channel conditions to the macrocell base stations due to different locations, and thus achieve different data rates when using the same amount of bandwidth. We consider that a user has fixed transmission power P per unit bandwidth (e.g., power spectrum density constraint) and his average channel gain in the macrocell is h. Without interfering with other users, the user's macrocell spectrum efficiency is thus</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">θ = log 2 (1 + SNR) = log 2 1 + P h n 0 ,</formula><p>where n 0 is the background noise power density. By obtaining b Hz of spectrum, its achieved data rate is θb bits per second. As users have different channel gains in macrocell service, they perceive different macrocell spectrum efficiency θ. A larger θ means a better channel condition and a higher spectrum efficiency when using the macrocell service. In Section 3, we will show that all users achieve the same high spectrum efficiency with femtocell service as the femtocell is always close an indoor user. Note that θ can be normalized in the range [0, 1] and here we assume the θ is uniformly distributed (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref></p></div>

The user needs to pay a linear payment p M b to the operator, where the price p M is announced by the operator in Stage I. The user's payoff is the difference between its utility and payment, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">π M (θ, b, p M ) = ln(1 + θb) -p M b.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Operator's Pricing in Stage I</head><p>Next we consider the operator's optimal choice of price p M in Stage I. To achieve a positive profit, the operator needs to set p M ≤ max θ∈[0,1] θ = 1, so that at least some user purchases some positive bandwidth in Stage II. The fraction of users choosing macrocell service is 1p M as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The total user demand is</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Q M (p M ) = 1 p M 1 p M - 1 θ dθ = 1 p M -1 + ln p M , (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>which is a decreasing function of p M .

(<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>To facilitate later discussions, we denote this p * M as p bench M . 4 Furthermore, the total user demand Notice that all users with a macrocell spectrum efficiency θ less than p bench M will not receive macrocell service. When the total bandwidth B is small, the equilibrium macrocell price p bench M is close to 1 and thus most users will not get service. This motivates the operator to adopt the femtocell service so that it can serve these users and generate additional profits.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Q M (p bench M ) = B.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PROVISION OF FEMTOCELL SERVICE</head><p>We now consider how femtocell service can improve the operator's profit. Note that the some users preferring one service (e.g., femtocell service) can be rejected if the bandwidth in that service is not enough. This is motivated by the fact that a femtocell with limited bandwidth can only serve several users <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Similarly, if a macrocell faces demands from too many users, some users will be out of service.</p><p>The analysis in this section is based on several assumptions, each of which will be relaxed in later sections.</p><p>• Each user has a zero reservation payoff. This means that if a user's bandwidth demand in macrocell service is not satisfied, he will switch to femtocell as long as its payoff is positive. 5 This assumption will be relaxed in Section 4. • Different femtocells use different spectrum bands and do not have frequency reuse. This assumption will be relaxed in Section 5. • The femtocell service does not incur any additional operational cost compared to the macrocell service. This assumption will be relaxed in Section 6. • The femtocell service has the same maximum coverage as the macrocell service, and each user can access to both macrocell and femtocell services. This assumption will be relaxed in Section 7. It should be noted that we also jointly relax all four assumptions in Appendix E, where most engineering insights in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 still hold.</p><p>4. The superscript of p bench M means the benchmark scenario with marcrocell service only.</p><p>5. For example, users may have zero reservation payoff if the operator is the monopolist in the local market and users do not have other operator choices. This is the case in countries such as Mexico and some other Latin American, where America Movil is the dominant operator.  We are interested in answering the following two questions:</p><p>• Is it economically viable for the the operator to introduce the femtocell service? • If so, how should the operator determine resource allocation and pricing for macrocell and femtocell services? Under the assumptions in this section, we will show that the operator will choose to only provide femtocell service (i.e., no macrocell service) and charge a femtocell price p * F than the optimal macrocell price p * M derived in the benchmark (Section 2).</p><p>Notice that we have assumed that the femtocell service has the same maximum coverage as the macrocell service in this section. This means that if a user decides to become a femtocell user, there is no need for him to use macrocell service at any time.</p><p>More specifically, we will look at a two-stage Stackelberg game as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. In Stage I, the operator determines bandwidth allocated to femtocell service (femtocell band B F ) and to macrocell service (macrocell band B M ), with B F + B M = B. The operator also determines the femtocell price p F and macrocell price p M . In Stage II, each user decides which service to choose and how much bandwidth to purchase. If a user's demand cannot be satisfied by its preferred service, it will purchase bandwidth from the other service. 6 We will again analyze this twostage Stackelberg game by using backward induction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Users' Service Choices and Bandwidth Demands in Stage II</head><p>If a user has a macrocell spectrum efficiency θ, its maximum payoff by using the macrocell service is given in (3). Next we consider users' payoffs by using the femtocell service.</p><p>Since femtocell base stations are deployed indoors and are very close to the users' cell phones, we assume that all users using the femtocell service have equal good channel conditions and all of them achieve the high spectrum efficiency. This means that independent of the macrocell spectrum efficiency θ, each user achieves the 6.

We assume that the operator has a higher priority to serve users with larger values of θ by macrocell service (as it is more efficient for the macrocell service to do so).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">IMPACT OF USERS' RESERVATION PAYOFFS</head><p>In this section, we will consider the operator's decisions by assuming that each user with a macrocell spectrum efficiency θ receives a payoff no less than π M (θ, b * , p bench M ) as calculated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. This means that the operator always needs to provide macrocell service at the same price as p bench M derived based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Also, all users' preferred demands in macrocell service should be satisfied. Next we consider a two-stage decision process similar to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. The only difference here is that the operator needs to satisfy users' reservation payoffs.</p><p>In this section only, we assume that the operator has a priority to serve the users with the smallest θ first in femtocell service. This is reasonable since femtocell service aims at improving QoS of indoor users especially for those with a small macrocell spectrum efficiency. These users cannot use macrocell service and will be happy to pay a high price for the femtocell service. For users with a high macrocell spectrum efficiency, they have the additional choice of macrocell service and will not use femtocell service if p F is high.</p><p>We will again use backward induction to analyze the problem. As Stage II is the same as Section 3.1, we will focus on the operator's decisions on B M , B F , and p F in Stage I.</p><p>Lemma 3: At the equilibrium, only one of the following is true:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">• Only users with θ ∈ [p bench M</formula><p>, 1] are served with the macrocell service, and no users are served with the femtocell service.</p><p>• All users with θ ∈ [0, 1] are served, by either the macrocell service or the femtocell service, and some user with θ ≥ p bench M is served by the macrocell service. Proof. We prove this lemma by contradiction. First, assume that all users with θ ∈ [p bench M , 1] receive the macrocell service, and some user with θ &lt; p bench M receive the femtocell service. However, this is impossible as the macrocell users already use a total bandwidth of B and there is no resource left for the femtocell service. Second, assume that there exists a partition threshold θ * th &gt; p bench M , such that some users with θ &lt; θ * th do not receive femtocell service. Due to the constraint on reservation payoffs, all users with θ ∈ [p bench M , θ * th ) receive the femtocell service. Since the operator has a priority to serve the users with small θ first in the femtocells, then all users with θ &lt; p bench M also receive femtocell service. This contracts with the assumption.</p><p>Lemma 3 shows that the equilibrium femtocell band is either</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">B * F = 0 or B * F ≥ p bench M 0 (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_28">p * F -1</formula><p>)dθ. This implies that when supply B is low, the operator needs to allocate all its bandwidth supply B for macrocell service to reach users' reservation payoffs. Only when B is high, the operator can serve all users by dual services (i.e., macrocell and femtocell services). This will be further illustrated in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref>. Notice that as long as supply B is high, femtocell band needs to serve users more than those with θ ∈ [0, p bench M ]. Thus there is a corresponding sharp increase of B * F (and a sharp decrease of B * M ) when supply B slightly increases from the low to the high regime.</p><p>By following a similar analysis as in Section 3, we can show that the total supply B equals users' total finalized demand at the equilibrium (i.e., Lemma 2). The operator's profit-maximization problem can be simplified as</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">max p F ,θ th ∈[0,1] π operator (p F , θ th ) = p F θ th 0 1 p F -1 dθ + p bench M 1 θ th 1 p bench M - 1 θ dθ subject to p bench M ≤ θ th ≤ p bench M /p F , θ th 0 1 p F -1 dθ + 1 θ th 1 p bench M - 1 θ dθ = B, (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_30">)</formula><p>where p bench M is computed from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">6</ref>), and the right in- equality of the first constraint means that the operator cannot violate users' preferences in macrocell service. In the second constraint, the first and second terms on the left hand side are the users' finalized total demands in femtocells and macrocells, respectively.</p><p>Problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_29">15</ref>) is difficult to solve in closed form, so we use numerical results to illustrate some interesting insights.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref> shows the operator's equilibrium femtocell price p * F and macrocell price p bench M as functions of total bandwidth B. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref> is consistent with Lemma 3, where the femtocell price is very high (p * F = 1) in the low supply regime (i.e., B &lt; 3.5), thus no users would choose femtocell service and B * F = 0. Both services are available in the high supply regime (i.e., B ≥ 3.5), where the femtocell price is lower and becomes attractive to users. We can observe sharp decrease of p * F at the boundary value B = 3.5 that distinguishes the low and high supply regimes. This is consistent with Lemma 3 where the operator needs to serve users more than those with θ ∈ [0, p bench M ] once in the high supply regime, and thus the femtocell price needs to be significantly reduced to attract users. We further observe that p * F decreases faster than p bench M in the high supply regime, which means that the operator wants to attract more users to the more efficient femtocell service.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref> shows the users' equilibrium partition threshold θ * th with dual services, comparing to the partition threshold of the macrocell service only case in Section 2. In the low supply regime (i.e., B &lt; 3.5), two curves overlap as the dual services degenerate to the macrocell service only in this regime. However, in the high supply regime, the operator will announce similar femtocell and macrocell prices (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>), and most users will choose to use femtocell service (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>). Unlike the femtocell service only case in Section 3 (without considering users' reservation payoffs), here users with large θ values will choose to stay with the macrocell service and are not affected by the introduction of femtocell service.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref> shows the operator's equilibrium bandwidth  allocations to dual services (i.e., B * F and B * M ) as functions of the total bandwidth supply B. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref> is directly related to Lemma 3, where only macrocell service is available in the low supply regime (i.e., B &lt; 3.5), and both services are available in the high supply regime (i.e., B ≥ 3.5). Consistent with Lemma 3 and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>, there is a sharp decrease of B * M right at the boundary that distinguishes the low and high supply regimes. In the high supply regime, femtocell band B * F increases faster than the macrocell band B * M . This is because the operator can obtain a higher profit by selling more bandwidth by the femtocell service, which charges users a higher price than the macrocell service. The increasing property of B * M within each regime is intuitive: in the low supply regime, the increase of B * M is a result of increased B and the provisions of macrocell service only; in the high supply regime, as B increases, B * M will continue to increase as more resource needs to distribute to high theta users.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref> compares the operator's profits in three different cases: femtocell service only as in Section 3, dual services as in this section, and macrocell service only as in Section 2. In the low supply regime, dual services degenerate to the macrocell service case. In the high supply regime, the profit of the dual services becomes closer to the femtocell service only case as B increases. This means that considering users' reservation payoffs will not lead to significant profit loss when the total resource is abundant. In this case, only users with a θ very close to 1 will stay with the macrocell service and all other users will choose the femtocell service.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">IMPACT OF FEMTOCELL FREQUENCY REUSE</head><p>In Section 3, we have assumed that different femtocells use different spectrum bands. However, as a femtocell often has a smaller coverage (e.g., tens of meters within a home) than the macrocell (e.g., hundreds of meters), it is often possible to have multiple non-overlapping femtocells within the same macrocell coverage. These nonoverlapping femtocells can use the same spectrum band without interfering with each other. This is also called frequency reuse. We will discuss how frequency reuse affects the operator's provision of femtocell service.</p><p>Our analysis here will be based on the simplified scenario as in Section 3. We again analyze the twostage game by using backward induction. Here the users' requests in service and bandwidth in Stage II are the same as Section 3.1. If the same spectrum is allocated to two different femtocells, then the operator collect twice of the revenue.</p><p>Now we are ready to analyze Stage I to derive the operator's equilibrium decisions. Let us denote the average number of interfering femtocells that cannot use the same frequency spectrum as K, and the frequency reuse factor is then 1/K. We will assume that the total number of femtocells is N &gt; K. Thus after considering frequency reuse, the available spectrum to each femtocell increases from B F /N to B F /K. Then the total available bandwidth to all femtocells will be B F N/K instead of B F .</p><p>By following a similar proof as that of Theorem 2, we have the following result.</p><p>Theorem 3: At the equilibrium, the operator will only provide femtocell service, i.e., B * F = B and B * M = 0. All users will use femtocell service, i.e., users' equilibrium partition threshold θ * th = 1. The equilibrium femtocell price is</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">p * F = 1 1 + B N K , (<label>16</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_32">)</formula><p>and the operator's equilibrium profit is</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">π operator * = B N K 1 + B N K , (<label>17</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_34">)</formula><p>which is increasing in the ratio N K . By comparing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, we conclude that the operator obtains a larger profit by adopting frequency reuse for femtocells. This is consistent with the current engineering practice of reducing cell size to increase frequency reuse and improve network capacity. Apparently, smaller femtocell size means a larger N , and thus a larger capacity increasing ratio N/K and a larger profit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">IMPACT OF FEMTOCELL OPERATIONAL COST</head><p>In Section 3, we have assumed that there is no additional operational cost of the femtocell service. The data from the femtocells will be delivered through the wireline Internet connection of an ISP back to the operator's cellular network, free of charge. However, this is only reasonable when the operator and the ISP belong to the same entity or the ISP is sharing-friendly as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In this section, we consider the case where the ISP will charge the operator usage-based fees for using the wireline Internet connection in downloading femtocell users' traffics from Internet. We are interested in understanding how this additional operational cost affects the provision of femtocell service.</p><p>For simplicity, we assume that the operational cost is linearly proportional to femtocell bandwidth with the coefficient C. This assumption is reasonable if the ISP adopts the usage-based charging that is linear in femtocell users' total traffic volume. 10 Recall that in Section 3 we have shown each femtocell user's data rate and traffic volume are linear in its bandwidth demand, thus all femtocell users' total traffic volume is also linear in their total bandwidth demand. We focus on the case of C ∈ (0, 1). It is easy to show that if C ≥ 1, then the operator will charge a femtocell price p F &gt; 1, and no user will choose the femtocell service based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. In other words, an operational cost C ≥ 1 means no femtocell service.</p><p>We consider a two-stage decision process similar as Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. The analysis of Stage II is the same as in Section 3.1. Here we will focus on the operator's decisions on B M , B F , p M , and p F in Stage I. Following a similar analysis as in Section 3, we can show that the total bandwidth B equals users' total finalized demand at the equilibrium (i.e., Lemma 2). Then we can formulate the operator's profit-maximization problem as</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">max p M ,p F ,θ th ∈[0,1] π operator (p M , p F , θ th ) = (p F -C)θ th 1 p F -1 + p M 1 -θ th p M + ln θ th subject to p M ≤ θ th ≤ 1, θ th 1 p F -1 + 1 -θ th p M + ln θ th = B.

Even if the ISP adopts other usage-based charging that is nonlinear in femtocell traffics, we can still show that the main insights in this section (e.g., Theorem 4) still holds. Moreover, besides the usagebased charging, even if we also consider some immediate investment cost (e.g., software upgrade and customer support), the results in this section can be extended as that cost would not affect the operator's decisions.  The proof of Theorem 4 is given in Appendix C. Note that p * M is the equilibrium macrocell price, and θ * th is the users' equilibrium partition threshold with dual services. Intuitively, a positive operational cost C forces the operator to charge a higher femtocell price p * F than the value in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. However, the small payment from users with a large value of θ (who only experience a little QoS improvement) in the femtocell service cannot cover the increased operational cost to the operator. As a result, the operator will serve these users by the macrocell service.</p><p>Problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_35">18</ref>) is difficult to solve in closed form, so we use numerical results to illustrate some interesting insights.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9</ref> shows the operator's equilibrium femtocell price p * F and macrocell price p * M as functions of bandwidth supply B and femtocell operational cost C. The femtocell price p * F is always larger than C in order to be profitable. The macrocell price p * M does not need to compensate any cost. When B increases, the operator can set p * M as low as needed to maximize its profit, but p * F is lower-bounded by C. This explains why the p * Fp * M widens as B increases, and such gap becomes even bigger with a larger C.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10</ref> shows users' equilibrium partition threshold θ * th as a function of B and C.

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">11</ref> shows the operator's equilibrium bandwidth allocations to dual services as functions of B and C. When B is small, femtocell band B * F increases with B since the operator wants to serve more users at much higher femtocell price. When B is large, B * F decreases with B and a larger C value causes B * F to decrease earlier (e.g., the decrease starts from B = 1.6, 1.1, and 0.6 when C = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5, respectively). Intuitively, the operator wants to maximize the profit by clearing the market (i.e., total supply equals total demand), thus both femtocell and macrocell prices should be low to match with the high supply B. However, the cost C serves as the lowerbound of femtocell price, and the high femtocell price (relative to macrocell price) makes more users switch to macrocell service as B increases. A higher value of C will further exaggerate this switching.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">12</ref> shows that the operator's equilibrium profit increases in B and decreases in C. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">IMPACT OF LIMITED FEMTOCELL COVER-AGE</head><p>In Section 3, we have assumed that femtocell service has the same maximum coverage as the macrocell service. In this section, we relax this assumption and consider that femtocell service only covers a small percentage of the macrocell coverage area as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">13</ref>. 11 We will try to understand how the limited coverage affects the provision of femtocell service. We still consider a two-stage decision process similar to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>.</p><p>We assume that the femtocell service covers η ∈ (0, 1) portion of the macrocell coverage area. If users are uniformly distributed in space, then only η portion of all users can potentially access both services (called overlapping users). The rest 1η portion of users can only access the macrocell service (called non-overlapping users). 12  Our results in Section 3 show that the operator wants to serve all overlapping users by the more efficient femtocell service if possible. The operator can try to achieve this via two approaches. The first approach is to announce the same price for both macrocell and femtocell services, which makes the macrocell service less attractive than the femtocell service to all overlapping users. This approach, however, means that the macrocell price is too high, and may not be most profitable when η is small. The second approach is to allocate all bandwidth B to the femtocell service. However, this may not be most profitable either, since the non-overlapping users will be out of service.</p><p>11. For simplicity, we assume that multiple femtocells cannot reuse the same frequency bands.</p><p>12. We may also consider mobile users, in which case some user may subscribe to both services. More specifically, when a user is in an area only covered by the macrocell service, he will use to the macrocell service (or not using the service if his θ is too small). However, when the same user moves into the area that is covered by both the macrocell and femtocell services, he may switch to the femtocell service (depending on his value of θ). We believe that the main insights in this section will still hold with mobile users, although the thresholds in Theorem 5 will change. Recall that the operator serves macrocell users with good signals (i.e., a larger θ) first, thus some users with a small θ will not be able to receive the macrocell service (even if they prefer so) if the macrocell band is not enough. Let us denote θ non th as the minimum spectrum efficiency among all non-overlapping users served by macrocell service. If a non-overlapping user with θ is served by macrocell service, another overlapping user with the same θ should also be able to request and obtain macrocell service successfully. This is because the operator cannot distinguish whether a user is in the femtocell coverage or not. Moreover, the operator wants to serve as many overlapping users as possible by the more efficient femtocell service. Thus we conclude that the partition threshold of overlapping users is θ th = max(θ non th , p M /p F ). The total finalized demand of the macrocell service is</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">Q M (p M , p F , θ non th ) = (1 -η) 1 θ non th 1 p M - 1 θ dθ + η 1 max(θ non th ,p M /p F ) 1 p M - 1 θ dθ.

In this case, more non-overlapping users are served by the macrocell service at a higher price. Among overlapping users, the service partition threshold θ th increases to p M + p F and all users' preferred demands are satisfied.

The operator will not leave any non-overlapping users who prefer to be served out of service. Intuitively, the operator wants to serve as many non-overlapping users as possible, which means that the macrocell users' total demand is large and thus the operator can charge a higher macrocell price. The increase of macrocell price will encourage more overlapping users to choose the femtocell service, which will improve the operator's profit.</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">= 1 -η(1 -p F ) - B ln θ non th -1 θ non th + 1 B -ηθ non th 1 p F -1 -ln θ non th 2 - (ln θ non th ) 2 -η 1 p F -1 (1 -θ non th -ln θ non th ) B -ηθ non th 1 p F -1 -</formula><p>Based on Theorem 5, the operator's optimization problem is</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">max p M ,p F ∈[0,1] π operator (p M , p F ) = p F η p M p F 0 1 p F -1 dθ + p M Q M (p M , p F , θ non th )| θ non th =p M , subject to, p M ≤ p F , B = Q M (p M , p F , θ non th )| θ non th =p M + η p M p F 0 1 p F -1 dθ.<label>(28)</label></formula><p>Problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_47">28</ref>) is difficult to solve in closed form, so we use numerical results to illustrate some interesting insights. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">14</ref> shows the operator's equilibrium femtocell price p * F and macrocell price p * M as functions of bandwidth supply B and femtocell coverage η. Both equilibrium prices decrease with B to ensure market clearance (supply equals demand). For each value of coverage η, we can observe two different behaviors depending on the value of B:</p><p>• Small B regime (e.g., B ≤ 0.1 under η = 0.2, B ≤ 0.6 under η = 0.5, and B ≤ 3.1 under η = 0.8): the operator will announce the same price for both services, i.e., p * F = p * M . This means that all overlapping users will be served by the femtocell service. Intuitively, small B implies limited total resource, and thus it is more important to serve all overlapping users with the more efficient femtocell service than to serve more non-overlapping users with the macrocell service.</p><p>• Large B regime (e.g., B &gt; 0.1 under η = 0.2, B &gt; 0.6 under η = 0.5, and B &gt; 3.1 under η = 0.8): In this case, we have p * M &lt; p * F . This means that the overlapping users will be served by both femtocell and macrocell services. As the total resource is abundant in this case, it becomes important to provide enough resource for the macrocell service and get enough revenue from the non-overlapping users as well. As the operator cannot differentiate users based on their coverage areas, some non-overlapping users will also get served by the macrocell service. We notice that the threshold between two regimes increases with η, i.e., from B = 0.1 when η = 0.2 to   Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">15</ref> shows the operator's bandwidth allocations to two services as functions of B and η. As femtocell coverage η increases, the operator will serve more users in femtocells and will allocate more bandwidth to femtocells. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">16</ref> shows that the operator's equilibrium profit increases in both B and η. The operator benefits from the availability to serve more users by the more efficient femtocell service.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS</head><p>This paper studies the economic incentive for a cellular operator to introduce the femtocell service on top of its existing macrocell service. We analyze the operator's equilibrium decisions in terms of spectrum allocations and pricing of dual services. Compared to the macrocell service, we show that the femtocell service can attract more users at a higher price and increase the operator's profit. However, the requirement of satisfying users' reservation payoffs (i.e., what they can achieve without the femtocell service) prevents the operator from only providing femtocell service. We also study the impacts of femtocell frequency reuse, operational cost, and limited coverage on femtocell service provision, where the operator's profit increases with frequency reuse, decreases in operational cost, and increases in femtocell coverage.</p><p>There are several directions to extend the results in this paper. We can further consider the "shared carriers" scheme, where femtocell service and macrocell service share part of or the whole spectrum. We need to optimize the pricing and spectrum allocation decisions by trading off the increased spectrum availabilities and mutual interferences. The results here also lay the foundation of further study of market competition between multiple operators, where some or all of them provide the femtocell service on top of their existing macrocell service. Moreover, we can further study a distributed femteocell system, where the femtocell is operated by an independent operator other than the macrocell operator. Some preliminary studies along this line can be found in our another paper submission <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
