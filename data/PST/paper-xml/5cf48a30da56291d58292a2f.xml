<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In this work, we consider the task of creating personalized photorealistic talking head models, i.e. systems that can synthesize plausible video-sequences of speech expressions and mimics of a particular individual. More specifically, we consider the problem of synthesizing photorealistic personalized head images given a set of face landmarks, which drive the animation of the model. Such ability has practical applications for telepresence, including videoconferencing and multi-player games, as well as special effects industry. Synthesizing realistic talking head sequences is known to be hard for two reasons. First, human heads have high photometric, geometric and kinematic complexity. This complexity stems not only from modeling faces (for which a large number of modeling approaches exist) but also from modeling mouth cavity, hair, and garments. The second complicating factor is the acuteness of the human visual system towards even minor mistakes in the appearance modeling of human heads (the so-called uncanny valley effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>). Such low tolerance to modeling mistakes explains the current prevalence of non-photorealistic cartoon-like avatars in many practically-deployed teleconferencing systems.</p><p>To overcome the challenges, several works have proposed to synthesize articulated head sequences by warping a single or multiple static frames. Both classical warping algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28]</ref> and warping fields synthesized using machine learning (including deep learning) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">40]</ref> can be used for such purposes. While warping-based systems can create talking head sequences from as little as a single image, the amount of motion, head rotation, and disocclusion that they can handle without noticeable artifacts is limited.</p><p>Direct (warping-free) synthesis of video frames using adversarially-trained deep convolutional networks (Con-vNets) presents the new hope for photorealistic talking heads. Very recently, some remarkably realistic results have been demonstrated by such systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37]</ref>. However, to succeed, such methods have to train large networks, where both generator and discriminator have tens of millions of parameters for each talking head. These systems, therefore, require a several-minutes-long video <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37]</ref> or a large dataset of photographs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref> as well as hours of GPU training in order to create a new personalized talking head model. While this effort is lower than the one required by systems that construct photo-realistic head models using sophisticated physical and optical modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, it is still excessive for most practical telepresence scenarios, where we want to enable users to create their personalized head models with as little effort as possible.</p><p>In this work, we present a system for creating talking head models from a handful of photographs (so-called fewshot learning) and with limited training time. In fact, our system can generate a reasonable result based on a single photograph (one-shot learning), while adding a few more photographs increases the fidelity of personalization. Similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37]</ref>, the talking heads created by our model are deep ConvNets that synthesize video frames in a direct manner by a sequence of convolutional operations rather than by warping. The talking heads created by our system can, therefore, handle a large variety of poses that goes beyond the abilities of warping-based systems.</p><p>The few-shot learning ability is obtained through extensive pre-training (meta-learning) on a large corpus of talking head videos corresponding to different speakers with diverse appearance. In the course of meta-learning, our system simulates few-shot learning tasks and learns to transform landmark positions into realistically-looking personalized photographs, given a small training set of images with this person. After that, a handful of photographs of a new person sets up a new adversarial learning problem with high-capacity generator and discriminator pre-trained via meta-learning. The new adversarial problem converges to the state that generates realistic and personalized images after a few training steps.</p><p>In the experiments, we provide comparisons of talking heads created by our system with alternative neural talking head models <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">40]</ref> via quantitative measurements and a user study, where our approach generates images of sufficient realism and personalization fidelity to deceive the study participants. We demonstrate several uses of our talking head models, including video synthesis using landmark tracks extracted from video sequences of the same person, as well as puppeteering (video synthesis of a certain person based on the face landmark tracks of a different person).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work</head><p>A huge body of works is devoted to statistical modeling of the appearance of human faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, with remarkably good results obtained both with classical techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref> and, more recently, with deep learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25]</ref> (to name just a few). While modeling faces is a highly related task to talking head modeling, the two tasks are not identical, as the latter also involves modeling non-face parts such as hair, neck, mouth cavity and often shoulders/upper garment. These non-face parts cannot be handled by some trivial extension of the face modeling methods since they are much less amenable for registration and often have higher variability and higher complexity than the face part. In principle, the results of face modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref> or lips modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref> can be stitched into an existing head video. Such design, however, does not allow full control over the head rotation in the resulting video and therefore does not result in a fullyfledged talking head system.</p><p>The design of our system borrows a lot from the recent progress in generative modeling of images. Thus, our architecture uses adversarial training <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and, more specifically, the ideas behind conditional discriminators <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>, including projection discriminators <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>. Our meta-learning stage uses the adaptive instance normalization mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which was shown to be useful in large-scale conditional generation tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">34]</ref>.</p><p>The model-agnostic meta-learner (MAML) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> uses meta-learning to obtain the initial state of an image classifier, from which it can quickly converge to image classifiers of unseen classes, given few training samples. This high-level idea is also utilized by our method, though our implementation of it is rather different. Several works have further proposed to combine adversarial training with meta-learning. Thus, data-augmentation GAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, Meta-GAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref>, adversarial meta-learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref> use adversariallytrained networks to generate additional examples for classes unseen at the meta-learning stage. While these methods are focused on boosting the few-shot classification performance, our method deals with the training of image generation models using similar adversarial objectives. To summarize, we bring the adversarial fine-tuning into the metalearning framework. The former is applied after we obtain initial state of the generator and the discriminator networks via the meta-learning stage.</p><p>Finally, very related to ours are the two recent works on text-to-speech generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18]</ref>. Their setting (few-shot learning of generative models) and some of the components (standalone embedder network, generator fine-tuning) are are also used in our case. Our work differs in the application domain, the use of adversarial learning, its specific adaptation to the meta-learning process and numerous implementation details. Our meta-learning architecture involves the embedder network that maps head images (with estimated face landmarks) to the embedding vectors, which contain pose-independent information. The generator network maps input face landmarks into output frames through the set of convolutional layers, which are modulated by the embedding vectors via adaptive instance normalization. During meta-learning, we pass sets of frames from the same video through the embedder, average the resulting embeddings and use them to predict adaptive parameters of the generator. Then, we pass the landmarks of a different frame through the generator, comparing the resulting image with the ground truth. Our objective function includes perceptual and adversarial losses, with the latter being implemented via a conditional projection discriminator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Architecture and notation</head><p>The meta-learning stage of our approach assumes the availability of M video sequences, containing talking heads of different people. We denote with x i the i-th video sequence and with x i (t) its t-th frame. During the learning process, as well as during test time, we assume the availability of the face landmarks' locations for all frames (we use an off-the-shelf face alignment code <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> to obtain them). The landmarks are rasterized into three-channel images using a predefined set of colors to connect certain landmarks with line segments. We denote with y i (t) the resulting landmark image computed for x i (t).</p><p>In the meta-learning stage of our approach, the following three networks are trained (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>): • The embedder E(x i (s), y i (s); φ) takes a video frame x i (s), an associated landmark image y i (s) and maps these inputs into an N -dimensional vector êi (s). Here, φ denotes network parameters that are learned in the meta-learning stage. In general, during meta-learning, we aim to learn φ such that the vector êi (s) contains video-specific information (such as the person's identity) that is invariant to the pose and mimics in a particular frame s. We denote embedding vectors computed by the embedder as êi .</p><p>• The generator G(y i (t), êi ; ψ, P) takes the landmark image y i (t) for the video frame not seen by the embedder, the predicted video embedding êi and outputs a synthesized video frame xi (t). The generator is trained to maximize the similarity between its outputs and the ground truth frames. All parameters of the generator are split into two sets: the person-generic parameters ψ, and the person-specific parameters ψi . During meta-learning, only ψ are trained directly, while ψi are predicted from the embedding vector êi using a trainable projection matrix P: ψi = Pê i . • The discriminator D(x i (t), y i (t), i; θ, W, w 0 , b) takes a video frame x i (t), an associated landmark image y i (t) and the index of the training sequence i. Here, θ, W, w 0 and b denote the learnable parameters associated with the discriminator. The discriminator contains a ConvNet part V (x i (t), y i (t); θ) that maps the input frame and the landmark image into an N -dimensional vector. The discriminator predicts a single scalar (realism score) r, that indicates whether the input frame x i (t) is a real frame of the i-th video sequence and whether it matches the input pose y i (t), based on the output of its ConvNet part and the parameters W, w 0 , b.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Meta-learning stage</head><p>During the meta-learning stage of our approach, the parameters of all three networks are trained in an adversarial fashion. It is done by simulating episodes of K-shot learning (K = 8 in our experiments). In each episode, we randomly draw a training video sequence i and a single frame t from that sequence. In addition to t, we randomly draw additional K frames s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s K from the same sequence. We then compute the estimate êi of the i-th video embedding by simply averaging the embeddings êi (s k ) predicted for these additional frames:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">êi = 1 K K k=1 E (x i (s k ), y i (s k ); φ) .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>A reconstruction xi (t) of the t-th frame, based on the estimated embedding êi , is then computed:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">xi (t) = G (y i (t), êi ; ψ, P) . (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>The parameters of the embedder and the generator are then optimized to minimize the following objective that comprises the content term, the adversarial term, and the embedding match term:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L(φ, ψ,P, θ, W, w 0 , b) = L CNT (φ, ψ, P)+ (3) L ADV (φ, ψ, P, θ, W, w 0 , b) + L MCH (φ, W) .</formula><p>In (3), the content loss term L CNT measures the distance between the ground truth image x i (t) and the reconstruction xi (t) using the perceptual similarity measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>, corresponding to VGG19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref> network trained for ILSVRC classification and VGGFace <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> network trained for face verification. The loss is calculated as the weighted sum of L 1 losses between the features of these networks.</p><p>The adversarial term in (3) corresponds to the realism score computed by the discriminator, which needs to be maximized, and a feature matching term <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref>, which essentially is a perceptual similarity measure, computed using discriminator (it helps with the stability of the training):</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">L ADV (φ, ψ, P, θ, W, w 0 , b) = (4) −D(x i (t), y i (t), i; θ, W, w 0 , b) + L FM .</formula><p>Following the projection discriminator idea <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>, the columns of the matrix W contain the embeddings that correspond to individual videos. The discriminator first maps its inputs to an N -dimensional vector V (x i (t), y i (t); θ) and then computes the realism score as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">D(x i (t), y i (t), i; θ, W, w 0 , b) = (5) V (x i (t), y i (t); θ) T (W i + w 0 ) + b ,</formula><p>where W i denotes the i-th column of the matrix W. At the same time, w 0 and b do not depend on the video index, so these terms correspond to the general realism of xi (t) and its compatibility with the landmark image y i (t).</p><p>Thus, there are two kinds of video embeddings in our system: the ones computed by the embedder, and the ones that correspond to the columns of the matrix W in the discriminator. The match term L MCH (φ, W) in (3) encourages the similarity of the two types of embeddings by penalizing the L 1 -difference between E (x i (s k ), y i (s k ); φ) and W i .</p><p>As we update the parameters φ of the embedder and the parameters ψ of the generator, we also update the parameters θ, W, w 0 , b of the discriminator. The update is driven by the minimization of the following hinge loss, which encourages the increase of the realism score on real images x i (t) and its decrease on synthesized images xi (t):</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L DSC (φ, ψ, P, θ, W, w 0 , b) = (6) max(0, 1 + D(x i (t), y i (t), i; φ, ψ, θ, W, w 0 , b))+ max(0, 1 − D(x i (t), y i (t), i; θ, W, w 0 , b)) .</formula><p>The objective (6) thus compares the realism of the fake example xi (t) and the real example x i (t) and then updates the discriminator parameters to push these scores below −1 and above +1 respectively. The training proceeds by alternating updates of the embedder and the generator that minimize the losses L CNT , L ADV and L MCH with the updates of the discriminator that minimize the loss L DSC .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Few-shot learning by fine-tuning</head><p>Once the meta-learning has converged, our system can learn to synthesize talking head sequences for a new person, unseen during meta-learning stage. As before, the synthesis is conditioned on the landmark images. The system is learned in a few-shot way, assuming that T training images x(1), x(2), . . . , x(T ) (e.g. T frames of the same video) are given and that y(1), y(2), . . . , y(T ) are the corresponding landmark images. Note that the number of frames T needs not to be equal to K used in the meta-learning stage.</p><p>Naturally, we can use the meta-learned embedder to estimate the embedding for the new talking head sequence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">êNEW = 1 T T t=1 E(x(t), y(t); φ) ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>reusing the parameters φ estimated in the meta-learning stage. A straightforward way to generate new frames, corresponding to new landmark images, is then to apply the generator using the estimated embedding êNEW and the metalearned parameters ψ, as well as projection matrix P. By doing so, we have found out that the generated images are plausible and realistic, however, there often is a considerable identity gap that is not acceptable for most applications aiming for high personalization degree. This identity gap can often be bridged via the fine-tuning stage. The fine-tuning process can be seen as a simplified version of meta-learning with a single video sequence and a smaller number of frames. The fine-tuning process involves the following components:</p><p>• The generator G(y(t), êNEW ; ψ, P) is now replaced with G ′ (y(t); ψ, ψ ′ ). As before, it takes the landmark image y(t) and outputs the synthesized frame x(t). Importantly, the person-specific generator parameters, which we now denote with ψ ′ , are now directly optimized alongside the person-generic parameters ψ. We still use the computed embeddings êNEW and the projection matrix P estimated at the meta-learning stage to initialize ψ ′ , i.e. we start with ψ ′ = Pê NEW . • The discriminator D ′ (x(t), y(t); θ, w ′ , b), as before, computes the realism score. Parameters θ of its ConvNet part V (x(t), y(t); θ) and bias b are initialized to the result of the meta-learning stage. The initialization of w ′ is discussed below. During fine-tuning, the realism score of the discriminator is obtained in a similar way to the meta-learning stage:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">D ′ (x(t), y(t); θ, w ′ , b) = (8) V (x(t), y(t); θ) T w ′ + b .</formula><p>As can be seen from the comparison of expressions ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>), the role of the vector w ′ in the fine-tuning stage is the same as the role of the vector W i + w 0 in the meta-learning stage. For the intiailization, we do not have access to the analog of W i for the new personality (since this person is not in the meta-learning dataset). However, the match term L MCH in the meta-learning process ensures the similarity between the discriminator video-embeddings and the vectors computed by the embedder. Hence, we can initialize w ′ to the sum of w 0 and êNEW .</p><p>Once the new learning problem is set up, the loss functions of the fine-tuning stage follow directly from the metalearning variants. Thus, the generator parameters ψ and ψ ′ are optimized to minimize the simplified objective:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">L ′ (ψ, ψ ′ , θ, w ′ , b) = (9) L ′ CNT (ψ, ψ ′ ) + L ′ ADV (ψ, ψ ′ , θ, w ′ , b) ,</formula><p>where t ∈ {1 . . . T } is the number of the training example. The discriminator parameters θ, w NEW , b are optimized by minimizing the same hinge loss as in ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">L ′ DSC (ψ, ψ ′ , θ, w ′ , b) = (10) max(0, 1 + D(x(t), y(t); ψ, ψ ′ , θ, w ′ , b))+ max(0, 1 − D(x(t), y(t); θ, w ′ , b)) .</formula><p>In most situations, the fine-tuned generator provides a much better fit of the training sequence. The initialization of all parameters via the meta-learning stage is also crucial. As we show in the experiments, such initialization injects a strong realistic talking head prior, which allows our model to extrapolate and predict realistic images for poses with varying head poses and facial expressions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Implementation details</head><p>We base our generator network G(y i (t), êi ; ψ, P) on the image-to-image translation architecture proposed by Johnson et. al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>, but replace downsampling and upsampling layers with residual blocks similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> (with batch normalization [15] replaced by instance normalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>). The person-specific parameters ψi serve as the affine coefficients of instance normalization layers, following the adaptive instance normalization technique proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, though we still use regular (non-adaptive) instance normalization layers in the downsampling blocks that encode landmark images y i (t).</p><p>For the embedder E(x i (s), y i (s); φ) and the convolutional part of the discriminator V (x i (t), y i (t); θ), we use similar networks, which consist of residual downsampling blocks (same as the ones used in the generator, but without normalization layers). The discriminator network, compared to the embedder, has an additional residual block at the end, which operates at 4×4 spatial resolution. To obtain the vectorized outputs in both networks, we perform global sum pooling over spatial dimensions followed by ReLU.</p><p>We use spectral normalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref> for all convolutional and fully connected layers in all the networks. We also use self-attention blocks, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>. They are inserted at 32×32 spatial resolution in all downsampling parts of the networks and at 64 × 64 resolution in the upsampling part of the generator.</p><p>For the calculation of L CNT , we evaluate L 1 loss between activations of Conv1,6,11,20,29 VGG19 layers and Conv1,6,11,18,25 VGGFace layers for real and fake images. We sum these losses with the weights equal to 1.5•10 −1 for VGG19 and 2.5•10 −2 for VGGFace terms. We use Caffe <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> trained versions for both of these networks. For L FM , we use activations after each residual block of the discriminator network and the weights equal to 10. Finally, for L MCH we also set the weight to 10.</p><p>We set the minimum number of channels in convolutional layers to 64 and the maximum number of channels as well as the size N of the embedding vectors to 512. In total, the embedder has 15 million parameters, the generator has 38 million parameters. The convolutional part of the discriminator has 20 million parameters. The networks are optimized using Adam <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>. We set the learning rate of the embedder and the generator networks to 5 × 10 −5 and to 2 × 10 −4 for the discriminator, doing two update steps for the latter per one of the former, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiments</head><p>Two datasets with talking head videos are used for quantitative and qualitative evaluation: VoxCeleb1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref> (256p videos at 1 fps) and VoxCeleb2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>  than the former. VoxCeleb1 is used for comparison with baselines and ablation studies, while by using VoxCeleb2 we show the full potential of our approach.</p><p>Metrics. For the quantitative comparisons, we fine-tune all models on few-shot learning sets of size T for a person not seen during meta-learning (or pretraining) stage.</p><p>After the few-shot learning, the evaluation is performed on the hold-out part of the same sequence (so-called selfreenactment scenario). For the evaluation, we uniformly sampled 50 videos from VoxCeleb test sets and 32 holdout frames for each of these videos (the fine-tuning and the hold-out parts do not overlap). We use multiple comparison metrics to evaluate photorealism and identity preservation of generated images. Namely, we use Frechet-inception distance (FID) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, mostly measuring perceptual realism, structured similarity (SSIM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>, measuring low-level similarity to the ground truth images, and cosine similarity (CSIM) between embedding vectors of the state-of-the-art face recognition network <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for measuring identity mismatch (note that this network has quite different architecture from VGGFace used within content loss calculation during training).</p><p>We also perform a user study in order to evaluate perceptual similarity and realism of the results as seen by the human respondents. We show people the triplets of images of the same person taken from three different video sequences. Two of these images are real and one is fake, produced by one of the methods, which are being compared. We ask the user to find the fake image given that all of these images are of the same person. This evaluates both photo-realism and identity preservation because the user can infer the identity from the two real images (and spot an identity mismatch even if the generated image is perfectly realistic). We use the user accuracy (success rate) as our metric. The lower bound here is the accuracy of one third (when users cannot spot fakes based on non-realism or identity mismatch and have to guess randomly). Generally, we believe that this user-driven metric (USER) provides a much better idea of the quality of the methods compared to FID, SSIM, or CSIM.</p><p>Methods. On the VoxCeleb1 dataset we compare our model against two other systems: X2Face <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref> and Pix2pixHD <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref>. For X2Face, we have used the model, as well as pretrained weights, provided by the authors (in the original paper it was also trained and evaluated on the Vox-Celeb1 dataset). For Pix2pixHD, we pretrained the model from scratch on the whole dataset for the same amount of iterations as our system without any changes to thetraining pipeline proposed by the authors. We picked X2Face as a strong baseline for warping-based methods and Pix2pixHD for direct synthesis methods.</p><p>In our comparison, we evaluate the models in several scenarios by varying the number of frames T used in fewshot learning. X2Face, as a feed-forward method, is simply initialized via the training frames, while Pix2pixHD and our model are being additionally fine-tuned for 40 epochs on the few-shot set. Notably, in the comparison, X2Face uses dense correspondence field, computed on the ground truth image, to synthesize the generated one, while our method and Pix2pixHD use very sparse landmark information, which arguably gives X2Face an unfair advantage.</p><p>Comparison results. We perform comparison with baselines in three different setups, with 1, 8 and 32 frames in the fine-tuning set. Test set, as mentioned before, consists of 32 hold-out frames for each of the 50 test video sequences. Moreover, for each test frame we sample two frames at random from the other video sequences with the same person. These frames are used in triplets alongside with fake frames for user-study.</p><p>As we can see in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>-Top, baselines consistently outperform our method on the two of our similarity metrics. We argue that this is intrinsic to the methods themselves: X2Face uses L 2 loss during optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>, which leads to a good SSIM score. On the other hand, Pix2pixHD maximizes only perceptual metric, without identity preservation loss, leading to minimization of FID, but has bigger identity mismatch, as seen from the CSIM column. Moreover, these metrics do not correlate well with human perception, since both of these methods produce uncanny valley artifacts, as can be seen from qualitative comparison Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> and the user study results. Cosine similarity, on the other hand, better correlates with visual quality, but still favours blurry, less realistic images, and that can also be seen by comparing Table 1-Top with the results presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. While the comparison in terms of the objective metrics is inconclusive, the user study (that included 4800 triplets, each shown to 5 users) clearly reveals the much higher realism and personalization degree achieved by our method.</p><p>We have also carried out the ablation study of our system and the comparison of the few-shot learning timings. Both are provided in the Supplementary material.</p><p>Large-scale results. We then scale up the available data and train our method on a larger VoxCeleb2 dataset. Here, we train two variants of our method. FF (feed-forward) variant is trained for 150 epochs without the embedding matching loss L MCH and, therefore, we only use it without fine-tuning (by simply predicting adaptive parameters ψ ′ via the projection of the embedding êNEW ). The FT variant is trained for half as much (75 epochs) but with L MCH , which allows fine-tuning. We run the evaluation for both of these models since they allow to trade off few-shot learning speed versus the results quality. Both of them achieve con-siderably higher scores, compared to smaller-scale models trained on VoxCeleb1. Notably, the FT model reaches the lower bound of 0.33 for the user study accuracy in T = 32 setting, which is a perfect score. We present results for both of these models in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> and more results (including results, where animation is driven by landmarks from a different video of the same person) are given in the supplementary material and in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>Generally, judging by the results of comparisons (Table 1-Bottom) and the visual assessment, the FF model performs better for low-shot learning (e.g. one-shot), while the FT model achieves higher quality for bigger T via adversarial fine-tuning.</p><p>Puppeteering results. Finally, we show the results for the puppeteering of photographs and paintings. For that, we evaluate the model, trained in one-shot setting, on poses from test videos of the VoxCeleb2 dataset. We rank these videos using CSIM metric, calculated between the original image and the generated one. This allows us to find persons with similar geometry of the landmarks and use them for the puppeteering. The results can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> as well as in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented a framework for meta-learning of adversarial generative models, which is able to train highlyrealistic virtual talking heads in the form of deep generator networks. Crucially, only a handful of photographs (as little as one) is needed to create a new model, whereas the model trained on 32 images achieves perfect realism and personalization score in our user study (for 224p static images).</p><p>Currently, the key limitations of our method are the mimics representation (in particular, the current set of landmarks does not represent the gaze in any way) and the lack of landmark adaptation. Using landmarks from a different person leads to a noticeable personality mismatch. So, if one wants to create "fake" puppeteering videos without such mismatch, some landmark adaptation is needed. We note, however, that many applications do not require puppeteering a different person and instead only need the ability to drive one's own talking head. For such scenario, our approach already provides a high-realism solution.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure2: Our meta-learning architecture involves the embedder network that maps head images (with estimated face landmarks) to the embedding vectors, which contain pose-independent information. The generator network maps input face landmarks into output frames through the set of convolutional layers, which are modulated by the embedding vectors via adaptive instance normalization. During meta-learning, we pass sets of frames from the same video through the embedder, average the resulting embeddings and use them to predict adaptive parameters of the generator. Then, we pass the landmarks of a different frame through the generator, comparing the resulting image with the ground truth. Our objective function includes perceptual and adversarial losses, with the latter being implemented via a conditional projection discriminator.</figDesc><graphic url="image-17.png" coords="3,58.29,211.69,61.04,61.04" type="bitmap" /></figure>
