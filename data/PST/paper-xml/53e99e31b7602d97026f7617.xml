<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>C ODE-DIVISION multiple-access (CDMA) implemented with direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DS/SS) is among the most promising multiplexing technologies for wireless telecommunications services. The explosive growth in wireless telephony, in conjunction with emerging new applications, has inspired a significant recent interest in advanced signal processing techniques for enhancing the performance of nonorthogonal signaling schemes for such multiple-access communications systems. These techniques generally fall under the category of multiuser detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, which refers to optimum or near-optimum demodulation of data in such situations. It has been demonstrated that multiuser detection provides very substantial performance gains over detection techniques conventionally used in multiple-access channels. Considerable recent research in this area has focused on the development of adaptive techniques for multiuser detection Manuscript received <ref type="bibr">April 14, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">revised March 27, 1998</ref>. This work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grant NCR-9613108 and by the U.S. Office of Naval Research under Grant N00014-94-1-0115. The associate editor coordinating the review of this paper and approving it for publication was Dr. Jean-Jacques Fuchs.</p><p>The authors are with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544-5263 USA (e-mail: wangx@princeton.edu; poor@princeton.edu).</p><p>Publisher Item Identifier S 1053-587X(98)07812-X. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Adaptivity not only allows multiuser detection to be applied without additional protocol overhead with respect to that required by conventional methods, but it also allows multiuser detectors to operate in the dynamic environment found in mobile communications applications. More recently, blind techniques for adapting linear multiuser detectors have been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. These blind techniques essentially allow one to use a linear multiuser detector for a given user with no knowledge beyond that required for implementation of the conventional matched filter for that user. The blind technique in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for adapting the linear MMSE detector is based on a constrained minimization of the output energy (MOE) of a linear filter, using either the least mean-square (LMS) algorithm or the recursive leastsquares (RLS) algorithm. It has been shown that under either adaptation algorithm, this blind technique suffers from a saturation effect in the steady state, which causes a significant gap between its steady-state performance and the performance of the true linear MMSE detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Moreover, if the background ambient noise level is low, the signal covariance matrix is almost rank deficient, and the RLS method may fail to provide satisfactory results.</p><p>In CDMA systems, the effective rank of the noise-free signal covariance matrix is usually less or much less than the signal dimension or the filter length . Therefore, the useful information in the signal can be projected without loss onto a signal subspace of rank . Motivated by this observation, a blind adaptive multiuser detection technique based on subspace tracking is developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. This technique remedies the problems that stem from the RLS version of MOE method. In addition, by using low-complexity adaptive subspace tracking algorithms, considerable complexity reduction can be achieved when the rank of the signal subspace is much smaller than the signal dimension .</p><p>In many CDMA communications applications, such as cellular mobile radio systems, indoor wireless communications, and underwater local area networks, the channels exhibit severe multipath fading, which limits the system performance. In this paper, we extend the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and develop a blind multiuser detection theory for multipath channels based on rank revealing processing and subspace tracking. The receiver structure considered here bears the same spirit of the RAKE receiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, that is, first, the signal of interest along each path is collected, and the interference (multiple-access interference and multipath interference) on that path is mitigated; then, the signals collected from all paths are optimally combined to yield the decision statistic on the received data symbol. Two key issues are addressed, namely, blind adaptive interference suppression and blind adaptive channel estimation.</p><p>The receiver considered in this paper employs a bank of linear filters (decorrelating filters or linear MMSE filters) at the front end for interference suppression. It is shown that through the use of signal subspace estimation, both the decorrelating (i.e., zero-forcing) filterbank and the linear MMSE filterbank can be obtained blindly, i.e., they can be estimated from the received data with the prior knowledge of only the signature waveform of the user of interest. Two forms of subspacebased linear filterbanks are developed, and their equivalence in terms of interference suppression capability is established. These subspace-based blind adaptive interference suppression techniques require, at each symbol epoch, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a signal subspace. This can be achieved using computationally efficient sequential adaptive eigendecomposition (subspace tracking) algorithms. The focus of this paper, however, is on the development and performance analysis of the subspace-based interference suppression methods in multipath channels, assuming the signal subspace components are available. Nevertheless, in the numerical simulation section, some examples are provided to demonstrate the performance of subspace-based blind adaptive multiuser detection methods, using a particular subspace tracking algorithm found in the recent literature.</p><p>We also develop a blind adaptive technique for estimating the channel state for diversity combining. It is shown that the channel state vector is related to the principal eigenvector of the covariance matrix of a linearly transformed filterbank output. A recursive-least-squares (RLS) type of algorithm is then derived for blind channel state estimation. This algorithm also produces the post-combining decision statistic as a byproduct.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce the signal model and the diversity receiver structure considered in this paper. In Section III, we discuss the concept of signal subspace and the techniques for adaptive signal subspace tracking. In Section IV, we derive two forms of subspace-based linear filterbanks for interference suppression in multipath channels and show their performance equivalence. In Section V, we develop a blind adaptive method for channel state estimation. In Section VI, we provide some simulation examples to demonstrate the performance of the blind adaptive algorithms proposed in this paper. Section VII contains the conclusions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Signal Model</head><p>Consider a synchronous -user binary communication system employing normalized modulation waveforms and signaling through a frequency-selective fading channel. The received baseband signal in such a channel can be modeled as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where is a zero-mean complex white circular Gaussian noise process with unit power spectral density;</p><p>is the power of the ambient channel noise;</p><p>is the number of data symbols per user per frame; is the symbol interval; and , denote, respectively, the received amplitude, carrier phase, symbol stream, and normalized signaling waveform of the th user;</p><p>is the bandwidth of the spread-spectrum signals; is the number of resolvable paths; and is the complex channel fading gain of the th path for the th user's signal. It is assumed that , which is the th user's normalized signaling waveform, is supported only on the interval and that is a collection of independent equiprobable binary random variables. As seen from model ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>), the channel is assumed to be subject to slow fading, e.g., the multipath fading gains remain constant over an entire signal frame.</p><p>For the direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DS/SS) multipleaccess format, the user signaling waveforms are of the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> where is the processing gain; is a signature sequence of 's assigned to the th user; and is a normalized chip waveform of duration , where . It is seen from ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) that the frequency-selective channel for the th user is modeled as a tapped delay line with tap spacing and tap coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. ( is usually taken as or . In this paper, we take .) The number of resolvable paths is given by , where is the channel multipath spread. For the symbol interval much longer than the multipath delay spread, i.e., , any intersymbol interference (ISI) due to channel dispersion can be neglected <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. At the receiver, chip-matched filtering followed by chip-rate sampling yields an vector of chipmatched filter output samples during the th symbol interval <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> where is the vector of the discretized version of the signal , is a complex Gaussian noise vector with mean and covariance matrix ( denotes the identity matrix.), and . In this paper, we consider only the synchronous system. One simple suboptimal way to treat the more general asynchronous system is the "one-shot" approach, in which a particular transmitted data bit is estimated based on only the received signal within the symbol interval corresponding to that data bit. An asynchronous system of users can then be viewed as equivalent to a synchronous system with users <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and the results in this paper thus apply in this context as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Diversity Receiver Structure</head><p>We consider the problem of demodulating a particular user's transmitted data from the received signal (3). The receiver structure under consideration bears the same spirit of the RAKE receiver, namely, it collects the useful signal energy and suppresses the interference on each path and then optimally combines the collected signals to make a final decision on the received data symbol. To that end, define the following notations: matrix matrix -vector diag block diagonal matrix diag diagonal matrix and vector</p><p>Then, (3) can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(4)</formula><p>Throughout this paper, let user 1 be the user of interest. Let be the vector with all entries zeros except for the th entry, which is one. We assume that and has full column rank . Define the matrix</p><p>where denotes the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse [10] of matrix . Then, from (4), we have <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> where we used the fact that , and is a complex-valued Gaussian random vector with mean and covariance matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> where , and denotes the submatrix of consisting of its rows 1 to and columns 1 to . Assuming that the channel state is known, then the maximum likelihood decision rule for detecting from in ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> sgn Re <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> Conditioned on the channel state , it then follows that the error probability of the decision rule ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) is given by ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>)</p><p>where . It is seen from above that the diversity receiver consists of a multipath decorrelating filterbank , a channel estimator, and a combiner. Such a receiver structure has been considered previously in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, where the implementation of the decorrelating filterbank requires knowledge of all users' signature waveforms . The problem of channel estimation in this context is considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, where the channel estimator is a Kalman filter aided by periodically inserted pilot symbols. In the rest of this paper, we develop blind adaptive techniques for implementing the above diversity receiver structure, with the prior knowledge of only the signature waveform of the user of interest . Two issues in this context will be addressed, namely, blind adaptive interference suppression and blind adaptive channel state estimation.</p><p>Recently, MUSIC-type methods have been proposed for channel estimation in multipath CDMA systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. These methods essentially estimate the effective signature waveforms in the multipath channels. The estimated effective signature waveforms are then used in multiuser detection. A limitation of such approaches is that the estimated effective waveforms may not be unique, and thus, there could be a discrepancy between the estimated waveforms and the true effective waveforms. Moreover, these are batch estimation methods and are computationally expensive, which makes it difficult to apply these techniques to real-time wireless communications applications.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Signal Subspace Tracking</head><p>The linear multipath filterbanks for interference suppression that will be derived in the following sections are expressed in terms of the subspace components and . These subspace components can be estimated from the received signal . The classic approach to subspace estimation is through batch eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of the sample covariance matrix or batch singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix, which are computationally too expensive for adaptive applications. Considerable research in signal processing has been focused on the development of computationally efficient adaptive subspace tracking algorithms, i.e., sequential algorithms that compute at each time step an exact or approximate EVD or SVD of the signal covariance matrix. An early survey of the existing techniques in this area is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. More recent results are found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The computational complexities of these subspace tracking algorithms vary among or operations every update, where is the input vector dimension, and is the number of desired eigencomponents. Note that the recently developed fast subspace tracking algorithms with complexity , e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, when applied to the blind adaptive multiuser detection application, can achieve a considerable complexity reduction compared with the RLS version of the MOE method for blind multiuser detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, if the rank of the signal subspace is much less than the signal dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. It is beyond the scope of this paper to compare the performance of these subspace tracking algorithms. Rather, the focus of this paper is on the development and performance analysis of the subspace-based blind multiuser detection in multipath channels, assuming the signal subspace components are known. For the simulation examples provided in Section V, the subspace tracking algorithm (PASTd) found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> is employed for signal subspace tracking.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Subspace-Based Linear MMSE Filterbank</head><p>The decorrelating filterbank is a bank of zero-forcing filters that eliminate the multiple-access interference and multipath interference along each path. In this section, we consider an alternative type of filters-namely, the linear MMSE filter bank, which minimizes the mean-square-error between actual and desired signals along each path. Although the MMSE filters do not completely eliminate the interference, their performance is more robust than that of the decorrelating filters in the presence ambient noise. where is the covariance matrix of the received signal defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> </p><p>In the presence of ambient noise, the signal covariance matrix has full rank. In this case, we can give an explicit expression for the linear MMSE filterbank as follows. Proposition 4: The type-I linear MMSE filter-bank is given by (37)</p><p>Proof: First of all, notice that the constraint in the definition that range range must be satisfied by the optimal solution. This is because if has a component outside this space, it has no impact on the signal power at the output, but it increases the noise power at the output and, thus, increases the value of the penalty function. Therefore, we have where is an matrix of Lagrange multipliers. By setting the derivative of with respect to equal to , we get Substituting this into the constraint that , we obtain . Although each linear MMSE filter does not completely eliminate the multiple-access interference (MAI), using the result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, in many cases of interest, the residual MAI at the output of the filter is negligible compared with the ambient noise, and the MAI-plus-noise is approximately Gaussian distributed. We therefore adopt a combining strategy similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> at the output of the linear MMSE filter-bank, i.e., sgn Re (40)</p><p>where . Remark 1: Proposition 4 leads to a recursive least-squares (RLS) blind adaptive implementation of the type-I linear MMSE filter bank in which the signal covariance matrix is replaced by an exponentially weighted sample covariance matrix. However, as discussed in Section I, the RLS method may fail to provide satisfactory results when the sample covariance matrix is ill-conditioned, which may happen frequently in realtime applications. Moreover, there is a steady-state saturation effect in the blind RLS method which limits its interference suppression performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Remark 2: It is seen from Propositions 2 and 3 that both the decorrelating filterbank and the linear MMSE filterbank can be expressed in terms of the signal subspace components and and the signature of the user of interest. Since the signal subspace components can be estimated adaptively from the received signal using various subspace tracking algorithms, we say these filterbanks for interference suppression can be implemented blindly, i.e., with the prior knowledge of only the signature of the user of interest.</p><p>Notice from Propositions 2 and 3 that the computation of the decorrelating filterbank and the linear MMSE filterbank based on the signal subspace components is somewhat involved. In the next section, we develop an alternative yet equivalent implementation of the subspace-based linear filterbanks for interference suppression in multipath channels. In this approach, parallel subspace trackers are employed, each tracking the signal subspace of a remodulated received signal. The th linear filter can then be written directly in terms of the signal subspace components obtained by the th tracker, with little extra computation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. An Alternative Approach to Subspace-Based Linear Filterbanks</head><p>In this section, we derive a different yet equivalent subspace-based decorrelating filterbank. In this approach, there are signal subspace trackers operating in parallel. At the th tracker, , on receiving the signal , a new signal is generated as</p><p>where are independent equiprobable binary random variables, and they are independent of the transmitted data bits and the noise . The th tracker tracks the signal subspace of the signal . Define the following notations:</p><p>-vector diag diagonal matrix Remark 4: The implementation of the decorrelating filterbank (or the linear MMSE filter-bank ) is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref>.</p><p>parallel signal subspace trackers are employed. Each tracks the signal subspace of a remodulated signal and updates the coefficients of one linear filter for interference suppression. Notice that this receiver structure resembles the RAKE receiver; the subspace tracker together with the linear filter on the branch can be viewed as the th finger of the RAKE receiver. We still need to estimate the channel state in order to implement the maximum ratio combining rule (49), which is discussed in the next section.</p></div>

BLIND ADAPTIVE JOINT CHANNEL ESTIMATION AND SYMBOL DETECTION</head><p>In this section, we develop a blind adaptive technique for estimating the channel state .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES</head><p>In this section, we present some simulation examples to illustrate the performance of the proposed blind adaptive method for joint interference suppression and channel estimation in multipath CDMA channels.</p><p>Example 1-Probability of Error in Multipath Rayleigh Fading Channels: The primary performance measure for any receiver is its probability of detection error. In this example, the error probabilities of three receivers are compared, namely, the conventional RAKE receiver, the diversity receiver with a decorrelating filterbank at the front end, and the diversity receiver with a linear MMSE filterbank at the front end. The simulated system is a synchronous CDMA systems with six active users . The processing gain is . The signature sequence of the desired user is a sequence, whereas the signature sequence of other users are randomly chosen. The number of resolvable paths is . The channel is assumed to be subject to Rayleigh fading, i.e., the channel fading gains are complex Gaussian random variables. It is assumed further that the receivers have perfect knowledge of all users' signatures and the channel states of all paths, such that both the decorrelating filterbank and the linear MMSE filterbank can be explicitly constructed. The conventional RAKE receiver employs a matched filterbank at the front end to yield (64)</p><p>The data bit is then demodulated according to (65)</p><p>The error probabilities of the three receivers averaged over 1000 runs are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. (In each run the channel Rayleigh fading gains are generated independently.) Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2(a</ref>) corresponds to the case of perfect power control, where all users signal's have the same power. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2(b</ref>) corresponds to the near-far situation, where the power of each interferer is 10 dB above the power of the user of interest. It is seen that the conventional RAKE receiver has an irreducible error floor caused by the multiple-access interference, whereas by employing the linear filters for interference suppression, such an error floor can be eliminated, and the receiver is made near-far resistant.</p><p>Example 2-Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) of the Blind Adaptive Receiver: This example illustrates the interference suppression capability of the subspace-based blind adaptive linear filterbank. A synchronous system with processing gain is simulated. In this system, there are four 10-dB multiple-access interferers (MAI's) and one 20-dB MAI in addition to the desired user. The number of resolvable paths is . The complex multipath gains for each user are randomly generated according to Rayleigh distribution and kept fixed during the simulation. The subspace-based type-II linear MMSE filterbank is used for interference suppression. The performance measure plotted here is the postcombining signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), which is defined as SIR Var , where the expectation is taken with respect to the data bits of MAI's and the noise;</p><p>is the post-combing statistic given by Re . In the simulation, the expectation operation is replaced by the time averaging operation. The time averaged output SIR's versus number of iterations is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>. For the solid curve in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>, an exact SVD is used for updating the signal subspace components at every time step; for the dashed curve, a fast subspace tracking algorithm (with complexity ) found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> is used at each time step. Because this subspace tracking algorithm produces the approximate SVD at every time step, its performance is seen to be inferior to the case when an exact SVD is used. However, subspace tracking is still an active research field, and it is anticipated that with the emergence of more acurate fast subspace trackers, the performance of the subspace-based adaptive multiuser detectors will be improved.</p><p>As a comparison, the performance of the recursive leastsquared (RLS) version of the minimum-output-energy (MOE) Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.

It is seen that the proposed adaptive receiver offers significant performance enhancement over the conventional RAKE receiver. Moreover, there is a performance loss incurred by the blind adaptive receiver, compared with the nonadaptive receivers (i.e., the post-combining signals under the two hypotheses are less separated for the blind receiver), due to the fact that the blind receiver assumes no knowledge on the spreading signatures of other users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have developed a blind adaptive technique for demodulating a user's signal in multipath CDMA channels. This technique is based on signal subspace estimation. The receiver that we have considered bears the same structure as the RAKE receiver, that is, first, the useful signal along each path is collected, and the interference on that path is mitigated; then, the signals collected from all paths are optimally combined to yield the decision on the received data symbol. We have addressed two issues, namely, blind adaptive interference suppression and blind adaptive channel estimation. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Blind</head><label></label><figDesc>Adaptive Multiuser Detection in Multipath CDMA Channels Based on Subspace Tracking Xiaodong Wang, Student Member, IEEE, and H. Vincent Poor, Fellow, IEEE Abstract-A blind adaptive technique for signal demodulation in multipath code-division multiple-access (CDMA) communication channels is proposed. This technique is based on signal subspace estimation. The receiver employs a bank of linear filters (decorrelating filters or linear MMSE filters) at the front end to mitigate the multiple-access interference and the multipath interference. A channel estimator is used to estimate the channel state for diversity combining. It is shown that through the use of signal subspace estimation, both the decorrelating filterbank and the linear MMSE filterbank can be obtained blindly, i.e., they can be estimated from the received signal with the prior knowledge of only the signature waveform of the desired user. Two forms of the subspace-based linear filterbanks are developed, and their equivalence in terms of the interference suppression capability is established. These subspace-based blind adaptive interference suppression techniques require, at each symbol epoch, the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of an appropriate signal subspace, which can be obtained using computationally efficient sequential adaptive eigendecomposition (subspace tracking) algorithms. Moreover, a blind adaptive method for estimating the channel state is developed, which also produces the postcombining decision statistic as a byproduct.
