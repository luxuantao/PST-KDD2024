<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Let P be a finite partially ordered set. An antichain in P is a subset which contains no chains of length two. In 1950, Dilworth <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> proved that the maximum size of an antichain in P is equal to the smallest integer d such that P can be partitioned into d chains. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[7]</ref>, Greene and Kleitman extended Dilworth's theorem to more general subsets of P called kfamilies. By definition, a subset A C P is a k-family if A contains no chains of length k + 1. The central result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[7]</ref> can be described as follows.</p><p>Let 4(P) denote the maximum size of a k-family in P, and let V = {Cl &gt; G ,..., C,} be a partition of P into chains Cj . Define &amp;J2?) = i min(k, [ Ci I}. i=l Since each chain Ci meets every k-family at most k times, it follows that d]:(P) &lt; plc(%?). That is, every partition induces a bound on the maximum size of a k-family. Then the following is true. THEOREM 1.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[7]</ref>. For any partially ordered set P, and any positive integer k 4(P) = min P&amp;?), where the minimum is taken over all partitions %T of P into chains.</p><p>This reduces to Dilworth's theorem when k = 1. A partition %? which minimizes Pk(%?) is called a k-saturated partition of P (into chains). In fact, a somewhat stronger result was obtained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[7]</ref>: THEOREM 1.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[7]</ref>. For any k &gt; 1, there exists a partition which is simultaneously k-saturated and (k + 1)-saturated.</p><p>In this paper, we consider the analogs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 when the concepts of "chain" and "antichain" are reversed. That is, we consider partitions of P into antichains (instead of chains), which induce bounds on the size of subfamilies containing no antichains of size k + 1. We prove that the analogs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 remain valid (Theorems 1.3 and 1.4) and in the process derive a surprising relationship between the numbers d,(P) and their "complementary" counterparts (Theorem 1.6).</p><p>First some notation and terminology: If B is a subset of P which contains no antichains of size k + 1, we call B a k-cofamily of P. By Dilworth's theorem, every k-cofamily can be expressed as the union of k chains. Let &amp;(P) denote the size of the largest k-cofamily in P.</p><p>Foreach i &gt; l,defined,(P) = di(P) -d,-,(P),anda,(P) = &amp;(P)-&amp;(P). By convention, we also define d,(P) = a,,(P) = 0, so that d,(P) = d,(P) and L&amp;(P) = C&amp;(P).</p><p>If 02 = (A, , A, ,..., A,} is a partition of P into antichains, define</p><p>Clearly, &amp;(P) &lt; /J(a) for every partition QI.</p><p>We can now state the principal results. The proofs will be deferred until the next section.  In particular, it follows from Theorem 1.6 that the dk(P)'s can be determined from the &amp;(P)'s and vice versa.</p><p>We illustrate Theorems 1.3-1.5 by the following example. Let P be the partially ordered set shown in Fig. Before proceeding to the proofs, we make several additional remarks concerning the background and motivation for these problems.</p><p>(1) It is trivial and well known that Dilworth's theorem remains true when the roles of chain and antichain are reversed. This fact suggested looking for complementary analogs of the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[7]</ref>. To prove Theorem 1.3 when h = 1 (i.e., to find a l-saturated partition of P into antichains) let Ai denote the set of elements of height i in P, for i = 1, 2,..., 2. (The height of an element x E P is the length of the longest chain whose top is x.) Then G!? = {A, , A, ,..., A,) is a l-saturated partition.</p><p>(2) The theory of perjkct graphs, developed by Berge (see <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>), Fulkerson <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[6]</ref>, and Lovasz <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[9]</ref>, suggests that Dilworth-type theorems tend to come in complementary pairs, under very general conditions. If G is any undirected graph, we can interpret "Dilworth's theorem" as the following statement about G (which may or may not be true). The oertices of G can be coz;ered by d totally related (complete) subgraphs, if d is the size of the largest totally unrelated (independent) set in G. By definition, a graph G is perfect if Dilworth's theorem holds for every subgraph of G. The perfect graph theorem states that, if G is perfect, then so is its complement G* (the graph whose edges are the "nonedges" of G). One can examine various analogs of Theorems 1.1-1.5 in the more general context of graph theory and we will do so in Section 4. Surprisingly, Theorem 1.1 does not imply Theorem 1.3 in general, but the stronger Theorem 1.2 implies Theorem 1.4.</p><p>(3) Many of the results in this paper were motivated by an important class of examples arising from the theory of permutations. If q = (aI, a2 ,..., a,&gt; is a sequence of distinct integers, we can associate with a a partially ordered set P, whose chains and antichains correspond to increasing and decreasing subsequences of u'. Define PC to be the set of all pairs (ai, i), with the usual product ordering. In <ref type="bibr">[S]</ref> it was shown that A(P,) is identical to the partition associated with (r by a procedure known as Schensted's algorithm (see <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>). This algorithm constructs a certain Young tableau based on the elements of cr, and A(P,) turns out to be its shape. When the order of cr is reversed, it is known that the "Schensted tableau" is transformed into its transpose. This proves Theorem 1.6 directly when P is of the form PO , since reversing the order of u has the effect of interchanging chains and antichains.</p><p>It should be noted that when P is not of this form the situation is much more complicated: In general, there need not exist a partially ordered set Ij whose chains are the antichains of P and vice versa. In fact, it can be shown that this occurs only when P = P, for some CJ <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">PROOFS OF THE MAIN RESULTS</head><p>To prove Theorems 1.3-1.6, we will need to use Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.5(i) (proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[7]</ref>), and also one additional result from <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[7]</ref>, not mentioned in the Introduction: THEOREM 2.1 [7, Theorem 3.101. Let k be such that A,(P) &gt; O,+,(P). Then there exists an element x E P which is contained in every k-family and (k + l)-famiZy of maximum size.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[7]</ref>, this result was used to prove Theorem 1.2. On the other hand, it can be derived trivially from Theorem 1.2 by the following argument. Let %Y be a partition of P into chains which is both k-saturated and (k + l)saturated. There must be at least one chain of length &lt; k, since otherwise A,(P) = A,,,(P). Choose x to be any element of such a chain, and x has the desired property.</p><p>Except for the use of Theorems 1.2, 1.5(i), and 2.1, the arguments in this section are self-contained.</p><p>It is sometimes useful to observe that a k-saturated partition remains k-saturated if all of the chains of length &lt;k are broken up into singletons. Thus a collection of chains C, , Cz , . . . , Ch of length 3k (together with the set S = P -lJ"; Ci of singletons) determines a k-saturated partition of P if and only if d,(P) = kh + j S j . For convenience of notation, we write +J? = (C, ) c, )...) C, ; S} when %? is obtained in this way. Similarly, if A, &gt; A, ,.'a, Ak is a collection of antichains and T = P -IJ; Ai , define a partition CJ? = (A, , A, ,..., Ak ; T} similarly. The strategy will be as follows. We first prove Theorem 1.6, which allows the dh(P)'s to be expressed in terms of the d,(P)'s, and also verifies Theorem 1.5(ii). Using this information, we may then easily prove Theorem 1.4 (and hence, Theorem 1.  The next step is to remove the above restriction on h and obtain a proof of Theorem 1.6 in all cases.</p><p>Proof of Theorem 1.6. We wish to prove &amp;P) = d,*(P) + ... + d,*(P) for all h &gt; 1.</p><p>Assume inductively that this holds for all partially ordered. sets of size 1 P j -1. If h = d,(P) for some k, we are done by Corollary 2.4. Hence, we can assume that O,(P) &gt; h &gt; O,+,(P) for some k 3 1. (Note that if h &gt; d,(P) the result is trivial, since P is an h-cofamily and a,(P) = A,*(P) + ... + d,*(P) = / P j .) By Theorem 2.1, there exists an element x E P such that x is contained in every k-family of size a',(P), and also every (k + I)-family of size d,+,(P). Let P' = P -x. Then d,(P') = d,(P) -1 and d,+,(P') = d,+,(P) -1, so that O,+,(P') = O,+,(P). By the inductive hypothesis, we can find an h-cofamily in P' (and hence in P) of size d,*(P) + ... + d,*(P). Hence, dh(P) 3 A,*(P) + ... f d,*(P). But Lemma 2.2 shows that equality must occur, and the proof of Theorem 1.6 is complete. Now that we can describe d(P) in terms of d(P), it is easy to show that lz-and (h + I)-saturated partitions of P into antichains always exist (i.e., to prove Theorem 1.4). /Jh+l(m &lt; k(h -t 1) -t T / = &amp;(P) + Ah+,(P) = d&amp;+,(P). Hence, GZ is / both h-saturated and (h f I)-saturated, as desired.</p><p>The results proved in this section indicate a very close relationship between i-families and j-saturated "complementary" partitions, and between j-cofamilies and i-saturated partitions, for certain values of i and j. In a sense, j-cofamilies are i-saturated partitions, provided that i and j are related properly. We make this connection precise in the following theorem. A similar relationship holds between k-families and h-saturated partitions into antichains. We remark that the condition A^,(P) 3 k &gt; d,+l(P) is equivalent to the condition A,(P) 3 h &gt; A,,,(P), as a glance at the Ferrers diagram of A(P) shows.</p><p>Proof. Part (ii) follows from Lemma 2.3 and the above remark. To prove part (i), observe that ,%(%?) &lt; kh + 1 P -C I = kh + a,+,(P) + ... + d,(P) = d,(P), since A,(P) &gt; k 2 A,+,(P). This proves that % is k-saturated. Trivially, 1 Ci / &gt; d,(P) for all i, which implies / Ci / &gt; k.</p><p>Once it is known that h-saturated partitions exist, it is possible to derive a number of additional properties of h-cofamilies. We mention several corollaries, which are counterparts of results obtained for k-families by Greene and Kleitman in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[7]</ref>. THEOREM 2.6. If Al(P) &gt; d,+,(P), then there exists an element x E P which is contained in every h-cofamily and (h + l)-cofamily of maximum size.</p><p>Proof. Let cpl= {A, ,..., A, ; T} be a partition of P into antichains which is h-saturated and (h f I)-saturated (with each I Ai / &gt; h). Since Al*(P) &gt; AZ+,(P), T must be nonempty. Choose x to be any member of T. THEOREM 2.7. Let Fh(P) denote the set of all h-cofamilies of maximum size in P. If every set of (h + 1) members of&amp;(P) has nonempty intersection, there is an element x E P which is common to all members of Fh(P).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof.</head><p>By the previous result, F$(P) fails to have nonempty intersection only if d,*(P) = A&amp;l(P). However, in this case there exist h + 1 pairwise disjoint chains C, , C, ,..., C,,, of maximum length (Al(P)) in P. By removing the chains one at a time, we obtain h + 1 different maximumsized h-cofamilies without a common member.</p><p>The last theorem (proved for k-families in bears a formal resemblance to Helly's theorem for convex regions in h-dimensional Euclidean space (see <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>). However, the h-cofamilies of P do not really have the "Helly property," since the statement of Theorem 2.7 need not hold for arbitrary subcollections of FJP).</p><p>In the special case h = 1, Theorem 2.7 can be restated as follows. 1f</p><p>any two maximum-length chains of P have a common member, then all such chains have a common member. The reader may find it an amusing exercise to construct a direct proof of this statement.</p></div>
