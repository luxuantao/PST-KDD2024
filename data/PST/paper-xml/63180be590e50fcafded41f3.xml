<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The proliferation of real-time applications has motivated extensive research on analyzing and optimizing data freshness in the context of age of information. However, classical frameworks of privacy (e.g., differential privacy (DP)) have overlooked the impact of data freshness on privacy guarantees, which may lead to unnecessary accuracy loss when trying to achieve meaningful privacy guarantees in time-varying databases. In this work, we introduce age-dependent DP, taking into account the underlying stochastic nature of a time-varying database. In this new framework, we establish a connection between classical DP and age-dependent DP, based on which we characterize the impact of data staleness and temporal correlation on privacy guarantees. Our characterization demonstrates that aging, i.e., using stale data inputs and/or postponing the release of outputs, can be a new strategy to protect data privacy in addition to noise injection in the traditional DP framework. Furthermore, to generalize our results to a multi-query scenario, we present a sequential composition result for age-dependent DP under any publishing and aging policies. We then characterize the optimal tradeoffs between privacy risk and utility and show how this can be achieved. Finally, case studies show that to achieve a target of an arbitrarily small privacy risk in a single-query case, combing aging and noise injection only leads to a bounded accuracy loss, whereas using noise injection only (as in the benchmark case of DP) will lead to an unbounded accuracy loss.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Background</head><p>Fresh data has become indispensable for ubiquitous real-time applications, including Internetof-things (IoT) systems (e.g., healthcare wearables), cyber-physical systems (e.g., autonomous transportation systems), and financial services. For instance, real-time location and velocity information of motor vehicles is the key to realize reliable and safe autonomous driving, and real-time stock quotes are essential for developing effective high-frequency trading strategies in financial markets. The increasing importance of fresh data has been driving research on a new metric, Age of information (AoI), to measure the timeliness of the information that a receiver has about the status of a remote source <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>An unpredecented amount of personal data is generated in such real-time applications. This may severely compromise user privacy, as an adversary may take advantage of this data to infer information about a user. This privacy-sensitive information may include user identities and user properties, whose leakage may lead to undesireable consequences. For instance, burglars can use real-time electricity usage readings (in smart grid systems) to infer whether there are people at private homes before attempting burglaries; stalkers may access real-time GPS location data from location-based service providers to track mobile users.</p><p>To combat such privacy leakage, researchers have proposed numerous solutions, varying in terms of the level of data protection and implementation complexity (see a survey in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>). A widely used analytical framework is differential privacy (DP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, which quantifies the level of individual privacy leakage due to releasing aggregate information from a database. Several companies and government agencies, such as Apple <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, Google <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, Microsoft <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and the U.S.</p><p>Census Bureau <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, have adopted the framework of DP in their practices. The key idea of DP is to provide strong privacy guarantees by injecting tunable levels of noise into the aggregate information before its release, with the goal of maintaining a proper tradeoff between privacy and statistical utility of databases.</p><p>Despite its privacy guarantees against arbitrary adversaries, existing DP techniques (and other related classes of privacy metrics such as k-Anonymity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and t-Closeness <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>) have largely overlooked the impact of data freshness for time-varying databases. Intuitively, as some data has diminishing value over time, releasing outdated data may lead to less privacy leakage if a user only focuses on protecting its real-time status. As an example, for a mobile user trying to protect Aging Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>: An age-dependent differential privacy mechanism. its real-time location, the accuracy of an adversary's inference (hence the user's privacy leakage) will significantly drop as the location data becomes outdated. In a more concrete example in Section III, we show that the accuracy of an adversary's estimate diminishes quickly to a level of no privacy concerns due to data aging, whereas the classical DP framework can only provide a very loose upper bound (as high as 88%) for the probability an adversary's estimate is correct. This observation motivates the following key question: Question 1. How should one quantify the impact of data timeliness on data privacy protection? Motivated by Question 1 and the notions of AoI and DP, this work proposes an age-related generalization of DP that provides more meaningful guarantees for time-varying datasets. We name it age-dependent differential privacy.</p><p>Our new framework is applicable to a wide range of privacy-sensitive applications with timevarying datasets, such as (i) location-based services <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, (ii) smart meter readings <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, (iii) medical information, and (iv) stock holdings in financial markets. Other types of privacy-sensitive information that are time-invariant (e.g., genome information) can be well understood under the classical DP notion, hence are not the main focus of this paper.</p><p>Whereas existing studies largely rely on injecting noise to achieve DP <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, our proposed framework provides a new direction to protect privacy, namely aging, which postpones the release of outputs. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> presents an example of age-dependent differentially private mechanism that combines both the new method (aging) and the existing one (noise injection). This also raises another challenge in designing privacy-persevering mechanisms: Question 2. How should one characterize age-dependent privacy guarantees by leveraging aging along with classical methods (e.g., noise injection)?</p><p>To answer this question, we provide theoretic guarantees achieved by classical DP mechanisms when adopted in our new age-dependent DP framework. This establishes a connection between the classical DP notion and our proposed age-dependent generalization. Additionally, it enables us to derive the achievable age-dependent privacy guarantees by exploiting both classical methods (e.g., noise injection) and aging (e.g., timing inputs and outputs).</p><p>The operation of real-time systems involving frequent data updates raises the necessity of understanding the performance of privacy-preserving mechanisms with sequential queries, a topic that has been studied for conventional DP mechanisms through work on sequential composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Age-dependent DP mechanisms bring two new challenges compared to these classical results. First, our characterization further depends on the timing of both inputs (how stale the input database is for all queries) and outputs (when to release the outputs of all queries). In contrast, the classical composition results only depend on the number of queries. The second challenge is that optimally trading off privacy and utility now depends on optimizing over such timing as well as any noise that is added, both of which may impact utility and privacy in different ways. In light of the above challenges, our final key question is Question 3. How should one characterize the optimal tradeoffs between privacy and utility for multi-query mechanisms?</p><p>To this end, we construct multi-query mechanisms by a combination of single-query mechanisms, and derive the corresponding privacy guarantees over time considering the independent guarantees achieved by these single-query mechanisms and the corresponding timings of inputs and outputs. By deriving and exploiting a special structure of the optimal solutions, we are then able to formulate a tractable optimization problem that makes tradeoffs between privacy and utility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Contributions</head><p>We summarize the key contributions of this work in the following:</p><p>? Age-dependent DP. To the best of our knowledge, age-dependent DP is the first performance metric of privacy protection that accounts for the potentially diminishing privacy leakage of delayed data.</p><p>? Privacy guarantee analysis. By establishing the connection between the classical DP notion and our proposed age-dependent DP, we derive the achievable privacy guarantees when one exploits aging along with classical DP mechanisms. We also characterize the key factor that determines the decaying rate of age-dependent privacy risks over time.</p><p>? Composition. We further address how age-dependent DP guarantees compose over multiple queries, depending on the timing of both inputs and outputs. Even for infinitely many queries, we show that the peak privacy risk can be upper bounded under a characterizable condition.</p><p>? Tradeoffs. We present two case studies to understand tradeoffs between privacy and utility.</p><p>Our numerical studies reveal that, when approaching an arbitrary small privacy risk in a single-query case, our proposed scheme (of combing aging and noise injection) only incurs a bounded accuracy loss, whereas the loss incurred by a benchmark (using noise injection only) grows unbounded.</p><p>We organize the rest of this paper as follows. In Section II, we review related studies.</p><p>Section III describes the model. In Section IV, we introduce the definition of age-dependent DP for a single-query mechanism and characterize its properties. In Section V, we generalize our definition and results to multi-query mechanisms and characterize how age-dependent DP guarantees compose. We further present two heuristic examples in Section VI and finally conclude in Section VII.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RELATED WORK</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Age of Information</head><p>Many works in recent years considered the analysis and optimization for data freshness, measured by AoI, for different networked systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> and a survey in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>). Most studies in this literature have not considered privacy protection. One exception is <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, in which Jin et al. studied the an age-minimal mobile crowd sensing system for location-based services while achieving DP. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> did not consider an age-based variant of DP, nor the impact of data freshness or temporal correlation on privacy protection, which we do here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Differential Privacy</head><p>There has been a lot of work on DP (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>) and we will only survey some related studies here.</p><p>Variants of differential privacy. The initial work on DP <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> makes no distributional assumption on the data. A number of existing variants of DP assumed specific knowledge of data generating distributions, which can provide more meaningful privacy protection under considered scenarios (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>). For instance, Rinaldo et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> studied how data distributions affect the characterizations of privacy guarantees. Kifer et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> proposed a Bayesian framework for defining privacy, the Pufferfish. Yang et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> further studied the influence of data correlations on privacy in the Pufferfish framework. Our approach assumes the knowledge of an underlying probabilistic model for the time-varying data, whereas these variants mainly did not account for the impact of data timeliness.</p><p>Privacy analysis of dynamic databases. Related studies of DP for dynamic databases have focused on a limited class of problems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>). Both <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> adapted the notion of DP to streaming environments, where each entry in the database is a single bit, and bits arrive one per unit time. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, Smith et al. extended this technique to maintain private sums of real vectors arriving online in a stream. Mechanisms proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> are non-adaptive, in the sense that they answer a single query repeatedly on a dynamic database. Cummings et al. extended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> the results to an adaptive analysis. Nevertheless, this line of work did not characterize the impact of data timeliness or temporal correlation on data privacy protection. Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> is the only exception, in which Cao et al. studied the privacy leakage accounting for continuous data release with time correlation (but not data timeliness).</p><p>The composition result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> did not account for different data publishing and aging policies, which we consider in this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Time-Based Privacy Metrics</head><p>Another line of related work considers time-based metrics for privacy, which only includes a few studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, Wright et al. proposed a time-based metric that measures the time until the adversary's success, which in fact assumed that the adversary will eventually succeed.</p><p>On the other hand, Hoh et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> considered the mean time to confusion, which measures the time during which the adversary's uncertainty stays below a confusion threshold. For an adversary aiming to track a target's location over time, Sampigethaya et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> considered the maximum tracking time to measure the adversary's tracking ability. These studies did not account for the impacts of the temporal correlation of data or data timeliness on data privacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. MODEL AND PRELIMINARY</head><p>In this section, we introduce the model of the users, the adversary, and the stochastic processes of the users' privacy-sensitive and time-varying databases. After reviewing the classical notion of DP, we use an illustrative example to show that DP may not provide an informative description of privacy protection for time-varying databases. We summarize all key parameters in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Model</head><p>System Overview: We consider a set I = {1, . . . , I} of users and an infinite-horizon discretetime model with time t ? N. The system starts to operate at time t = 0, and N denotes the set of all non-negative integers.</p><p>User: For each user i, its privacy-sensitive data is captured by a discrete-time stationary process {x i,t } t?N . We assume this process take values in a finite state space, X i . Due to the stationarity, there exists a stationary probability distribution ? i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X i ? [0, 1], such that ? i (x) = Pr(x i,t = x)</formula><p>for all t ? N. We denote the t-step transition probability by P i,t (x, y) Pr[x i,t = y|x i,0 = x] for all t ? N and all x, y ? X i . We further use Pi,t (x, y) to denote the t-step transition probability of the reversed process, which satisfies that Pi,t (x, y) = ? i (y)P i,t (y, x)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">? i (x) , ?x, y ? X i , t ? N, i ? I.<label>(1)</label></formula><p>If Pi,t (x, y) = P i,t (x, y) for all t ? N and x, y ? X i , then {x i,t } t?N is reversible <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p><p>A class of random processes of particular interest is time-invariant Markov chains, which are characterized via a time-invariant transition probability matrix P i (x, y) for each user i and states</p><p>x and y.</p><p>Aggregate Database: We use {X t } t?N to denote the aggregate process across all users, where X t {x i,t } i?I is the random variable of the (aggregate) database of all users at time t, belonging to the (aggregate) state space X = i?I X i . Throughout this paper, a database is referred to as the aggregate data of all users sampled at a time, X t . Assuming that the processes are independent across users, then the corresponding t-step transition probability is P t (X, Y ) = i?I P i,t (x i , y i ), the stationary probability is ?(X) i?I ?(x i ), and the t-step transition probability of the reversed process is Pt (X, Y ), for all X = {x i } i?I , Y = {y i } i?I , and t ? N.  Event-Level Privacy Protection Goal: Users seek to protect their data privacy against a type of adversaries that aim to infer about the current status X t at each time slot t ? N. That is, the key focus is to protect each user's single data point at time t ? N, which is referred to as the event-level privacy protection <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Answering a query using database X t for some t &lt; t thus leads to less privacy leakage than using database X t , even if X t and X t may be correlated.</p><p>The consideration of such adversaries is practical in a wide range of application scenarios.</p><p>Examples include real-time electricity consumption data, real-time GPS data, and financial data.</p><p>This can be distinguished from user-level privacy protection, where an adversary is interested in obtaining the entire history (or its subset) of a user's location database {X t } t?T for some T , e.g., to determine if a user ever visited a given location with a given time window. We will leave the modeling of this more general class of adversaries and the corresponding analysis for future work.</p><p>In our analysis, we consider the worst-case scenario where the adversary has knowledge of the underlying probability models {P i,t (x, y)} i?I , which provides a strong guarantee. We assume that the platform also has knowledge of {P i,t (x, y)} i?I and can use it to determine how data can be released. The platform may gain such knowledge, for example, from analyzing historical data from the same set of users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Differential Privacy</head><p>Here we review the classical notion of DP <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, which can be viewed as if applying to databases that consist of a single element from a joint-state space X :</p><p>Definition 1 (Differential Privacy (DP)). Given any C &gt; 0, a mechanism (algorithm) M :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">X ? Y is C -DP if</formula><p>for all pairs X, X ? X which differ only in one user's data, the following inequality holds</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Pr[M (X) ? W] ? exp( C )Pr[M (X ) ? W], ?W ? Y,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where the probability is taken over the randomness of the output of mechanism M .</p><p>We use subscript C to indicate that C stands for the classical privacy risk, so as to distinguish it from the privacy risk achievable in our framework.</p><p>DP requires that changing each user's data will have little impact on the output when is small. It provides a strong and mathematically rigorous robustness against an arbitrary adversary, but may come at the expense of the statistical utility (e.g., the accuracy) of the output.</p><p>To achieve DP, a well-known approach is to inject Laplace or Gaussian noise to the database output <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Formally, we review the following definitions:</p><p>Definition 2 (Sensitivity). For any function f : X ? R d , the 1 -sensitivity of f is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">S (f ) = max X,X f (X) -f (X ) 1 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where X and X are neighbouring databases, i.e., X and X differ only in one user's data.</p><p>Definition 3 (Laplace Mechanism). For any function f : X ? R D , the Laplace mechanism (associated with f ) is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">M L (X) = f (X) + n,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where n = {n k } D k=1 are independent Laplace(S (f ) / C ) random variables. A random variable has a Laplace(b) distribution if its probability density function is</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">p L (x|b) = 1 2b exp - |x| b .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Proposition 1 (Classical Privacy Guarantee <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>). For any function f : X ? R D with a sensitivity given in (3), the corresponding Laplace mechanism is C -DP.</p><p>As an example, consider function f (X) = i?I X i /I, where X i ? {0, 1} for every i ? I.</p><p>From Definition 2, we have S (f ) = 1/I. We use the variance of its outcome to characterize the L 2 accuracy loss (mean square error) of the Laplace mechanism in (4), given by Var(M L (X)) = 2/( 2 C I 2 ). This implies that a higher degree of privacy protection (i.e., a small C ) requires a larger statistical utility loss (i.e., a larger variance Var(M L (X))). Next we present an example to illustrate that the classical DP privacy guarantee may not be practical for time-varying databases, as it does not capture the impact of data freshness on privacy leakage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. A Motivating Example</head><p>In this subsection, we consider an illustrative example to motivate our alternative privacy notion.</p><p>Consider the following example. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> There are two towns: A and B. The databases X, X consist of two profiles of resident income values of town A. There is a billionaire x whose income is orders of magnitude higher than other individuals in either town. The billionaire occasionally travels between two towns, and the probability that the billionaire travels to the other town after each day is 10%. An adversary wishes to track down the current location of the billionaire. The adversary observes the mean income w of town A sanitised by an C -DP mechanism. The result w is only published at time t = 0. Using a Bayesian estimator, the probability of the adversary being correct is</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P (A) = 1 1 + exp(-C ) .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>For an C -DP mechanism with C = 2, the attack accuracy is as high as P (A) = 88%.</p><p>However, if the adversary obtains this message after t days (still using the same C -DP mechanism), we can express the eventual accuracy P t (A) in the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">? ? P t (A) 1 -P t (A) ? ? = ? ? P (A) 1 -P (A) ? ? ? ? ? 90% 10% 10% 90% ? ? t .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>That is, the probability of a successful attack becomes P t (A) ? 65% when t = 3 days, P t (A) ? 58% when t = 6 days, and P t (A) ? 53% when t = 10 days. Therefore, the probability of a successful attack decreases over time and eventually converges to 50% (which corresponds to a pure random guess).</p><p>Moreover, the probability of a successful attack when it receives w immediately with C = 0.3 is approximately the same as when it observes w after t = 6 days with C = 2. This shows that aging provides an alternative to increasing the noise variance for increasing privacy protection.</p><p>This motivates us to design an age-dependent generalization that takes the data timeliness into account in the next sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. AGE-DEPENDENT DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY: THE SINGLE-QUERY CASE</head><p>In this section, we start with introducing the definition of age-dependent differential privacy for a single-query mechanism. In the age-dependent DP framework, we characterize the privacy guarantees achieved by any DP mechanism considering data freshness and the temporal correlation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Definitions</head><p>Throughout Section IV, we focus on single-query (time-invariant) mechanisms M : X ? Y, where X = i?I X i denotes the state space of an aggregate database (at a specific time instance) and Y is the set of all possible outcomes. In Section V, we will provide an extension to multiquery mechanisms.</p><p>We first formally introduce age-dependent DP under the single-query case:</p><p>Definition 4 (Age-Dependent Differential Privacy). A single-query mechanism M is ( , t)-agedependent DP for a given random process {X t }, if, for any pair X, X ? X which differ only in one user's data, the following is true:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Pr[M (X 0 ) ? W|X t = X] ? exp( )Pr[M (X 0 ) ? W|X t = X ], ?W ? Y,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where the probability takes into account the randomness of both the output of mechanism M and the stochastic process of {X t } t?N .</p><p>Different from classical DP (Definition 1), age-dependent DP (Definition 4) also accounts for the evolution of the stochastic process {X t } t?N . This also implies that the classical C -DP is a special case of the age-dependent DP, i.e., ( C , t = 0)-age-dependent DP.

We characterized how the agedependent privacy risk evolves over time and how to achieve age-dependent DP by exploiting the classical DP and aging. Our analysis reveals that the key factor of {X t } t?N that determines the decaying rate is ?(t). The analysis in this section is only applicable to a single-query mechanism M , whereas the deployment of real-time applications in practice relies on publishing data updates frequently. This motivates us to study the more general case of multiple queries next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. AGE-DEPENDENT DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY: SEQUENTIAL COMPOSITION</head><p>In this section, we introduce a more general notion of age-dependent DP for multi-query mechanisms (e.g., for real-time applications that publish updates frequently) and present a sequential composition theorem. We will further discuss how to best trade off privacy and utility (characterized by age of information).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The General Definition and Composition</head><p>In a multi-query scenario, the history of all published outputs are visible to the adversary, which brings a new challenge in characterizing the privacy risk over time. A fundamental problem in the DP literature is how the overall privacy level degrades when combining multiple queries,</p><p>where each query meets a certain DP guarantee. Such a combination of multiple queries is known as composition. Characterizing classical sequential composition results usually depend on the total number of queries (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>). As an example, Dwork et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> showed that:</p><p>Proposition 2 (Basic Composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>). Let M n be an C,n -DP mechanism for all n ?</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">[N ]. The composition M (X) defined as M (X) = {M n (X)} N n=1 is C -DP for C = N n=1 C,n .</formula><p>Proposition 2 can only provide a loose privacy guarantee in our case since it does not capture the impacts of data freshness and the temporal correlation. Another challenge of analyzing timevarying databases comes from the need to consider timings of both inputs and outputs: how stale is each input database used for each query and when each output is published.</p><p>To this end, we consider the following notations of an aging policy and a publishing policy.</p><p>We use A = {A n } n?N to denote the aging policy, where A n indicates the age of the n-th input database used for the n-th query. We further use S = {S n } n?N to denote the publishing policy, i.e., S n indicates the time instance that the n-th outcome is published. Given a publishing policy, we name the time interval [S n , S n+1 ) as the n-th epoch for all n.</p><p>Let H t be the history up to time t, given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">H t (S, A) {X Sn-An : n ? N, S n ? t},<label>(18)</label></formula><p>and let</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">N t max n, s.t. S n ? t,<label>(19)</label></formula><p>be the the number of queries N t up to time t. Furthermore, we define the general class of (potential multi-query) mechanisms as follows:</p><p>Definition 9 (Multi-query Mechanism). A multi-query mechanism M t is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">M t (H t (S, A)) {M n (X Sn-An ) : n ? N, S n ? t},<label>(20)</label></formula><p>where M n : X ? Y is a single-query mechanism used for the n-th query.</p><p>Privacy Risk ?(?) A multi-query mechanism is constructed based on potentially infinitely many single-query mechanisms. The n-th query uses dataset X Sn-An as its input, with S n -A n representing the time stamp of the input dataset, and uses (single-query) mechanism M n and publishes its output at time S n . Further, we label the multi-query mechanism with a time stamp t so that M t (H t (S, A)) stands for the history of all outputs published no later than time t.</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">Time ? ! ? !"# (a) Age of Information Time ? ! ? !"# ? ! (b)</formula><p>We next present the general definition of age-dependent DP associated to M t , characterized by not only t and , but also the publishing and the aging policies: Definition 10 (Age-Dependent Differential Privacy). A multi-query mechanism M t is ( (t), t, S, A)age-dependent DP for a given random process {X t } if for all t, the following inequality holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">Pr[M t (H t (S, A)) ? W t |X t = X] ? exp( )Pr[M t (H t (S, A)) ? W t |X t = X ],<label>(21)</label></formula><p>for each pair X, X ? X which differ only in one user's data, and for all output histories W t ? Y Nt . We let S 0 = 0 and (t) = 0 for all t ? [0, S 1 ).</p><p>To characterize how the information freshness evolves over time given S and A, we consider the following definition of age of information:</p><p>Definition 11 (Age of Information <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>). Given the publishing policy S and the aging policy A, we define age of information AoI(t) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">AoI(t + 1) ? ? ? ? ? A n , if t + 1 = S n , AoI(t) + 1, otherwise.<label>(22)</label></formula><p>In other words, age of information represents the time elapsed since the time stamp of the input database for the most recently published output. It has been used to estimate the value (e.g., accuracy) of the output of M n (X Sn-An ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Before we present the formal characterization of how the age-dependent privacy guarantee evolves over time for any multi-query mechanisms, we present an illustrative example of what the age of information in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> and the privacy risk guarantees may look like. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the privacy risk (t) decreases within each epoch (for any ?(t) diminishing in t) and spikes at the beginning of the next epoch. Therefore, we define (S n ) as the in-epoch peak privacy risk for the n-th epoch. On the other hand, the age of information increases within each epoch.</p></div>

This result in fact coincides with the basic composition result (for static databases). On the other hand, several existing studies have provided state-of-art improvements on composition (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>) by considering more sophisticated composition techniques (e.g.</p><p>adaptive composition as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>).

Possibility of No Tradeoffs</head><p>Intuitively, increasing privacy will lead to a decrease of utility (measured by an increase in the peak age penalty function f ). However, unlike the single-query mechanism, this tradeoff between privacy and utility in the multi-query scenario may not exist, i.e., there may be cases where increasing the bound on the penalty ( f ) does not lead to greater peak privacy risk.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Two-State Markov Chain</head><p>In this subsection, we first consider the following example with two states <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>:</p><p>Example 1. Consider a system of I agents and two locations. We use x i,t ? {-1, 1} to denote the location at time t of agent i and let X t = {x i,t } i?I . Each agent i's time-varying database is given by an identical discrete-time Markov chain, with the following transition probability matrix 4 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_64">P = ? ? 1 -p p q 1 -q ? ? ,<label>(36)</label></formula><p>which can be verified to be reversible. Assuming |1 -p -q| &lt; 1, 5 it follows that the stationary distribution is ?(0) = q p+q and ?(1) = p p+q , and the t-step transition probability matrix is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_65">P t = 1 p + q ? ? q p q p ? ? + (1 -p -q) t p + q ? ? p -p -q q ? ? .

In the latter example, an analyst aims at designing a mechanism to estimate the current aggregate 4 We drop the index i in the matrices for Example 1, as agents' time-varying databases are identical. 5 If p = q = 0, the Markov chain is reducible.

Based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>, we consider two utility metrics:</p><p>? Mean-Square Error: We assume no prior information is available and simply use the given released data M (X 0 ) as the estimate. The mean-square error (MSE) is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_72">f MSE (t, C ) = E ? ? M (X 0 ) - 1 I i x i,t 2 ? ? .

Failure Rate: Motivated by the age of incorrect information proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, we consider a binary estimator. Specifically, based on the outcome of the mechanism M (X 0 ), we seek to determine whether i x i,t /I ? 0 is true (e.g., whether a the traffic at a specific location is congested). Let z t be an indicator random variable for the event that i x i,t /I ? 0. The maximum likelihood estimate of z t is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_74">g MLE (M (X 0 )) arg max x?{0,1} Pr[z t = x|M (X 0 )].<label>(43)</label></formula><p>We use the following definition of the failure rate (conditional on the initial state X 0 ) as our noise-aware age penalty:</p><formula xml:id="formula_75">f MLE (t, c ) = Pr[g MLE (M (X 0 )) = z t |X 0 ].<label>(44)</label></formula><p>1) The single-query case: Combining (40) and Theorem 2, we can characterize the achievable privacy guarantee in the single-query case as follows:</p><p>Corollary 3.

In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>(a), we show that the accuracy loss increases in t, and for a given C , it converges to an upper bound as t ? ?. This implies that aging does not necessarily incur significant accuracy loss in terms of the mean-square error. On the other hand, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4(b)</ref> shows that privacy risks decrease in t and converge to 0, which is mainly because ?(t) converges to 0.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>(c), we compare our proposed mechanisms against a classical noise only benchmark that only injects Laplace noise, whose accuracy loss is given by 2/( 2 C I 2 ). We show that, to achieve an arbitrary small privacy risk, the accuracy loss incurred by the benchmark grows unbounded. The large loss is partially because of the lack of prior information in the considered mean-square error scenario. Our proposed scheme combines both aging and noise injection and is able to achieve a finite accuracy loss, as the privacy risk approaches 0. We note that this is partially because our age-dependent DP protects privacy specifically from adversaries seeking to infer X t , whereas DP does not assume any type of data distributions or adversaries. We set p = q = 0.1 and I = 20.</p><p>In the failure rate scenario, we present the accuracy loss and privacy risk for a single query mechanism at different ages t in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>(a), and the tradeoffs between privacy risk and accuracy loss in Figures <ref type="figure">5(b)(c</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>(a) shows that the accuracy loss increases in t as it does in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>(a), but at a different rate. The accuracy loss eventually converges to 0.5 as t ? ?. We note that the privacy risks for a given t and C are the same as in the mean-squared error scenario (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4(b)</ref>). In terms of the tradeoffs between privacy and accuracy loss, we show that our proposed scheme can achieve less accuracy loss compared to the noise only benchmark. In addition, Figure <ref type="figure">5(b</ref>) also shows that different utility-privacy pairs require different t and C . In Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>(c), we present the optimal tradeoffs between privacy and accuracy loss. Compared to the noise only benchmark, this shows that our proposed scheme can achieve a reduction up to 1/3 in accuracy loss given the same privacy risk.</p><p>Finally, Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> presents the tradeoffs between privacy and utility in the multi-query scenario.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>(a) show that there exists a pair that minimizes both the peak accuracy loss and the peak privacy risk. This is mainly because the condition in Corollary 2 holds in this case and hence the tradeoff between privacy and utility does not exist. Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>(b) demonstrates the existence of the optimal tradeoffs between privacy and utility for multi-query mechanisms in the failure rate scenario, as the condition in Corollary 2 does not hold in this case. That is, a smaller achievable peak privacy risk leads to a larger achievable peak accuracy loss.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Electricity Consumption Forecast</head><p>In this experiment, we use electricity consumption readings of households in London provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> to evaluate our proposed scheme. UK Power Networks recorded Power consumption (in kWh) every 30 minutes between November 2011 and February 2014. We selected 40 households, with 28, 000 readings per household on average. We quantized the power values into 12 intervals, resulting in a Markov chain with 12 states for each household. Related studies also considered such a Markov chain formulation of electricity consumption readings <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Our goal is to publish a privacy-preserving approximation to forecast households' average electricity consumption. In particular, to evaluate the privacy risks, we use the following result to estimate an upper bound for the total variation distance between the transition probability and the stationary probability: Proposition 5 (Bounds on variation distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>). Let {X t } t?N be an irreducible, aperiodic, and reversible Markov chain on a finite set X . Then for all X ? X , t ?

As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>(a), the accuracy loss first increases rapidly in t and then remains a relatively constant level, for all choices of C values. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>(b), we observe that the upper bound on the privacy risks in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref> are first the same as their corresponding classical DP risks and then decrease when the age is greater than 18 hours. This mainly results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>, in which the second term max i?I max becomes less than 1 when t ? 18 hours. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">6</ref> Finally, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>(c) depicts the achievable tradeoffs between privacy and accuracy loss. Similarly, the accuracy loss incurred by the DP benchmark grows unbounded as the privacy risk approaches zero, while a finite accuracy loss is always achievable under our proposed scheme that combines both noise injection and aging.</p><formula xml:id="formula_80">x i ?X i 1-? i (x i ) ? i (x i ) only</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we proposed an age-dependent generalization of differential privacy. We characterized the impact of data staleness on data privacy guarantees and showed that aging provides a new direction to protect data privacy (in addition to noise injection) based on stale data. Motivated by frequent data updates in real-time applications, we further characterized how age-dependent privacy risks compose, given any publishing and aging policies. Finally, our case studies showed that mechanisms combining aging and noise injection may significantly outperform the classical mechanisms (that inject noise only), when making tradeoffs between privacy and utility.</p><p>As a first study on understanding the impact of data freshness on privacy, there are many future research directions. First, our work assumes that the adversary is only interested in keeping track on the most current state of some user. One potential direction is to extend our results to different adversary models, e.g., adversaries that aim to infer a subset of the entire history of users' databases. Second, it is interesting to study adaptive composition to enhance the privacy guarantees for multi-query mechanisms.</p><p>where (a) is due to Claim 1 and the fact that X and X only differs in the i-th user's data; (b) is because ln(1 + x) ? x; (c) is from Proposition ??.</p><p>This completes the proof of Theorem 2.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Proof of Theorem 2</head><p>In Lemma 2, we bound i?X i (p(x i ) + ?(x i )) x i based on both the constraint on ?(x i ) and the bound of x i . The key difference in this proof from that of Theorem 1 is that we consider a lemma which does not require the bound of x i , based on which we can prove Theorem 2. We start with such a lemma: Lemma 3. For any part of vectors with lengths K denoted by {a 1 , a 2 , ..., a k } and</p><p>Proof. We can prove Lemma 3 by summing b k g ? a k ? b k G all over 1 ? k ?

We note that i) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> is necessary even if the problem in (55) is not convex; ii) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> automatically satisfies (55b), which implies that the relaxation of (55b) does not lose any feasibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Preliminaries: Mixing, Ergodicity, and Markov Chains</head><p>In order to characterize how privacy guarantees change over time under the new framework of age-dependent DP, we introduce several related concepts and preliminary results from the literature in this subsection. Lemma 4 (Bounds on Eigenvalues <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>). Let P (?, ?) be the transition matrix of an irreducible Markov chain {X t } t?N . Then the eigenvalues of P , {? k }, satisfy:</p><p>where m = |X | denotes the total number of states.</p><p>The largest eigenvalue ? 0 being 1 results from irreducibility. It is known that the convergence rate largely depends on the value ? * = max(? 1 , |? m-1 |).</p><p>There are a few studies in the literature of applied probability on analysis of the value of ? * (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>). As an example, Landau and Odlyzko in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> provided a bound for a random walk on a connected graph and showed the following result: <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>). Let {X t } t?N be a random walk on a connected graph, it follows that</p><p>where |X | is the number of vertices in the graph, d * is the maximum degree of the graph, and ? * is the diameter of the graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Proof of Theorem 4</head><p>To prove Theorem 4, we will first prove that the monotonicity of (S n ) in n (Lemma 5).</p><p>We will then present the intermediate result of the existence of an optimal solution that have identical (A * n , S * n , * C,n ) after n ? m in Lemma 6, based on which we complete the whole proof.

We have that, for the sequence { n } generated according to n+1 = F (A * , S * , * C , n ) for all n ? N with 0 = 0, n ? * for all n ? N. Therefore, the new solution Z must be optimal as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H. Proof of Corollary 2</head><p>Let (A, S, C ) be any feasible solution, we construct another solution (A , S , C ) such that</p><p>From (32a), we can show that (A , S , C ) leads to the same objective value as (A, S, C ) does.</p><p>On the other hand, we have that</p><p>Therefore, the new value of the peak age penalty is given by</p><p>where a = A -ln(exp( C )-1) ln(? -1 )</p><p>+ S -C ln(? -1 ) . The assumption that (73) is decreasing in C means that the new solution will satisfy f (A + S , C ) &lt; f (A + S, C ) while achieving the same peak privacy guarantees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Autoregressive Model</head><p>We further consider a continuous-state autoregressive (AR) models, expressed as</p><p>where i,t follows an i.i.d. normal distribution N (0, ? 2 ).</p><p>We start with the following time reversibility result:</p><p>Lemma 7 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>). When i,t follows i.i.d. normal distributions, the process in (74) is time reversible.</p><p>In the following, we focus on an AR(1) model for trackability, i.e., among all {? t } only the first coefficient ? 1 takes a non-zero value. Therefore, we drop the index 1 in ? 1 in the following.</p><p>When i,t has mean zero and variance ? 2 , it follows that</p><p>and</p><p>Lemma 8. When follows N (0, ? 2 ) for all i ? I and t ?
