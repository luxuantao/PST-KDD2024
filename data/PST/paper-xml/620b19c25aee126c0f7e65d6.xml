<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper studies the scaling properties of recruitment fluctuations in randomly varying environments, for abundant marine species with extreme reproductive behavior. Fisheries stock-recruitment data from the North Atlantic display fluctuation scaling, a proportionality between the standard deviation and the average recruitment among stocks. The proportionality covers over five orders of magnitude in the range studied. A linear-scaling behavior can be a sign of a universal distribution of the normalized data across stocks. In light of this conjecture, it is demonstrated that the Lévy-stable model offers a better effective description of the recruitment distribution than the log-normal model. Care is devoted to the problem of random sums of random variables. Recruitment is calculated by summing random offspring numbers with infinite variance, where the number of summands (i.e. spawning population size) is also a random process with infinite variance.</p></div>

Studies on the population dynamics have been overshadowed by large fluctuations in recruitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Smith 1994)</ref>. Understanding large fluctuations requires theoretical and empirical studies of fluctuation probabilities. A conventional approach uses the log-normal distribution of recruitment. While the main body of the recruitment distribution is well described by a lognormal distribution, there are more extreme events than the log-normal model predicts <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hilborn &amp; Walters 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Niwa 2006b)</ref>.

I investigate the coupling of recruitment fluctuations with the mean annual recruitment to individual stocks, and find that the coupling scales linearly with the mean recruitment. Populations with large mean experience proportionally large variability in recruitment, in contrast to the expectation of decaying per-capita variability. The linear scaling is here explained by the competition between internal demographic dynamics and changes in external factors (such as climate and commercial exploitation).</p><p>Very large interfamilial, or sweepstakes, variation in reproductive success has been documented in abundant marine species <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hedgecock &amp; Pudovkin 2011)</ref>.

Thus the typical value of the squared difference is estimated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(R − R ) 2 ∼ R 2/α ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>whereas the variance (R − R ) 2 is infinite. Angled brackets denote mean over all possible realizations. The value of α in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) is within the Lévy-stable domain, suggesting that the recruitment distribution has similar asymptotic behavior to the offspring distribution. Stated more precisely, the rescaled sum</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">R sc = R − X N ς R</formula><p>has a maximally asymmetric α-stable distribution L α,1 as N → ∞, where the scale factor ς R represents the width of the distribution of R,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ς R = x 0 C α N 1/α with C α = [Γ(1 − α) cos(πα/2)] 1/α .

When β = 1, the tail vanishes to the left. When β = 0, the distribution is symmetric. Let R t , as in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>), denote the number of recruits to the population at time t + 1 in years (or generations), where X n is the number of offspring of the n-th individual in year t with the distribution in Equation (1) being identical for all t.

Here, I study the recruitment fluctuations in randomly varying environments, for abundant marine species with extreme reproductive behavior. This paper provides, contrary to constant N , a theory for fluctuation scaling of R for a population with a time-variable carrying capacity. The recruitment is a random sum of independent random variables X n with infinite variance, where the number of summands (population size N ) is also a random process with infinite variance. Individual reproductive variability (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) is assumed to be independent of population size. This paper shows that fisheries stock-recruitment datasets from the North Atlantic fall into the 'universality' class (or the limiting case) of the exponent b = 1. This observation is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cobain et al. (2019)</ref>, which reported the scaling of fluctuations in abundance of populations in the North Sea fish community, where the exponents are around b ≈ 1. The scaling exponent of b = 1 implies that the normalized observations have an identical distribution across blocks of observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Eisler et al. 2008)</ref>. In light of this conjecture of a universal distribution, I compare the log-normal versus the Lévy-stable model for recruitment fluctuations.</p><p>The study of random sums of random variables was launched in Robbins' (1948) paper, where the number N of random variables in a sum is also a random variable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dobrushin (1955)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rényi (1963), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gnedenko &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fahim (1969)</ref> developed the theory of limiting behavior of random sums. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Klebanov et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Recruitment as random sums.</head><p>To incorporate externally induced fluctuations, let us allow N to vary independently from one year to the other. I study the fluctuations of the random sums, allowing for an infinite variance of the number of summands. The relationship between the fluctuation scaling in the sums (or the value of b) and the amplitude of fluctuations in the number of summands is of special interest.</p><p>Define N t (t = 1, . . . , T ), the size of the population at time t, to be a random variable with finite mean N . It is assumed that the number of summands is independent of the summands X n . The average recruitment is then given by R = X N .</p><p>Since the recruitment fluctuations have two sources, it follows that</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">(R t − R ) 2 = (R t − X N t ) 2 + X 2 (N t − N ) 2 +2 X (R t − X N t )(N t − N ), yielding (for large T t=1 N t ≈ N T ) Σ 2 R ≡ T t=1 (R t − R ) 2 T ≈ X 2 N 2/α T 2/α−1 + X 2 Σ 2 N (4) with Σ 2 N ≡ T t=1 (N t − N ) 2 T .</formula><p>When the amplitude of fluctuations Σ N is typically less than N 1/α and the ratio Σ N / N 1/α approaches 0 as N gets large, one recovers Equation (3), i.e. Σ R ∼ R 1/α for large N . In contrast, when Σ N exceeds the threshold, i.e. the ratio Σ N / N 1/α goes to infinity as N → ∞, then the recruitment fluctuations are driven by external forces and one obtains</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Σ R ≈ X Σ N , which leads to Σ R / R ≈ Σ N / N .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Increasing the amplitude of fluctuations Σ N should induce a change from the intrinsic or endogenous to the externally driven behavior. When there are several stocks (subsystems with respect to the habitat of the species) for which one observes year-class recruitment, the difference between stocks with smaller and greater mean recruitment comes from the different mean number of spawners. One is interested in how the sample standard deviation changes, across blocks of observations, with the value of the mean annual recruitment to individual stocks. One then calculates the R i and Σ R i (where the superscript i denotes the stock identifier), and compares the couplings across stocks. If the distribution for the normalized variable, ν t = N i t / N i , is identical across stocks, then one has</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Σ N i = Σ ν N i (6) with Σ 2 ν = [Σ 2 N i / N i 2 ] (average across stocks), which gives rise to a linear rela- tionship Σ R i ≈ Σ ν R i . (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>One here sees the scaling exponent b = 1. Note that, since N i 's are large, the transition between the two scaling regimes is sharp; see Equations ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>). When the fluctuations Σ N i of N i 's linearly scale with the mean, the linear-scaling behavior also arises in R i 's among stocks. Then, the two linear function, Σ N of N and Σ R of R , nearly overlie each other; see Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">5</ref>). Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">7</ref>) reflects the central observations in the vast majority rather than rare tail events. Even though the tail exponents of the offspring distributions are stock-specific, the b = 1 behavior can arise among these stocks when the external driving force imposes strong fluctuations in N , provided that the normalized variables N i t / N i are identically distributed (or almost identically distributed on the central part) across stocks.</p><p>2.2.

Therefore, the sample standard deviation of the recruitment distribution goes as Σ R ∝ T 1/α −1/2 , where the endogenous term in Equation ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) is negligible but the magnitude Σ N is significant. Although the model is in equilibrium, the recruitment variability increases with observation time T , implying that, as the number of observations increases, the equilibrium will becomes not more well-defined.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>Exploring stylized facts common to fisheries stocks may provide insights into the recruitment variability in exploited populations. Recruitment time-series across North Atlantic stocks (regardless of species) display fluctuation scaling with universal exponent b = 1. The per-recruit variability in recruitment is close to the per-capita variability in population abundance, and both of these are constant for all stocks. From these facts, it can be deduced that normalized abundances have a universal distribution across stocks, and consequently normalized year-class strengths have a distribution close to the universal distribution. I have observed a collapse of these two distributions of the normalized data, aggregated across 72 stocks, onto each other.</p><p>Under the conjecture of a universal distribution of the normalized abundances across stocks, I have explained these stylized facts on recruitment fluctuations in marine fishes using a simple random-sum model in which the summands are random offspring numbers, and the number of summands (i.e. spawning population size) is also a random process. When the magnitude of the year-to-year fluctuations in the number of spawners is significant, the recruitment mimics the environmental (carrying capacity) fluctuations. Then, one sees the fluctuation scaling in the sums with exponent b = 1.</p><p>The random-sum model sheds new light on models of recruitment distribution. I have proposed to model the recruitment distribution using a Lévy-stable law, a natural candidate deriving from the generalized central limit theorem. The Lévystable model has been shown to provide a better fit to the data than the traditional log-normal model. The Lévy-stable distribution has a power-law regime in the tail, which accounts for occurrence of rare large recruitment events. When aggregated across 72 stocks of North Atlantic fishes, the tail of the recruitment distribution has been found to effectively follow a power law with exponent α ≈ 1.4. The fact that 1 &lt; α &lt; 2 is consistent with patterns of genetic variation found in marine species <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Steinrücken et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Eldon et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Árnason &amp; Halldórsdóttir 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Niwa et al. 2016)</ref>. Population genetics theory allows the inference of the index α from DNA sequences.</p><p>The fluctuations in recruitment of North Atlantic fish stocks are dominated by environmental stochasticity. It has serious consequences for sustaining the capture fisheries sector. In the current paradigm of fisheries management, recruitment variability relative to the mean population abundance N is thought to be lower in stocks with more spawning components <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Myers 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, Oeberst et al. 2009)</ref>. In stark contrast, the observed proportionality between the mean recruitment R and the sample standard deviation Σ R implies that the relative fluctuations Σ R / N do not decay with higher mean abundances. Variation in commercial catches from marine fisheries will have a similar behavior to that of recruitment. Catch timeseries, compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, confirmed this expectation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Niwa 2006a</ref>).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
