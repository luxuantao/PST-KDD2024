A reason for this is that in contrast to classical pharmacology focusing at one target at a time, the transcriptomics profiles provided by CMap and LINCS open the door for systems biology approaches on the pathway and network level.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Recently, there is an increasing interest in the computational analysis of drug perturbation data sets. Such data types are now routinely used to aid our understanding in drug discovery and disease therapeutics <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. With the rapid accumulation of genomics and chemical informatics data in the past decade, several new systematic approaches to drug discovery have been proposed. For example, some study the drug-target structural relationships for specific drugs to discover new targets implicated in diseases, whereas others predict biochemical interactions of small molecules with their respective targets using, e.g. the Connectivity Map (CMap) approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. However, for either type of investigations, machine learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and biomedical text mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> approaches have been vital to uncover hidden relationships between drugs and potential new indications. Overall, applying these methods on drug perturbation data sets has proven to be beneficial in enhancing the understanding of the connection between genes, drugs and diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> because such methodologies can lead to generation of novel hypotheses beyond classical pharmacology by translating new knowledge from genomic in vitro screens and cell-based assays to the patients.</p><p>Computational screening of drugs has been greatly facilitated by the advent of connectivity mapping methods, specifically CMap and the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. CMap and LINCS are comprehensive, large-scale drug perturbation databases containing transcriptomic profiles of dozens of cultivated cell lines treated with thousands of chemical compounds serving as reference databases. That means, these 'big data' resources provide simple yet important platforms to characterize 'signatures' of gene expression changes induced by small molecules. Such drug perturbation signatures have been used to determine connections, similarities or dissimilarities among diseases, drugs, genes and pathways, but we are far from fully understanding their capabilities.</p><p>The purpose of this article is to provide a state-of-the art survey of recent advances in CMap studies and related methods used in drug discovery, as well as reviewing computational tools that have been applied in the field. Furthermore, we discuss examples of applications of these methodologies being currently used both in drug repurposing/repositioning and in drug discovery process. An earlier review of connectivity mapping has been provided by Qu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, neglecting, however, methodological developments. A complementary presentation has been given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> focusing on publicly available resources and databases that can be used for generic genomic investigations of disorders.</p><p>Put simply, the goal of the CMap in genomic drug discovery studies is to identify disease or drug-associated gene signatures that correlate with perturbations on the transcriptomics level as a response to administrated small molecules or drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. It is a common approach used to identify inverse drug-disease relationships by comparing disease molecular features and drug molecular features, such as gene expression. This approach starts by generating a disease gene expression signature by comparing disease samples and normal tissue samples, followed by querying drug-gene expression reference databases. This makes the CMap technique effective and widely popular in drug discovery, posing a primary advantage, as it does not require a detailed mechanism of action (MoA) or prior knowledge of drug targets to work <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. However, CMap comes with some limitations, such as limited drug perturbation data, a limited drug coverage, dosage-dependent conditions and the uncertainty of applying cell lines or animal model expression patterns to human systems. Also, the methodology can be expensive and time-consuming before it can generate a significant portion of all safe dosage conditions for a limited number of cell lines for CMap <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The connectivity mapping methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CMap: the connectivity map</head><p>The connectivity map was introduced by Lamb et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> in 2006. The basic concept of CMap is to use a reference database containing drug-specific gene expression profiles and compare it with a disease-specific gene signature. The CMap method is performed by simply submitting a list of genes thought to be relevant to a particular disease. A researcher is returned a list of drugs having either presumptive efficacy for the disease or, more realistically, whole mechanisms of action that are well known, thereby enhancing biological understanding of the disease. This allows identifying connections between drugs, genes and diseases. The overall goal of CMap is to predict potentially therapeutic drug candidates.</p><p>The principal workflow of CMap is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. A phenotype of interest such as a disease or biological condition is described by a gene expression signature, i.e. a set of genes that uniquely represents the underlying phenotype. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the gene signature corresponds to a list of differentially expressed genes (DEG), named h, that contains up-and downregulated genes as shown Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>.</p><p>The gene signature set is then used to query the CMap catalog of gene expression profiles. The CMap database is a collection of paired gene expression profiles representing a series of structured microarray experiments. All experiments were conducted using a microarray platform (Affymatrix HT_HG_U133A array with 22 283 probesets in addition to HG_U133A with 22 277 probesets) and standardized preprocessing (MAS 5.0). The experiments were carried out in various cell lines to perturbagens (drugs and bioactive small molecules) at varying concentrations and time points against vehicle controls. The initial database (Build 1) contained 455 instances, i.e. treatmentcontrol pairs, where treatment constitutes a selection of 165 drugs, 42 different concentrations, 2 time points and 5 cell lines. The updated version (Build 2) contains 6100 instances with more drugs (1309) and concentration (156) but the same cell lines, for a parallel series of analysis. The instance is the basic unit of data and metadata in CMap. Each instance is uniquely identified by an instance identifier. After preprocessing, the resulting probe-level summaries are subject to further analysis (scaling treatment values to corresponding vehicle controls, thresholding, etc.). The fold change of treatment to control values was calculated for each probeset, sorted into decreasing order and converted to a rank vector, separately for each instance. Thus, the probeset that is most upregulated will receive Rank 1 and the most downregulated will receive 22 283. So, for Build 2, the CMap database is n ¼ 22; 283 Â p ¼ 6100 matrix. The instance rankings are used to compare query lists. It is important to note that while these rankings may be perceived as a crude form of summarization, the absence or sparsity of treatment replication precludes usage of summaries incorporating variation. Hence, for every drug, there is an instance representation in the reference database, corresponding to the treatment and the control condition.</p><p>The gene signature, h, is compared with the ranked probesets of the treatment versus control gene expression profiles that are ranked in descending order according to the fold changes of the probesets. By splitting the gene signature, h, into two lists containing only upregulated genes, h ", and downregulated genes, h #, a so-called connectivity score is estimated via several auxiliary variables using a nonparametric rank-ordered Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, similar to the method introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>The resultant 'connectivity score' is normalized using random permutation described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> by Lamb et. al., assuming values from À1 to þ1 to reflect the closeness or connection between the expression profiles. A positive connectivity score is obtained for having most of the downregulated genes at the top of the reference profile and most of the upregulated genes at the bottom (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). In contrast, a negative connectivity score is obtained for a reversed mapping, meaning that most of the upregulated genes are at the bottom of the reference profile and most of the downregulated genes are at the top <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. A positive correlation denotes the degree of similarity and a negative correlation emphasizes an inverse similarity between a query signature and a reference profile derived from an individual chemical perturbation; thus, implicating the exposure to a particular chemical can mimic or reverse the expression pattern of the biological state of interest. A null connectivity score occurs when the up-and downregulated genes are randomly distributed over the reference profile. See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> for a visualization of the different cases. Overall, the results are obtained as a list of connectivity scores for all small molecules in the reference database, one connectivity score for each small molecule. Finally, the top-scoring drugs are selected by sorting all connectivity scores in descending order and identifying a relevance threshold (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). Unfortunately, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, no measure of statistical significance, via a statistical hypothesis test, has been used formally. In contrast, only a basic approach has been suggested involving a resampling procedure.</p><p>Since the first introduction of the CMap principle and methodology, there have been numerous applications of this approach by many research groups with a particular focus in drug discovery and development. Therefore, the CMap approach can be used as a method of screening chemicals by matching the gene signature of a novel pertubagen against the reference profile <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. The chemicals sharing similar gene expression pattern, similar activities or mechanisms can be retrieved. A highly representative phenotype-specific gene signature set of a given biological state; pathological, genomic perturbations or induced by chemicals is seen as the first step of implementing CMap technique. The signature can be generated through a computational analysis using the genome-wide gene expression profiles. Although there is no precise way of creating optimal gene signatures, the conventional approach is to identify and use the DEG that are statistically significant displaying an association with a given phenotype. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reference drug perturbation databases and data sets</head><p>There are a few valuable databases and data sets containing gene expression response profiles effected by chemical compounds that are publicly available. Hence, these data provide information about the perturbation effects that drugs have on the transcriptomics level of a cell. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, we provide an overview of the most important generic resources. However, we would like to note that there are additional disease-specific resources available, e.g. for cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, that provide also diseaserelevant relationships with drug compounds and targets. Henceforth, we focus on the two largest general purpose drug perturbation data sets CMap and LINCS L1000. The DP14 data set contains GEPs of OCI-LY3 cell line (a human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell line) treated with 14 distinct individual compounds and profiled at 6, 12 and 24 h following compound treatment, all in triplicate. For treatment, two different concentrations of the compounds corresponding to IC20 at 24 h and IC20 at 48 h were used. GEP of DMSO-treated samples and profiled at the three different time points, all in octuplicate were used as control, resulting in 276 GEPs from this data set. DP92 data set contains GEPs of 92 distinct FDA-approved, late-stage experimental and tool compounds in three different B-cell lymphoma cell lines (OCI-LY3, OCI-LY7 and U-2932), profiled at 6, 12 and 24 h following compound treatment. All compounds were treated using IC20 at 24 h concentration. DMSO was used as control media at each of the three time points, resulting in 857 GEPs.</p><p>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ query/acc.cgi?acc¼GSE60408</p><p>GEODB <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> This data set contains GEP of 13 different compounds, obtained from nine independent expression sets obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Each expression set had at least six DMSO controls and six samples for compound treatment. Three of the expression sets were profiled on MCF7 breast cancer cell lines (GSE9936-three compounds, GSE5149 and GSE28662-two compounds), and two on MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast cancer lines (GSE33552-two compounds). The rest of the expression sets were profiled in a B-cell lymphoma cell lines, which are chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient-derived cell lines(GSE14973), K422 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines (GSE7292), lytic-permissive lymphoblastoid cell lines (GSE31447), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patient-derived cell lines (GSE40003) and mantle cell lymphoma cell lines (GSE34602 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CMap</head><p>The CMap database consists of genome-wide transcriptional expression profiles of bioactive compounds from cultured cell lines. In the original CMap study <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the reference database consisted of 564 gene expression profiles generated from exposing five different human cell lines (MCF7, PC3, SKMEL5, HL60 and ssMCF7) with 164 small molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> (Build 1). In Build 2, this has been significantly extended to 1309 approved small molecules applied to the same five human cell lines leading to over 7000 gene expression profiles. Build 1 and Build 2 use an Affymetrix platform for generating the gene expression data. So far, several methods have been developed using the CMap database (either Build 1 or Build 2), either for new drug repositioning/repurposing approaches or for improving the performance of the original CMap method, also in comparison with other data sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Notably, Cheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> presented a systematic approach to quantitatively assess the performance of such methods. Hence, this study can be seen as a benchmark approach to assess any new methodology in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LINCS L1000</head><p>The LINCS supported by the NIH, comprises $5000 genetic perturbagens (e.g. single-gene knockdowns or overexpressions) and $15000 perturbagens induced by chemical compounds (e.g. drugs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. To date, over one million gene expressions have been profiled and collected for this project using the L1000 technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The L1000 platform has been developed at the Broad Institute by the CMap team to facilitate rapid, flexible and high-throughput gene expression profiling at lower costs. Specifically, the L1000 technology measures the expression of only 978 so-called landmark genes, and the expression values for the remaining genes are estimated by a computational model using additional data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. A user-friendly access to the database is provided by the LINCS cloud Web page (http://www.lincscloud.org/l1000/), which is a Web-based application allowing users to browse and query the LINCS database. In a simplified view, the L1000 data can be considered as a 'big matrix' where the rows correspond to 22 268 genes and the columns are the millions of perturbations induced by the small molecules. It is clear that such a large data set presents new challenges to computational systems biologists who aim to analyze and visualize Big Data. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, we provide a brief overview of tools and software developed so far to explore and understand the L1000 database.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CMap variations and extensions</head><p>ssCMap: statistically significant connectivity map New methods of pattern matching algorithm and data normalization were applied using CMap approach to help reduce noise effects, results interpretation and strengthen the methods reliability in generating unproven hypotheses <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. For example, an important method has been introduced by Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, The approach uses connectivity score computation with permutation tests at both treatment instance level and treatment set level that offers a statistical means to control over the possible false connections between the gene signature and the reference profiles. Because the CMap concept uses the entire genomic information of the patients and of the drug, one may view this approach as an attempt at systems treatment. However, it suffers from having many draw backs as mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. In particular, it has no specific reference to the biological functions altered by the disease in question. A top-ranked drug could be misleading for having strong effects on a subset of functions at the expense of altering other functions that are not associated with the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>The ssCMap method introduces a new ranking score using the following steps. First, treatment and control instances are treated similarly, making the effect of the treatment instances to be determined by DEG. Second, the genes that are affected by the treatment instance, that is, genes that are highly differentially expressed, are given more weight. Finally, the up-and downregulated genes are handled equally, in such a way that 2-fold of the up-or downregulation of a gene has the same relevance in constructing the reference profile. The genes are ordered using the absolute value of their log expression ratios (fold change), as the up-and downregulated genes are considered the same. Moreover, the most significant gene will be at the top of the list, while most of the insignificant gene will be at the bottom. This ensures that the genes are ranked by their importance in the reference profile <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Assuming there are in total N genes, the first gene in the list will be assigned a rank N if it is upregulated, or a rank ÀN if it is downregulated. In general, the ith gene in the list will be ranked with ðN À i þ 1Þ for upregulation or ÀðN À i þ 1Þ for downregulation. The ssCMap uses new scoring scheme for representing a query gene signature either with ordered or unordered gene list. The important gene expressed will be assigned a rank m or Àm depending on whether it is up-or downregulated, where m is the number of genes in the gene signature. The connection strength <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> is calculated between reference profile R and gene signature s to measure a connection between reference profile and gene signature.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">CðR; sÞ ¼ X m i¼1 Rðg i Þsðg i Þ:<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Where g i represents the ith gene in the signature, sðg i Þ is its signed rank in the signature and Rðg i Þ is this gene's signed rank in the reference profile (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>). To have maximum connection between reference profile and gene signature, Zhang et al. achieved it by matching m genes and their regulation status in the reference profile and the gene signature in the correct order (for ordered gene signature) as shown in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>. For an unordered gene signature, all the genes in the list have equal weight because there is no particular ordering; therefore, maximum connection strength for unordered is calculated using Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">C 0 max ðN; mÞ ¼ X m i¼1 ðN À i þ 1Þðm À i þ 1Þ:<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">C u max ðN; mÞ ¼ X m i¼1 ðN À i þ 1Þ:<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The overall connectivity score (c) is calculated by dividing the connection strength with the maximum connection strength of a given gene signature and reference profile Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>. The connectivity score ranges from À1 to 1, where 1 indicates a maximum positive connection of gene signature with the reference profile, while À1 indicates a negative connection. To test the connection score, ssCMap uses a simple procedure to test the null hypothesis between the gene signature and the reference profile that is achieved by generating a random gene signature of ordered/unordered list using random selection without replacement with equal probability of either upor downregulation. After generating the signature, ssCMap calculates the connectivity score (c) of each signature as well as the P-value associated with the connectivity score denoted by P.</p><p>Here, c is the connectivity score between a random gene signature and a reference profile. The same procedure is repeated to estimate the sampling distribution of the random signatures. Zhang et al. provide a user-friendly software application for the ssCMap algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ConnectivityScoreðcÞ ¼ CðR; sÞ=C max ðN; mÞ:<label>(4)</label></formula><p>CMapBatch: a meta-analysis of drug response Fortney et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> have recently adapted a parallel CMap approach across multiple gene signatures of a disease, and named the method 'CMapBatch'. Specifically, instead of applying CMap to one individual gene signature, the authors apply it to multiple gene signatures for the same disease and then combine the resulting outcomes. Therefore, their approach is similar to a meta-analysis. It is common for a complex disease to have more than one signature available, and this justifies the application of CMap to multiple gene signatures of a disease. Previously, other groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref> addressed this issue by combining those different gene signatures before applying CMap <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. However, Fortney et al. emphasize that combining gene signatures is problematic for strongly nonoverlapping gene sets. This problem has been addressed by CMapBatch. Formally, for each disease signature, CMapBatch obtains a list of connectivity scores corresponding to all the small molecules (1309 in CMap Build 2) and combines them by using the Rank Product method <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> to assign a consensus ranking on each drug for all the tested gene signatures. The Rank Product method was originally developed to identify DEG for replicated experiments based on the ranking of the individual experiments.

The results reveal that CMapBatch produces indeed a more stable list of drugs when compared with the individual gene signatures. Specifically, the median overlap of the top 50 drugs for 21 individual gene signatures was 22, but for CMapBatch, the overlap was 39 drugs. Furthermore, for a FDR threshold value of 0.01, 247 small molecules have been identified that significantly reverse the gene expression changes of the tested signatures.</p><p>The method was used to further highlight more effective drug candidates inhibiting cancer growth and the results compare favorably with the results of the original CMap. Thus, scaling up transcriptional knowledge increases the hit percentage significantly from 44 to 78% of the top-ranked drugs. Moreover, the resultant drug hits were characterized in silico and showed slow growth significantly in nine lung cancer cell lines from the NCI-60 collection <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. In total, 247 candidate therapeutics were identified for which two genes, CALM1 and PLA2G4A, are found to be markers for drug targets in lung cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>Despite the fact that CMapBatch was only tested for lung cancer, the proposed meta-analysis can be used for any disease phenotype to prioritize therapeutics.</p></div>

One of these is failure to apply a comprehensive measure to validate the significance of a gene signature when queried against reference profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Several studies have focused on improving the original KS statistics used as the 'similarity metric' by CMap.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High-performance computing platforms in CMap</head><p>As a computational and bioinformatics framework, connectivity mapping has been underpinned by the powers of modern computers. Throughout the development of connectivity mapping, particularly CMap and its extensions, intensive permutation tests are required to provide statistical rigor, and the evergrowing expansion of the reference database has required faster processing and/or better software architectures to fulfill such requirements.</p><p>To address these issues related to the computational demands, Zhang and his group developed high-performance computing (HPC) models of connectivity mapping, called cudaMap <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, which uses the computing power offered by the graphics processing units (GPUs) of modern computers; a recent extension is QUADrATiC <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, which is a scalable gene expression connectivity mapping framework for repurposing Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. The framework uses multiple processor cores to achieve high-speed connectivity mapping. Furthermore, concerted efforts have also been made to formulate and standardize the procedures for creating quality gene signatures across multiple data sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> and determining the optimal lengths of query gene signatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</p></div>

However, a remaining challenge is to evaluate methods based on such data sets. Despite the success of various CMap approaches, there are few ways to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the connectivity score for the association between drugs and diseases by computational means. There are two ways to computationally evaluate CMap: first, evaluate drug-drug relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref> and second, evaluate disease-drug relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>In evaluating drug-drug relationship, a drug signature is used to query CMap to retrieve related drugs that have the same ATC codes or chemical structures that are similar as studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. However, in evaluating disease-drug relations, a disease signature is used to query CMap to retrieve known drugs notably in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>Iskar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> were among the first to study a quantitative evaluation of CMap methods to identify similar compounds using an ATC classification. They created labeled benchmark sets using compound chemical similarities and ATC codes. They focused on early retrieval performance where the falsepositive rate (FPR) is &lt;0.1. At these FPRs, their calculated AUCs were significantly different from random.</p><p>Cheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> also used the ATC codes to benchmark the similarity metrics using two different methods: the batch DMSO control and mean-centering normalization. Focusing on early retrieval performance (FPR ¼ 0.1), eXtreme cosine (XCos) method outperforms the original CMap similarity metric based on KS test. It is also robust in terms of drug-drug relationship prediction with compounds that have higher treatment effect on treated cell lines. Therefore, the authors further extended the method for evaluating various CMap similarity metrics with compound profiles that have higher treatment effect.</p><p>However, not all performance evaluations tend to work as pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> because of the following reasons: First, a lack of high-quality disease signatures, as many diseases may not be represented accurately by the reference profiles in the gene signature. Second, the benchmark sets used to represent the drugdisease association might not be comprehensive enough to capture all drug-disease linkages. Finally, the drug cellular profiles are limited to only treating fewer cell lines, which explains why some of the neoplastic disease signatures perform better than nonneoplastic disease signatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applications of CMap in pharmacogenomics</head><p>Since the introduction of Build 1 in 2006, the CMap database and the CMap method have been applied in a large number of pharmacogenomics studies.

This is also called a lead discovery. It aims at establishing an advantageous connection between the administration of a drug and a phenotypic response of the patient.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Connectivity score</head><p>based on partial-rank metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> This extension of the connectivity score was introduced by Segal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. They apply partial-rank metrics and empirical null distributions for scoring CMap queries by accommodating a query order, in contrast to the KS scoring, which uses a rank ordering of gene expression profiles in the target instance to generate an ordering of the query.</p><p>• More effective methods than KS by computing a per experiment score that measures 'closeness' between the signature and the reference profiles.</p><p>• New approaches measuring closeness for the common scenario wherein the query constitutes an ordered list.</p><p>• Advance an alternate inferential approach based on generating empirical null distributions that characterize the scope, and capture dependencies, embodied by the database.</p><p>• Hard to develop effective fitting algorithms for large instances.</p><p>• Number of inferential problems surrounding use of metrics extended to partial rankings, such as reconciling asymptotic distributions.

The results showed how HSF1 levels can predict a response to drugs targeting HSP90 or any possible protein synthesis. Furthermore, their results also justified that the HSF1 level and HSF1-related signatures impact on carcinogenesis during disease progression and found that HSF1 can be used for developing new therapeutic targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Therefore, HSP90 inhibitors are seen as novel targeted therapeutics for patients with high HSF1 levels in tumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>.</p><p>In addition, a similar approach of CMap application has been used to investigate relationships between drugs and microRNAs (miRNAs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. Jiang et al. proposed a novel high-throughput approach to identify the biological links between drugs and miRNAs in 23 different cancers and constructed the Small Molecule-MiRNA Network for each cancer to systematically analyze the properties of their associations. They concluded that most of the miRNA modules comprised miRNAs that had similar target genes and functions or were members of the same miRNA family. The majority of the drug modules involved compounds with similar chemical structures, modes of action or drug interactions. Another common approach is to identify drug-miRNA relationships by comparing disease molecular features and drug molecular features, such as gene expression. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> proposed a novel computational approach to identify associations between small molecules and miRNAs based on functional similarity of DEG. The results show 2265 associations between FDA-approved drugs and diseases, where 35% of the associations have been reported in the literature. Also, 19 potential drugs were identified for breast cancer, in which 12 drugs were reported by previous studies.

The L1000CDS2 method provides prioritization of thousands of small-molecule signatures, and their pairwise combinations, predicted to either mimic or reverse an input signature. It also predicts drug targets for all the small molecules profiled using L1000 assay. To further showcase the usefulness of the approach, they collected expression signatures from human cells infected with Ebola virus at 30, 60 and 120 time points. Querying these signatures against L1000CDS 2 , kenpaullone compound was identified.

It is widely known that many drugs with therapeutic targets in cancer prognosis and diagnosis have been identified using CMap. For example, CMap designated the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin as a potential therapy for dexamethasone-resistant ALL in children. A clinical trial is currently underway for assessing this possible new indication <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>. A similar approach by Li et al. has shown its power in discovering chemicals sharing similar biological mechanisms and chemicals reversing disease states. They used CMap and gene ontology (GO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> modules to partition genes into small biological categories and performed expression pattern comparison within each category <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. The method shows robustness in finding chemicals sharing similar biological effects by using a reduced similarity matrix to measure the biological distances between query and reference profiles.

The method uses drug candidates in a pool of compounds that downregulate the overexpressed genes, or upregulate the underexpressed genes, for a given abnormal phenotypic condition and demonstrate the utility of their approach for drug repositioning. The authors pointed out that the improved functionality of their method will help in identifying a drug or a group of drugs with potential heterogeneous properties. On the other hand, the method can be used to find genes that can be targeted by a set of identified compounds.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drug repurposing</head><p>Generally, drug repurposing refers to investigating drugs that are already used for treating a particular disease to see if they can be safely and effectively used for treating other diseases. The terms repurposing and repositioning are used interchangeably. Owing to the fact that the repurposing of a drug builds on previous research and development efforts, new candidate therapies could be ready for clinical usage more quickly and at reduced costs. Over the past years, many approaches have been developed for the generic drug repurposing; however, in the following, we will focus on investigations that have been using CMap to repurpose drugs and to identify novel targets.</p><p>For instance, Kunkel and his group <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> used CMap to determine ursolic acid, a natural compound that is e.g. present in apples, as a lead compound for reducing fasting-induced muscle atrophy.

This study suggests that calmodulin can be seen as a novel target enhancing neuron regeneration.

Interestingly, they found that a combination of Trolox C and Cytisine is effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but if used separately, neither of the drugs are effective. Similarly, Sirota et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref> integrated a new gene expression database from 100 diseases and 164 drug compounds, yielding predictions for all drug compounds that show a high consistency with already known therapeutics. As a demonstration for a novel prediction, an experimental validation for the antiulcer drug cimetidine was provided as a candidate therapeutics in the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma (LA).</p><p>Malcomson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref> has recently applied computational drug repurposing successfully, as well, by using sscMap to identify candidate drugs that could be used to induce A20 and to normalize the inflammatory response in cystic fibrosis. A20 (TNFAIP3) is a known nuclear factor-kB regulator, which is reduced in airway cells. The authors used a co-expressionbased analysis to create a gene signature consisting of A20 showing high correlation. Then, Malcomson et al. performed a connectivity mapping analysis using the sscMap framework. The identified candidate drugs were subsequently validated in airway epithelial cells, confirming that ikarugamycin and quercetin have anti-inflammatory effects mediated by induction of A20. They used small interfering RNA experiments to illustrate that the anti-inflammatory effect of these two drugs is mainly because of A20 induction.</p></div>

This seems to be particularly appropriate for complex disorders such as cancer, as cancer cells possess compensatory mechanisms to overcome perturbations occurring at the individual signaling pathway level by means of, e.g. mutations of key receptors or cross-talk between pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>.</p><p>For instance, Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref> developed the Combinatorial Drug Assembler as a genomic and bioinformatics system by using gene expression profiling to target multiple signaling pathways for a combinatorial drug discovery. The method performs an expression search against a signaling pathway to compare gene expression profiles of patient samples (or cell lines) as input signature, with the expression patterns of the sample treated with different small molecules. The method then finds the best pattern that matches the combination of two drugs across the input signature related to signaling pathways to detect and predict those drugs that could be used in a combination therapy. Furthermore, they performed in vitro validations for NSCLC and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and found that alsterpaullone and scriptaid as well as irinotecan and semustin for NSCLC, halofantrine and vinblastine for TNBC, showed synergistic effects.</p><p>Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref> proposed a novel systematic computational approach called DrugComboRanker to find synergistic drug combinations and to uncover their MoA. The drug functional framework was built based on genetic profiles and network partitions of various DN clusters using a Bayesian nonnegative matrix factorization. By building disease-specific signaling networks based on disease profiles, drug combinations can be identified by searching drugs whose targets are enriched in the reference signaling module of the disease signaling network. An evaluation of the method was performed for LA and endocrine receptor-positive breast cancer.</p><p>Wang and his group <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> performed a meta-analysis to obtain a list of 343 DEG of LA and used this signature to query CMap to identify a combination of compounds whose treatment reverse the expression direction. Compounds in categories such as HSP90 inhibitor, HDAC inhibitor, PPAR agonist and PI3K inhibitor were identified as top candidates. An in vitro validation demonstrated that either 17-AAG (HSP90 inhibitor) alone or in combination with cisplatin can significantly inhibit LA cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.</p><p>Parkkinen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> showed their proposed probabilistic connectivity mapping method is capable of identifying drug combinations. Specifically, they define a combined drug profile consisting of drug pairs by assessing the correlation of their individual profiles. Overall, this leads to a ranking of drug pairs rather than individual drugs. A computational assessment of the proposed method was conducted considering ATC codes and chemical similarity as ground truth. Their hypothesis was that single drugs with ATC codes having minor response effects will not result in a high relevance score, as other drugs with stronger effects will dominate. However, their statistical analysis demonstrated that a combinatorial matching improves the results for many polypharmacologic drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. The authors highlight how LINCS data set <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> could be used to extend benefits of the group factor analysis-based probabilistic connectivity mapping in drug combination. As it identifies both single or shared responses across a large number of cell types, making it valuable for drug discovery and development would be even possible to impose more structure on the group factor analysis model, by similarly inferring response of a specific cell line to a drug, enabling high relevant information for personalized medicine studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental validations</head><p>Using a computational biology approach in combination with CMap can help in finding new forms of drugs, predicting drug candidates, pharmacological and toxicological properties in chemicals <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref>. However, these predictions need to be evaluated experimentally, either by using cell viability after drug treatment in vitro or tumor growth after drug treatment in vivo and, in some cases, using survival analysis of drug treatment in the clinic. Moreover, disease samples collected from patients are used to investigate the dynamics of disease progression; apart from that, diverse preclinical models, such as cell lines and animal models, could be used in experiments to interpret CMap results, understand disease and validate hypothesis. In this section, we discuss studies that provided such experimental validations.</p><p>Notably, Ishimatsu-Tsuji et al. identified fluphenazine compound as a novel inducer in hair-growth cycle using CMap.</p><p>Moreover, the results showed the additive effect of two compounds that are being ranked by the CMap analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>. Caiment et al. studied the reliability of the CMap method for classifying and predicting a drug in different forms. The study was performed on hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cell model exposed to a wide range of different compounds using ssCMap application. The results of the analysis revealed significant positive connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref>. Moreover, the method showed how the CMap approach is robust in predicting a drug's carcinogenicity based on data from representative in vitro models by adding more relevance for predicting human disease state and may be considered as a classification way of discovering new compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref>. Also, Wang et al. established prediction models for various adverse drug reactions, including severe myocardial and infectious events. Also, they were able to identify drugs with FDA boxed warnings for safety liability effectively. Therefore, it illustrates that a combination of effective computational methods and drug-induced gene expression change can be proven as new cutting edge to have a systematic drug safety evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref>.</p><p>Public data sets can be leveraged to validate drug hits and understand drug mechanisms, e.g. drug efficacy and toxicity. Using in silico drug screening via CMap followed by empirical validations, Cheng et al. discovered that thioridazine can reduce the viability of glioblastoma (GBM) cells and GBM stem cells, induce autophagy and affect the expressions of related proteins in GBM cells. Thus, thioridazine has the potential to treat GBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. In addition, thioridazine induces autophagy and apoptosis at a high concentration, functioning through G protein-coupled receptors.</p><p>Although drugs in these previous examples were validated in preclinical models, the question of whether the disease gene expression was really reversed in disease models remains unknown. A recent study in a mouse model of dyslipidemia found that treatments that restore gene expression patterns to their norm are associated with the successful restoration of physiological markers to their baselines, providing a sound basis to this computational approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PharmacoGx: a computational pharmacogenomics platform</head><p>The availability of large-scale perturbation data sets, such as CMap and LINCS L1000, opened new avenues for research in pharmacogenomics. Nonetheless, issues such as lack of standards for annotation, storage, access and analysis challenge the full exploitation of the pharmacogenomics data sets. Hence, unifying platforms are required to integrate the currently existing data sets and the corresponding mining tools. For data integration purposes, such platforms should remove biases of different sources such as batch effects, difference between profiling platforms and cell-specific differences to best characterize drug-induced effects. Furthermore, the unifying platforms should be easy to use so that users can develop new methods and functions for easy data manipulation and mining within the platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>. To address these issues, PharmacoGx, an open source package, has been recently developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, PharmacoGx is currently the only integrative platform developed for this purpose.</p><p>The PharmacoGx platform comprises two fundamental components: first, efficient data structures to store pharmacological and molecular data and experimental metadata (e.g. molecular profiles of cell lines before and after treatment by compounds) provided by the pharmacogenomics data sets. The storage scheme of PharmacoGx provides a common interface for multiple data sets, standardizes cell line and drug identifiers, and provides easy access to the data. Furthermore, it facilitates easy and side-by-side comparison of the pharmacogemonics data sets that are usually scattered and independently collected.</p><p>The second component of PharmacoGx is its set of functions for data manipulation and mining tasks, such as, removing the biases of data and creating signatures representing druginduced changes in the gene expression of cell lines, implementation of the connectivity mapping analysis and computing the connectivity score to infer links between the drug-induced signatures and phenotypes. Furthermore, it should be noted that such functions are not data set specific. For instance, connectivity mapping analysis can be performed on not only the CMap data set but also the LINCS L1000 and any other drug perturbation data set that will be curated and published in the future. This provides an opportunity to compare the query results from several data sets alongside one another. These features contribute to the uniqueness of the PharmacoGx package.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Connectivity mapping via PharmacoGx: a case study</head><p>We designed an experiment to show that PharmacoGx package enables users to easily query the two state-of-the-art perturbation data sets (i.e. CMap and L1000), and facilitates comparison of the results along each other. For this purpose, we illustrate a case study similar to the phenothiazines example by Lamb et al. in the original CMap publication. L1000 and CMap both contain profiles of five members of phenothiazine antipsychotics (i.e. chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, prochlorperazine, thioridazine and trifluoperazine). We first generated a small L1000 signature set (Supplementary Materials) consisting of 10 unique instances of the family members and 990 randomly selected perturbation signatures from the L1000 data set. The goal of this experiment is to retrieve phenothiazine family members, from the L1000 and CMap data sets, using a query signature generated from the profile of only one of the family members (e.g. trifluoperazine). We used trifluoperazine's signature to generate a query signature by selecting only genes whose expression values are highly affected by the drug (-t-stat-&gt;1). This led to a signature of length 458. Query results have been shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> as two ranked lists. PharmacoGx matched trifluoperazine signature as the most similar to the query signature in both data sets. The other family members have also been retrieved as top hits in both lists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The CMap methodology has been used in numerous applications by many research groups with a particular focus in drug The CMap method uses a simplistic model of pattern matching techniques based on an unproven hypothesis to understand the concept of cell biology in drug discovery. However, there is no account for dynamics associated with the disease or the drug under investigation, multi-organ effects and genetic variations. Therefore, incorporating additional models and data sources will help in understanding the effect of candidate drugs in specific disease settings and appropriate cellular tissue and environmental factors that are more effective in drug discovery/ repurposing applications. Applications are not limited to such disease-oriented querying with, for example, illustrations of CMap generating hypotheses concerning MoA being showcased. While CMap has achieved some notable successes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75]</ref>, pathways and network-based models provide a more realistic system-level insights into the molecular targets of the drug candidates, which is an essential step in drug repurposing/repositioning process and phenotypic-based discovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, some limitations of the CMap approach can be highlighted, for example, experimental replicates, a potential issue with the CMap data (Build 1), as most small molecules have only one replicate per cell line for each experiment. This will present some challenges on statistical analysis, such as finding DEG for small molecules compounds. Another limitation is cell line coverage (the experiment was conducted only using five human cancer cell lines and not all small molecules were tested on all cell lines), the limited dosages and time points (several small molecules were tested using 10 mM concentration with 6 h perturbation time point). Another possible limitation in CMap is the presence of potential batch effect, the similarity of gene expression profiles observed for unrelated stimuli in grown or processed cells at the same time. Batch effects have been identified as a significant source of systematic error that can be corrected <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. Attempts to solve the problem of batch effects have been made in the methods proposed. For example, Iskar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> performed a quantitative evaluation of CMap methods by applying a centered mean approach to normalize the gene expression intensity values in CMap to reduce batch-specific effects. Also, Iorio et al. uses the pairwise druginduced gene expression profile similarity (DIPS) scores between drug pairs in CMap to calculate total enrichment score <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. They used drug compounds with shared ATC classification, and high chemical similarities to discretize true positives in their approach. This is relevant in willingness to sacrifice true positives to keep false positives low. Notably, Cheng et al. used the ATC classification as a benchmark to address batch effects using XCos. The novel XCos approach is used to determine which drug compounds contain robust expression profiles in CMap data, and which analytical approaches are more accurate to use when evaluating CMap data set. Although some of these limitations are derived from the practicality and resource constraints at the time of designing the approach, the caveats associated with such systems abstraction methodology need to be addressed during study design, for example, a proper biological context, relevance of transcriptional changes to disease states, representation of gene signatures to the global expression profile and the overall reliability of the approach. Now with the availability of the LINCS L1000 data set, covering cellular responses upon the treatment of chemical/genetic perturbagen, including over 1.4 million gene expression profiles representing $15; 000 small molecules compounds and $5000 genes (small hairpin RNA and overexpression) in $15 cell lines. Researchers can leverage the publicly available data to overcome some of the CMap shortcomings.</p><p>The LINCS L1000 still lacks quality needed for comprehensive drug discovery/repurposing, which makes it challenging for understanding the data-processing pipeline and lead inferences, mostly because it uses a noisy platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>. The current imputation of the computational inferred genes used by the L1000 in generating the data is also lagging. What is certain is that, the recent methods developed using CMap/LINCS L1000 data have already shown great promises and constantly becoming more appealing to researchers in pharmacogenomics. For more comprehensive understanding of drug MoA, some methodologies incorporating other omics than transcriptomics would be beneficial, including, for instance, methylation array for epigenetic compound such as HDAC inhibitors or 5-AZA-CdR, metabolomics and proteomics, as well as dynamic or longitudinal data, would widen the limited view captured by the single time point of transcriptomic responses. This will give the opportunity to shift drug discovery toward personalized and precision medicine treatment approach to enhance disease therapies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In this article, we reviewed the connectivity mapping methodology and applications. Perturbation databases, such as CMap or LINCS, offer a wealth of opportunities for computational drug discovery approaches by enabling pharmacogenomics that extends beyond classical pharmacology. A reason for this is that these transcriptomic perturbation databases allow network (nonsingle gene centered) approaches, e.g. at the pathway or network level. So far, the majority of applications are focused on different cancer types. However, the principal ideas can be translated to any other type of complex disease opening in this way the door into a new era of drug discoveries. Research in extending connectivity mapping concept and methodology is ongoing, and there are still aspects such as the application of different similarity metrics that need further investigations. Although few variations and improvements over the original CMap have been proposed, the field lacks systematic evaluations of the new approaches. Therefore, advantages and disadvantages of different methods are so far not precisely measurable.</p></div>
