<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Fuzzy sets emerged in 1965 in a paper by Lotfi Zadeh. In 1969 Ruspini published a seminal paper that has become the basis of most fuzzy clustering algorithms. His ideas established the underlying structure for fuzzy partitioning, and also described and exemplified the first algorithm for accomplishing it. Bezdek developed the general case of the fuzzy c-means model in 1973. Many branches of this tree grew from 1969 to 1993.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Krishnapuram and Keller's work on possibilistic clustering. This tree has also developed many branches, and together, these two topics comprise two thirds (of the conceptual field) of soft clustering (the other third belongs to probabilistic clustering in its many guises). Another important class of fuzzy and possibilistic methods, known as generalized clustering, were later developed, based on the idea of stressing the internal nature of clusters rather than solely on metric notions or on the sharing of some significant traits. This article reviews some of the key highlights of fuzzy and possibilistic clustering. This is not a comprehensive survey: that would require an article the size of an encyclopedia and an army of well-informed authors. The best we can do here is to give readers a small glimpse of the overall reach and span of Zadeh's idea in the vast jungle that is fuzzy cluster analysis.</p><p>1. Introduction t his paper briefly reviews the development of a vast array of computational methods, known collectively as fuzzy clustering. Length limits imposed by its format preclude the preparation of even a skimpy survey of this vast field. We aim, rather, to note key early milestones in the development of the technology, together with the description of the underlying ideas, leading to a presentation of the state of the art and of current key problems that need to be addressed to assure its further evolution.</p><p>Why do we classify? Sentient organisms, even those that are very simple, are confronted throughout their existence by a large number of objects in their environment. The variety of living environments is not only due to their size but also their diversity and complexity. This complexity, captured by multiple organism sensors, is formally represented by a potentially large number of object description variables. Dealing with the large number and variety of objects and variables requires the ability to organize them into useful classes that are the basis for simple and complex behaviors. Recent neurological studies strongly suggest that human brains are wired to represent thousands of objects and action categories.</p><p>Furthermore, and of extreme importance to the subject of this paper, the semantic space so represented is continuous <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Grouping objects into categories that share some key feature or variable range is a necessary skill that assures survival of the conscious classifier. Given the wide diversity and complexity of the entities (objects, relations, actions) to be classified it should not be surprising that myriad formal methods have been proposed to summarize entities of interest as a collection of classes sharing common traits. Basic to this process is the notion of indistinguishability, that is, the idea that, for a particular decision making purpose, the individuals in a class need not be differentiated from each other.</p><p>We aim here to discuss the problem of classifying objects on the basis of various notions of similarity, distance, or indistinguishability. Our historical review is focused on classification methods based on the theory of fuzzy sets and related formalisms, such as fuzzy logic and possibility theory. It is important to note that we will not concern ourselves with the construction of classifiers, by means of supervised methods, in situations where the classes are known and are described either through a set of classificatory axioms or, more commonly, through subsets of known examples of each of the known classes. We discuss, instead, methods for unsupervised classification based on application of concepts and ideas from fuzzy-set theory. The description of this latter class as being unsupervised is somewhat misleading and motivated solely by the need to distinguish its techniques from methods where the classes are already known and the task is to devise algorithms that map object descriptions into their classifications. In clustering, the aim is to employ a different type of supervision or guidance-provided by notions of similarity or of trait sharing-to discover classes that may shed light on the structure of the underlying system.</p><p>Even when the objective of the classification is not the emulation of an existing categorization system but, rather, the discovery of a new one, there may be a wide diversity of goals driving the taxonomical purpose. This diversity was noted in the early years of pattern recognition research by authors who remarked on the wide variety of situations that occurred in practice, as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Quite often we aim to discover clusters having elements that are similar to others within the cluster but dissimilar to those outside it. This objective, motivating the majority of early clustering methods, seeks to reduce the complexity of a multivariate dataset by its reduction to a manageable number of clusters, each having members that resemble each other.</p><p>The key idea here is that the ensuing loss of information will not be harmful to the objectives of the exercise in system understanding. This view, seeking to maximize utility-based measures of classificatory value, has also been found to be at the core of important interpretations of the basic notions of fuzzy set and fuzzy logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>A significant conceptual enhancement of the notion of cluster as a set of points that resemble each other while being different from points in other clusters is the consideration of internal cluster structure. A number of generalized clustering methods are based on the notion that clusters should have some form of cohesion that may not be expressible in terms of binary measures of similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. As consideration of general cohesion measures usually leads to complex, intractable, and computational problems, general notions of cohesion are replaced by requirements that the classes resemble structures of interest in a multidimensional Euclidean space <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Beyond partitioning large datasets into subsets of interest, we are many times interested in the relations among the clusters themselves. From this viewpoint, a clustering is not merely a collection of interesting or useful clusters of a sample but, actually, a structure that, as a whole, yields important insights into the system being studied. These structures, comprising not only data subsets but also important relations between them, often allow objects to belong to multiple classes while not requiring every point to belong to a cluster.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Fuzzy Sets and Fuzzy Clustering</head><p>The early development of clustering algorithms was primarily motivated by the desire to formalize and extend the classification structures of biological taxonomy, or systematics. The classification system, differentiating and relating species, was originally formulated by the famous Swedish physician and botanist Linnaeus <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, who provided an enduring hierarchical structure, substantially increasing the understanding of their roles and interactions. This taxonomy, later enhanced and interpreted through the years by evolutionary and genetic knowledge, provided the foundations for early automated methods of numerical classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Aside. Confusion about the difference between computational approaches to clustering and classification abounds in the pattern recognition literature. Today we call the "classes" of Linnaeus a set of clusters. Psychologists and numerical taxonomists still refer to the labeling of finite sets as "classification." Indeed, the Classification Society is devoted almost entirely to what is now called clustering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Object Clustering and Relational Clustering</head><p>The starting point of any clustering effort is a collection of objects and some notion (often implicit) of resemblance intended to help the classifier to tell good versus bad classifications. In many cases resemblance between the objects to be classified is given by means of a binary relation representing distance or dissimilarity. For any pair of objects in the initial collection this relation assigns a nonnegative numerical value indicating, for example, whether two objects are similar (i.e., distance close to zero) and it would be desirable to group them together, or whether they do not resemble each other (i.e., large distance) and thus that it will be a bad idea to put them in the same cluster. In these relational clustering problems the notion of resemblance is, sometimes, given instead by a similarity measure, which may be thought of as a numeric complement of a classical distance function, that is, small distances correspond to high similarities and vice versa.</p><p>In other numerical classification problems the notion of similarity is not explicitly given but, rather, objects are specified as vectors in some representation space-usually a p-dimensional Euclidean space . p 0 In these object clustering problems classificatory insights are often provided by some suitable measure of distance defined in the representation space, thus making the problem-after some initial data processing and reduction-equivalent to a relational clustering problem. In other cases, statistical measures of correlation or assumptions about cluster structure provide more or less explicit classification guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_0"># # = =</formula><p>The type of data usually dictates the style of clustering, but since any feature vector dataset X can be converted to relational data by the simple expedient of defining ( , ) diss o o x x k j k j = using any vector norm, relational clustering is in some sense a bit more general.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Numerical Classification and Fuzzy Sets</head><p>To a large extent, the early development of numerical clustering methods relied on a variety of heuristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> rather than on formal characterizations of the problem with a clear set of assumptions and measurable goals. In the relational clustering problem-then the object of most clustering efforts-the classification goal was usually stated as "partition the set of objects into groups so that all members in the same group are similar while objects in different groups are dissimilar." As Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows for a dataset in , 2 0 this problem as stated, does not have a solution since, in that case, any partition will necessarily put close points in different sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. This essential impossibility demanded the utilization of a richer representation scheme than that provided by classical partitions thus leading to the consideration <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> of a new methodology for the description of vagueness and imprecision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Fuzzy Sets</head><p>Fuzzy sets were introduced by Zadeh <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>  called the degree of belongingness or membership of the point x to the fuzzy set S, measures the amount to which x is a member of S. Values could range from 0 for points not in S to 1 for points said to be in the core of S. We will not discuss the theory of fuzzy sets and related formalisms, such as possibility theory or fuzzy logic, beyond pointing out that it is formally and conceptually different from probability theory. At the formal level, the formulas that define set composition and complement are truth functional, or fully dependent on the degree of belongingness of the arguments, unlike those of probability theory. The formulas proposed by Zadeh for the intersection, union, and complement of fuzzy sets S and T were: These basic equations have been expanded to include a wide variety of extensions of the truth-value tables of the classical set theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. At the conceptual level, the main ideas of the theory are grounded on notions of "proximity to truth" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> rather than by those stemming from the study of the chance of events. Due to its ability to describe classes with imprecise boundaries the concept of fuzzy set strongly suggested utility for the nascent field of pattern recognition as proposed in 1966 by Bellman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">( ) { ( ),<label>( )}, ( ) { ( ), ( )}, ( ) ( ).</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Fuzzy Clustering</head><p>The advent of the concept of fuzzy set provided a richer framework for the specification of the relations between points and clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Rather than conceiving the solution of a clustering problem as the assignment of each data point to one, and only one, cluster, the fuzzy clustering approach regards it as the discovery of a mapping U from the dataset X to the multidimensional cube [ , ] , 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">1 c that is, : { , , } U X x xn 1 7 f = [ , ] : ( ( ), , ( )) u u 0 1 x x x c k k c k 1 7 f for all , , k n 1 x X k !</formula><p># # where c is the (assumed) number of clusters. A point xk fully belonging to the j-th cluster will have ( ) , u 1 x j k = while some points may have positive degrees of belongingness to several clusters. In the initial formulation proposed by Ruspini <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the degrees of belongingness of each point to each cluster were assumed to satisfy the equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">( ) : . u 1 for all x x X i k i c k 1 ! = = / (1)</formula><p>Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) generalizes the relation, initially proposed by Zadeh <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, to define the degrees of membership of any point x X ! to a fuzzy set S and its complement , S r ( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">( ) . 1 x x S S n n + = r</formula><p>Due to its resemblance to the additive law of probabilities, ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) is often called the probabilistic constraint. This expression, together with other uses of probabilistic notation in Ruspini's paper, led some to question whether fuzzy clusters were just a disguise for probability distributions. The intent, however, was quite clear and did not lend itself to easy confusion. The objective was to provide a richer description of the nature of the dataset being classified rather than to discover some underlying random process resulting in its generation. Representation of a point x belonging to a fuzzy set A to the degree 0.5 and to the fuzzy set B to the same degree is intended to indicate that the point lies midway between the cores of A and B, rather than to make a statistical assumption about a hidden aleatory process having equal chances of assigning x to one of two distinct classes A and B. The key conceptual distinction, studied later in detail by Ruspini, when proposing a semantics for fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, lies in the difference between a representation approach that measures the degree to which a statement can be said to be true (e.g., how true is the statement "John is a millionaire" if his assets amount to $999,999) versus a description of the relative number of times that such a statement is found to be true or false when sampling individuals from some space. The latter is, of course, the basis for probability theory, while the former is related to the notion of truthlikeness <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. This view of degrees of membership as descriptors of a continuous space of clustering possibilities results in a framework where problems, such as that illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, which cannot be treated by conventional methods, are now feasible of solution within a richer formal structure that allows objects to belong to multiple clusters to various degrees. Beyond seeking to gain representational ability the introduction of fuzzy clustering also had a practical motivation. The development of formal classification methods, beyond various scope-limited heuristics, strongly suggested the introduction of measures of clustering quality. These degrees of clustering performance were provided by measures , J(U: ) X having as arguments the dataset X being classified and a particular partitioning U. For fixed , X the performance index J(U: )</p><p>X could be employed to compare the relative quality of several partitions. In the relational clustering problems first considered by Ruspini, dependence on the object set X was represented by means of a distance function D defined between pairs of vectors in X or by a related fuzzy similarity function <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Having a performance index naturally leads to the desire to find a U that is not bettered by any other alternative. In a classical framework where points are assigned to one and only one cluster, this problem is typically formulated as a difficult integer optimization problem where solutions must meet constraints have values restricted to be either 0 or 1. In the richer fuzzy extension, however, the optimization problem is a continuous-variable problem tractable using the powerful tools of continuous mathematical analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Early Methods</head><p>The earliest reference to the use of fuzzy sets in numerical pattern recognition was Bellman, Kalaba and Zadeh <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Apparently Bill Wee wrote the first Ph.D. thesis about fuzzy pattern recognition in 1967 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In 1968 Flake and Turner <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> discussed a method for constructing a hierarchy of fuzzy subsets they called clusters. However, the bellwether of fuzzy clustering appeared one year later <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Posed in the context of relational clustering, Ruspini considered the general classification, or data reduction, problem to be equivalent to the determination of a fuzzy partition whose columns map objects in a finite set { , , }</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">X x xn 1 f = into the c-dimensional cube [ , ] ,</formula><p>0 1 c where , c the number of clusters, was assumed to be known, For any object vector xk the k-th column of U (a matrix in the set Mfcn at (4.2)), viz., the column vector<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> ( ) ( ( ), , ( )) ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">u u u x x x k k c k T 1 f =</formula><p>represents the labeling of xk in terms of its memberships to each cluster. In his original paper Ruspini <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> considered several possible characterizations of the grouping problem, all based on the assumption on the availability of a distance function D between pairs of points of X. Among these, the main formulation was based on the utilization of a metric V in the classification space <ref type="bibr">[ , ]</ref> 0 1 c and on the identification of a metric-mapping function F such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">F(D( , )) V( ( ), ( )) x y u x u y = ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>for all ( , ) , x y X X # ! where the label vectors { ( ), u xk } x X k ! satisfy the fuzzy partition condition of Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and where V is a distance in the c-dimensional unit cube. Being a subset of the Euclidean space , p 0 it was natural to select D to be the Euclidean distance in that space. The choice of the function F was, however, more problematic as the distance function D in the object space , X although assumed to have the standard properties of a conventional metric, could have arbitrary values while its counterpart V, defined in a bounded subset of , c 0 was itself bounded. In consideration of this fact, it was assumed that F was a non-decreasing function mapping the nonnegative real line 0 + to itself with ( ) . 0 0 F = After some experimentation F was chosen <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> to be a piecewise linear function of the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">d ( ) ( )/ ; ; , d M D M d D d D 0 F for for M M M # # # $ = '</formula><p>where M is the maximum possible value of V. D 0 M 2 represents a distance beyond which the classifications should be as different as possible. In other words, for ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">D DM $ V-distances in c 0 between classifications should be as close to M 2 = as possible (M 2 =</formula><p>is the maximum Euclidian distance between points in the c-cube which lie in the plane defined by the probabilistic constraint.) As, in general, the multiple constraints of Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">2</ref>) cannot be satisfied for any clustering function, the problem was posed as that of the minimization of the clustering quality index (objective function);</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">; , , , D V D ww u u J U F x x x x M kj k j k j k n j n 1 1 2 = - = = ^^^^^^Ä¥ h h hhh h 6 @ / /</formula><p>where { } wi are weights defining the relative importance of classification for each point xk and where the column vectors in the partition U satisfy the constraints at <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Through suitable choices of the functions F and V performance index optimization could then be treated as a nonlinear programming problem.</p><p>Reliance on parameters assumed to be known beforehand such as the actual (but unknown) number of clusters c has been a continued source of vexation for clustering methods, whether conventional or fuzzy. Many clustering validation methods and associated validity indexes have been advanced to provide insights on the nature of parameters used to define the clustering-quality index or the associated clustering constraints.</p><p>The first validity index for fuzzy clustering methods was also proposed by Ruspini <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This index, based on the notion of entropy, sought to measure the extent to which a proposed classification contained too many clusters by noting that, in those cases, some otherwise compact clusters would be split into several parts with a high number of points belonging partially to more than one cluster. This index is given by the functional:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">, log l og c w u u H U x x k j k j k j c k n 1 1 1 = - - = = ^^e ^Ä¥ h h h o / /</formula><p>where { } wk are the weights of object importance, assumed to be nonnegative numbers satisfying the constraint . w 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">k n k 1 = = /</formula></div>

A similar procedure was discussed by Cox in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The first discussion of J (U, ; ) V X 1 as a clustering criterion is widely credited to Steinhaus <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Lloyd acknowledged that his method apparently appeared in a paper written by Lukaszewicz and Steinhaus <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.

His scheme required one pass through X, was initialized at , c 1 = and required a user-defined threshold T which essentially controlled the size of the clusters grown by the process. In 1967, MacQueen <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> defined sHCM (calling it simply "k-means") and specified a way to process batch data one at a time. This was a slight variant of Sebestyen's approach wherein one pass is made through X without a threshold, but this version required pre-specification of . c In 1973, Duda and Hart <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> presented a "Basic Minimum Squared Error (BMSE)" version of this idea.

Early Relatives and Applications of FCM</head><p>Clusters defined by objective functions almost always take mathematical substance via distances, which induce topological structure on .</p><p>p 0 This often forces the criterion function to unwittingly favor clusters having the basic shape of their metric topology, even when no clusters are present! Generalization of FCM to address this problem has taken three distinct tracks.

This problem was first addressed in a very important paper by Gustafson and Kessel <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, who introduced the idea of allowing the norm-inducing matrix A to vary from cluster to cluster. They let each cluster assume a best-match shape via individual norms { } Ai that adapted to the shapes of individual clusters during AO iteration. Information about the shape of the i-th cluster resides in the eigenstructure of Ai. They recognized that the necessary conditions used by AO to optimize their model were in some ways very similar to the well-known maximum likelihood equations (MLEs) used by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to optimize the Gaussian mixture model (GMM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>). The fundamental importance of Gustafson and Kessel's work was to show the way towards modifications and improvements of the basic FCM model. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> for ways to solve (6) when</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">k i A 2 - in (</formula><formula xml:id="formula_28">x v k i A 2</formula><p>is replaced by non-inner product norms. The second path to generalization is to replace the point prototypes in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">5</ref>) with more general geometric entities. The earliest reference to the explicit use of non-point prototypes in connection with FCM was <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, which contained a primitive method for fitting fuzzy clusters with lines in the plane. The fuzzy c-varieties (FCV) models <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> grew out of this effort, and were the first generalizations of FCM that explicitly used non-point prototypes (specifically, linear varieties) called fuzzy c-Varieties (FCV). Gunderson proposed a way to make FCV adaptive, so that different clusters could be fitted with linear varieties having different dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Coray <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> suggested the use of circular prototypes-that is, shell-like structures. This line of research evolved into a long chain of more and more sophisticated prototypes and AO algorithms: fuzzy c-shells <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>; fuzzy c-spherical shells <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>; fuzzy c-ellipsoidal shells and fuzzy c-quadric shells <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>; shell prototypes corresponding to level sets of any norm <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>; and fuzzy c-regression models <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</p><p>The use of fuzzy clustering for rule-based induction began when Sugeno and Yasakawa used FCM to estimate membership functions in the output space <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. Clustering with the GK algorithm in both input and output spaces was introduced by Babuska and Verbruggen to identify Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems with linear consequents <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Kaymak and Babuska introduced the idea of merging compatible clusters to identify rules that could be combined to simplify the resulting rule base <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. Yoshinara et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> used FCV and Chiu <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> used Yager's mountain method for rule extraction. Setnes showed used supervised clustering for rule extraction in <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Qualitative Object Description</head><p>Another important class of fuzzy clustering methods was introduced in 1999 by Ruspini and Zwir to produce descriptions of complex objects (e.g., time series, large molecules, genetic material) at various levels of detail <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. The generated descriptions were approximate or qualitative, taking advantage of the ability of fuzzy sets to describe objects by their similarity to certain structures deemed to be interesting by domain specialists. For example, a part of a large biomolecule may be described as "cylindrical" or "having a protruding arm." Closely related to the notion of perception introduced by Zadeh in 1999 <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, the objective of these conceptual clustering methods is to produce qualitative object descriptions in forms (e.g., natural language) close to that employed by humans to describe complex objects rather than in terms of structures mainly devised to represent those objects in a computational setting. For example, a molecule as a hierarchy of parts resembling objects of interest as opposed to a matrix of positions of atoms in 3 D. Beyond uncovering parts of interest of a complex object these methods also sought to relate these parts, each corresponding to a generalized cluster, through predefined interesting relations (e.g., proximity, containment, relative spatial position). The proposed methodology was based on the definition of interesting objects and inter-object relations by general fuzzy models enabling comparison between the degree of matching of a portion of the object being described to paradigmatic model examples. Multi-objective evolutionary computation methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> were employed to extract clusters, which could be overlapping, and relations between them. The methodology and its many variations have been successfully applied to problems ranging from gene description <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, gene regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, ontology-based gene annotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, and neuropsychiatry <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Possibilistic c-Means and its Relatives</head><p>Despite the successes of various families of FCM algorithms, there was a continuing desire to eliminate the "sum to one" constraints (Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)) on the memberships of a vector to all of the clusters needed for optimization of . J (U, ; )</p><p>V X m This column constraint prevented the FCM models from signifying that an outlier should have very low membership in all c clusters; or that a vector might deserve high membership in more than one cluster. In other words, the FCM model spreads the degree of belongingness across the clusters better than HCM does, but still does not provide for the possibility of high membership in multiple clusters or low membership in all clusters. Crisp approaches have no choice but to assign anomalies into an individual cluster and fuzzy algorithms can at best force their memberships close to / . c 1 If the number of points being clustered is not huge, this can result in noticeable changes in the cluster prototypes. True outliers can drastically affect the performance of those algorithms.</p><p>An early attempt to ameliorate the outlier problem within the FCM framework was to include a noise cluster <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. In this algorithm all points are considered equidistant from an amorphous noise cluster, and this heuristic distance was large compared with the distances of the "good" points to cluster prototypes. Therefore, noise/outlier points were attracted to the noise cluster. The membership values were still constrained as with FCM, and produce asymmetric cluster membership functions. However, some researchers felt that using this forced constraint did not properly exemplify Zadeh's notion of a cluster being a fuzzy subset of X. Krishnapuram and Keller <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> introduced the idea of relaxing this constraint by adding a second term to ( ) J U, ; , V X m h (the rightmost term in equation ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>)) that encourages high memberships, thereby relaxing the FCM constraint without forcing memberships to zero. This idea was inspired by noting how a Hopfield Neural Network could be "tricked" into tackling the traveling salesman problem by augmenting its energy function with terms that were minimized when the natural traveling salesman's constraints were enforced.</p><p>Nothing about PCM is possibilistic in the true sense of possibility theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. Krishnapuram and Keller chose possibilistic c-means to distinguish it from the sum-to-one fuzzy partitions of FCM. The proof of the fundamental PCM theorem given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> mirrors that of the FCM theorem except that the zero distance case is unnecessary. The PCM theorem effectively decouples each cluster when computing membership values; hence they create a natural symmetry in membership. The values { } uik for possibilistic c-partitions generated by PCM (equation (4a)) are called typicalities since they measure how typical a particular input point is to each cluster, i.e., how close the point is to each cluster prototype. Unlike FCM, typicality membership functions are symmetric around each cluster prototype. To take advantage of both FCM memberships and PCM typicalities, some researchers have fused the FCM and PCM objective functions into a single hybrid model that produces both memberships and typicalities simultaneously. Pal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> is an example of a fuzzy possibilistic c-means algorithm.</p><p>Since all clusters are decoupled in the PCM formulation, the cluster centers have the freedom to seek out dense regions of feature space, and so, the PCM algorithm is actually a mode seeking technique. This can be either good news or bad news. Barni et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> pointed out that PCM can find co-incident clusters because there is nothing to stop two cluster centers from moving into the same dense cloud. They had a dataset where they expected c clusters (actually, they had c class labels). Using m 2 = and their initialization, PCM terminated at a number of distinct clusters less than .</p><p>c Krishnapuram and Keller subsequently <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref> argued that while there might be c class labels, the features extracted for clustering might not support that many clusters, particularly using Euclidean distance. They pointed out that the fuzzifier ( ) m in equation ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) plays an important role in determining values of the typicality matrix. Unlike FCM, where most users pick m 2 = for simplicity, PCM is more sensitive to this choice. They suggested that, as a heuristic rule, m should be chosen less than 2 for best performance. In an attempt to ameliorate the "m problem", they suggested an alternate formulation of the criterion function that eliminates .</p><p>m The necessary condition for the cluster centers remains the same, but this approach provides a different sequence of values for U and V heading towards a possible minimum of the modified objective function.</p><p>Other formulations of the criterion function for PCM have been proposed, along with their resulting optimization conditions. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, convergence of FCM and several of its derivatives, including some versions of PCM, was studied. A generalized formulation of PCM was reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. Zhou et al. established convergence properties equivalent to those for FCM for three generalized versions of PCM in <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>. Recently a "sparse" version of PCM appeared <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>, along with its convergence theory.</p><p>In the PCM algorithm, the parameters { } i h in ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) have a significant influence on the final partition matrix; they determine the distance from the cluster center at which the membership crosses 0.5 ("the 3db point"). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref> Krishnapuram and Keller gave two recommendations for choosing the { } i h based on an initialization using FCM for a few iterations to get a reasonable starting partition. One form is simply the weighted average of all the distances of the input vectors to the i-th cluster center; the second choice computes the average distance of "good" i-th cluster points, that is, points that belong to ana level cut of the cluster. Of course, now you have to decide what level cut to use, but it does add flexibility. For data sets where there might be more noise, the estimates can be done at the end of each iteration of the PCM algorithm. In the case of very noisy data, running FCM may not (probably won't) result in good starting points for PCM.</p><p>Because PCM tends to search for dense regions of feature space it can have the property that more than one cluster center, and hence the clusters themselves, end up being identical. While this has been cited as a bad property by some, it can be a good trait in situations where the exact number of clusters is unknown. A larger number of clusters than "expected" can be specified as the initial value for , c and then identical clusters can be pruned if they arise. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>, Yang and Lai propose to exploit this idea by having all points initially serve as cluster centers and then constructing an automatic merging PCM (AM-PCM). AM-PCM is a deterministic algorithm once the parameters are set, and so the key is to study the parameter setting.</p><p>The fact that all points (or some gridding of feature space) are used as initial cluster centers is a major issue in scaling up this algorithm to large datasets and/or high dimensionality.</p><p>The original PCM is quite robust in identifying outliers, a challenge to AM-PCM, whereas that algorithm tends to produce superior soft partitions for clean data. In fact, this duality was exploited in an initialization scheme for streaming clustering, i.e., situations where the data comes in sequentially over time. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>, after collecting vectors for some preliminary time, PCM with c chosen larger than the expected number of starting clusters was run essentially to identify outliers in this early grouping. Co-incident clusters were no problem here. Then, with the outliers tagged, AM-PCM was run to get a good initial partition. A Gaussian Mixture Model was used and updated as each new point arrived, logging anomalies. PCM was applied to the anomaly list to check for the emergence of new clusters. This approach was extended to utilize an incremental validity measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref> that actually serves as a means to understand what the clustering process is actually doing.</p><p>PCM decouples the search for clusters into a parallel hunt, so it is one of the few approaches that can look for just one cluster at a time. This first came up when Professor Zadeh called Keller and posed the challenge "Jim, how do you define a cluster?" His own answer was that if you want to say whether a bunch of points form a cluster (whatever that really means), you have to use memberships. That challenge inspired the work reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> that used P1M with varying values of h to construct a membership function for The idea that PCM can look for one cluster at a time formed the basis of a sequential version of P1M <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref> to attack the regular clustering problem, with the second paper addressing that nagging question of how to "pick h ".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Models and Algorithms for Relational Data</head><p>All of the methods discussed in previous sections can be couched in terms of relational data via the expedient of converting X to D, i.e., ( , ) . o o D x x diss i j ij i j = = -However, many applications provide relational data directly.

Tamura et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref> gave a different method that is at worst ( ) log O n n 3 and at best . ( ) O n 3 Kandel and Yelowitz discussed a fuzzy version of Warshall's algorithm for computing the transitive closure <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>. Dunn <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> gave an ( ) O n 2 algorithm for constructing the max-min transitive closure of a symmetric, reflexive fuzzy relation. Miyamoto proved the equivalence between the partitions generated by four different fuzzy relational algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>. These graph-theoretic methods have been particularly effective in information retrieval, where they were used, for example, to construct fuzzy thesauri <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref> for a different decompositional method of fuzzy relational clustering based on convex decompositions of fuzzy partitions.</p><p>There are also a number of models and algorithms which generate a fuzzy partition from relational data based on minimization of an objective function. The first method of this type has already been discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Roubens developed an early method called fuzzy non-metric (FNM) clustering in <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>. Windham presented a generalized method called assignmentprototypes (AP) clustering in <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>. The reformulation theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>, which eliminates V from (6a) instead of U, was used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref> to define and analyze relational duals of the FCM objective functions called relational fuzzy c-means (RFCM). AP and FNM require one less assumption on the relational data than RFCM. Thus, the AP and FNM models have a wider reach in applications than RFCM. A relational version of PCM is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we would be remiss in our obligations to the fuzzy clustering community without mentioning some of the exciting new areas that have arisen in the 21st Century. We don't have space to provide even cursory reviews, but we want to acknowledge ongoing efforts in these new areas, all of which evolved from Zadeh's ideas about fuzzy sets.
