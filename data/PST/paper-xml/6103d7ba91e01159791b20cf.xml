<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Social biases with respect to demographics (e.g., gender, age, race) in datasets are often encoded in the large pre-trained language models trained on them. Prior works have largely focused on mitigating biases in context-free representations, with recent shift to contextual ones. While this is useful for several word and sentence-level classification tasks, mitigating biases in only the representations may not suffice to use these models for language generation tasks, such as auto-completion, summarization, or dialogue generation. In this paper, we propose an approach to mitigate social biases in BERT, a large pre-trained contextual language model, and show its effectiveness in fill-in-the-blank sentence completion and summarization tasks. In addition to mitigating biases in BERT, which in general acts as an encoder, we propose lexical co-occurrence-based bias penalization in the decoder units in generation frameworks, and show bias mitigation in summarization. Finally, our approach results in better debiasing of BERT-based representations compared to post training bias mitigation, thus illustrating the efficacy of our approach to not just mitigate biases in representations, but also generate text with reduced biases.</p></div>

First, we introduce bias mitigation during model training of BERT, by further pre-training it on a small dataset, compared to those used for initial pre-training, using bias mitigation losses in addition to the masked language modelling (MLM) objective <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref>. The bias mitigation losses include (a) an equalizing loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Qian et al., 2019)</ref> to equalize the associations of words with different groups of a given demographic, and (b) a novel declustering loss that we propose to further decluster the various clusters of words that may be indicative of certain kind of implicit bias with respect to the demographic <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gonen and Goldberg, 2019)</ref>. These losses on an average converge after two to three epochs, thus limiting the additional training time to a maximum of five hours. We refer to the resulting BERT model as DEBIASBERT. Second, we propose bias mitigation in the language decoding stage, in addition to that during the language modelling and encoding stages; we focus on the task of summarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Liu and Lapata, 2019)</ref> in this paper, and this can be extended to other generation tasks such as question answering, paraphrasing, etc.</p><p>This paper makes four main contributions.</p><p>(1) This is the first known work to (a) address bias mitigation during the training of pre-trained contextual language models (BERT), and (b) handle implicit biases that may not be captured by explicit measures, using loss functions and further pretraining of BERT.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows an overview of our approach. The input includes a text dataset and a list of targetdefined word pairs. In this paper, we study gender and race as the target demographics, and consider two demographic groups in each-male and female for gender, and African American and Caucasian for race-with respect to which biases are mitigated. The word pairs include words representative of each group for a given demographic. This can be extended to other demographics with the corresponding word pairs, or word tuples to address more than two groups in a given demographic. We consider BERT, a Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref>-based language model trained on very large text corpora. Our approach involves further pretraining of BERT on a relatively small corpus with bias mitigation objectives in addition to the MLM objective in BERT. We refer to the resulting language model as DEBIASBERT.</p><p>We show the effectiveness of DEBIASBERT in (a) the resulting associations between contextual representations, (b) fill-in-the-blank sentence completion, and (c) abstractive text summarization. For (c), we use DEBIASBERT as encoder, and a Transformerbased decoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Liu and Lapata, 2019)</ref> in which we further propose another bias penalization loss. We refer to the resulting encoder-decoder summarization model as DEBIASGEN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">DEBIASBERT</head><p>As shown on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, our method takes a pretrained language model (BERT) and further pretrains it on the given dataset, while mitigating the existing social biases using the demographic word pairs. The approach consists of two stages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Equalizing</head><p>First, our model attempts to "equalize" the associations of every neutral word in the vocabulary with male and female-defined words for gender, or African American and Caucasian-defined words for race <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Qian et al., 2019)</ref>. Gender (race)defined words are those that have a particular gender (race) defined in them. Gender-defined word pairs include (she, he), (woman, man), and (girl, boy). Race-defined pairs include (Black, Caucasian) and (Africa, America). we use 65 genderdefined <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bolukbasi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Karve et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bordia and Bowman, 2019)</ref> and 6 race-defined word pairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Manzini et al., 2019)</ref>. Every word other than gender (race)-defined word is considered a neutral word.</p><p>Given an input sequence, BERT randomly masks 15% of the tokens, and learns to predict the masked tokens based on bidirectional context. In addition to the cross-entropy loss to predict the masked tokens, we include equalizing loss with respect to the given demographic <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Qian et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">EqLoss = ? 1 k k i=1 | log( P ([groupA i ]) P ([groupB i ]) ) | (1)</formula><p>? ? 0 is the equalizing weight, k the number of gender (race)-defined word pairs, and groupA and groupB consist of definition words for the two groups (female and male for gender; African American and Caucasian for race). The goal is to equalize the associations of neutral words with respect to the definition word pairs, which in turn is considered as an approximation to equalizing the associations with the respective groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Declustering</head><p>Even after equalizing, we notice certain "implicit clusters" that form among words, that stereotypically associate to one of the given groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gonen and Goldberg, 2019)</ref>. For example, words such as delicate and prot?g? are essentially gender-neutral, but in practice have strong gender associations, which reflect on or are reflected by their neighboring words. In the case of gender, words such as del-icate, pink, beautiful, nurse and receptionist cluster together. Similarly, words such as entrepreneurs, prot?g?, aspiring, arrogant and bodyguard cluster together. Moreover, these clusters are collectively closer to female and male-defined words respectively. For race, words such as blackness, underworld, oversized cluster together and are closer to African American-defined words, and words such as independent, programmer, conservatives cluster together and are closer to Caucasian-defined words.</p><p>We obtain the representations of these words using the sum of the last four layers of the representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref> of their occurrences in the Brown corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kucera and Francis, 1967)</ref>. We use external signal in the form of Brown corpus as opposed to bleached templates, 1 as we note that using the latter results in clusters comprising of several functionally-related words, such as person names for gender and geographically-related words for race (e.g., greenland, alaska for Caucasian), than semantically-related ones. We choose Brown corpus for the external signal as it is built using rough estimates of the ratio of genre styles a normal human is exposed to daily <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fine et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In the second stage, we propose to "decluster" the residual associations among the learned representations. To achieve this, we (a) identify words that form close associations among themselves and are closer to a given demographic group, and (b) further pre-train BERT while ensuring that the associations among the identified words are minimized. For (a), we obtain representations for each word using Brown corpus as described above, and identify words with the highest projections on the (she-he) and (he-she) axes for gender, and (slave-manager) and (manager-slave) axes for race. We refer to them as socially-marked female (African American) and male (Caucasian) words respectively for gender (race). We choose the word pair (slave, manager) as an approximation for (Black, Caucasian) from <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Manzini et al., 2019)</ref>, as we observe that using the latter pair again results in the highestprojection words on (Caucasian-Black) axis being those that are functionally-similar to Caucasian.</p><p>The proposed loss function for declustering is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">DeclustLoss = ? | log( |A| i=1 P ([social groupAi]) |B| i=1 P ([social groupBi]) ) | (2)</formula><p>|A| and |B| are the numbers of socially-marked 1 Bleached templates are those that do not convey any information other than the given word; e.g., for Caucasian, they include This is a Caucasian, That is a Caucasian, etc. words for groups A and B respectively (female and male for gender, African American and Caucasian for race). The goal is to decluster the implicit clusters, i.e., for any given word, the percentage of socially-marked neighbors of group A and group B should be more or less equal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">DEBIASGEN</head><p>In this work, we view biases in summarization as any potential implications of offending different demographic groups based on the language choice to summarize an input article. Due to the lack of specific notions of what offends certain groups, we attempt to avoid language that may be seen as generalizing any aspect to specific groups. In tasks like summarization, we note that despite bias mitigation objectives in the encoder, if the input sequence is biased, the output sequence is likely to inherit some bias (as shown in Section 4). Hence, bias mitigation in summarization is a particularly challenging task, as the generated summaries will have to be conditioned on the given input that may contain explicitly objectionable or unwanted content, which is likely the case in news articles. With DEBIAS-BERT as the encoder, we fine-tune a Transformerbased decoder on a given corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Liu and Lapata, 2019)</ref> for summarization. Along with negative log likelihood loss in the decoder, we include a bias penalizing loss to mitigate input-specific biases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BiasP enalizingLoss = |W |</head><p>i=1 (e b i ? P (W i )), (3) where W is the set of all adjectives and adverbs in the vocabulary, b i is the bias score of word W i , and</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P (W i ) is the probability of W i .

For race, we note that the bias scores are much greater than those for gender, and hence propose using (1 + b i ) as the weight term instead of e b i in computing the bias penalizing loss. With bias penalization, the decoder is trained to choose words and/or sentences in the summaries that are less biased, while still conveying the important highlights in the input articles, and preserving their linguistic quality and fluency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>To obtain DEBIASBERT, we further pre-train BERT on a given dataset, that is much smaller in size than the Wikipedia and Book Corpus <ref type="bibr">(Zhu et al., 2015)</ref> datasets, with MLM and equalizing losses first (EQUALIZEBERT), and then with MLM, equalizing, and declustering losses (DEBIASBERT). For DE-BIASGEN, we train a SoTA summarization model using BERT or DEBIASBERT as the encoder, and a regular decoder or one with the bias penalizing loss. For the summarization experiments, we use the framework in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Liu and Lapata, 2019)</ref>, with a 6-layered Transformer decoder that is trained from the scratch with a much higher learning rate in comparison to that of the encoder. Datasets. We use three datasets to further pre-train BERT: (i) CNN/ DailyMail news articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hermann et al., 2015)</ref>, (ii) WikiText-103 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Merity et al., 2016)</ref> that contains articles extracted from Wikipedia, and (iii) Brown corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kucera and Francis, 1967)</ref> containing stories from 15 genres including politics, sports, etc. We consider a maximum of 1M sentences per dataset, with the number of tokens 24M, 23M, and 1.2M respectively, and an average of 22 tokens per sentence. 2 We use CNN/DM and XSum <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Narayan et al., 2018)</ref> datasets for summarization, with the same splits as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Narayan et al., 2018)</ref>. Further details are provided in Appendix A. Implementation Details. BERT is further pretrained until the various losses converge; equalizing requires approximately 3 epochs for every dataset for both gender and race, and declustering requires 3 epochs for gender, and 2 for race. The ? values used as weights for equalizing and declustering losses are chosen based on SEAT scores (described below) obtained using a set of SEAT templates as validation. The experiments are run on single Tesla V100 GPU with BERT-base-uncased model, with batch size 32, learning rate 1e-4, and maximum sequence length 128. Each training experiment takes approximately 5 hours. For DEBIASGEN training, we use default parameters for abstractive summarization as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Liu and Lapata, 2019)</ref>, with ? = 1 for bias penalizing loss in the decoder. Further details are provided in Appendix A. Evaluation Metrics. To evaluate language modelling bias mitigation, we use the SEAT score <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(May et al., 2019)</ref>, which measures the associations between contextual representations of two sets of target concepts (e.g., family and career) and two sets 2 We randomly sample 1M sentences from CNN/DM. of attributes (e.g., male and female). To obtain contextual representations of the target and attribute words, we use the templates and code from <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Liang et al.

To measure the bias in generated summaries, we propose Constrained Co-Occurrence (CCO) score, a variant of Co-Occurrence bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Qian et al., 2019)</ref>, that estimates bias in given text by comparing co-occurrences of neutral words in it with definition words.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">CCO(text) = 1 N w?N | log( a?A c(w,a) b?B c(w,b)) | (5)</formula><p>N is the set of adjectives and adverbs in text, A and B are the gender (race)-defined words (female and male for gender; African American and Caucasian for race), and c(w, d) is the number of cooccurrences of word w with words of dimension d in its context (window size 10).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">DEBIASBERT</head><p>Representations. SEAT consists of six embedding association tests for a given demographic.  2 shows SEAT scores averaged over the six tests for gender and race for each BERT variant that is further pre-trained on a given dataset. In the case of gender, DEBIASBERT trained on either CNN/DM (0.1) or Brown (0.172) results in reduced SEAT score compared to that of BERT (0.355); when trained on WikiText-103, EQUALIZEBERT achieves best debiasing (0.173). Further, the best SEAT scores for BERT variant trained on each dataset (0.1, 0.173, 0.172) are lower than the SEAT of SENT-DEBIAS, the post-processing bias mitigation of BERT by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Liang et al. (2020)</ref>, which is 0.256.</p><p>For race, EQUALIZEBERT achieves least SEAT scores when trained on WikiText-103 (0.132) and Brown (0.222) datasets, and both EQUALIZEBERT and DEBIASBERT result in an increase in SEAT when trained on CNN/DM. We believe this may be due to two reasons. (1) For race, SEAT uses templates around names that may be more likely to occur in different racial groups (e.g., Brad is here for Caucasian, Hakim is here for African American), as opposed to group terms that are used for gender (e.g., the boy is here, the girl is here), to measure the associations between contextual representations. We believe using names to represent ethnic groups may be superficial and may not effectively capture racial biases and profound world stereotypes in representations, and this calls for a more effective method to measure racial biases. (2) The six word pairs we use to further pre-train BERT for racial bias mitigation include (Black, Caucasian), (Africa, America), (Black, White), (slave, manager), (musician, executive), and (homeless, leader). We believe that while using pre-defined word pairs has been successful in mitigating gender biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bolukbasi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Qian et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Liang et al., 2020)</ref> perhaps due to the perceived binary nature of gender, 4 it is not straightforward to use such pairs 4 We acknowledge the rich communities that form other or tuples for other demographics such as race, occupations, age groups, etc., as these dimensions are often of more diversity than gender, and there are not many word-level indications that can represent or define a specific racial group, other than those that directly mention the group itself. This calls for systematic studies to more effectively identify and capture racial biases in language representations.</p><p>We also compute the SEAT scores of the DEBI-ASBERT variants trained for racial bias mitigation on gender, and vice-versa. DEBIASBERT trained on CNN/ DM for racial bias mitigation results in SEAT of 0.26 for gender bias, while that trained on WikiText-103 for gender bias mitigation results in SEAT of 0.2 for racial bias. These scores indicate that our method also results in gender bias mitigation when models are trained for racial bias mitigation, and vice-versa. Sentence Completion. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows sentence completions for a few templates using BERT and the best DEBIASBERT variants for gender and race, with respect to male and female groups for gender, and Caucasian and African American groups for race. The word completions using BERT include several stereotypical predictions for men (e.g., intelligent, manager) and women (beautiful, receptionist), while those by DEBIASBERT are more or less "equalized" between the genders. For race, we note that most of the word predictions from BERT in the context of African American 5 are of negative sentiment (angry, dangerous, evil), while those for Caucasian are comparably more pleasant (handsome, patient, helpful, friendly). Human Evaluation. We conduct human evaluations on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). We use groups of gender. Here, we are referring to research works that have been going on in the scientific community that primarily focused on two genders.</p><p>5 'Black' is used for 'African American' here, as this is a term colloquially and very frequently used in the datasets. 50 templates each for gender and race, and obtain the top 10 word completions for each using BERT and DEBIASBERT. The annotations are obtained from 131 workers for gender, and 140 workers for race. All the workers are of the United States (US) background. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">6</ref> The workers are instructed to label the word completions from BERT and DEBI-ASBERT in terms of their ideas of biases against the groups. The templates used are provided in Appendix B.</p><p>For gender, 28% word completions using BERT are marked as biased against female, 2% against male, and 8% against both. Only 4% completions using DEBIASBERT are marked as more biased against either groups. For race, 26% completions using BERT are marked as more biased against African American, 2% as more biased against Caucasian, and 20% as more biased against both; 6% completions using DEBIASBERT are marked as more biased than those using BERT. The inter-rater reliability, as measured by Krippendorff's alpha <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Krippendorff, 1970)</ref>, for gender is 0.279, and that for race is 0.355, indicating a decent agreement among the workers particularly in subjective tasks such as bias identification, and comparable to those in other subjective tasks such as judging humor <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hossain et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Garimella et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>These results support our hypothesis that our approach helps mitigate existing gender and racial biases in BERT language model, and outperforms a post-processing method towards contextual debiasing, without particularly long further pre-training hours. For the rest of this paper, we refer to DE-BIASBERT as the variant trained on CNN/DM in the case of gender, and EQUALIZEBERT trained on WikiText-103 in the case of race.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">DEBIASGEN</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> shows summarization results on CNN/DM and XSum datasets for gender and race, with or without bias mitigation in encoder and decoder. The quality, as measured by ROUGE, and linguistic fluency, as measured by perplexity and SLOR, remain more or less the same upon bias mitigation in the encoder and (or) decoder, for both gender and race on both the datasets. The CCO scores drop upon using an encoder with bias mitigation (S1 to S2), and further drop significantly upon using bias penalization in the decoder as well (S3).</p><p>Thus DEBIASBERT, along with bias penalizing in the decoder, helps generate summaries with bias mitigation, while maintaining quality and fluency. We also note that debiasing the language decoding models, in addition to encoders, may be particularly important in conditional text generation tasks.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">5</ref> shows a few summaries generated with and without bias mitigation in the encoder and decoder models. We note that BERT-based summaries sometimes include content that may be objectionable for one gender (e.g., women also received a 'standard' 40 lashes), or mentions of racial origin of one group (Somali-American men). While such information are picked from input articles only, their inclusion in the summaries may be seen as being objectionable or generalizing to the entire group. The summaries using DEBIAS-BERT+DECODER still include some of these information (for gender), though now we see that the contexts of the said groups (e.g., women) are not included. The summaries obtained from DEBIASGEN convey the necessary information, while avoiding any mention that may offend different groups. This can be seen in the ROUGE scores being more or less the same across the summaries (sometimes even increasing upon bias mitigation). Human Evaluation. We conduct a survey on the resulting summaries for racial bias on AMT. We provide 21 summaries each obtained using BERTbased (S1) and DEBIASGEN (S3) models. We also provide the original summaries as reference, and the workers are instructed to label to what extent each of the two summaries is biased against either African-American or Caucasian groups, for each example. The annotations are obtained from 82 workers, all from US background. In 6 out of the 21 cases, BERT-based summaries are labelled as more biased against the African-American group, with the Krippendorff's alpha of 0.15. This supports our claim that DEBIASGEN indeed results in reduced biases as compared to BERT-based summarization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Limitations and Future Work</head><p>First, the methods used to mitigate gender biases may not readily extend to other demographics due to their greater diversity and lack of straightforward words to represent this diversity beyond the mentions of the groups themselves (e.g., Asian, African, Caucasian). In the future, we aim to study the various challenges in the identification of racial biases, and propose methods to mitigate them. Second, we The six men are accused of conspiracy to provide material support and attempting to travel to Syria to join the Islamic state group. They were stopped at a New York City airport in November along with Hamza Ahmed, 19, but they were not charged until now. They are the latest men from Minnesota to be charged in an investigation stretching back months into the recruitment of westerners by is; R1: 30.57 R1: 9.03; RL: 28.83 DEBIASGEN Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, and Adnan Abdihamid Farah, both 19, and their four co-accused have been described as close friends who met secretly to plan their travels. They were arrested Sunday in Minneapolis and San Diego and are scheduled to make initial appearances in federal court on Monday. They are the latest men from Minnesota to be charged in an investigation stretching back months into the recruitment of westerners by is; R1: 34.22; R2: 14.71; RL: 31.20</p><p>Table <ref type="table">5</ref>: Bias mitigation in abstractive summaries for gender (top) and race (bottom).</p><p>note that there is in general a greater association between certain neutral and demographic-defined words, such as dress to women, and beard to men, that exist not due to any social biases or stereotypes, and hence are to be preserved. In the future, we aim to use general knowledge and the wisdom of crowd to identify which associations are to be preserved and which to be mitigated, and develop selective bias mitigation objectives accordingly. Third, the SEAT measure can only predict the presence of a given type of bias, and not the absence of any potential bias in language models <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gonen and Goldberg, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Liang et al., 2020)</ref>; while we attempted to address residual clustering of certain words even upon equalizing in this work, in the future, we aim to work towards devising methods to understand and detect more implicit biases in language models.</p><p>Fourth, in the future, we aim to use representational similarities and world knowledge to devise more effective bias mitigation strategies for language generation models, as bias mitigation using word-based co-occurrences (as used in summarization) may sometimes lead to redundant bias mitigation. Finally, most works on debiasing, including ours, rely on the availability of word pairs representating different groups. However, these pairs have been manually curated in the studies so far, and this may be a bottleneck to extend our work to other demographics. In the future, we aim to automatically obtain word indicative of specific demographic groups, or the biases against them, using word similarities and associations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we addressed the problem of bias mitigation in pre-trained contextual language models, and proposed an approach to mitigate explicit and implicit biases in BERT using existing and our proposed loss functions. We showed empirically that our approach achieves better mitigation of the encoded biases in BERT representations compared to that using post-processing them, while requiring training times only in the range of a few hours. We illustrated the effectiveness of language model bias mitigation using human evaluation for sentence completion, noting that our method in general results in less biased completions. Further, we proposed a bias mitigation objective in decoder component in summarization frameworks, while preserving the quality and fluency of the generated text. Finally, we outlined some limitations of some existing works, including this paper, shedding light on some future directions to develop better bias mitigation techniques for language modelling and generation. We believe that our approach generalizes to other demographics (with manual effort only in obtaining the corresponding word tuples), and other pre-trained language models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Ethical Considerations</head><p>We are committed to following ethical practices which including protecting the anonymity and privacy of all individuals who may have contributed to the datasets used to analyze gender and racial biases. Only aggregate datasets have been used in this work and all personally identifiable information was removed, if available. For the human evaluation, we collected annotations from workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). For each task, the workers are rewarded with $0.65, and each task on an average requires less than five minutes.</p><p>The examples mentioned in the paper are only to illustrate the approach and there is no intent for discrimination. Words such as 'Black' are interchangeably used for 'African American', as this is a term colloquially and very frequently used in the articles we are studying, again not with the intent to discriminate. We honor and respect all demographic preferences. Our aim, through this work, is to help provide technical tools to avoid amplification of discrimination and biases in NLP models used for representing and generating language.  </p></div>
