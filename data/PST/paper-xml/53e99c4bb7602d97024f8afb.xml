<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A new class of distributions, G distributions, arising from the multiplicative model is presented in this paper, along with their main properties and relations. Their densities are derived for complex and multilook intensity and amplitude data. Classical distributions, such as K, are particular cases of this new class. A special case of this class called here G 0 , that has as many parameters as K distributions, is shown able to model extremely heterogeneous clutter, such as that of urban areas, that cannot be properly modeled with K distributions. One of the parameters of this special case is related to the degree of homogeneity, and a limiting case is that of a scaled speckle. The advantage of the G 0 distribution becomes evident through the analysis of a variety of areas (urban, primary forest and deforested) from two sensors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HE PRECISE knowledge of the statistical properties of SAR data plays a central role in image processing and understanding. These properties can be used to discriminate types of land use and to develop specialized filters for speckle noise reduction, among other applications. Several studies have been conducted in order to relate physical features and statistical properties of SAR data and, in order to do this, some hypothesis and distributions are considered.</p><p>The multiplicative model has been widely used in the modeling, processing, and analysis of synthetic aperture radar images. This model states that, under certain conditions [15], the return results from the product between the speckle noise and the terrain backscatter. Several distributions could be used for the backscatter, aiming at the modeling of different types of classes and their characteristic degrees of homogeneity. For instance, for some sensor parameters (wavelength, angle of incidence, polarization, etc.), pasture is more homogeneous than forest, which, in turn, is more homogeneous than urban areas. Most distributions for the (amplitude) backscatter do not yield to closed-form distributions for the return, being a constant, a square root of Gamma and a square root of generalized inverse Gaussian distribution important exceptions.</p><p>Common distributional hypothesis for one-look return data and homogeneous targets are the Exponential and Rayleigh distributions, for quadratic and linear detections, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>When the observed region cannot be assumed as homogeneous, other distributions are considered. Among these, the distributions have received a great deal of attention in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</p><p>This paper extends classical results with the proposal of distributions that have the distributions as particular cases. These distributions arise using the square root of generalized inverse Gaussian distribution as the model for the amplitude backscatter, a distribution here proposed to model extremely heterogeneous targets as well as other types of clutter.</p><p>This work is organized in the following manner: complex and amplitude cases for the speckle noise are treated separately; distributions that model the terrain backscatter (amplitude case) are then reviewed, and the square root of the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution is introduced. Once the speckle noise and the backscatter are characterized, attention is devoted to the distributions induced for the return. It is shown that a two-parameters particular case of the square root of generalized inverse Gaussian distribution can be succesfully used as a model for urban areas backscatter, a problem addressed by several authors (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>). The distribution induced for the return, called here , is also used to model primary forests and a deforested area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. THE MULTIPLICATIVE MODEL AND THE SPECKLE NOISE</head><p>Speckle noise is always associated to coherent-illuminated scenes, such as those obtained by microwaves, laser, ultrasonography, etc. This kind of noise appears due to interference phenomena between the incident and reflected signals. This kind of noise makes visual and automatic interpretation a difficult task, though it may carry important information. As will be seen in this section, images suffering from speckle noise should not be treated with the usual additive-noise derived tools (Wiener filter, for instance), since speckle corrupts the signal in a multiplicative manner and in the amplitude and intensity formats it is non-Gaussian.</p><p>The multiplicative model is a common framework used to explain the statistical behavior of data obtained with coherent illumination. It assumes that the observations within this kind of images are the outcome of the product of two independent random variables: one modeling the terrain backscatter, and other modeling the speckle noise. The former is many times considered real and positive, while the latter could be complex (if the considered image is in complex format) or positive real (intensity and amplitude formats).</p><p>Therefore, the observed value is the outcome of the random variable defined by the product . In order to make a clear distinction between the aforementioned formats, the subscripts " ," " ," and " " will be used for the complex, intensity, and amplitude cases, respectively. Vectors will be explicitly denoted in boldface.</p><p>Complex speckle is usually assumed to have a bivariate normal distribution, with independent identically distributed components having zero mean and variance . These marginal distributions are denoted here as ; therefore, denotes the distribution of the pair.</p><p>Multilook intensity speckle appears by taking the average over independent samples of leading, thus, to a Gamma distribution denoted here as and characterized by the density Multilook amplitude speckle results from taking the square root of the multilook intensity speckle and, therefore, has a square root of Gamma distribution, denoted here as and characterized by the density Though the number of looks should, in principle, be an integer, seldom this is the case when this quantity is estimated from real data due to, among other reasons, the fact that the mean is taken over correlated observations. It is therefore interesting to call the equivalent number of looks; its estimation is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. AMPLITUDE BACKSCATTER</head><p>Two models are found in the literature for the amplitude backscatter within the multiplicative model: a constant (used to model homogeneous areas) and a square root of Gamma distribution (used to model heterogeneous areas), being the former a particular case of the latter. In Section V it will be seen that these distributions lead to the square root of Gamma and to the amplitude distributions for the amplitude return, respectively. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, it was noticed that the observations from some areas were heterogeneous to an extent that even distributions could not take account of.</p><p>In this paper the use of the square root of a generalized inverse Gaussian distribution is proposed as a general model for the amplitude backscatter which • yields to closed form densities for the complex, intensity and amplitude returns under the multiplicative model with Gaussian complex speckle; • has the following distributions as particular cases:</p><p>-the square root of Gamma, leading to the class of distributions for the return; -the reciprocal of a square root of Gamma, leading to the class of distributions for the return; -a constant, leading to scaled speckle for the return.</p><p>• The class of distributions has as many parameters as the distributions, and allows the modeling of extremely heterogeneous areas (as is the case of urban data), as well as other types of areas.</p><p>The amplitude backscatter is said to obey the square root of generalized inverse Gaussian law, situation here denoted as , if its density is given by where denotes the modified Bessel function of the third kind and order , and the parameters space is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">if if if (1)</formula><p>Its -th order moments are given by If , then the intensity basckscatter is said to have the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution. An extensive account of properties and applications of this last distribution can be seen in <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Two particular cases of this distribution are of interest in SAR data analysis: the square root of Gamma, and the reciprocal of a square root of Gamma distributions. The former is a well known model for homogeneous and heterogeneous clutter. The latter is a proposal of this paper that encompasses the modeling abilities of the former whilst extending them to enable the modeling of more heterogeneous (extremely heterogeneous) data. This new model was motivated by statistical fitting of areas with varying degrees of homogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</p><p>The square root of Gamma distribution arises by letting while . This distribution, denoted here as is characterized by the density <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> Square root of Gamma distributed backscatter is a commonly used model for heterogeneous areas, as is the case of forests for some SAR sensors. This hypothesis is mainly based on empirical evidence, though some theoretical results relating backscatter with birth-and-death processes can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>The reciprocal of the square root of Gamma distribution arises by letting while . This distribution, denoted here as is characterized by the density</p><p>(3) Notice that, if , then (3) characterizes the distribution of with . Using characteristic functions it can be proved that a sequence of random variables obeying distributions converges in probability to the constant , if such that when . Also, a sequence of random variables obeying distributions converges in probability to the constant , if such that when . In this manner, constant amplitude backscatter, used to model homogeneous areas, arises in two situations and as particular cases of the square root of generalized inverse Gaussian distribution.</p><p>The aforementioned limiting properties that relate the distribution with and constants are summarized in (4), where " " and " " denote the convergences in distribution and probability, respectively, of the associated random variables. The properties stated in relations ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>), shown at the bottom of the page, show that either homogeneous, heterogeneous, or extremely heterogeneous backscatters can be treated as the outcome of a random variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. COMPLEX RETURN</head><p>Once defined the general distribution for as being , and given that the complex speckle is assumed to be distributed, it is possible to derive the associated marginal distribution for the complex return, which is given by . The density that characterizes the distribution of either the real or imaginary part of , denoted by , is given by and parameter space given in (1). This distribution is denoted here as , and its -th order moments are given by if is odd else</p><p>The relations presented in (4) yield to the properties for the marginal return presented in ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), shown at the bottom of the page, where and denote the complex and distributions, respectively, characterized by the densities These distributions have th order moments given, respectively, by if is odd else if is odd else</p><p>Using the parametrization presented here, it can be easily checked that the distribution is a particular case of the generalized hyperbolic distribution. It is interesting to note that the generalized hyperbolic distribution (see <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> for its properties and applications) is defined for an arbitrary number of dimensions, and so is the distribution. Therefore, multivariate distributions could also be considered to exploit the maximum of information from polarimetric data.</p></div>

AMPLITUDE RETURN</head><p>The distribution of the amplitude return that arises from the product of , where and is denoted here as and is</p><p>Heterogeneous Homogeneous A (020; 24:512;1) (dashes) and 0 1=2 (1; =4) (dash-dot-dot-dot) distributions.</p><p>characterized by the density <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> and parameters space given in (1).

It is possible to write the cumulative distribution function of this distribution as where is the hypergeometric function <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. A similar distribution, derived as the square root of the ratio of two correlated Gamma random variables, is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> as a model for multilook amplitude band ratios.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the densities of the distribution for different values of , with , such that the mean is unitary. The distribution , shown in dash-dot-dot-dot, represents the limiting case , [see relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>]. It can be seen from the plot that this last distribution is very close to the with and, therefore, the is a good approximation to the distribution for values of smaller than about . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the densities for different values of , with , such that the mean is unitary, showing the strong effect of the equivalent number of looks on this distribution for low values of the return. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. INTENSITY RETURN</head><p>The distribution of the intensity return is that of the product , which can be obtained from the densities of the amplitude return by the transformation . Applying this transformation to ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>), (8), and (9) one obtains the densities that characterize the (with parameters space given in (1)), and distributions, respectively. Analogous limiting properties to those presented in (7) can be easily obtained for these distributions. Their th order moments are given by , where is the th order moment of the corresponding amplitude random variable, which is given in Section V. A closed (recursive) form for the cumulative distribution function of and distributed random variables can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. MODELING URBAN AREAS</head><p>When estimating the three parameters of the distribution over urban areas it was always observed that the attractor and global solution of the system of equations was in the parameters space subset given by ;</p><p>Heterogeneous Homogeneous General Situation Extremely heterogeneous the density corresponding to the case was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(9)</ref>. Therefore, assuming that the observed values of are small enough to allow the use of the distribution, there is empirical evidence that the amplitude return of urban areas can be modeled as having the distribution characterized by the density given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(9)</ref>.</p><p>Using the convergence properties stated in (4), the degree of heterogeneity can be measured with the estimated value of , i.e., if estimation is performed over two areas and and are the estimated parameters, then suggests that the first area is more heterogeneous than the second.</p><p>Parameter estimation was performed solving the (system of) moment equations. For amplitude data, and assuming known, the estimators for the parameters of the and distributions are  given, respectively, by where denotes the th order sample moment. The estimators for the parameters of the two last distributions were derived using . The SAR data used for modeling urban areas were acquired by the DLR's airborne Experimental SAR system (E-SAR), developed and built by its Institute of High Frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. E-SAR is mounted on board of a Dornier DO 228 aircraft. It currently operates in X-, C-, L-and P-bands with vertical or horizontal polarization, except L-band which works fully polarimetric. Special features are small fixed antennas with a wide azimuth beam permitting high azimuth resolution and motion error compensation in the off-line SAR image processor. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> summarizes the technical key parameters of E-SAR system, while Table II presents information specific to the images covering the selected urban area.</p><p>From E-SAR data takes two urban areas were selected, Gilching (48 5′35″N, 11 12′54″E) and Weilheim (47 56′2″N, 11 5′9″E). These are small towns to the west and to the south sample sizes of the P-HH band data were 268 720 (1 look, 3 m azimuth resolution), 268 300 (1 look, 10 m) and 328 196 (4 looks, 10 m) pixels, respectively. For this last image, an equivalent number of looks was estimated and used in the forthcoming analysis. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the Gilching area and its surroundings in the L-HH band; Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the P-HH band, 4 looks image over Weilheim and its surroundings. Before doing the goodness-of-fit tests the data were subsampled in a 1 to 16 ratio (only one pixel every 4 4 window was considered), in order to reduce the effect of spatial correlation on the test statistics. Parameters estimation was performed using the whole datasets to obtain more accurate values. The results of the analysis are shown in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">III</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_0">IV</ref>, where the first column identifies the data, the second shows the estimated coefficient of variation ( , while the next three present the estimated parameters of the aforementioned distributions. The last column shows the -value of the goodness-of-fit test of the distribution. Fitting the other two distributions always produced , with the only exception being the distribution for the first Weilheim data set, that produced . Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">III</ref> shows the results of the analysis of Gilching data, and Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows the histogram of the whole set of data and the estimated densities. From this table and this figure it can be concluded that both and give very poor statistical description of the data, whilst is a good model. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">IV</ref> shows the results of the analysis of Weilheim data, and Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows the histogram of the whole set of data and the estimated densities. It is evident, again, the feasibility of the use of the distribution for urban areas modeling, against the inadequacy of the other two distributions.</p><p>The observed inadequacy of the distribution for these data is in accordance with the results presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, where it is shown that data for which is not well fitted by this distribution. One look urban data was also fitted with the Nakagami-Rice distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The estimated parameters led to the distribution, which is a particular case of the Nakagami-Rice model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. MODELING PRIMARY FOREST AND DEFORESTED AREAS</head><p>As presented in relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, the distribution has the capability of modeling a continuously varying degree of homogeneity, being the extreme homogeneous situation where this distribution is equivalent to a distribution (scaled speckle). In this section the fitting of the previously presented distributions is shown for primary forest and deforested areas, with varying degrees of homogeneity. It is shown that the distribution is a good model for these areas, and that the deforested area (more homogeneous) is also Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. JERS-1 samples: primary forest with undulated relief, primary forest with flat relief and deforestation, from top to bottom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TABLE V ANALYSIS OF JERS-1 DATA</head><p>well fitted by the distribution, as expected from relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</p><p>The image used for this part of the study was taken on June 26, 1993 over Tapajós, Pará, Brazil, by JERS-1. The main parameters of the instrument are L-HH band (wavelength of 24 cm), spatial resolution of 18 m, nominal look angle of 35 degrees and three looks (nominal). The estimated number of looks, used in the forthcoming statistical modeling, was of 2.84 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. Three samples were taken from this image, two from different types of primary forest and one from a deforested area. The two primary forests differ with respect to their relief (one is undulated while the other is relatively flat) and with respect to their vegetation types, among other factors. Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> shows these three samples; their sizes are, respectively, of 300 300, 300 216, and 200 52 pixels. Table <ref type="table">V</ref> shows the estimated parameters and the values obtained with the same methodology described in Section VII. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref> presents the histograms of the whole data sets and the estimated densities.</p><p>From the plots and the estimates of it can be observed that, as expected, this parameter is strongly related to the degree of homogeneity of the data, being smaller for more homogeneous areas such as the deforested one. Also, as decreases the fit with the distribution becomes better and all the three densities tend to be alike; note that for deforested data it was observed when fitting the distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. CONCLUSION</head><p>Some useful distributions for SAR image modeling and analysis for several degrees of heterogeneity and usual image formats were derived within the multiplicative model. Many relationships between these distributions were presented. An extension of "classic" distributions that arise within the multiplicative model is given through the use of the square root of generalized inverse Gaussian distribution for the amplitude backscatter, giving rise to the class of distributions for the return. A two-parameters particular case of the amplitude distribution, called here , is presented in this paper. The modeling improvement of the distribution, with respect to the distribution, becomes evident when fitting urban, forested, and deforested areas, with widely varying degrees of homogeneity.</p><p>Efficient estimation techniques for the and distributions is a problem currently under study.

He received the degree of engineer electronics and electricity from the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro in 1993, the M.Sc. degree from the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE), São José dos Campos, Brazil in the area of remote sensing in 1995.</p><p>He is currently a Consultant at INPE, and his interests are image analysis and processing techniques for remote sensing (SAR image filtering, statistical methods, robustness, etc.).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

He received the engineering degree in electronics and electricity from the Universidad de Mendoza in 1985, the M.Sc. degree in applied mathematics (statistics) from the Instituto de Matemática Pura e Aplicada (IMPA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1990, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais, São José dos Campos, Brazil, in 1993.</p><p>He is currently with the Computer Science Department, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil. His activities focus on the development and the use of statistical techniques (Markov random fields, inference, robustness, simulation, etc.) applied to image synthesis, processing, and analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Häns-J ürgen M üller received the Diploma</head><p>Physiker in theoretical and experimental physics from the University of Munich, Germany, in 1967.</p><p>Coming from the fields of crystallography and thin layers in X-ray and vacuum technique, he worked in cloud physics, artificial influenced rain, fog control, and forming of ice nuclei at the Institute for Atmospheric Research. He was responsible for the deep space antenna station of the HELIOS probe, the national German ship station, and the two frequency scatterometer for measuring ocean waves. He belonged to the science group pushing forward the German draft of the process language PEARL by applying it in the simulated workplace for Spacelab experiments. In the early 1990's, he was the responsible scientist for data evaluation of the Shuttle/Spacelab experiment MRSE. Since then he was more and more involved in microwave remote sensing at the Institute for Radio Frequency, DLR. Presently, he is aircraft operator of the airborne ESAR system and member of the Geomatic group at DLR interpretating SAR images with emphasis to statistics and forest problems.</p></div>			</div>
