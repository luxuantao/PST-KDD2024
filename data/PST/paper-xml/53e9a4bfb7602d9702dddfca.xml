<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HIS paper was originally motivated by the study of the following system of first-order ordinary differential equations: . . . . . . where the subscripted s, as well as and , are arbitrary positive constants; the s are nonnegative functions of time , and dots indicate derivatives with respect to . These equations arise in immunology, and describe a possible mechanism, due to McKeithan, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, that may explain the selectivity of T-cell interactions (some more details are provided below). McKeithan analyzed the equilibria of these equations, which represent steady-state regimes, mostly under the simplifying assumptions that and for some fixed and . During Carla Wofsy's series of talks <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> on the topic, a number of questions arose: what can be said about the structure of equilibria? are the equilibria stable? Stability is a natural mathematical requirement, with clear biological significance.</p><p>Manuscript received <ref type="bibr">February 17, 2000</ref>; revised November 25, 2000. Recommended by Associate Editor G. Bastin. This work was supported in part by United States Air Force under Grant F49620-98-1-0242.</p><p>The author is with the Department of Mathematics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA (e-mail: sontag@hilbert.rutgers.edu).</p><p>Publisher Item Identifier S 0018-9286(01)06744-7.</p><p>Under the simplifying assumptions mentioned above, it is not difficult to see that there is only one equilibrium, whose coordinates depend, of course, on the given constants. We will see that in fact even in the general case of the constants being distinct, there is a unique equilibrium. Far more interestingly, however, we will prove that the equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable: every solution, for any choice of initial (nonnegative) values s, converges to the unique equilibrium. This conclusion rules out, in particular, periodic orbits and, of course, chaotic behaviors, and shows the "determinism" of the process described by McKeithan. Moreover, we will also establish the robustness of stability with respect to a quantifiable class of perturbations in the dynamics.</p><p>Going further, and approaching now the equations from the point of view of a control theorist, one may pose questions of a very different nature as well, questions of design. The equilibria depend, in particular, on the value of the constants and , which represent total concentrations (of intermediate complexes plus T-cell receptors, and intermediates plus peptide-major histocompatibility complex, respectively). If these concentrations are allowed to vary, and are seen as additional state variables, multiple attracting equilibria exist. So one may ask: if we are allowed to manipulate some of the variables, can we change the equilibria at will (and preserve stability)? How many variables need to be manipulated? Such questions might eventually impact approaches to therapy and rational drug design. We will provide a global feedback stabilization result as an answer.</p><p>As it turns out, the system of interest can be viewed as a very special instance of a very large class of nonlinear systems, for which the above-mentioned results can be established in general. In this paper, we describe a theory of structure, stability, and stabilization for that general class of systems. Thus, this paper can be read totally independently of the above-mentioned motivating example from immunology. By providing a general theory, one expects that other applications of the theorems given here will be possible.</p><p>The class of systems which we consider is, basically, that of "deficiency zero chemical reaction networks with mass-action kinetics (and one linkage class)" in the language of the beautiful and powerful theory developed by Feinberg, Horn, and Jackson, cf. [10]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. (the mass-action kinetics assumption is weakened in several of the results, however). As a matter of fact, our stability (but not the robustness nor the feedback) results are basically contained in that previous work. The existence and uniqueness of equilibria, and local asymptotic stability, are already proved in the papers by Feinberg, Horn, and Jackson, and we claim no originality whatsoever in that regard. And although the global stability results may not be readily apparent from a casual reading of that literature, our proofs of them consist basically of a careful repackaging of the discussion found in Feinberg's paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. (One should point out that an alternative approach to global stability, which would apply to a somewhat smaller class of systems, could use ideas from <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, which, in turn, was based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Also somewhat related, but far more restrictive, are the results described in the book <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, which apply to systems which satisfy a "conservation of energy" constraint.)</p><p>The reliance upon the Feinberg/Horn/Jackson theory notwithstanding, we provide here a totally self-contained and streamlined exposition even of those results that are known for these systems (deep theories for other classes of systems have also been developed by these authors). We do this in order to present things in a terminology and formalism more standard in control and dynamical systems, and also because it is not obvious how to put together the necessary pieces from the various sources in a way that allows us to refer to them efficiently. In any case, it is our hope that this exposition will serve to make a wider audience in the dynamical systems and control theory communities aware of their work.</p><p>In addition to the stability results, we also prove a robustness and a feedback stabilization result, and we show the existence of a global change of coordinates, which brings the systems in question into a canonical form which exhibits a particularly elegant structure. We develop a formalism, and present explicit estimates for stability margins, with a view toward further theoretical developments. Indeed, in a recent follow-up joint paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> with Madalena Chaves, we have been able to derive, using these techniques, various input-to-state stability results and, in particular, a design of globally convergent Luenberger-like observers for systems of the type studied here. As new results, we also include partial generalizations to nonmass action kinetics (cf. Remark V.6 and the stability section).</p><p>There is an extensive literature regarding applications of control theory to chemical engineering, and, in particular, to bioreactors. Among many references, one may mention the textbook <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and the more recent survey articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and the references given there, as well as the well-known theory of compartmental systems (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>). More specifically, results based on Feinberg-Horn-Jackson theory have appeared in the control literature, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Other reactor biocontrol work deals with reachability and controllability issues, see for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. A preliminary version of this paper was posted electronically in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>The organization of this paper is as follows. In the rest of this Introduction, we motivate the formalism and results to follow by reviewing some basic facts concerning chemical reaction networks and working through an example. This section can be skipped with no loss of continuity by readers interested in the mathematical developments. The paper starts in Section II, where we introduce the class of dynamical systems being studied, and the main theorems are also stated. In Section III, we specialize to McKeithan's system, interpreting the results in that special case. Section IV discusses some basic coordinatization facts, as well as some useful alternative system descriptions. Section V deals with the main proofs regarding interior equilibria, Section VI with boundary equilibria, Section VII with technical invariance results, and, finally, Section VIII with the proofs of the stability theorems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Chemical Networks</head><p>Let us motivate the formalism and results to follow by reviewing some basic facts concerning chemical reaction networks. We will restrict attention to "mass action kinetics"; however, it is important to remark that variations such as Michaelis-Menten reactions, obtained through singular perturbation analysis when starting from mass-action models, are routinely used to model many enzymatic reactions in biology and, in fact, most of our results apply to them as well (see Remark V.6 and the stability section).</p><p>In chemical network studies, one analyzes systems of differential equations which describe the time-evolution of the concentrations of given "chemical species"</p><p>; the s might denote anything from small molecules to large complexes. The equations are derived from a consideration of the reactions that are known to occur among the substances , perhaps helped by other molecules which are not explicitly considered in the equations (such as catalysts or energy sources).</p><p>As an extremely simple illustration, suppose that each molecule of a certain species can react with one molecule of to produce a molecule of , and that, conversely, each molecule of may dissociate (through a different process, typically with different time constants), into and . This is indicated graphically by and or just by An example of this reaction is provided by the synthesis of ethyl tert-butyl ether ( C H O) from isobutene ( C H ) and ethanol ( C H O). For studies of the ethyl tert-butyl ether reaction in the control theory literature, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Assuming that the reactor is well-mixed, particle-collision theories or quantum-mechanical potential energy methods are often used to justify the statement that the probability of such a reaction occurring, in a small time interval around time , is proportional to the product of the concentrations at time , and to the length of the interval, that is to say, to the probability of two molecules in this bimolecular reaction colliding by virtue of being "in the same place at the same time." Since we gain a single molecule of for each such reaction, we arrive at a formula for the rate of increase of the concentration of due to the first reaction :</p><p>(1)</p><p>In addition, as one molecule of and each are eliminated at the same rate, we also have the following two differential equations:</p><p>(2)</p><p>Here, is a suitable constant of proportionality, the "reaction rate constant," which is often taken to be (Arrhenius law) proportional to the Boltzmann factor and is the temperature. One also writes graphically:</p><p>We also assumed for our example that there is a dissociation reaction, that is, where is another rate constant, and this reaction is also modeled by rate equations:</p><p>decays at a rate proportional to its concentration, , and each of and grow at this rate. Incorporating these into the previous equations gives the final set of differential equations:</p><p>(3) which describe the evolution of all the concentrations . A very convenient and systematic formalism to describe the complete system of equations is as follows. The entire reaction is represented by a graph, whose nodes are the "complexes" which appear in the reactions, such as and in the example given above, and whose edges are labeled by the reaction rate constants. So, in the example shown above, there is an edge labeled (where is an actual positive number) starting at the node in the graph corresponding to , and pointing to the node corresponding to , and there is likewise an edge labeled from the second node to the first. We associate to this graph its incidence (connectivity) matrix matrix , listing all the edge labels (for instance, , to indicate a reaction with rate constant , from the first node to the second node). More generally, the size of is , if there are a total of complexes. One of the hypotheses to be made is that the matrix is irreducible, meaning that the graph is strongly connected, that is, there is some path, typically through several stages of intermediate reactions, linking any two given complexes (in fact, results hold under a weaker, block-irreducibility, property). Next, one introduces a set of column -vectors , one for each complex (in our simple example,</p><p>). This is done by specifying the contributions from each type of molecule. For example, gives rise to the vector , and to the vector . The "mass action" dynamics are then summarized by the system (4) (where each has entries ), which the reader may easily verify reduces to (3) in the above example, for which Note that, for instance, the term corresponding to and in the summation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> gives us which provides precisely the contributions to , , and represented by ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>). [Higher-order polynomial equations may result as well. For example, suppose that each molecule of species can react with four molecules of to produce two molecules of , that is, . This would give us equations , , and , and the vectors and would become , .] A fundamental role is played by the linear subspace of which is spanned by all the differences . This is the stoichiometric subspace associated to the reaction, and each intersection between a parallel translate of and the positive orthant is called a class, or more properly a stoichiometric compatibility class ["stoicheion" (Gk.) element]. The significance of classes is that, since , trajectories remain in classes, that is, classes are positive-time invariant manifolds for the dynamical system. (The positive orthant is itself forward invariant, as is easily shown.) In the example discussed above, is the line spanned by . This line can also be described as the set of solutions of , so each class is given by the positive points in , for different constants and . Of course, it is clear from the equations (3) that along solutions.</p><p>One of the basic facts about the systems studied here is that there is a unique equilibrium in each class, and, under mild conditions, this equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable with respect to positive initial conditions. Continuing with the above example, the set of possible equilibria consists of the points in the hyperbolic paraboloid . Let's now take for simplicity and analyze the stability of the equilibrium . As the ray is forward invariant, where ranges over the interval (the intersection of the corresponding line and the positive orthant), we may parameterize motions by . One obtains the scalar differential equation , which has, as claimed, the point as an asymptotically stable state with a basin of attraction which includes all of . If we start at a point which is not in the above line, the equilibrium approached will not be . If this equilibrium is desirable, we may want to design a feedback law to drive the solutions from every other (positive orthant) initial state into . Suppose that we can control the inflows and outflows of, let us say, and . This situation is represented by the following control system: Stabilization of can be achieved for instance by a simple feedback linearization, taking and . Then, and as , and thus, by a cascade argument, we see that also as , as wanted. We will provide a general result on stabilization (but using linear feedback), as well as results on robustness of stability and on global decompositions of dynamics, for systems (4). These results will be illustrated again for the above simple example, now viewed as a particular case of McKeithan's system, in Section III.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. DEFINITIONS AND STATEMENTS OF MAIN RESULTS</head><p>Some standard notations to be used are the following: . Although we develop the theory for a somewhat wider class of systems, we wish to emphasize that all the results to be given are valid, in particular, for the following general class of systems evolving on :</p><p>(and, as appropriate, for those systems obtained by adding control inputs, as discussed below). Each column vector has entries , which are nonnegative integers, and the s are nonnegative numbers. The systems defined in this fashion are described by polynomial dynamics. The only assumptions required in order for the results to hold are that the s be linearly independent and that the matrix must be irreducible. Recall that this means that or, equivalently, that the incidence graph is strongly connected [where is the graph whose nodes are the integers and for which there is an edge , , if and only if ]. This assumption amounts to a "weak reversibility" property in the application to chemical reactors, as discussed briefly in Section III, and is crucial to the validity of the results.</p><p>We now describe the underlying dynamics of the systems to be studied, and leave for later the introduction of additional terms in order to model the possibility of control actions. Our systems are parametrized by two matrices and with nonnegative entries, as well as a collection of nonnegative functions , , and have the following general form:</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">)<label>5</label></formula><p>where denotes the th column of (notice that the diagonal entries of are irrelevant, since ). Several restrictions on , , and the s are imposed below. The powers are interpreted as follows, for any , : , if , and if and . The main motivating example, arising from mass-action kinetics in chemistry, is obtained when for all and is a matrix whose entries are nonnegative integers (so, for nonnegative vectors , we have polynomial equations). This is the case mentioned in the first paragraph, and will be referred to as the "standard setup" in this paper.</p><p>The hypotheses on the s, , and are as follows. Each map is locally Lipschitz, has , satisfies , and its restriction to is strictly increasing and onto. [Most results hold without this last assumption; see (28)]. We suppose that is irreducible <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> and, for , that each entry of is either or <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> [this last hypothesis insures that in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">5</ref>) is a locally Lipschitz vector field, so we have uniqueness of solutions for the differential equation],</p><p>has rank <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> (so, its columns are linearly independent), and no row of vanishes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> This last hypothesis is made mainly for convenience. Observe that if some row, let us say the th one, were zero, then the same dynamics would be obtained if all entries in row are replaced by "1" (since the differences are still zero) and one restricts the dynamics to those states satisfying , where is the positive number such that . From now on, we assume that all systems (5) considered satisfy the above assumptions.</p><p>Our study will focus on those solutions of (5) which evolve in the nonnegative orthant . Recall that a subset is said to be forward invariant with respect to the differential equation provided that each solution with has the property that for all positive in the domain of definition of . It is routine to show (cf. Section VII) that the nonnegative and positive orthants are forward invariant:</p><p>Lemma II.1: Both and are forward-invariant sets with respect to the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</p><p>[These properties are simple consequences of the fact that, because of the assumptions made, the th component of a solution of (5) will satisfy whenever .) We will also show in Section VIII-B4 that there are no finite explosion times:</p><p>Lemma II.2: For each there is a (unique) solution of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">5</ref>) with</p><p>, defined for all .</p><p>In order to state concisely the main results for systems (5), we need to introduce a few additional objects. The subspace <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> can be seen as a distribution in the tangent space of</p><p>; it has dimension because adding to the last-shown generating set gives the column space of the rank-matrix . For each vector , we may also consider the parallel translate of that passes through , i.e.,</p><p>. A set which arises as an intersection of such an affine subspace with the nonnegative orthant:</p><p>(for some , without loss of generality in</p><p>) will be referred to as a class. If intersects the positive orthant , we say that is a positive class. The significance of classes is given by the fact that any solution of (5) must satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> , so for all . In particular, see the following. Lemma II.3: Each class is forward invariant for <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. The introduction of control action, through additional feedback loops, may be used in order to overcome the constraints imposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. In order to formulate our control-theoretic results, we will suppose that external inputs can be used to independently influence each of state coordinates, In other words, we will also consider the following control system associated to the basic open-loop model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">5</ref>): <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> [ is as in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">5</ref>)], where is a positive integer, are the canonical basis vectors in , and are distinct elements of . Of course, inputs might influence the system in manners other than through independent action on some coordinates, which represent what are sometimes (especially in compartmental models) called inflow-controlled systems, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Bilinear control action, for instance, is arguably more interesting in reaction systems. We will only study the above class of control systems, but research is ongoing on generalizations to other formulations, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>We will first state the main results for autonomous systems (5), and later we state a stabilization result for <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</p><p>We denote by (respectively, or ) the set of nonnegative (respectively, positive or boundary) equilibria of (5), i.e., the set of states (respectively, or ), such that . Of course, is the disjoint union of and .</p><p>Theorem 1: Consider any system (5), under the stated assumptions. For every maximal solution of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">5</ref>) with , it holds that as . This will be proved in Section VIII-B-2. The invariance of classes (which are contained in subspaces of dimension ) precludes asymptotic stability of equilibria of (5). The appropriate concept is that of asymptotic stability relative to a class. We say that an equilibrium is asymptotically stable relative to a class if it is a) stable relative to [for each , there is some such that, for all solutions , and imply for all ] and b) locally attractive relative to [for some , if and then as ]. We say that is globally asymptotically stable relative to a class if it is stable relative to and globally attractive relative to [ for all solutions with ]. The main results are as follows; the first part is shown in Section V-A, and the remaining two in Section VIII.</p><p>Theorem 2: Consider any system (5), under the stated assumptions. For any positive class . a) there is a unique equilibrium ; b) the equilibrium is asymptotically stable relative to ; c) the equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable relative to if and only if . Example II.4: The following two trivial examples may help in understanding the above theorems. In both cases we take and for . The first example has</p><p>The system ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">5</ref>) is (for nonnegative states):</p><p>and thus and . The positive classes are the sets , for each , and for each such , is asymptotically stable with domain of attraction . See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Each class has a second equilibrium , but this second equilibrium is in the boundary, so there is no contradiction with part a) of Theorem 2. Regarding Theorem 1, observe that every trajectory either converges to an interior equilibrium or it is itself a trajectory consisting of an equilibrium (and hence also converges to , in a trivial sense).</p><p>The second example has</p><p>We now have (for nonnegative states) the following linear system:</p><p>and thus and . The positive classes contain no boundary equilibria; they are the sets , for each (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). For each such , is globally asymptotically stable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Feedback Stabilization</head><p>The invariance of classes precludes the existence of global (not merely relative to a class) attractors for the uncontrolled system <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Now suppose that we wish to find a feedback law which forces all the solutions of the closed-loop system obtained from the controlled system <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> under this feedback to converge, as , to a specific equilibrium . It turns out that the obvious negative feedback solution, namely to use inputs proportional to the errors , achieves the goal of global stabilization to , provided that enough inputs are used [ , which is obviously necessary, since solutions of ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) evolve in linear subspaces of dimension ] and that the s are appropriately chosen. We next state a result in that regard. For each we consider the set <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> which is nonempty, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. Theorem 3: Let , and suppose that are arbitrary positive real numbers, and are such that <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> for some . Pick any equilibrium . Then, all maximal solutions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> with are defined for all and remain in , and is a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</p><p>The invariance statement is proved in Section VII. The global stability statement is proved in Section VIII-B1.</p><p>To study the closed-loop system <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>, and also to be able to formulate a result concerning robustness of the stability properties described by Theorems 1 and 2, we will study "positive perturbations" of the basic uncontrolled system model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. These are described by equations as follows: <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> where is as in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">5</ref>) (and all the stated assumptions hold), and is a locally Lipschitz vector field on for which the following property holds: <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> where denotes the th coordinate of . Property ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) is the most natural assumption which guarantees the forward-invariance of [since it will imply that whenever ]. Of course, any results established for arbitrary systems (17) will be also true for systems (5) (take ). The feedback system ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) is of this type. To see that <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> holds, note that either (if some ) or</p><p>, and, in the first case, implies . Moreover, it satisfies the following strengthening of ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>): <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> [note the strict inequality, in contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>]. Indeed, pick as in ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>), , and so that . Then, for each , property <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> guarantees that .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Robustness</head><p>A different specialization of the general form ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) allows the study of robustness with respect to perturbations which preserve classes. The corresponding systems are obtained by adding vector fields which lie pointwise in the span of the s. We suppose given a collection of locally Lipschitz functions : ( ) such that <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> and, using these, define the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> Observe that property <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> implies that this system is of the general type <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. Indeed, the only possible negative signs for can arise from the terms of the form with (i.e., ), but these vanish, because of (20), when . Of course, systems ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">5</ref>) are a subclass of ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>) (take all</p><p>). The main robustness result will be as follows.</p><p>Theorem 4: For each positive class there exists a continuous function :</p><p>, with if and only if , such that, for any collection such that <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> for all , the following properties hold for the system (21):</p><p>1) both and , and the class , are forward-invariant; 2) for each there is a (unique) solution with , defined for all ; 3) the equilibrium is asymptotically stable relative to ;</p><p>4) the equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable relative to if and only if . In other words, the claim is that the conclusions previously stated for systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> are preserved by perturbations, as long as the magnitude constraint ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>) is satisfied. The result is not in itself surprising; the main interest is in its proof, which will be largely constructive, offering an explicit formula for the function and, moreover, the fact that will depend nicely on the class (in a sense that will be clear). The invariance of is clear from the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, and the (also easy) invariance of orthants is proved in Section VII. Parts 2-4 are proved in Section VIII-B3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Regularity</head><p>For all results to be stated next, we suppose a fixed system (5) has been given.</p><p>We say that a function defined on an open subset of is of class , if it is -times continuously differentiable (for ) or real-analytic (for ). We will refer to the following hypothesis, for each such : H each restricted to is of class , and for all Obviously, this hypothesis is satisfied with when is the identity map for , as is the case in the standard setup leading to polynomial systems.</p><p>We will show, in Section V-B: Theorem 5: If hypothesis (H ) holds, then is an embedded submanifold of , -diffeomorphic to . Observe that, in the standard setup, is a polynomial vector field, so and hence is an algebraic subset intersected with . Theorem 2 states that there is a unique interior equilibrium in each positive class. This equilibrium depends nicely (smoothly, analytically) on the class, provided that the s be regular enough.

MASS-ACTION KINETICS, AND MCKEITHAN'S SYSTEM</head><p>As mentioned in the Introduction, the results explained in Theorems 1 and 2 are basically theorems for what are called mass-action networks of zero deficiency, and are given (implicitly in the case of global stability) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. (There is one global stability result stated explicitly in the above papers, namely in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The statement would be that every trajectory which starts in the positive orthant must converge to the interior equilibrium in the corresponding class. However, this question is still open, since the suggested proof used the implication that if a positive definite function of states has a negative derivative along trajectories while away from an equilibrium, then global stability of the equilibrium follows. This implication is, in general, false, without the assumption of some sort of radial unboundedness, a property which definitely does not hold in the context in which it is being applied; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> for a retraction of that proof.)</p><p>The assumptions of irreducibility of and full rank of (both of which may be relaxed somewhat, cf.

Kinetic Proofreading in T-Cell Signaling</head><p>The equations with which we started represent the dynamics of the "kinetic proofreading" model proposed by McKeithan in  . The constants are the rate constants for each of the steps of phosphorylation or other intermediate modifications, and the constants are dissociation rates. Global stability of a unique equilibrium will be deduced from Part c) in Theorem 2 when we view the equations as those of an appropriate system (5) restricted to a suitable class (which is determined by the constants and ). The complete reaction network is represented graphically in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> (this is the same as [20, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>], except that we do not make the simplifying assumption of equal rates). In other words, we have a system of form <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> we may express all s as multiples of . We also have . Thus where the s are rational functions of the constants defining the system (these are the equilibria studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>). It is obvious in this example that we obtained a two-dimensional ( ) nonsingular algebraic subvariety of . We next discuss the application of Theorem 3 to this example.

In other words, stabilization to any desired equilibrium is possible provided that some pair of reactants, including at least one of or , can be manipulated by a controller.</p><p>To illustrate some of our constructions in a comparatively trivial case, let us now specialize even further, taking just and all constants equal to one. (This is mathematically the same as the example treated in Section I-A.) Writing instead of , we have the system and is a hyperbolic paraboloid (intersected with the main orthant). This is obviously a nonsingular algebraic set, but it is instructive to see it also as the image of the diffeomorphism : constructed in the proof of Theorem .

Since the column spaces of and are orthogonal, this fact follows from the following observation: if is self-adjoint and positive definite, then for any subspace of .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. A Coordinatization Property</head><p>When we apply the following Lemma, we will always take , but we can state the result in more generality. Actually, we may get an even more general result by dropping the assumption that the maps are onto. We will only assume, for the next result, that each , : (where ) is locally Lipschitz, has , satisfies , and its restriction to is strictly increasing and onto , but we are not now requiring . The reason for this relaxation is to allow consideration of functions like which arise in Michaelis-Menten kinetics. We will impose, instead, another condition, which we describe next. Let, as earlier, , and let (infinity if ). Notice that , seen as the inverse of the restriction of to , is a strictly increasing map from onto . Thus, for any given constant , for all , some , which implies that, for , its derivative where the constitute a basis of , then the uniqueness part of Lemma IV. . Hence, is also an eigenvector of , so by Lemma V.1 we conclude . Remark V.4: Even if the assumption that each is onto is dropped, the second part of Corollary V.3 is still valid, as the proof of the previous lemmas did not use ontoness, but merely (28). We are not assured that equilibria exist, but if there is any equilibrium then (41) holds.</p><p>Remark V.5: It is possible to generalize many of the results to the case when is not irreducible but, instead, there exists a permutation matrix with the property that is a block matrix with irreducible blocks. Let us sketch this next. Assuming already such a reordering has taken place, the family of systems considered is as follows. The dynamics are described by where is a positive integer (the "number of linkage classes"), and each has the form in Equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), for some matrices and . We suppose that each is an irreducible nonnegative matrix of size , and each has size . We let . Further, we also assume that the matrix which is composed from the blocks , namely , satisfies the properties ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) required of . We let be the subspace of spanned by the differences of columns of , for each , and now define as the sum of the spaces . (Note that the column spaces of the s intersect only at zero, because we are assuming that the columns of are linearly independent; thus is also a direct sum of the s. The dimension of each is , and has dimension .) Since the differences of columns of different s do not ever appear in the vector fields defining the system, the same argument as before shows that the cosets (with the new definition of ) are invariant. Classes are now defined using this , and are also invariant. We can express the dynamics in the form (37), where is formed as before, starting from the matrix that is obtained by using as diagonal blocks.</p><p>Since each is irreducible, we can find positive eigenvectors for the entire matrix , and the possible such eigenvectors are of the form , where each is a positive eigenvector of and the s are positive numbers. The function is still onto, so we obtain the existence of positive equilibria. Note that decomposes into blocks , mapping into , respectively, and (40) generalizes to:</p><p>for some iff . Thus, uniqueness in each class holds just as before, since is the intersection of the , , and also is an equilibrium iff all . As a last comment along these lines, we remark that the assumption that has full rank can also be slightly relaxed, as follows. Suppose that the column spaces of the s intersect only at the origin, and the column space of some spans an affine space of dimension , i.e., has dimension , but itself has rank (instead of ). Then, we may add a state variable to the system, which satisfies a differential equation , and extend the system in such a manner that has rank : this is equivalent to adding a row constantly equal to 1 to the matrix (and to the remaining matrices as well). The original system appears as the restriction of the new system to the invariant subset consisting of those states whose last coordinate is equal to one.</p></div>

[The fact that all trajectories approach equilibria, in the multiple-linkage class case, may also be proved directly. The LaSalle argument proceeds in basically the same manner; the critical step is to study those trajectories that remain in a level set of the Lyapunov function and start on the boundary. In the case of a single class, such trajectories are either equilibria or enter immediately the interior (Corollary VII.5). In the general case, there may be a block which is "turned off," that is, for some . In that event, we are reduced to studying a system with classes, and the same Lyapunov function (restricted to a possibly smaller state space, after dropping those state variables which only appear in the "off" reaction) can be used inductively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. A Remark on Exponential Stability</head><p>Suppose that hypothesis (H ) holds. Recalling the definition (64) of the Lyapunov function , and the form of its gradient given by (60), , we know that the Hessian of at is given by and is therefore nonsingular. Since the gradient of vanishes at , we have a Taylor expansion , and thus, for all in some neighborhood of , for some positive constants and . If we let in (36), we also have that for all in a neighborhood of . So inequality (71) gives us that, along trajectories in the class containing , as long as is near we have where . Integrating, , so we obtain an estimate for all trajectories of system (21) which start near . In other words, (relative) stability is in fact exponential.</p></div>			</div>
