<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Motivated by diverse research topics, such as coordination, flocking and formation of groups of mobile autonomous agents, the consensus problem for multi-agent systems has attracted more and more attention recently. Vicsek et al. proposed a discrete-time model of multi-autonomous agents, and demonstrated that without any central control all the agents move in the same direction when the density is large and the noise is small <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. Jadbabaie et al. studied the linearized Vicsek's model and proved that all the agents converge to a common steady state provided that the interconnection graph is jointly connected <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>.</p><p>It is very important to study the delay effect on convergence of consensus protocols. Basically, there are two kinds of delays in multi-agent systems. One is related to communication from one agent to another, which will be called communication delay in this note. The other is related to processing and connecting time for the packets arriving at each agent, which will be called input delay. Input delays also occur when actuators and controllers are connected by networks.</p><p>For systems with communication delays, each agent gets delayed state information from its neighbors. Note that when a constant-consensus is achieved, the states of all the agents in the system share the same value at any time. So, in most consensus protocols each agent compares the delayed states of its neighbors with its own current state instead of a delayed one. Recently, these kinds of consensus protocols have been studied for fixed or even switched graphs by using different analysis methods, such as the contraction analysis method <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>, the passivity-based method <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>, the method based on delayed and hierarchical graphs <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>, among others. It should be pointed out that the study on the consensus problem with communication delays started as early as in 1980s in the context of distributed computation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>. In some other communities such as physics, this problem has also been extensively studied as synchronization of coupled oscillators (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>). However, current studies in the context of multi-agent systems pay more attention to interconnection topology graphs.</p><p>A common point of the above mentioned results is that when certain connectedness condition is satisfied by the topology graph, the consensus condition required on the coupling weights is independent of communication delays. Unfortunately, simulations show that such a good property does not apply to the case of input delay. Although input delay problems have been extensively studied in classic control theory, there are few reports on the consensus problem with input delays up to now, to our knowledge. Saber and Murray proposed a consensus protocol in which each agent delays its own measurement of state in the same number as the communication delay so that it could be matched with the delayed states of its neighbors <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. Actually, the delays introduced by agents for themselves in this protocol can be also considered as input delays. However, only the case of identical delay is considered in <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> and their analysis method does not apply to the case of diverse delays.</p><p>In this note, we first consider the consensus problem for systems with diverse input delays based on undirected graphs. Using some early results obtained for the congestion control <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, we get a decentralized consensus condition, which uses only local information of each agent. This is a delay-dependent condition, according to which one should use small interconnection weights or have small numbers of neighbors to achieve consensus under large input delays. Then, we consider the consensus problem for systems with both diverse communication delays and diverse input delays based on directed graphs (digraphs). Although the consensus condition obtained for this case is more conservative than that for the first case due to the absence of system symmetry, it is still in decentralized way, and moreover, it is applicable to the systems based on digraphs with asymmetric weights. The obtained consensus condition is dependent on input delays but independent of communication delays when the digraph contains a globally reachable node.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROBLEM FORMULATION AND PRELIMINARIES</head><p>The notation used in this note for graph theory is quite standard. A weighted digraph G = (V; E; A) consists of a set of vertices V = fv 1 ; . . . ; v n g, a set of edges E V 2 V and a weighted adjacency matrix A = [aij ] 2 R n2n . The node indexes belong to a finite index set I = f1; . . . ; ng. We assume that the adjacency elements associated with the edges of the digraph are positive, i.e., a ij &gt; 0 , e ij 2 E. Moreover, we assume aii = 0 for all i 2 I. The set of neighbors of node v i is denoted by N i = fv j 2 V : (v i ; v j ) 2 Eg. For the digraph G, the out-degree of node i is defined as deg out (vi) = n j=1 aij . Let D be the degree matrix of G, which is defined as a diagonal matrix with the out-degree of each node along its diagonal. The Laplacian matrix of the weighted digraph is defined as L = D 0 A.</p><p>A node v i in the digraph G is said to be reachable from another node v j if there is a path in G from v j to v i . A node in the digraph is said to be globally reachable if it is reachable from every other node in the digraph. For an undirected graph, if it contains a globally reachable node then every two of its nodes are reachable from each other. In that case we simply say the undirected graph is connected.</p><p>In a multi-agent system, each agent can be considered as a node in a digraph, and the information flow between two agents can be regarded as a directed path between the nodes. Thus, the interconnection topology in a multi-agent system can be described by a digraph G = (V; E; A). where x i 2 R and u i 2 R denote the state and the control input of agent i, respectively. The following consensus protocol for the multiagent system (1) has been extensively studied in the literature</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ui(k) = v 2N aij(xj(k) 0 xi(k)) (2)</formula><p>where Ni denotes the neighbors of agent i, and aij &gt; 0 is the adjacency element of A in the digraph G = (V; E; A).</p><p>When each agent is subject to an input delay D i , system (1) becomes xi(k + 1) = xi(k) + ui(k 0 Di); i 2 I:</p><p>(3)</p><p>Under diverse communication delays, the consensus protocol becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">u i (k) = v 2N a ij (x j (k 0 T ij ) 0 x i (k))<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where T ij represents the communication delay from agent j to agent i.</p><p>Under protocol (4), multi-agent system (3) is said to achieve a consensus asymptotically if</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">lim k!1 x i (k) = c; 8 i 2 I</formula><p>where c is a constant.</p><p>The closed-loop system of (3) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">4</ref>) is</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">xi(k + 1) = xi(k)+ v 2N aij(xj(k 0 Tij 0 Di) 0 xi(k 0 Di)); i 2 I: (5)</formula><p>Let x(k) = [x 1 (k); . . . ; x n (k)] T , and dm1 = Tij + Di; m1 = 1; . . . ; n 2 ; d m2 = D i ; m 2 = n 2 + 1; . . . ; n(n + 1):</p><p>Then, (5) can be rewritten as a time-delayed system in a vector form</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">x(k + 1) = x(k) + n i=1 A i x(k 0 d i ) (6)</formula><p>where Ai 2 R n2n , and n d = n(n + 1). Obviously, n i=1 Ai = L, which is the Laplacian matrix of the topology graph.</p><p>The characteristic equation of system ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) is given by det (z 0 1)I 0 n i=1 Aiz 0d = 0:</p><p>The equilibrium set of system ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) is define by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Xe = fx 2 R n : Lx = 0g:</formula><p>When L is singular, X e is a continuum of equilibrium points. Assume the interconnection topology of the system is described by a connected undirected graph or a digraph containing a globally reachable node.</p><p>Then the Laplacian matrix L has a simple eigenvalue 0, i.e., det(L) = 0 and rank(L) = n 0 1 (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>). By the definition of L we have L[1; . . . ; 1] T = 0. and all the elements in X e can be represented as c[1; . . . ; 1] T where c is any constant. Therefore, system (6) achieves a consensus asymptotically, if the solution of the system starting from any given initial states x(0k) 2 R n , k = 0; 1; . . . ; n d 0 1, asymptotically converges to an element in Xe. According to this analysis the following lemma can be easily proved. Lemma 1: If the roots of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">7</ref>) have modulus less than unity except for a root at z = 1, then system (6) with a connected undirected graph or a digraph containing a globally reachable node achieves a consensus asymptotically. Some other lemmas are needed in the proof of our main results. Lemma 2: The following inequality:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">sin 2D+1 2 ! sin ! 2 2D + 1 (8)</formula><p>holds for all nonnegative integers D and all ! 2 [0; ].</p><p>Proof: First of all, we claim that sin 2(2D + 1) 1</p><p>2D + 1 <ref type="bibr">(9)</ref> holds for any nonnegative integer D. Indeed, by denoting</p><p>x = (1=(2D + 1)), we have x 2 (0; 1] for any nonnegative integer D. Thus, inequality ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) is equivalent to the well-known inequality sin((=2)x) x, where x 2 (0; 1]. Now, we note that lim!!0(sin((2D + 1=2)!)=sin((!=2))) = (2D + 1). We just need to prove (8) for all ! 2 (0; ] because the left-hand side of ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) is an even function for ! 2 [0; ].</p><p>When ! 2 (0; (=2D + 1)], let h(!) = sin(((2D + 1)=2)!) 0 (2D + 1) sin(!=2). Calculating the derivative of h(!) with respect to</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">! yields _ h(!) = ((2D + 1)=2)(cos(((2D + 1)=2)!)0cos((!=2))).</formula><p>Obviously, we have _ h(!) 0, i.e., h(!) is not increasing for all ! 2 (0; (=(2D + 1))]. Since h(0) = 0, we have h(!) 0, i.e., sin(((2D + 1)=2)!) (2D + 1) sin(!=2) for all ! 2 (0; (=(2D + 1))]. Since sin(!=2) &gt; 0, we get (sin(((2D + 1)=2)!)=sin((!=2)) (2D + 1).</p><p>When ! 2 ((=(2D + 1)); ], we have sin(!=2) &gt; sin(=2(2D + 1)) &gt; 0 for all nonnegative integers D. So, from ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>), we get</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">sin (2D+1) 2 ! sin ! 2 1 sin ! 2 &lt; 1 sin 2(2D+1) 2D + 1</formula><p>for all ! 2 ((=(2D + 1)); ] and all nonnegative integers D. Lemma 2 is proved.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Lemma 3 ([11]): Let Q = Q 3 &gt; 0 and T = diag(t i ; t i 2 C) be given. Then (T Q) 2 (Q)Co(0 [ ft i g)</formula><p>where (1) denotes the matrix spectral radius, and Co(1) convex hull.</p></div>

Then, the scaled convex hull Co(0 [ fG i (!); i = 1; . . . ; mg) does not contain the point (01; j0) for all ! 2 [0; ],</p><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">G i (!) = ki e 0jD ! e j! 0 1 ; k i = 2 sin 2(2Di + 1)</formula><p>and D i i = 1; . . . ; m, are nonnegative integers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. CONSENSUS WITH INPUT DELAYS</head><p>In this section we consider the consensus problem for multi-agent systems with input delays only. The closed-loop form of the time-delayed multi-agent system (3) with consensus protocol (2) is ; 8 i 2 I: <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref> Proof: Taking the z-transformation of system <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref> and writing it in vector form, we get (z 0 1)X(z) = 0diagfz 0D ; i = 1; . . . ; ngLX(z): <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref> Note that L in ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) is a positively semi-definite matrix since undirected graph is considered. The characteristic equation is det((z 0 1)I + diagfz 0D ; i = 1; . . . ; ngL) = 0: (13) Define p(z) = det((z 0 1)I + diagfz 0D ; i = 1; . . . ; ngL). Then, we will prove that all the zeros of p(z) have modulus less than unity except for a zero at z = 1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">x i (k + 1)= x i (k)+ v 2N a ij (x j (k 0 D i )0x i (k 0 D i )); i 2 I:(10)</formula><p>Let z = 1, then p(1) = det(L). Since G = (V; E; A) is connected, 0 is a simple eigenvalue of L, i.e., det(L) = 0 and rank(L) = n 0 1</p><p>(see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>). Thus, p(z) indeed has a simple zero at z = 1.</p><p>Now, we prove that the zeros of det(I + diagf(z 0D =(z 0 1)); i = 1; . . . ; ngL) have modulus less than unity. By the general Nyquist sta- bility criterion, this is the case if the eigenloci of</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">F (j!) = diag e 0j!D</formula><p>e j! 0 1 ; i = 1; . . . ; n L does not enclose the point (01; j0) for all ! 2 [0; ]. To show this we rewrite F (j!) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">F (j!) = diag k i e 0j!D e j! 0 1 diag k 01 i L</formula><p>where k i = 2 sin(=(2(2D i + 1))). Now, using Lemma 3 we have Now, from Lemma 4 we conclude that eigenloci of F (j!) does not enclose the point (01; j0) for all ! 2 [0; ], which implies that the zeros of p(z) have modulus less than unity except for a zero at z = 1.</p><p>Theorem 1 is thus proved by Lemma 1.</p><p>Remark 1: Theorem 1 gives a decentralized consensus condition for multi-agent systems with diverse input delays, which uses only local information of each agent.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. UNDER COMMUNICATION DELAYS AND INPUT DELAYS</head><p>In this section we consider multi-agent systems with both communication delays and input delays. Unlike the input delays, the diversity of communication delays destroys the symmetry of the system even if the graph is undirected with symmetric weights. This implies that the tools used for Theorem 1 (Lemma 3 and Lemma 4) are no longer applicable. So, in our following analysis we will use Greshgorin's disk theorem to estimate matrix eigenvalues, which does not need symmetry. And the interconnection topology studied in this section can be a digraph with asymmetric weights.</p><p>Theorem 2: Consider multi-agent system (3) with protocol (4). Assume that the interconnection topology digraph G = (V; E; A) of the system has a globally reachable node. Then the system achieves a consensus asymptotically if</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">v 2N aij &lt; 1 2D i + 1 ; 8 i 2 I: (19)</formula><p>Proof: The closed-loop system of (3) with ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">4</ref>) is given by <ref type="bibr">(5)</ref>. Taking the z-transformation of the system (5), we get</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">zX i (z) = X i (z) + v 2N a ij (X j (z)z 0T 0D 0 X i (z)z 0D ); i 2 I (20)</formula><p>where Xi(z) is the z-transformation of xi(k). Define a n 2 n matrix L(z) = f lij (z)g as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">lij (z) = 0aijz 0T 0D ; v j 2 Ni;</formula><p>v 2 a ij z 0D ; j = i; 0;</p><p>otherwise.</p><p>and L(1) = L, which is the Laplacian matrix. Then, (20) can be written as zX(z) = X(z) 0 L(z)X(z); where X(z) = [X 1 (z); . . . ; X n (z)] T . Define p(z) = det((z 0 1)I + L(z)). Then, we will prove that all the zeros of p(z) have modulus less than unity except for a zero at z = 1 in the following. Let z = 1, p(1) = det( L(1)) = det(L). Since G = (V; E; A) has a globally reachable node, 0 is a simple eigenvalue of L, i.e., det(L) = 0 and rank(L) = n 01 (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>). Thus, p(z) indeed has a simple zero at z = 1. Now, we prove that the zeros of f (z) = det(I + (1=(z 0 1)) L(z))</p><p>have modulus less than unity. Based on the general Nyquist stability criterion, the zeros of f (z) have modulus less than unity, if the eigenloci of (1=(e j! 0 1)) L(e j! ), i.e., ((1=(e j! 0 1)) L(e j! )), does not enclose the point (01; j0) for ! 2 [0; ]. By Greshgorin's disk theorem, we have ((1=(e j! 0 1)) L(e j! )) 2 i2I Di for all ! 2 (21)</p><p>The Nyquist plot of Gi(!) for ! 2 [0; ] is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Note that G i (!) is just the center of the disc : 2 C; 0 K i e 0j!D =(e j! 01) K i e 0j!D =(e j! 01) . So, ((1=(e j! 0 1)) L(e j! )) does not enclose the point (01; j0) for all ! 2 [0; ] as long as the point (0a; j0) with a 1 is not in the disc : 2 C; 0K i e 0j!D = (e j! 01) K i e 0j!D =(e j! 01) for all ! 2 [0; ], i.e., 0a + j0 0 K i e 0j!D =(e j! 0 1) &gt; K i e 0j!D =(e j! 0 1) holds for all ! 2 [0; ] when a 1. Thus, a+j0 0 K i (e 0j!D =(e j! 0 1)) 2 0 K i (e 0j!D =(e j! 0 1)) 2 &gt; 0, i.e., a+j0 0 K i (e 0j!D =(e j! 0 1)) &gt; K i e 0j!D =(e j! 0 1) holds for ! 2 [0; ] when a 1.</p><p>Now, we have proved that the zeros of p(z) have modulus less than unity except for a zero at z = 1. Therefore, Theorem 2 is proved by Lemma 1.</p><p>Remark 4: The result of Theorem 2 can be extended to the continuous-time system with communication delays and input delays given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">_ x i (t) = v 2N a ij (x j (t 0 T ij 0 D i ) 0 x i (t 0 D i )); i 2 I: (22)</formula><p>If the interconnection topology digraph of the system has a globally reachable node, then through a similar way shown in the proof of Theorem 2 one can get a consensus condition as</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">D i v 2N a ij &lt; 1 2 ; 8 i 2 I: (23)</formula><p>Remark Noticing the inequality (9), we know that the condition ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>) is more conservative than the condition <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref> given by Theorem 1, which is even necessary and sufficient for in the case of a 1-link, 2-node network with equal delay. Remark 6: When there is no input delays, i.e., Di = 0, the consensus condition (19) for the discrete-time case reduces to v 2N aij &lt; 1, while (23) always holds for the continuous-time case. This conclusion coincides with the existed results in references such as <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>.</p><p>With communication delays and input delays, the linearized Vicsek's model given in <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">x i (k + 1) = x i (k) + 1 1 + n i v 2N (xj (k 0 Tij 0 Di) 0 0 Di) (24)</formula><p>where n i denotes the number of the neighbors of agent i.</p><p>From Theorem 2 we get the following corollary.

This implies that the convergence of the consensus protocol given by Vicsek's model is independent of communication delays provided the graph has a globally reachable node. This coincides with the result given in <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. Cao et al. extended this result to the case when the graph is jointly rooted <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. On the other hand, inequality (25) holds only for Di = 0. This may suggest that Vicsek's model is very sensitive to input delays. To enhance its robustness against input delays, one should introduce small weights as we mentioned in Remark 2.</p></div>

Example 1: Symmetric System</head><p>Consider a system of eighty agents described by the modified linearized Vicsek's model <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(17)</ref>. The interconnection topology for the agents is a closed ring (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2</ref>). Note that under non-zero input delays, the linearized Vicsek's model with unity weights ("i = 1) has no consensus. In simulations, we choose the coupling weights as " 1 = 111 = " 10 = 0:05; " 11 = 111 = " 20 = 0:1; " 21 = 111 = " 30 = 0:15; " 31 = 11 1 = " 40 = 0:2; "41 = 111 = "50 = 0:25; "51 = 11 1 = "60 = 0:3; " 61 = 111 = " 70 = 0:4; " 71 = 11 1 = " 80 = 0:45. By Corollary 1, the admissible values of the input delays are D i 23, i = 1; . . . ; 10; Di 11, i = 11; . . . ; 20; Di 7, i = 21; . . . ; 30; D i 5, i = 31; . . . ; 40; D i 4, i = 41; . . . ; 50; D i 3, i = 51; . . . ; 60; Di 2, i = 61; . . . ; 70; Di 2, i = 71; . . . ; 80.</p><p>Simulations validate that under the admissible input delays the system achieves consensus asymptotically.

For example, with each agent's input delay at boundary, we introduce an identical communication delay, T 1, which destroys the conjugate symmetry of the system matrix in the frequency domain, between each two neighboring agents. Then, the simulation shows the system has no asymptotic consensus.    The boundary determined by Theorem 2 is beneath the boundary given by Corollary 1, which implies that Theorem 2 is more conservative than Corollary 1 for symmetric systems. However, with input delays in the area determined by Theorem 2, the asymptotic consensus of the system is robust to arbitrary communication delays.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Example 2: Asymmetric System</head><p>Consider the multi-agent system (5) with an interconnection digraph shown by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref>. The weights of the directed paths are: a 12 = 0:1, a 16 = 0:05, a 23 = 0:15, a 36 = 0:1, a 43 = 0:05, a 45 = 0:1, a 56 = 0:15, a62 = 0:15, and the corresponding communication delays are:</p><p>T 12 = 5, T 16 = 3, T 23 = 4, T 36 = 4, T 43 = 4, T 45 = 6, T 56 = 6, T62 = 5. Simulation shows that the system is quite sensitive to input delays, and it cannot converge to any consensus when D i &gt; 3. This is an asymmetric system to which Theorem 1 does not apply. Using Theorem 2, we get that Di 2 is a sufficient consensus condition which is independent of communication delays. We choose D i = 2, i = 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6, in the simulation. The multi-agent system converges to a consensus as shown by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this note, we consider the consensus problem with diverse input and communication delays. Two decentralized consensus conditions are obtained. Both conditions are independent of communication delays. The first condition is given only for symmetric systems, while the second one can be used for systems with asymmetric directed topology and/or diverse communication delays. For symmetric systems the condition of Theorem 2 is more conservative than that of Theorem 1. We conjecture that there may still exist a consensus criterion depending on communication delay, which establishes a link between Theorem 1 and Theorem 2.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bin Liu</head><p>Abstract-This note studies stability problem of solutions for stochastic impulsive systems. By employing Lyapunov-like function method and Itô's formula, comparison principles of existence and uniqueness and stability of solutions for stochastic impulsive systems are established. Based on these comparison principles, the stability properties of stochastic impulsive systems are derived by the corresponding stability properties of a deterministic impulsive system. As the application, the stability results are used to design impulsive control for the stabilization of unstable stochastic systems. Finally, one example is given to illustrate the obtained results. Index Terms-Comparison principle, impulsive control, Itô's formula, stability, stochastic impulsive system (SIS).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>There are many real world systems and natural processes which display some kind of dynamic behavior in a style of both continuous and discrete characteristics. For instance, many evolutionary processes, particularly some biological systems such as biological neural networks and bursting rhythm models in pathology, as well as optimal control models in economics, frequency-modulated signal processing systems, and flying object motions, and the like, are characterized by abrupt changes of states at certain time instants. This is the familiar impulsive phenomenon. Often, sudden and sharp changes occur instantaneously, in the form of impulses, which cannot be well described by using pure continuous or pure discrete models. Moreover, it has also been noticed that many real world systems and natural processes may be disturbed by stochastic factors. Therefore, stochastic impulsive system (SIS) can be used as an appropriate description of these phenomena of abrupt qualitative dynamical changes of essentially k ) 0 x(t k ) = I k (x(t)); t = t k ; k 2 N; (1)   where initial condition x(t0) = x0 &gt; 0; x 3 is the equilibria of system _ x(t) = f (t; x), i.e., f (t; x 3 ) = 0; _ B(t) 2 R m represents the white noise and 0 2 R n2m is the noise intensity matrix, and g(x) with g(0) = 0 is some function about species population x; 1x(t k ) means that there are sudden and sharp changes of the species population at some instances t k ; k 2 N . Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) is a SIS. Under environmental noises and impulsive effects, how about the dynamical properties such as stability of system (1)? With respect to the stochastic disturbances, many important results of stability for stochastic systems have been established since Itô introduced his stochastic calculus about 50 years ago, see <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref> and references therein. With respect to impulsive effects, significant progress has also been made in the theory of impulsive differential equations in recent years <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>. However, the theory of SIS has not yet been fully developed. Although there are literatures studied the systems with Markovian jumping parameters (see <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>), few investigations have been carried out for SIS.</p><p>In this note, we aim to study the stability problem of solutions for SIS. We will establish the comparison principles which guarantee the existence and uniqueness and stability (stability, asymptotic stability, and exponential stability) of solutions for this kind of systems. In the literature, the existence and uniqueness of solution of dynamical systems is often derived by using Picard-Lindelüf method. There are very few literatures reported for the existence and uniqueness of solution by using comparison approach. One interesting result in this note is that the existence and uniqueness of solution of SIS can be judged by a deterministic comparison system with known existence property of solution. Thus, the linear growth condition often required for the existence and uniqueness of solution of stochastic systems is relaxed. Another advantage for this kind of comparison principles is that the stability properties of SIS can be derived by the corresponding stability properties of a deterministic impulsive system. Thus, some stability results for impulsive systems in the literature can be used to investigate the stability properties of SIS. Moreover, the stability results are used to design impulsive control for the stabilization of unstable stochastic systems.</p></div>
