<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>S a tradition since the early 1980's, operators and regulators of mobile wireless communication systems roll out a new generation of cellular networks almost every decade. The year 2020 is expected to herald a new dawn with the introduction and possible commercial deployment of the fifthgeneration (5G) cellular networks that will significantly outperform prior generations (i.e., from the first generation (1G) to the fourth generation (4G)). Widespread adoption of 5G networks is anticipated by 2025. The 5G era is foreseen to usher in next-generation mobile networks (NGMNs) that will deliver super-speed connectivity and much higher data rates with more robust reliability, higher spectral efficiency and lower energy consumption than today's legacy systems. This quest is motivated by a mix of economic demands (mobile traffic growth, cost, energy, etc.) and socio-technical concerns (health, environment, technological advances, etc.) which render current standards and systems unsustainable <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Specifically, the ambitious goals set for 5G networks, as compared to the 4G Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) systems include: 1000x higher mobile data traffic per geographical area, 100x higher typical user data, 100x more 1 Normalized with 4G value connected devices, 10x lower network energy consumption and 5x reduced end-to-end latency <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. A quantitative comparison of 4G performance metrics and the corresponding 5G targets is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> [1], <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>However, there is a major problem: 5G must support much higher data rates (100-1000x legacy networks), yet current systems are not very far from the Shannon Limit (albeit, treating other-cell interference (OCI) as noise). Towards this end, the research community identifies three plausible ways to get several orders of magnitude throughput gain: (i) extreme densification of infrastructure, (ii) large quantities of new bandwidth, and (iii) many more antennas, allowing a throughput gain in the spatial dimension. These methods are complementary in many respects. Large swathes of bandwidth require going to higher frequencies, especially the promising millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum with carrier frequencies of 30-300 GHz. These high frequencies require many antennas to overcome the path losses in such an environment (mainly from such small antennas) and enable precisely that because half-wavelength dipole antennas are so small at such frequencies. Furthermore, higher frequencies need smaller cells to overcome blocking and pathloss, while the same channel difficulties (i.e., pathloss and blocking) cause the interference due to densification to decay quickly <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>The amalgam of these three features, ultra-dense networks (UDNs), mmWave spectrum and massive multiple-inputmultiple-output (massive MIMO), which fortunately exhibit symbiotic relationship as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, produces the heterogeneous network (HetNet) architecture and the mmWave massive MIMO paradigm that have emerged as key subjects of research trends for next-generation cellular networks. MmWave massive MIMO springs as a technology that combines the prospects of the huge available mmWave bandwidth on the one hand, and the expected gains from massive MIMO antenna arrays on the other. When the mmWave massive MIMO technology is used in the HetNet topology, next-generation mobile networks can be projected to reap the benefits of the three enablers on a very large scale, and thereby support a plethora of high-speed services and bandwidth-hungry applications not hitherto possible. Although the potential of mmWave Massive MIMO is exciting, the challenges that evolve span the broad fields of communication engineering and allied disciplines. With rapid urbanization and an accelerating number of cellular-enabled devices per person, the density and physical environment these mmWave massive MIMO-based networks will face are new, and the challenges are immense and barely understood. However, the trends are becoming more widely recognized, and models, measurements, analyses and evaluation methodologies are being undertaken and developed for real-life deployment of a hyper-dense urban mmWave massive MIMO-based cellular system <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">[207]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">[209]</ref>. This survey, therefore, attempts to explore the emerging trends, evolving challenges and the proposed solutions for mmWave massive MIMO, in the march towards the 5G era. As a prelude, we present an overview of the three enablers for mmWave massive MIMO HetNets.</p><p>UDN refers to the hyper-dense deployment of small cell base stations (BSs) within the coverage areas of the macrocell BSs. It has been identified as the single most effective way to increase network capacity based on its potentials to significantly raise throughput, increase spectral and energy efficiencies as well as enhance seamless coverage for cellular networks. Small cells are classified as metro, micro, pico or femtocells (in decreasing order of capabilities) based on power range, coverage distance and the number of concurrent users to be served. The rationale behind them is to get users physically close to their serving BSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>The overlay of small cells on traditional macrocells leads to a multi-tier HetNet where the host macrocell BSs handle more efficiently control plane signaling (e.g., resource allocation, synchronization, mobility management, etc.) while the small cell BSs provide high-capacity and spectrally-efficient data plane services to the users <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b226">[227]</ref>. This HetNet topology has the potential to deliver on all fronts: it increases network capacity based on increased cell density and high spatial and frequency reuse; enhances spectral efficiency based on improved average signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) with tighter interference control; and improves energy efficiency based on reduced transmission power and lower pathloss resulting from smaller cell radii or shorter distance between the small cells and their User Equipment (UEs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>The mmWave frequency band (i.e., the extremely high frequency (EHF) range of the electromagnetic spectrum representing 30-300 GHz and corresponding to wavelength 1-10 mm) has an abundant bandwidth of up to 252 GHz. With a reasonable assumption of 40% availability over time, these mmWave bands will possibly open up ~100 GHz new spectrum for mobile broadband applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. Out of this, about 23 GHz bandwidth is being identified for mmWave cellular in the 30-100 GHz bands, excluding the 57-64 GHz oxygen absorption band which is best suited for indoor fixed wireless communications (i.e., the unlicensed 60 GHz band) <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[163]</ref>. As a key enabler for the multi-gigabit-per-second (Gbps) wireless access in NGMNs, mmWave wireless connectivity offers extremely high data rates to support many applications such as short-range communications, vehicular networks, and wireless in-band fronthauling/backhauling, among others.</p><p>Massive MIMO, the third of the triad, is a technology which scales up the number of antenna elements by several orders of magnitude more than the number used in conventional MIMO systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. This is with the aim of reaping the benefits of MIMO on a much larger scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. It has the potential to increase the capacity of mobile networks in manifolds through aggressive spatial multiplexing while simultaneously improving the radiated energy efficiency. Using the excess degrees of freedom (DoF) resulting from its large number of antennas (100 or more), massive MIMO can harness the available space resources to improve spectral efficiency, and with the aid of beamforming, it can suppress interference by directing energy to desired terminals only. This avoids fading dips and thereby reduces the latency on the air interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. When deployed in the mmWave regime, the corresponding small sizes of massive MIMO antennas drastically reduce cost and power, not only by using low-cost low-power components but also by eliminating expensive and bulky components (such as large coaxial cables) and highpower radio frequency (RF) amplifiers at the front-end <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>The three technological enablers are the key ingredients for the expected orders of magnitude throughput gain, and their combined impact is capable of realizing the anticipated 1000fold increase in capacity for 5G networks relative to 4G legacy systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Contributions of the Survey</head><p>MmWave massive MIMO evolves from multiple constituent parts, and so the technology is expected to inherit concepts and benefits of prior technologies such as MIMO, conventional massive MIMO, and mmWave communications, in such a way as to adopt and/or adapt the techniques, as well as engineer new ones. This convergence of different technologies necessitates the design of novel strategies and procedures to incorporate the new characteristics, address the increasing complexities and resolve the emergent challenges, across all the layers and components in the network.</p><p>In this survey, we attempt a holistic overview of the concepts and techniques on the subject from cross-layer design perspectives. The aim, however, is not to describe in detail the theory behind every associated technique but to present the state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques being explored for mmWave massive MIMO systems and how they have evolved over time. It, therefore, serves to describe mmWave massive MIMO and its interplay with legacy technologies, with particular highlights on the areas of convergence and emerging trends.</p><p>To the authors' best knowledge, there has been no survey available in the scientific arena which has discussed mmWave Massive MIMO communication jointly, although there are quite a few surveys available such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">[210]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">[216]</ref>, etc., which deliberated these two technologies separately. These surveys typically overview mmWave MIMO or microwave (μWave) massive MIMO, with mmWave massive MIMO cursorily presented as outlook or future works. However, in order to achieve the 5G goals, these two technologies should be studied together. This survey, therefore, presents concepts and techniques specific to mmWave massive MIMO, with the overview of prior or legacy systems for evolutionary trend purposes only. It thus acts as glue between these two promising technologies for 5G networks and beyond.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Paper Organization</head><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present how the wireless communication technologies have evolved from the single-input-single-output (SISO) to massive MIMO and transitioned from employing μWave to mmWave frequencies. As well, we discuss the main benefits and challenges along the evolutionary line. In Section III, we introduce the candidate architecture for mmWave massive MIMO and discuss the propagation characteristics in this new domain. Section IV then uses a single-cell system model in the downlink to describe the three main communication system blocks (transmitter, channel, and receiver) with respect to their associated techniques and processes such as precoding, an antenna array, channel estimation and feedback, and channel modeling among others. This model is based on the mmWave massive MIMO paradigm, with highlights on how the techniques differ from those of the earlier systems. In Section V, we present the emerging trends, research challenges and proposed solutions for mmWave massive MIMO in the main areas of propagation, transceiver architecture, waveform, multiple access schemes, resource allocation, and wireless fronthaul design. Overview of standardization activities and health and safety issues are presented as well. The conclusion then follows in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. EVOLUTION OF CELLULAR NETWORK TECHNOLOGIES</head><p>Wireless communication has today reached several significant milestones, and the literature is replete with technologies that have enabled the progress so far. Over time, mobile networks' technologies have continued to evolve, pushing legacy systems towards their theoretical limits and motivating research for next-generation networks with better performance capabilities in terms of reliability, latency, throughput, cost, energy and spectral efficiency, among others.</p><p>Cellular networks have undergone remarkable transitions: from SISO at μWave frequencies to the latest legacy system with massive MIMO at μWave frequencies (hereafter referred to as conventional massive MIMO). However, the projections of explosive growth in mobile traffic, unprecedented increase in connected wireless devices and proliferation of increasingly smart applications and broadband services have motivated research for the development of 5G mobile networks. These networks are expected to deliver super-speed connectivity and high data rates, provide seamless coverage, support diverse use cases and satisfy a wide range of performance requirements for which the legacy cellular networks have reached their theoretical limits. This has prompted the research community to consider mmWave massive MIMO with a view to exploiting the joint capabilities of mmWave communication and massive MIMO. We present a brief overview of the road in this direction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. From μWave to mmWave Cellular Networks</head><p>Up till now, the operation of cellular networks has been mainly limited to the congested sub-6 GHz μWave frequency bands. Though these bands have favorable propagation characteristics, the total available bandwidth of about 1-2 GHz is grossly insufficient to support the foreseen traffic demand of next-generation mobile services and applications. This challenge pushes for the exploration of the under-utilized higher frequency bands with an abundant amount of bandwidth (first in the the 30-100 GHz mmWave band where approximately 10 times that available at μWave bands can be exploited) as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>When compared to the congested sub-3 GHz μWave bands used by 2G-4G cellular networks hitherto, and the additional television white space (TVWS) and other sub-6 GHz μWave frequencies approved by the International Telecommunication Union's World Radio Conference (ITU-WRC) 2015 (as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>), the mmWave bands offer several advantages in terms of larger bandwidths which translate directly to higher capacity and data rates, and smaller wavelengths enabling massive MIMO and adaptive beamforming techniques. The relatively closer spectral allocations in the mmWave bands lead to a more homogeneous propagation, unlike the disjointed spectrum in legacy networks. On the other hand, mmWave signals are prone to higher path loss, higher penetration loss, severe atmospheric absorption and more attenuation due to rain, when compared with μWave signals. In addition, they are vulnerable to blockages by objects. Thus, directional communication is employed in mmWave systems to counter the severe propagation losses and avoid interference thereby ensuring higher throughput and better energy efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>However, recent research studies and channel measurement campaigns carried out at different mmWave frequencies (e.g., 28, 38, 60 and 73 GHz) have revealed that mmWave signals can gainfully exploit these challenges by employing adaptive beamforming techniques to suppress interference and use relay stations to circumvent obstacles thereby avoiding blockages <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. More so, for the 50-200 m cell size envisaged for mmWave small cells, the expected 2 Excluding the International Scientific and Medical (ISM) band and the wireless fidelity (WiFi) frequencies at 2.4, 5 and 60 GHz 3 Subject to regional availability 4 Existing allocated IMT spectrum Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>: Directional communications in 5G HetNets 1.4 dB attenuation (i.e., 7 dB/km) due to heavy rainfalls has a minimal effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The high path loss limits inter-cell interference (ICI) and allows more frequency re-use, which by extension improves the overall system capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>In addition, the huge spectrum offered by the mmWave band will enable both the access (BS-UE) and fronthaul/backhaul links to support much higher capacity than present 4G networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In fact, the supposed drawback of short-distance or shortrange mmWave communication perfectly fits into the UDN trend and opens up new avenues for short-range applications such as the potential use in data centers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. From SISO to MIMO to Massive MIMO</head><p>SISO systems employ single antennas at both the transmitters (i.e., BSs) and the receivers (i.e., UEs), while MIMO systems use multiple antennas at both. MIMO offers higher capacity and reliability than SISO systems as its channels have considerable advantages over SISO channels in terms of multiplexing, diversity and array gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The diversity gains of MIMO scale with the number of independent channels between the transmitter and the receiver while the maximum multiplexing gain is the lesser of the number of antennas at the transmitter and receiver units. However, maximum multiplexing and diversity gains cannot be simultaneously reaped from MIMO systems as a fundamental trade-off exists between both. The best of the two gains cannot be achieved concurrently <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Massive MIMO, on the other hand, uses a much larger number of antennas than those used in conventional MIMO systems.</p><p>In evaluating the performance of cellular systems with the different antenna configurations (i.e., SISO to massive MIMO), we consider a single cell, downlink wireless communication system model shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> under the following four scenarios: SISO, single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO), multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) and massive MIMO. The set-up has one transmitter (Tx) with 𝑁 transmit antennas and 𝐾 users, with each user having a receiver (Rx) equipped with 𝑀 receive antennas. SISO is composed of a BS (Tx) and a UE (Rx), each with a single antenna. Given that the received signal y is generally modeled as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝒚 = 𝑯𝒙 + 𝒏<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where H, x, and n represent the channel matrix, transmit signal vector and the noise vector respectively, and n is assumed to be the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) following a complex normal distribution 𝒞𝒩(0, 𝜎) with zero mean and 𝜎 standard deviation. For the SISO scenario, the channel matrix in (1) becomes one-dimensional and scalar. The received signal y reduces to</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝒚 = ℎ𝒙 + 𝒏<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The achievable capacity (bits/s/Hz) of the single link can thus be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝐶 𝑆𝐼𝑆𝑂 = log 2 (1 + 𝛾) = log 2 (1 + ℎ 2 𝑃 𝑡 𝜎 𝑛 2 ) (3)</formula><p>where 𝛾 is signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), 𝑃 𝑡 is the transmit (signal) power, 𝜎 𝑛 2 is the noise power and ℎ is the channel coefficient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Single User MIMO [𝑁 &gt; 1, 𝑀 &gt; 1 and 𝐾 = 1]</head><p>In MIMO antenna array systems, both the transmitters and the receivers are equipped with multiple antennas. This configuration leads to significant increase in the data rates and mean spectral efficiencies of wireless systems without any increase in the SNR or the bandwidth of such systems, as required by the Shannon Capacity theorem on the theoretical limit for SISO systems. In MIMO, the additional increase in capacity comes from spatial multiplexing through multi-stream transmissions from the multiple antennas <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>While the channel capacity of SISO systems increases logarithmically with an increase in system's SNR, that of MIMO systems increases linearly with increasing number of antennas (i.e., scales with the smaller of the number of transmit or receive antenna when the channel is full rank). The gains can be limited (i.e., not exactly linear increase) when the channel is not full rank <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[214]</ref>. This increase is however at the expense of the additional cost of deployment of multiple antennas, space constraints (particularly for mobile terminals) and increased signal processing complexities <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>For the SU-MIMO system with multi-antenna transmitter and receivers, but where only one active user is served or scheduled in a transmission time interval (TTI), the received signal vector, 𝐲 𝑚 ∈ 𝐶 𝑀×1 , can be expressed as  where 𝑛 = {1,2, … , 𝑁} transmit antennas and 𝑚 = {1,2, … , 𝑀} receive antennas. 𝐱 𝑛 ∈ 𝐶 𝑁×1 (transmit signal vector), 𝐧 𝑚 ∈ 𝐶 𝑀×1 (noise and interference vector), 𝐇 𝑚,𝑛 ∈ 𝐶 𝑀×𝑁 (assumed narrow-band time-invariant channel with deterministic and constant channel matrix) and 𝜌 is a scalar representing the normalized transmit power (i.e., the total power of the transmit signal sum to unity, 𝐸{‖𝑥 𝑛 ‖ 2 } = 1).</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝐲 𝑚 = √𝜌𝐇</formula><p>Assuming independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) Gaussian transmit signals, zero-mean circularly symmetric complex Gaussian noise with an identity covariance matrix I and perfect channel state information (CSI) at the receiver, the instantaneous achievable rate (bits/s/Hz) is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">𝐶 𝑆𝑈-𝑀𝐼𝑀𝑂 = log 2 |(𝐈 + 𝜌 N 𝐇𝐇 * )| (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>where N is the number of transmit antennas and the m,n channel subscripts have been dropped.

However, MU-MIMO exploits multi-user diversity in the spatial domain by allocating a timefrequency resource to multiple users, which results in significant gains over SU-MIMO, particularly when the channels are spatially correlated <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. • MU-MIMO BS antennas simultaneously serve many users, where relatively cheap single-antenna devices can be employed at user terminals while expensive equipment is only needed at the BS thereby bringing down cost. • MU-MIMO system is less sensitive to the propagation environment than SU-MIMO system, and so a rich scattering is generally not required.</p><p>For this scenario, the BS transmits simultaneously to multiple users each with a single antenna.

However, despite its great significant advantages over SISO and SU-MIMO antenna systems, MU-MIMO has been identified as a non-scalable technology, and as a sequel, massive MIMO is evolving to scale up the benefits of MIMO significantly. Unlike MU-MIMO which has roughly the same number of terminals and service antennas, massive MIMO has an excess of service antennas over active terminals which can be used for enhancements such as beamforming, in order to bring about improved throughput and energy efficiency.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. DAWN OF MMWAVE MASSIVE MIMO</head><p>MmWave massive MIMO is a promising candidate technology for exploring new frontiers for next-generation cellular systems, starting with 5G networks. It benefits from the combination of large available bandwidth (in mmWave frequency bands) and high antenna gains (achievable with massive MIMO antenna arrays. With enhanced energy and spectral efficiencies, increased reliability, compactness, flexibility, and improved overall system capacity, mmWave massive MIMO is expected to break away from today's technological shackles, address the challenges of the explosively-growing mobile data demand and open up new scenarios for future applications.</p><p>For mmWave massive MIMO systems, maximum benefits can be achieved when different transmit-receive antenna pairs experience independently-fading channel coefficients. This is realizable when the antenna elements' spacing is at least 0.5λ, where λ is the wavelength of the signal. Since λ reduces with increasing carrier frequency, a higher number of elements in antenna arrays of same physical dimension can be realized at mmWave than at μWave frequencies. The realization of this optimal performance is dependent on the availability of accurate CSI <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>. At mmWave frequencies, the dimensions of antenna elements (as well as the inter-antenna spacing) become incredibly small (due to their dependence on wavelength). It thus becomes possible to pack a large number of antenna elements in a physically-limited space, thereby enabling massive MIMO antenna array, not only at the BSs but also at the UEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[175]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[177]</ref>. However, the maximum numbers of antennas under consideration by 3GPP (for example at 70 GHz) are 1024 and 64 for the BSs and UEs, respectively. As for the RF chains, the maximum numbers are 32 and 8 for the BSs and UEs, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">[210]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b223">[224]</ref>.</p><p>With low radiation power (due to small antenna size) and high propagation attenuation, it becomes necessary to use highly-directional, steerable, configurable or smart antenna arrays for mmWave massive MIMO in order to ensure high received signal power for successful detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[177]</ref>. In this section, we give an overview of the architecture for mmWave massive MIMO and the propagation characteristics in this new domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Architecture</head><p>A candidate architecture for the mmWave massive MIMObased 5G network is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. The architecture is a multitier cellular HetNet composed of the macrocell and small cell BSs, all with massive MIMO, μWave, and mmWave communication capabilities. It features several scenarios that are subjects of ongoing research in realizing the 5G goals. Some of these scenarios are highlighted as follows:</p><p>• Split control and data plane framework where the control signals are handled by the long-range μWave massive MIMO macrocell BS (for efficient mobility and other control signaling) while data signals are handled by the mmWave massive MIMO small cells for high capacity. • Dual-mode or dual-band small cells where close-by users are served by mmWave access links while farther-away users are served at μWave frequency band, thereby serving as a dynamic cell and emulating the "cell breathing" concept from legacy networks. • In-band backhauling where both the access and backhaul links are on the same mmWave frequency band to reduce cost and optimize spectrum utilization. • Vehicular communication where the μWave macrocell BSs serve the long-range and highly mobile users. • Virtual cells where a user, particularly cell-edge user, chooses its serving BS without being constrained to be served only by the closest BS as in the legacy user association and handover approach based on coverage zone.</p><p>This architecture, therefore, brings to fore many opportunities in terms of possible scenarios, use cases, and applications. Some of these possibilities have been considered lately for legacy systems. However, the mmWave massive MIMO-based 5G networks show greater potentials in realizing them. The realization of the architecture in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> is being pursued for 5G through multi-disciplinary, cross-layer research. Interoperator resource management (i.e., sharing of spectrum, access, and infrastructure) in mmWave networks is considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">[225]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b225">[226]</ref>. Resource allocation and user scheduling in joint μWave-mmWave dual-mode BSs using novel-contextawareness principles have been proposed by Semiari et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[153]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">[223]</ref>. Fronthaul design options in mmWave massive MIMO-based 5G networks have been discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140]</ref> while the energy and spectral efficiency analysis of wireless backhauling in mmWave-based small cell architectures are provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">[219]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">[220]</ref>. These cross-layer design proposals are further overviewed in Section V.D while the relevant references therein provide detailed discussions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Propagation Characteristics</head><p>Marked differences exist in the propagation characteristics of mmWave massive MIMO networks and those of legacy/conventional cellular systems. At mmWave frequencies, and as the number of BS antennas goes to infinity, the channel characteristics generally become deterministic, different users experience asymptotic channel orthogonality, and fewer user terminals can be supported due to reduced coverage area <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Also, signals propagated at mmWave frequencies experience higher pathloss (with increasing frequency) <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> and have lesser penetrating power through solids and buildings, thereby making them significantly more prone to the effects of shadowing, diffraction and blockage, as the wavelength is typically less than the physical dimensions of the obstacles <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>. In addition, mmWave signals suffer more attenuation due to rain <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>, have increased susceptibility to atmospheric absorption <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref> and experience higher attenuation due to foliage <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>. The attenuations due to atmospheric/molecular absorption and rain as a function of carrier frequency are presented in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> and<ref type="figure">6</ref>, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">[210]</ref>.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>, the specific attenuation due to atmospheric and molecular absorption have peaks around 60 and 180 GHz. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[150]</ref>, using air composition and atmospheric data, have shown that the peaks are due to the high absorption coefficient of oxygen (O2) and water vapor (H2O molecules) at 60 GHz and 180 GHz, respectively. These two frequency bands are thus best suited for short distance indoor applications, and the unlicensed 60 GHz mmWave WiFi has already taken the lead in this direction through its standardization.</p><p>Further, the experienced attenuation and molecular noise at mmWave frequencies (excluding the 60 GHz band) vary with the time of the day, and the season of the year, being more pronounced during the night than the day, and more during winter than in summer, due to the combined effect of the fall in temperature and corresponding rise in humidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[150]</ref>. Though the impact of these attenuation effects limits communication coverage and link quality, the impact is however minimal for the average small cell sizes of 50-200 m envisaged for future cellular networks. More so, beamforming will further be employed to increase the array gains and improve the SNR, in order to counter the effects of the comparatively higher pathloss at mmWave frequencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">[210]</ref>.</p><p>Overall, losses in mmWave systems are higher than those of μWave systems. However, the smaller wavelength (which enables massive antenna arrays) and the huge available bandwidth in the bands can compensate for the losses to maintain and even drastically boost performance gains with respect to spectral and energy efficiencies, provided evolving computational complexity, signal processing, and other implementation issues are addressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>.</p><p>In order to unleash the potentials of mmWave massive MIMO technology, a broad range of challenges spanning the length and breadth of communications theory and engineering has to be addressed. The challenges arise due to the differences in the architecture and propagation characteristics of mmWave massive MIMO networks when compared to prior systems. Among others, the areas of the challenges include: channel modeling, antenna and radio frequency (RF) transceiver architecture design, waveforms and multiple access schemes, information theoretic issues, channel estimation techniques, modulation and energy efficiency issues, medium access control (MAC) layer design, interference management, backhaul transmissions, mobility management, health and safety issues, system-level modeling, experimental demonstrations, tests and characterization, standardization and business models <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Summary and Open Issues</head><p>The propagation characteristics at mmWave frequencies differ from those of μWave frequencies. This has necessitated changes in the architecture and applications of cellular networks, as evident in the candidate architecture shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">IV</ref>, we present a summary of the fundamental differences between conventional (μWave) massive MIMO and mmWave massive MIMO. The comparison in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">IV</ref> shows the challenges which have to be addressed or exploited in order to realize the anticipated benefits of mmWave massive MIMO networks.</p><p>In terms of benefits, the larger bandwidth available in the mmWave bands, when compared the μWave bands, enables new applications such as wireless fronthauling, the higher path loss favors high-rate, short-range communications while the shorter wavelength allows the antennas at both the BSs and UEs to go large (i.e., massive) due to the dramatic reduction in antenna sizes. However, new challenges evolve. The combination of the huge bandwidth and massive antenna arrays translate to a lot of computations and signal processing due to the large amount of CSI that have to be processed for channel estimation and feedback, precoding, etc. Also, mmWave signaling will lead to frequent handover which is undesirable for ultra-dense small cell networks.</p><p>With the mmWave massive MIMO paradigm, the different challenges which surface in the different blocks of the communication system are reviewed in this survey as summarized in the roadmap of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref>, followed by a discussion of the concepts and techniques being explored to address them in the following sections IV and V.  The system is composed of the transmitter, the wireless channel and the receivers (UEs). Using this system set-up, we survey the various blocks and processes making up the three principal components of the system based on mmWave massive MIMO. In this subsection, we review the emerging techniques for the transmitter block of the mmWave massive MIMO communication network, with respect to antenna array design, precoding techniques, and channel estimation processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Antenna Array</head><p>In terms of transmission schemes, beamforming, spatial multiplexing or a combination of both are being used in MIMO systems to improve the performance of wireless links, in terms of achievable throughput. With beamforming, the phases and/or amplitudes of transmitted signals can be controlled, according to the channel environment and desired application <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>. An extensive survey on beamforming types and architectures can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref> and a quick overview on comparison of digital and hybrid beamforming with simulation-based link level performance can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>.</p><p>There are three types of antenna array architecture (including the RF chain) that have evolved over time: fullydigital, fully-analog, and hybrid analog-digital architecture. A fully-digital implementation employs dedicated RF front-end and digital baseband per antenna, which for the mmWave massive MIMO is prohibitively costly and practically infeasible due to tight space constraints. The fully-analog array, on the other hand, uses only one RF chain with multiple analog phase shifters (PS). It has simple hardware structure but suffers from poor system performance. Also, it has low antenna gain, as only the phases of the signals, but not their amplitudes can be controlled. The more feasible and practical approach, according to research trends, is the massive hybrid array which consists of multiple analog sub-arrays with their own respective digital chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[177]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[180]</ref>.</p><p>In the massive hybrid array architecture, antenna elements are grouped into analog sub-arrays. Only one PS is dedicated to a single antenna element; all other components are shared by all antenna elements in each sub-array. Each sub-array is fed with only one digital input (in the transmitter) and outputs only one digital signal (at the receiver), and all digital signals from all the sub-arrays are jointly processed in a digital processor. Overall, this hybrid structure, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>, significantly reduces the cost, number of required hardware components and system complexity, and the performance is roughly comparable with the optimal (but costly and unfeasible) fully-digital architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b210">[211]</ref>. High-performance prototypes of the hybrid arrays are already being built and tested. Examples are the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[181]</ref> and Samsung's <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[182]</ref> prototypes.</p><p>In general, the prohibitively high cost and power consumption discourage the use of digital beamforming for mmWave massive MIMO systems. Hybrid beamforming, with less RF chain than the number of antennas, is feasible for mmWave massive MIMO and exhibits only a negligible performance loss when compared to the digital beamformer, which though has optimal performance for conventional MIMO systems but practically infeasible for mmWave massive MIMO systems.</p><p>Spatial multiplexing can be used to drastically boost the system capacity of mmWave massive MIMO channels as the number of BS and UE antennas is much larger than in conventional systems. It increases transmission throughput by subdividing outgoing signals into multiple streams where each stream is transmitted simultaneously and in parallel on the same channel through different antennas. At μWave frequencies, signals are easily diffracted by physical objects thereby leading to several reflected signals from the different scatters. Such rich-scattering environment favors independent and parallels data streams which increase spatial multiplexing gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>.</p><p>However, mmWave channels are specular and have low rank, particularly for LOS. They tend to have a lower number of time clusters and spatial lobes (or generally less multipath components) compared to μWave. They are thus incapable of exploiting all available DoF (i.e., only a couple of spatial streams can be supported), thereby limiting achievable multiplexing gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>.</p><p>Also, sufficient decorrelation between different closely-spaced antennas needed by the channels for optimal spatial multiplexing is usually unrealizable in most practical systems such as mmWave indoor <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>. Works such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref> explored spatial multiplexing for single-user mmWave systems and <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref> for multi-user mmWave applications.</p><p>In terms of structure, antenna arrays are typically designed as either uniform linear array (ULA) or uniform planar array (UPA) as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>. However, UPAs are of more interest for mmWave massive MIMO channels as they yield smaller antenna array dimensions, thereby facilitating the packing of more antenna elements in a reasonably-sized array and enabling beamforming in the elevation domain (also known as 3D beamforming). The array response vector for ULA is expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">𝑎 𝑈𝐿𝐴 (𝜙) = 1 √𝑁 [1, 𝑒 𝑗 2𝜋 𝜆 𝑑 sin 𝜙 , … , 𝑒 𝑗(𝑁-1) 2𝜋 𝜆 𝑑 sin 𝜙 ] 𝑇<label>(11)</label></formula><p>For UPAs, the array response vector is 𝑎 𝑈𝑃𝐴 (𝜙, 𝜃) = ] 𝑇 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> where λ denotes the wavelength, d is the inter-element spacing, 𝜙 is the azimuth angle, 𝜃 is the elevation (or zenith) angle and N is the number of antenna elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p><p>In the case of UPAs, 𝑁 = 𝑊 1 𝑊 2 where 𝑊 1 and 𝑊 2 represent the number of elements on the horizontal and vertical, respectively, with 0 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ W 1 -1 and 0 ≤ 𝑦 ≤ W 2 -1.   Antenna array elements can be arranged in interleaved or localized mode. The two types of array configurations in hybrid uniform square arrays are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>. Each square represents an antenna element with squares of the same color representing antenna elements in the same analog subarray. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[179]</ref>, localized arrays have higher performance and better support for systems with relatively larger angles of arrival (AoAs). Interleaved arrays have narrower beamwidth which is advantageous but is harder to implement due to space constraints. Precoding techniques, which we review in the next subsection, are determined by the type of antenna array architecture employed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Precoding Techniques</head><p>The design of precoding schemes is highly essential for mmWave massive MIMO cellular systems. Precoders optimize the performance of mobile networks using the concept of interference cancellation in advance, by controlling the phases and/or amplitudes of original signals. This process is also known as beamforming, and it aims at transmitting pencilshaped beams that point directly at intended terminals with minimal or no interference at unintended ones. Precoding schemes can generally be classified into three: digital precoding, analog beamforming, and hybrid (analog-digital) precoding specified to the three architectures introduced in subsection IV-A-1 above. While analog beamforming can only be employed for single-stream single-user systems, both digital and hybrid precoding schemes can be used for single-user as well as multi-user systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. We present an overview of the three schemes in this sub-section.</p><p>(i) Analog beamforming: This is used to control the phases of signals with the single data stream in order to realize optimal antenna array gain and effective SNR. With perfect knowledge of the CSI available at both the BS and the UE, the analog beamformer employs N antennas at the BS with only one RF chain to send a single data stream to a terminal (i.e., UE) with M antennas and only one RF chain too.</p><p>This concept is also called beam steering and aims at the design of the analog beamformer vector f and analog combiner w which maximizes the effective SNR, using the conditions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</p><p>(𝐰 𝑜𝑝𝑡 , 𝐟 𝑜𝑝𝑡 = arg max|𝒘 * 𝐇𝐟| 2 )</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">subject to: 𝑤 𝑖 = √𝑁 -1 𝑒 𝑗𝜑 𝑖 , ⩝ 𝑖, (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">𝑓 𝑙 = √𝑀 -1 𝑒 𝑗𝜑 𝑙 , ⩝ 𝑙</formula><p>However, perfect CSI is unrealistic in practical systems, thus necessitating beam training where both the UE and the BS collaborate in selecting the best beamformer (at the BS end) and combiner (at the user end) pair (|f|-|w| pair) from pre-defined codebooks in order to optimize performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. For mmWave massive MIMO systems, the codebook sizes could be very large due to a large number of antennas, together with the accompanying huge overheads. In solving this, a systematic beam training scheme was proposed by Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> which reduces the overhead and limits the potentially exhaustive codebooks search using a hierarchical approach.</p><p>Similarly, Cordeiro et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> proposed a single-sided beam training scheme using a two-step approach, which was adopted by the IEEE 802.11ad standard, where the combiner is first fixed to search for the best precoder exhaustively, and later the found best precoder is fixed to search for the best combiner exhaustively. Though analog beamforming has simple hardware requirement (only one RF chain), it suffers severe performance loss as only the phases of transmitting signals can be controlled. More so, an extension of the scheme to multi-user systems seem not trivial <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, and so it cannot be used for mmWave massive MIMO networks.</p><p>(ii) Digital precoding: This can control both the phases and amplitudes of signals to be transmitted and can be employed in both single-user and multi-user systems. Digital precoding schemes are classified as either linear or non-linear.</p><p>Single-user, linear precoding schemes employ N antennas at the BS to transmit M data streams to a user with M antennas (M &lt; N). The (𝑁 × 𝑀) precoder D uses N RF chains. Examples of such linear precoders include the Matched Filter (MF), Zero Forcing (ZF) and the Wiener Filter (WF) precoder, in increasing order of complexity and performance. The precoder models are expressed in ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">16</ref>), respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, where H is the 𝑀 × 𝑁 </p><p>On the other hand, multi-user systems employing digital precoders simultaneously transmit to K mobile terminals, where each terminal is equipped with M antennas and the BS equipped with N antennas, N RF chains and (𝑁 × 𝑀𝐾) precoders, such that (𝑀𝐾 ≤ 𝑁) and the kth user has (𝑁 × 𝑀) digital precoder 𝐃 k = [𝐃 1 , 𝐃 2 , … , 𝐃 K ] with total transmit power constraint ‖𝐃 k ‖ 𝐹 = 𝑀. The received signal by the kth terminal is thus expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">𝑦 𝑘 = 𝐇 𝑘 ∑ 𝑫 𝒏 𝒙 𝑛 + 𝒏 𝑘 𝐾 𝑛=1<label>(17)</label></formula><p>where 𝒙 𝑛 of size (𝑀 × 1) is the original signal vector before precoding with normalized power. 𝐇 𝑘 which is of size (𝑀 × 𝑁) is the mmWave massive MIMO channel matrix between the BS and the kth UE, and 𝒏 𝑘 is an AWGN vector with entries following i.i.d distribution 𝒞𝒩(0, 𝜎 𝑛 2 ). From ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">17</ref>), the terms 𝐇 𝑘 𝑫 𝒏 𝒙 𝑛 for 𝑛 ≠ 𝑘 are interferences to the kth UE. For Block Diagonization (BD) precoder design <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">[185]</ref>, 𝑫 𝒏 is chosen to satisfy the condition 𝐇 𝑘 𝑫 𝒏 = 𝟎.</p><p>Examples of other linear, multi-user digital precoders include the optimal Dirty Paper Coding (DPC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> and the near optimal Tomlinson-Harashima (TH) precoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, both of which have excellent performance but high computational complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Generally, digital precoders have better performance than analog beamformers, as they are able to control both the phases and amplitudes of transmit signals. However, with their use of one dedicated RF chain per antenna, they, unfortunately, have higher energy consumption and prohibitive hardware cost, which make them impractical for mmWave massive MIMO systems.</p><p>(iii) Hybrid precoding: This is a promising scheme for mmWave massive MIMO cellular networks as it offers a significant reduction in the number of required RF chains and the associated energy consumption and cost (when compared with digital precoding), yet achieving near-optimal performance. It realizes this hybrid configuration by employing a small-size digital precoder with a small number of RF chains to cancel interference in the first step, and a large-size analog beamformer with a large number of only phase shifters (i.e., without RF chains) in the second step to increase the antenna array gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p><p>For a single-user system, hybrid precoders can be grouped into two structural classes: (i) the spatially-sparse hybrid precoder (a fully-connected architecture where all BS antennas are connected to each RF chain via phase shifters) and (ii) the successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based hybrid precoder (a sub-connected architecture where only a subset of BS antennas are connected to each RF chain), as shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12 (a</ref>) and (b), respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. For a multi-user system, Alkhateeb et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> proposed a two-stage hybrid precoder that employs the BS analog precoder and the UE analog combiner to jointly maximize the desired signal power of each user in the first stage, and in the second stage employs BS digital precoder to manage multi-user interference. For a multi-user hybrid precoding scheme, consider a mmWave massive MIMO system with N BS antennas and NRF RF chains such that 𝑁 𝑅𝐹 ≤ 𝑁 , and K terminals each with M antennas and only one RF chain. For a fully connected hybrid precoder system, the BS employs a 𝐾 × 𝐾 digital precoder in the baseband 𝐃 k = [𝐃 1 , 𝐃 2 , … , 𝐃 K ] followed by 𝑁 × 𝐾 analog precoder 𝐀 k = [𝐀 1 , 𝐀 2 , … , 𝐀 K ] , such that the transmitted signal becomes 𝐱 = 𝐀𝐃𝐬 .

The authors established that hybrid precoders outperform analog beamformers in terms of achievable rate (bps/Hz) and approaches the optimal performance of digital precoders, particularly as the number of BS antennas get large, which is good for mmWave massive MIMO systems.</p><p>Other hybrid precoding schemes such as the minimal Euclidean hybrid precoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, mean-squared error (MSE)based precoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> and more advanced hybrid precoding technologies or circuitry such as the 1-bit Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> and beamspace MIMO <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> have recently been proposed, with a view to reducing the energy consumption and hardware cost of precoders. This is in order to make them realistic and practical for mmWave massive MIMO systems while keeping complexity modest.

This CSI is obtained via uplink pilots in TDD-based systems with the assumption of channel reciprocity or fed back to the BSs by the UEs in FDDbased systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. In this subsection, we discuss channel estimation in TDD systems, while CSI feedback in FDD systems is discussed in subsection IV-C.</p><p>TDD protocol exploiting channel reciprocity is popular for large antenna systems, where uplink pilots are used for channel estimation and subsequent downlink precoding and transmission. For mmWave massive MIMO systems, the knowledge of the CSI at the BS is very important in realizing spatial multiplexing <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and is critical for high system performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Since both uplink and downlink in TDD systems operate on same frequency bands, the use of uplink pilots whose demand for time-frequency resources is only dependent on the number of receive antennas is both feasible and realistic for channel estimation. With TDD, CSI is obtained using uplink training of pilots, as the downlink channel matrix is assumed a conjugate of the uplink channel matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>Uplink pilots should ideally be orthogonal from one terminal to the other. However, in multi-cellular MIMO systems, a dearth of orthogonal pilot sequences can result. This shortage becomes more pronounced in massive MIMO systems due to the large number of users, and much more difficult in mmWave massive MIMO due to shorter coherence interval. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, the maximum number of distinct orthogonal pilot signals that can be assigned to users in each cell is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">𝑃𝑖𝑙𝑜𝑡𝑠 𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 𝐶𝑜ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑙 (𝑇 𝑐𝑜ℎ ) 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑙 𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑦 𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑 (𝐷𝑆)<label>(20)</label></formula><p>With a limited number of orthogonal pilot sequences, users in neighboring cells employ pilots which no longer remain orthogonal to those within the cell, thereby leading to the effect termed pilot contamination <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. This corrupts the CSI obtained at BS and reduces achievable throughput <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Users in neighboring cells re-use pilots which are on the same frequency thereby generating directed interference. And unlike intra-cell interference, the generated directed interference does not disappear as the number of transmit antennas increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, which thus degrades system performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Pilot contamination is a challenge for mmWave massive MIMO systems as it presents a limit on the upper bound of the achievable sum-rate throughput. For avoiding intracell pilot contamination, orthogonal pilot transmission is employed, but it limits the number of users that can be scheduled in a cell within a coherence interval. This also leads to significant overhead in the uplink, as amply demonstrated by Marzetta et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref>.</p><p>In orthogonal pilot assignment systems, the transmission time of each coherence interval of N symbols is divided into four overlapping phases: channel training, uplink data, processing time and downlink data as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13</ref>. Here, though the uplink and downlink data are transmitted in superimposed, non-orthogonal mode and are separated by Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA), the pilot symbols must be transmitted in an orthogonal fashion and only limited K users corresponding to the number of allowable pilots can be scheduled. Under this setting, the number of active users that can be served is set to   One particularly notable and promising technique that is being proposed for mmWave massive MIMO system is the use of semi-orthogonal multiple access (SOMA) scheme, as against the conventional orthogonal pilot allocation and access scheme used in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Access (OFDMA). SOMA proves to combat the problem of pilot contamination and eases resource allocation as more users can be scheduled within a coherence interval.</p><p>Khormuji in <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[137]</ref> developed a novel uplink transmission mode employing SOMA, using a single cell multi-user massive MIMO scenario (extensible to mmWave massive MIMO regime). The SOMA approach not only extends the number of users that can be scheduled but also increases the cell's sumrate throughput. In this access strategy, 𝐾 = 𝑁 -1 users can be scheduled in each coherence bandwidth. The pilots are transmitted over orthogonal time-frequency resources thereby avoiding interference and pilot contamination, while the uplink data are transmitted such that some users appear orthogonal and others appear non-orthogonal (and hence the name semiorthogonal), as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">14</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[137]</ref>, simulation results and comparative analyses of the achievable sum-rate by the conventional TDD, SOMA and its generalized form (GSOMA) are presented. The results show that SOMA can provide 70-100% gain in throughput as compared to the conventional TDD, with higher complexity of the receiver being the tradeoff cost for SOMA's enhanced performance.</p><p>The received superimposed noisy baseband signals/data are processed using sequential filtering and SIC at the receiver, employing minimum mean squared error (MMSE) channel estimator followed by spatial MF (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[137]</ref> for a full analysis of the model). The scheme is thus capable of receiving 𝑁(𝑁-1) 2 error-free symbols from serving 𝐾 = 𝑁 -1 users (upper bound). The SOMA scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[137]</ref> achieves a throughput nearly twice as that of the baseline conventional TDD <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. To ensure fairness among the 𝐾 = 𝑁 -1 users such that each user achieves roughly the same average throughput, the ordering of the users (shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">14</ref>) can be reshuffled at every coherence interval.</p><p>In mitigating the effects of pilot contamination in mmWave massive MIMO systems, several approaches have been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> which largely classify into: pilot contamination precoding which takes network structure into account, blind techniques which avoids the use of pilots altogether or optimal pilot allocation/coordination techniques which adapt the use of pilot sequences or use less aggressive frequency reuse factors for pilots thereby making mutually contaminating cells far apart.</p><p>Accurate CSI is highly critical for the full exploitation of the huge potential benefits of mmWave massive MIMO systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, but its acquisition via channel estimation is more challenging in mmWave massive MIMO systems than in conventional massive MIMO due to the following <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>:</p><p>• Doubly massive system with limited massive MIMO (dozens of the antenna) at the UE, which combined with the hundreds of antennas at the BS, result in high pilot overhead, even for TDD-based systems employing channel reciprocity • Demand for both CSI at the Transmitter (CSIT) and CSI at the Receiver (CSIR), for precoding in the downlink and combining in the uplink, respectively, since both the BS and MS employ massive MIMO as against conventional massive MIMO where only the BS goes massive • Special hardware constraints arising from low-cost, small-size and low-energy consumption considerations of the very large number of components (ADCs, Digital to Analog Converters (DACs), synthesizers, mixers and other hardware in the RF chains) for mmWave massive MIMO systems • Low SNR before beamforming resulting from increased thermal noise with increased available bandwidth and increased Doppler shift due to the high carrier frequency and the blockage effect at mmWave frequencies Inspired by the above challenges, cost and energy-efficient SOTA transceiver architectures that exploit the sparsity of mmWave channels and the low-rank property of mmWave massive MIMO channels have been proposed. This is to simplify channel estimation by using the concept of compressive sensing (CS). These transceivers use RF chains that are much smaller than the number of BS and UE antennas. Examples are the transceiver structure with analog phase shift networks (cascade of analog RF beamformer and digital baseband precoder), and the transceiver with low resolution (1bit) ADC at the receiver. These transceivers exhibit negligible performance loss for mmWave massive MIMO when compared with conventional MIMO systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. With respect to sparsity exploited with the concept of CS, channel estimation schemes can be classified as either CS-based or non-CS-based, as hereunder discussed.</p><p>(i) CS-based Channel Estimation Schemes: CS theory posits that an original signal which exhibits sparsity in some transformation domains can be recovered from far fewer samples than those required by the classical Shannon-Nyquist theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Most real-world signals are inherently redundant or correlated, and therefore sparse. As a result, the effective information rates of continuous signals are much smaller than their bandwidth. Similarly, the number of effective degrees of freedom of corresponding discrete signals is usually much smaller than their dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p><p>Channel estimation (CE) in mmWave massive MIMO systems can thus be realized by transforming channel measurement signals into sparse matrices, compressing the sparse signals into signals with far lower dimensions than real mmWave massive MIMO channel estimates and finally recovering the original signals from the compressed signals. These three stages form the fundamentals of CS theory and CSbased channel estimation schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>.</p><p>In mathematical terms, compressive sensing problems are formulated as follows.

By exploiting the sparsity of mmWave massive MIMO channels, CS theory estimates large-sized channels from small-sized measurements, via the careful design of the transformation matrix which transforms the channel vectors into sparse signals. The first step is realized by formulating channel estimation as a CS problem followed by the reconstruction of the original sparse signals of high dimensions from the measurements of low dimension.</p><p>Classical orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm is an example of sparse channel estimation schemes from which most other SOTA channel estimators derive their basis, due to its low complexity and good performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. Multi-grid OMP (MG-OMP) is the improved version with its adaptive capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Both OMP and MG-OMP are based on the hybrid MIMO transceiver architecture. Maximal Likelihood (ML) estimators represent another set of CE schemes exploiting sparsity. Examples are the expectationmaximization (EM) algorithm, and its combination with the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) called EM-GAMP. Their architecture is based on the 1-bit (low-resolution) ADCs at the receiver. The 1-bit ADC configuration has simpler architecture and consumes less energy, with only a slight loss in performance when compared with the other estimators <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</p><p>(ii) Non-CS-based Channel Estimation Schemes: Parametric CE schemes such as the super-resolution sparse channel estimator and its multi-user multi-stream hybrid beamforming/combining counterpart (Heuristic algorithm) <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> use a limited set of channel parameters (path gains, AoAs and angles of departure (AoDs)) to fully estimate the channel. In addition, they employ continuous AoAs and AoDs as against discrete sets of AoA and AoD used by CS-based schemes. They also use architectures with reduced number of RF chains to realize good system performance that approaches the optimal performance of fully-digital precoding/combining schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p><p>The problems with parametric channel estimators are that they require a priori information of the array manifold and estimate the entire full channel. Sub-space Estimation and Decomposition (SED)-based CEs, which have been employed in conventional MIMO systems can be extended to mmWave massive MIMO systems. They do not require a priori information and only estimate the eigenmodes of the dominated singular values which are effective and sufficient for transmission. However, these schemes employ multiple amplify and forward (AF) operations which inadvertently introduce much noise and degradation in the accuracy of the channel estimation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. Analysis of the above parametric CE schemes are fully presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p><p>The channel estimation schemes proposed for mmWave massive MIMO channels so far have practical limitations and are still subject of extensive research in some key areas. First, while optimal digital precoding and combining patterns have been proposed, the corresponding optimal analog beamforming and combining pattern design is still a subject of research. Second, the assumption of discrete AoA/AoD in sparse channel estimation algorithms leads to quantization error, as against continuous AoA/AoD in practice. And third, adaptive CS-based CE schemes would have to be developed for special scenarios (such as indoor office) where mmWave massive MIMO channels are non-sparse <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. Along with these, modifications to CE schemes used in conventional systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> such as the widely-adopted/standardized codebook-based channel estimators may be helpful in the search for optimal CE schemes for mmWave massive MIMO systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p><p>In scaling up link capacity of mmWave massive MIMO systems, beamforming and spatial multiplexing are essential, and both depend on reliable CSI acquisition, whether for Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) or Time Division Duplexing (TDD) mode. TDD-based CSI acquisition is more common in mmWave massive MIMO systems as it is more economical to send pilots from the UEs to the BSs, as the number of users is far lesser than the BS antennas. Extensive works on CSI acquisition are available in the literature. However, application to the mmWave band has to factor in the effects of less coherence time due to Doppler shifts <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref>, higher CSI learning overhead particularly for mobile environment, higher probability of link outage due to beamforming mis-alignment and blockage <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> and loss in available DoF resulting from hybrid precoding employing lower number of RF chains than antennas <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>. Research efforts have identified increased training period as important for improved and accurate CSI acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref>, and the optimization of the training duration can be formulated as a concave maximization problem with global optimal solution obtainable via convex optimization tools such as CVX <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref>.</p><p>Besides CS and non-CS-based CE schemes, precoding coefficients can be designed without recourse to either channel estimation or feedback. In this scheme, each BS relies on its own capability of receive beamforming by using previous uplink signaling from the UE for partial CSI acquisition. Such signaling (e.g., random access request, acknowledgement of previous downlink transmission, etc.) do not contain downlink CSI information and this is without additional usage of transmission bandwidth or radio resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. Similar to the concept of channel reciprocity used by TDDbased cellular systems, FDD systems can exploit the property that for a particular UE, AoAs at the BSs have strong correlations with the AoDs from that UE <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. In this approach, downlink precoders/beamformers steer transmit power to desired directions such that target UEs receive the most power in a way that limits or minimizes interference from neighboring UEs. This is implemented using a beamspace division method where the angular domain space is divided into M mutually orthogonal beams. To reduce interference to other UEs due to large beamforming sidelobe power (if the number of BS antennas is small) or minimize the sensitivity to errors resulting from narrow beamwidth (for large size antenna system), these precoder designs are proposed to boost transmission energy to desired UEs and suppress interference caused to other UEs located at different locations.</p><p>Some of the other multi-user precoder designs with no CSI feedback being explored include the Diagonal Loading (DL) approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> from radar technology and the Classical Parks-McClellan (PM) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> based on spatial-domain filter design approach. Channel models, simulations, and analysis of the proposed precoder designs in comparison with the beamspace division method and the ideal Block Diagonalization (BD) method are presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. Even without CSI feedback, these two proposed algorithms only exhibit slight performance degradation (in terms of sum rate (bps/Hz)) when compared to the ideal BD method which requires full, accurate CSI feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>.</p></div>

The overview of both methods with respect to mmWave massive MIMO is given in the following subsections. 1) Channel Measurement Channel measurement techniques are widely used for studying the properties of wireless channels. With field measurement results, the statistical and/or deterministic properties and profiles of the channels are extracted and modeled. Sounding techniques are being used extensively in wireless channel modeling, and more recently for the mmWave frequency bands.

Contrary to earlier thoughts, research and field trials point to the suitability of mmWave frequencies for mobile applications, particularly for pico and femto cells which typically do not involve highvelocity users.

Some of the techniques being explored for the reduction of the burden of CSI feedbacks in mmWave massive MIMO systems include: compressive sensing-based CSI feedback and CSI feedback based on multi-stage beamforming <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>.</p><p>(i) Channel Feedback with Compressive Sensing: CS, introduced in subsection IV-B-3, can also be adopted to reduce the feedback overheads required for CSI reporting by compressing the channel responses. With a sparsifying basis or sparsifying transformation matrix 𝛹, the channel matrix H is compressed and encoded as a 𝐾 × 1 vector with a compression ratio 𝜂 = 𝐾 𝑀×𝑁 where K is smaller than 𝑀 × 𝑁. S is the sparse form of H, and the channel matrix H can be recovered by applying the inverse sparsifying transform: 𝑯 = 𝛹 𝑇 𝑺 .

Examples of CS-based feedback mechanisms are the two-dimensional discrete cosine transformation (2D-DCT), the Karhunen-Loeve transformation (KLT) and the hybrid of both which evolves into a CSI feedback protocol with an adaptive sparsifying basis as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>.</p><p>Compact physical sizes resulting from the small antenna spacing of massive MIMO arrays dictate that some of the infrastructure nodes such as small cell BSs and remote radio heads (RRHs) have channel matrix entries with strong spatial correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, and therefore a sparse representation in certain domains other than space <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. This approach potentially reduces the required CSI feedback payload for massive MIMO systems. However, the assumption of high spatial correlation among the antennas makes the CS-based CSI feedback approach, which relies on sparse channel representation, invalid for mmWave massive MIMO systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>.</p><p>1553-877X (c) 2017 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission. See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information. This approach explores the technique of multi-stage beamforming and feedback where UEs only perceive signal energy and estimate channels in a few beamforming directions. This reduces the dimensionality of the desired channel as the number of propagation paths in such a beamformed signal is much lower than in conventional systems where CSI of a large number of antennas are measured and reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. While the two-stage beamforming comprises the beam selection and the beam-based CSI reporting phases, the three-stage beamforming has an additional intermediate phase where the user measures the transmitter correlation matrix and feeds back the eigenvectors to the BS. These two examples of multi-stage beamforming techniques are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">18</ref> and 19, respectively. Overall, both TDD and FDD modes have pros and cons. Though TDD simplifies CSI acquisition with the use of uplink pilots particularly for mmWave massive MIMO systems and is easily adopted for modeling and simulation studies, it does not account for ICIs specific to downlink transmission, it is prone to inaccuracies due to transmitter-receiver mismatch and as well as prone to pilot contamination effect which limits system performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>.</p><p>FDD systems, on the other hand, use dedicated feedback mechanism where UEs report measured channel information to the BSs, which is more accurate and less sensitive to latency, since the uplink and downlink transmissions operate at different frequencies. Accurate CSI is critical for improved systems performance, and decreased latency is important for missioncritical applications in next-generation networks. However, dedicated feedback in FDD systems consumes radio resources, particularly in mmWave massive MIMO systems, thereby resulting in massive overhead. It also requires the use of larger codebooks thus necessitating lower coding rates which inadvertently affects the reliability of the CSI feedbacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. System performance metrics of interest will therefore dictate the duplexing mode to adopt and the required design tradeoffs.   </p></div>

Summary and Open Issues</head><p>The techniques for mmWave massive MIMO at the three communication blocks (i.e., transmitter, channel and receiver) have been reviewed in this section, based on the downlink setup. MmWave signals have propagation features that are markedly different from those of μWave systems. These distinctive features have to be incorporated in the new channel models. Field measurement campaigns and analytical modeling, which are important for the simulation, test and validation of system performance, are being undertaken by various research groups and projects. Also, prototypes of hybrid antenna arrays are already being built and tested. In addition, various algorithms, schemes and techniques are being proposed for mmWave massive MIMO systems in the areas of precoding, channel estimation, channel feedback, among others.

Many of the proposed concepts and techniques which have been overviewed here are still in the exploratory phase. While energy and spectral efficiency analysis of networks employing mmWave massive MIMO are ongoing, performance in real-life deployments still remains an open issue. More channel measurement campaigns in different parts of the world are also still needed for representative channel models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Access Scheme and User Scheduling</head><p>Another factor which influences link level performance of the mmWave system is the access strategy. To this end, research trends orient in the direction of separation architecture where the user plane and control plane are decoupled <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>. In this network topology, critical control data (for mobility management, synchronization, resource allocation, etc.) are reliably transmitted on μWave links between the macrocell BSs and UEs while the small cells handle the high-capacity and spectrally-efficient data plane services on mmWave frequency bands. This layout leads to enhanced reliability in communication, higher cell capacity and improved user throughput <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref>.</p><p>Besides access links, the mmWave frequency bands are also being promoted for backhaul networks with a view to advancing deployment flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. For the joint design of access and backhaul networks, several research solutions are being explored. The design and implementation challenges in this respect are discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref>, with scheduling and resource allocation challenges considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>.</p><p>MAC refers to the strategies or schemes with which a BS communicates with multiple users in the downlink and by which multiple users communicate with the BS in the uplink. MAC designs entail how communication resources (time, frequency and space) are assigned to the user(s) <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref>. With the adoption of packet-switched networks for cellular systems since the late 1990s (i.e., from 2.5/3G systems), user scheduling and multiuser diversity have remained two key aspects of MAC designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref>.</p><p>User scheduling is the process of dynamically selecting some users for each communication resource block among many active users in the cell based on their channel conditions while multi-user diversity refers to the diversity gain realized from selecting a user or users with good channel conditions among many users with independent channel fading for each resource block, such that the overall system performance is optimized <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119]</ref>.</p><p>User scheduling can be in one, two or three dimensions of time, frequency, and space. The OFDM/OFDMA which was adopted as the physical layer transmission technology in 3GPP LTE allows two-dimensional time-frequency resource allocation. With the incorporation of MIMO technology, MIMO-OFDM networks allow user scheduling in three dimensions of time, frequency, and space. For each resource block, multiple data streams can be transmitted to either only one user (SU-MIMO) or to multiple users simultaneously (MU-MIMO) in the three dimensions, where multiple spatiallyseparated users can be scheduled simultaneously on the same time-frequency resource block based on SDMA using beamforming. MU-MIMO is capable of realizing full multiplexing gain thus achieving optimal sum-rate capacity of MIMO broadcast (BC) networks using smart scheduling algorithms, compared to SU-MIMO which is capable of realizing only a small fraction of the capacity, particularly when the number of BS transmit antennas is larger than receive antennas <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[120]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref>.</p><p>With the evolution of massive MIMO, user scheduling becomes more simplified due to the concept of channel hardening where small-scale channel fading vanishes. This thus allows the entire bandwidth to be allocated to each scheduled user separated by MIMO in the spatial domain. The challenge here, however, is that large amount of signaling (CSI feedback) is required from each user due to the large dimension of channel vectors. Several scheduling algorithms and resource allocation techniques working with non-ideal or partial CSI have been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[127]</ref> for massive MIMO cellular systems without significant loss in system performance. These new scheduling algorithms have largely been explored for the sub-6 GHz μWave frequency bands. Thus, they have to be revised for mmWave massive MIMO systems due to the remarkably different propagation characteristics in the μWave and mmWave bands. The works of Lee et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[131]</ref> are quintessential in this respect. Beyond the basic schedulers such as the maximum rate, round robin (RR) and proportionally fair (PF) schedulers, more efficient scheduling algorithms such as the DPC and the greedy user selection method based on ZF beamforming and DPC (gZF-DP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[132]</ref> have been proposed and developed, and more recently the low-complexity random beamforming (RBF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref> and semi-orthogonal user selection (SUS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref> which are easier for practical implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref>.</p><p>Using RBF as a case study, Lee et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref> showed that scheduling based on partial CSI is not optimal for mmWave massive MIMO where the sum capacity is expected to scale with the number of BS antennas, as it requires the number of active users in the cell to increase exponentially, which is impractical under rich scattering environments. Given a constraint on the total amount of feedback, the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133]</ref> concluded that it is preferable to obtain accurate CSI feedback from a small number of users than to get coarse channel feedback from a large number of users.</p><p>Propagation in the mmWave band is quasi-optical and sparse with very few multiple paths and large path losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>. MmWave massive MIMO networks are expected to operate in small cells in sparse user regime. Thus the demands for an exponentially-increasing number of users for RBF scheduling in mmWave massive MIMO networks is thus infeasible. Therefore, efficient user scheduling algorithms that exploit wireless channel fading consider channel sparsity, ensure low signaling overhead and work with partial CSI acquisition are essential to guarantee efficient resource allocation and optimal system performance for mmWave massive MIMO cellular networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, Semiari al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[153]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b221">[222]</ref> have proposed newl resource allocation frameworks exploiting context-awareness scheduling in dual-mode (μWave-mmWave) BSs. Here, scheduling is done per user application, and not per user. Multiple applications running on a single user device are allocated μWave or mmWave resources based on the specific delay requirement of the individual application. This is done not only to maximize the quality of service (QoS) of the BSs but also to enhance users' quality of experience (QoE). Simulation results show that the context-aware approach outperforms classical scheduling approaches employing CSI.</p></div>

This is because only spots with existing fiber access would be used or costly fiber access would have to be deployed. This challenge, therefore, is steering research in the direction of wireless fronthaul solutions for high-speed, high-capacity, easyto-install, low-latency, flexible and cost-effective fronthaul technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[138]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140]</ref>.</p><p>A number of wireless fronthaul solutions are available as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_21">VIII</ref>. MmWave massive MIMO shows promising prospects for both fronthaul and access links in future 5G cellular networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[144]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">[217]</ref> due to its promising capabilities for supporting flexible beamforming, and providing high spatial multiplexing and diversity gains. It also shows potentials for lower cost (with regards to components), higher capacity, lesser interference (due to smaller cell sizes and narrower beams) and smaller antenna form factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140]</ref>.</p><p>The suitability assessment in Table VIII which favors mmWave fronthaul over μWave is principally due to the limited available bandwidth in the μWave bands. The available bandwidth in the TVWS sub-800 MHz band is extremely limited, that of the licensed sub-6 GHz is limited and expensive while the unlicensed sub-6 GHz is highly interference-prone. All these constraints limit performance in terms of the realizable fronthaul throughput thereby pushing consideration towards the mmWave bands where abundant bandwidth is available. However, the suitability of wireless fronthaul in the 60 GHz bands is classified as requiring dynamic interference avoidance techniques due to its unlicensed nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140]</ref>.</p><p>For practical implementation, a combination of both the V and E-bands is proposed for the fronthaul of next-generation 5G HetNets based on their promising characteristics as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_22">IX</ref>. In all, the mmWave massive MIMO fronthaul design should support mesh network topology, be self-configuring and self-organizing (plug and play), support multi-hop links, adaptive beamforming algorithms, have immunity against interference and possibly operate in full-duplex mode, which is the optimal duplexing option for mesh fronthaul links <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140]</ref>. However, since full duplexing is still in the exploratory phase, particularly for mmWave bands, TDD may be a better choice than FDD for fronthauling due the ease of finding clean spectrum and avoiding interference thereby, flexibility of adjusting slot ratio since fronthaul has asymmetric traffic and the suitability of using a single device across different countries and operators <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143]</ref>. This will also ease inter-operator resource sharing and management for overall network improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">[225]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b225">[226]</ref>. In addition, the fronthaul should meet the following market requirements: reduced impact on the TCO (resulting from easy deployment and low installation, licensing and/or leasing fees) <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref>, multi-Gbps throughput support <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref>, low "last mile" latency (&lt; 5 ms for a single trip to support delay-critical applications and traffic classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>) and satisfactorily reliable link for the intercell/inter-site distance of up to 200 m for the HetNet small cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[146]</ref>. Multiplexing both fronthaul and access links on the same frequency (mmWave) band, which is termed in-band wireless fronthaul, is being proposed for 5G due to the obvious cost and frequency re-use benefits. However, this is prone to the challenges of interference between the access and fronthaul links, and self-interference between transmit and receive signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140]</ref>.</p><p>To address these sources of interference, Ghauch et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147]</ref> proposed the TDM-based in-band scheme, which in itself suffers from large system latency and large storage/buffering requirement. This has thus led to the flexible hybrid beamforming design with the concept of beam division multiplexing (BDM) which is expected to be a more competitive solution for the in-band mmWave massive MIMO fronthaul due to its lower latency <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Health and Safety Issues</head><p>With the mmWave bands being promising candidates for future broadband mobile communication networks, it is essential to understand the impacts of mmWave radiation on the human body and potential health effects related to its exposure. In addition, the current safety rules regarding RF exposure do not specify limits above 100 GHz whereas spectrum use will inevitably move to these bands over time, hence the need for further investigations to codify safety metrics at these frequencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The mmWave band constitutes RF spectrum with carrier frequencies between 30-300 GHz. The photon energy in these bands ranges from 0.1 to 1.2 milli-electron volts (meV), and unlike ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma radiation, mmWave radiation is non-ionizing and so cannot cause cancer. Therefore, the main safety concern is heating of the eyes and skin caused by the absorption of mmWave energy in the human body and constitutes the major biological effect that can be caused by the absorption of electromagnetic mmWave energy by tissues, cells, and biological fluid <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">[212]</ref>.</p><p>Based on findings from mmWave radiation studies, the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">[212]</ref> concluded that both the eyes and the skin (whose tissues would receive the most radiation) do not appear prone to damage from exposure experienced from mmWave communication technologies in the far-field, while more studies are required regarding exposure to communication devices (such as mobile devices with high-gain, adaptive and smart antennas) in the near-field.</p><p>Similarly, according to the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">[213]</ref>, more than 90% of the transmitted electromagnetic power is absorbed within the epidermis, and dermis layers and little power penetrates further into deeper tissues. However, heating of human tissue may extend deeper than the epidermis and dermis layers. Also, the steady state temperature elevations at different body locations may vary even when the intensities of electromagnetic wave radiations are the same. The authors concluded that power density (PD) is not likely to be as useful as Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for assessing safety, especially in the near-field, and proposed temperature-based technique an acceptable dosimetric quantity for demonstrating safety and setting exposure limits for mmWave radiations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Standardization Activities</head><p>3GPP, as a standardization body, has already decided to include two core physical layer (PHY) technologies (mmWave and massive MIMO) in the 5G NR <ref type="bibr" target="#b223">[224]</ref>. The joint use of these two technologies for future wireless systems is what is surveyed in this paper.</p><p>The attractive capabilities and high commercial potentials of mmWave communications have spurred several international activities aimed at standardizing it for wireless personal and local area networks (WPANs and WLANs) such as the IEEE 802.15.3c, IEEE 802.11ad, WirelessHD, WiGiG and IEEE 802.11ay <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The focus had been on the 60 GHz band for WiFi and WiGiG standards due to the earlier notion that mmWave bands are unsuitable for mobile communications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref>. However, with the new findings about its suitability, several research projects (such as MiWEBA <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[202]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">[203]</ref> and MiWaveS <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">[204]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">[205]</ref>) are ongoing in both the academia and the industry, with the aim of incorporating mmWave communications into cellular networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Standards and regulatory bodies such as ITU, IEEE, ETSI, and 3GPP are already considering and concretizing mmWave spectrum standardization for mobile systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">[205]</ref>, and the WRC-2018 appears as the time and place where the decision and agreement will be finalized by ITU-R <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref>.</p><p>Massive MIMO, on the other hand, has been under consideration for standardization by 3GPP since LTE-A Rel. 12 <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref>. The release work programme, which was largely completed in March 2015, considered four areas of significant enhancements and enablers: small cells and HetNets, multiantennas (e.g., massive MIMO and elevation beamforming), proximity services and procedures for supporting diverse traffic types <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[206]</ref>. Further works on massive MIMO standardization featured in subsequent 3GPP LTE releases and enhancements will continue through releases 15 and 16, expected to be finalized by September 2018 and late 2019, respectively. Standardization of both mmWave communications and massive MIMO will open up new opportunities for next-generation cellular networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Summary and Open Issues</head><p>Many factors and design considerations affect the performance of systems and influence the trade-offs to make with respect to the metrics of interest and desired applications. These cross-layer design considerations include: the choice of modulation technique and signal waveform, multiple access scheme, user scheduling algorithm, fronthaul design, antenna array architecture, precoding schemes, health and safety issues, among others.</p><p>Though we have presented many candidates cross-layer design choices in this section, it is important to note that many of these schemes are still undergoing experimental demonstrations and rigorous test and validation procedures. While optimal designs are being concluded for some techniques, same is yet to be achieved for some others. Therefore, holistic performance characterization and evaluation of these in mmWave massive MIMO techniques in real-life scenarios and real-time applications remain an open issue.</p></div>

This reduces the dimensionality of the desired channel as the number of propagation paths in such a beamformed signal is much lower than in conventional systems where CSI of a large number of antennas are measured and reported<ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. While the two-stage beamforming comprises the beam selection and the beam-based CSI reporting phases, the three-stage beamforming has an additional intermediate phase where the user measures the transmitter correlation matrix and feeds back the eigenvectors to the BS. These two examples of multi-stage beamforming techniques are illustrated in Fig.18 and 19, respectively.Overall, both TDD and FDD modes have pros and cons. Though TDD simplifies CSI acquisition with the use of uplink pilots particularly for mmWave massive MIMO systems and is easily adopted for modeling and simulation studies, it does not account for ICIs specific to downlink transmission, it is prone to inaccuracies due to transmitter-receiver mismatch and as well as prone to pilot contamination effect which limits system performance<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>,<ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>.FDD systems, on the other hand, use dedicated feedback mechanism where UEs report measured channel information to the BSs, which is more accurate and less sensitive to latency, since the uplink and downlink transmissions operate at different frequencies. Accurate CSI is critical for improved systems performance, and decreased latency is important for missioncritical applications in next-generation networks. However, dedicated feedback in FDD systems consumes radio resources, particularly in mmWave massive MIMO systems, thereby</figDesc></figure>

Citation information: DOI 10.1109/COMST.2017.2787460, IEEE Communications Surveys &amp; Tutorialsfootprints are among principal drivers for the B5G era, alongside the much-anticipated boost in network capacity, user throughput, spectral and energy efficiencies. While research, demonstrations and field tests of candidate technologies and prototypes are ongoing across different projects in the academia and the industry, holistic system deployment and performance evaluation remain open issues, together with the new applications, standardization and business models that will follow. As we march towards 2020, research on mmWave massive MIMO will continue to mature, and new trends will emerge. Though there are many challenges to address, mmWave massive MIMO shows amazing prospects and potentials in realizing the 1000-fold capacity quest for 5G cellular networks. The technology will, no doubt, usher in new paradigms for next-generation mobile networks and open up new frontiers in cellular services and applications.
