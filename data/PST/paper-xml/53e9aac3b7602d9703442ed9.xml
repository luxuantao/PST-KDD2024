<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Inspired by the previous work of Tu and Deng, we propose two infinite classes of Boolean functions of variables where . The first class contains unbalanced functions having high algebraic degree and nonlinearity. The functions in the second one are balanced and have maximal algebraic degree and high nonlinearity (as shown by a lower bound that we prove; as a byproduct we also prove a better lower bound on the nonlinearity of the Carlet-Feng function). Thanks to a combinatorial fact, first conjectured by the authors and later proved by Cohen and Flori, we are able to show that they both possess optimal algebraic immunity. It is also checked that, at least for numbers of variables , functions in both classes have a good behavior against fast algebraic attacks. Compared with the known Boolean functions resisting algebraic attacks and fast algebraic attacks, both of them possess the highest lower bounds on nonlinearity. These bounds are however not enough for ensuring a sufficient nonlinearity for allowing resistance to fast correlation attack. Nevertheless, as for previously found functions with the same features, there is a gap between the bound that we can prove and the actual values computed for bounded numbers of variables . Moreover, these values are very good. The infinite class of functions we propose in Construction 2 presents, among all currently known constructions, the best provable tradeoff between all the important cryptographic criteria.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>with filter nonlinear model, the following criteria for cryptographic Boolean functions are mandatory: balancedness, high nonlinearity, high algebraic degree, high algebraic immunity, and good behavior against fast algebraic attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In the case of the combiner model, the additional condition of resiliency is necessary for allowing resistance to the Siegenthaler correlation attack (which does not work for the filter model); we shall not address this model in this paper.</p><p>In 2003, Courtois and Meier successfully proposed algebraic attacks on several stream ciphers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. As a response to the standard algebraic attack, the notion of algebraic immunity of a Boolean function was introduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, defined as the minimum algebraic degree of the nonzero functions such that or , where is the multiplication of functions inherited from multiplication in , the finite field with two elements. For resisting the standard algebraic attack, a Boolean function should have algebraic immunity as high as possible, i.e., close to the maximum , where is the number of variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Later, the standard attack was further improved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, where the so-called fast algebraic attack was introduced. The fast algebraic attack is feasible if a nonzero function of low algebraic degree and of algebraic degree not much larger than such that can be found <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Let us however note that if or admits a function of low algebraic degree such that , then the algebraic attack using is more efficient since it needs less data. Summarizing, for resisting the algebraic attacks, a high algebraic immunity is now an absolutely necessary property for cryptographic Boolean functions, but it is not sufficient for resisting fast algebraic attacks.</p><p>Up to now, several classes of Boolean functions achieving optimal algebraic immunity have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. However, the nonlinearity of most of these functions is often not exceeding , which is almost the worst possible value according to Lobanov's bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Even when they do exceed it, they are not much larger than this value. Hence, they are insufficient for the resistance to fast correlation attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and there remains to see whether these functions behave well against fast algebraic attacks.</p><p>In 2008, the second author and Feng studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> an infinite class of -variable balanced Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity which had been introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> clarified the reasons why these functions have optimal algebraic immunity and proved they have additionally maximal algebraic degree and nonlinearity larger than . This showed that these functions have much better nonlinearity than previously found functions. Moreover, they have a quite good nonlinearity computed for small values of . In addition, it was also checked that, at least for small number of variables, the functions in this class have a good behavior against fast algebraic attacks. It is the first class of Boolean functions almost satisfying all the criteria (we write "almost" because the lower bound on the nonlinearity of the function that could be proved does not ensure it is large enough and because the good behavior with respect to fast algebraic attacks could not be proved either) and satisfying them completely for small. In this paper, functions in this class are called Carlet-Feng function for short.</p><p>As pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, similar functions had been previously investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, where a lower bound on their nonlinearity similar to that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> had been proved; but the algebraic immunity was not considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, the Carlet-Feng function was presented by Wang et al. in another way (as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>) with a very slightly improved lower bound on the nonlinearity: , . A minor modification of this class was also introduced (without proof) with the same parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Furthermore, the Carlet-Feng function was analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> (in particular, an attempt to study its behavior against fast algebraic attacks was done), and the author proposed new balanced Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity and studied their behavior against fast algebraic attacks. Later in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, Zeng et al. presented more balanced functions with almost the same cryptographic properties as the Carlet-Feng function by extending the analytical method presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>More recently, Tu and Deng <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> studied the algebraic immunity property of a special case of the well-known bent function , where , , and is balanced on , by setting to have support , where is an arbitrary integer and is a primitive element of . They modified into -variable balanced Boolean functions with maximal algebraic degree and nonlinearity larger than . Most notably, based on a combinatorial conjecture, they were able to show that their Boolean functions possess optimal algebraic immunity. By means of the same conjectured assumption, another class of balanced Boolean functions in even number of variables was also presented in a similar way, which have optimal algebraic immunity, maximal algebraic degree, and very high nonlinearity (same as the highest nonlinearity among all the known balanced Boolean functions) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Unfortunately, these classes of balanced functions are vulnerable to fast algebraic attacks, as first observed by the second author in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Later on, it was realized by Wang and Johansson in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> that the problem lies in the fact that these functions are close to functions of rather low algebraic degree (namely ) which explains why these functions do not behave well against fast algebraic attacks.</p><p>Inspired by Tu-Deng functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and their modification <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, we propose two classes of functions of variables with very good cryptographic properties based on the function instead of , where . The functions in the first class are unbalanced, with Hamming weight , algebraic degree , and nonlinearity larger than . The functions in the second class are balanced, having algebraic degree , which is the maximal algebraic degree of balanced functions of variables, and nonlinearity larger than . Thanks to a combinatorial fact (first presented by us as a combinatorial conjecture and later completely proved by <ref type="bibr">Cohen and Flori)</ref>, functions in these two classes have optimal algebraic immunity. Further, experiments show that both of them have a good behavior against fast algebraic attacks (which has been verified for all even numbers of variables between 4 and 16). Besides, in the process of studying the nonlinearity of our functions, we also find a lower bound on the nonlinearity of the Carlet-Feng function which is tighter than all the lower bounds found previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Even compared with this new lower bound, our functions in these two classes possess the largest lower bounds among those functions with similar features which have been already found. And what seems to be most interesting with these functions is that the actual values of the nonlinearity computed for happen to be, for some values of , the best among all functions having large algebraic immunity, large algebraic degree, and potentially good resistance to fast algebraic attacks. We summarize in Table I the behavior against fast algebraic attacks, the known lower bounds on nonlinearity, and the algebraic degrees of known Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity and good nonlinearity. It is seen from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref> that compared with the functions having optimal algebraic immunity and strong behavior against fast algebraic attacks, our functions are better with respect to the lower bounds on nonlinearity. We believe it is also interesting to observe that the Tu-Deng conjecture can be extended to other similar ones. This gives the idea that a more general conjecture could be stated and maybe more easily proved (we actually checked a more general conjecture, for small values of the number of variables, see Remark 2).</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the notation and the necessary preliminaries required for the subsequent sections are reviewed. In Section III, a combinatorial fact is presented. In Section IV, we propose a construction of unbalanced functions and give their cryptographic properties. In Section V, an infinite class of balanced functions satisfying all the main cryptographic properties is proposed and analyzed. Finally, Section VI concludes this paper.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Let</head><p>be the vector space of -tuples over the field of two elements, and be the finite field of order . For a vector , its support is the set , and its Hamming weight is defined as the cardinality of its support, i.e.  , is the maximal value of such that . A Boolean function is an affine function if its algebraic degree is at most 1. The set of all affine functions is denoted by . The cryptographic Boolean functions can be attacked by the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and by the Rønjom-Helleseth attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> if the functions have low algebraic degrees. It should be noted that the maximum algebraic degree of a balanced Boolean functions of variables is . Note that is isomorphic to through the choice of some basis of over . In this paper, for convenience, we shall represent the truth table of Boolean functions as where is a primitive element of</p><p>The Boolean functions over can also be uniquely expressed by a univariate polynomial where , , for such that . The algebraic degree equals , where is the binary expansion of (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>).</p><p>Besides, when is even, the Boolean function of variables can be viewed over and uniquely expressed by a bivariate polynomial where are such that for ,</p><p>. The algebraic degree equals . In order to resist the best affine approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and the fast correlation attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, Boolean functions used in a cryptographic system must have high nonlinearity. The nonlinearity of a Boolean function is defined as where is the Hamming distance between and , i.e., . In other words, the nonlinearity is the minimum Hamming distance between and all the affine functions.</p><p>The nonlinearity can also be expressed by means of the Walsh transform of . Let and both belong to and let be any inner product; for instance, the usual inner product ; then, the Walsh transform of at is defined by Over , the Walsh transform of the Boolean function can be defined by where is the trace function from to .</p><p>Over , the Walsh transform can be defined by where , and is the trace function from to . Then, the nonlinearity of a Boolean function can be computed as A new kind of attack, called algebraic attack, has been introduced recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. It is a new powerful tool to cryptanalyze many stream ciphers which were previously believed to be secure. The basic idea of algebraic attacks is to represent a cryptographic system by a large system of multivariate algebraic equa-tions, and by using the existence of low degree nonzero functions whose product with have low degrees to lower the degree of the multivariate algebraic equations. The idea was originated from Shannon <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, but this improvement in the efficiency of the method is recent. The standard algebraic attack leads to the following definition. Definition 1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>): Given two -variable Boolean functions and , we say that is an annihilator of if . The algebraic immunity of Boolean function is defined to be the minimum algebraic degree of a nonzero Boolean function such that is an annihilator of or . In this paper, a Boolean function of variables is said to have optimal algebraic immunity if it has maximal algebraic immunity (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>). A high algebraic immunity is necessary but is not a sufficient condition for the resistance against all kinds of algebraic attacks. If one can find nonzero functions of low algebraic degree and of algebraic degree significantly lower than such that , then a fast algebraic attack is feasible <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. For an -variable function and any pair of integers such that , there is a nonzero function of degree at most such that has degree at most , see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In this sense, can be considered as having optimal behavior against fast algebraic attacks if there do not exist two nonzero functions and such that and with (indeed, if the algebraic degree of is not smaller than , then we know that can be taken equal to 0 or to itself and we are in the framework of algebraic attacks).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. COMBINATORIAL FACT</head><p>Very recently, Tu and Deng <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> presented a combinatorial conjecture on binary strings for proving that the Boolean functions they introduced have optimal algebraic immunity. Recall that is the binary expansion of the integer . Tu-Deng's Conjecture ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>): Let be an integer. For any , define then . Tu and Deng validated the conjecture by computer for . Toward the proof of this conjecture, some advances have been achieved <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, in which many cases for are solved. However, the complete proof remains open.</p><p>In this paper, in order to show that the functions given in the subsequent two sections have optimal algebraic immunity, we need the following combinatorial fact.</p><p>Combinatorial Fact 1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>): Let be an integer. For any , define</p><p>(1) then .</p><p>Remark 1: This combinatorial fact was first presented by us as a combinatorial conjecture in a preliminary version of this paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, in which we reported that we had validated it by computer for . Cohen and Flori <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> completely proved that it is true.</p><p>Remark 2: We checked, for , a more general conjecture in which is replaced by where is a positive integer such that is true.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS WITH VERY GOOD CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROPERTIES</head><p>In this section, we present a class of unbalanced Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity, good immunity to fast algebraic attacks, high algebraic degree and for which a lower bound can be proved on the nonlinearity which is larger than for all previously introduced functions with all the same features. Moreover, the nonlinearity that we exactly computed for is very good. Construction 1: Let . Let be a primitive root of the finite field . Set where is an integer. Then, we construct a function as follows:</p><p>(</p><p>where the Boolean function is defined to have support .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Algebraic Immunity of the Constructed Functions</head><p>In this section, we will show that the Boolean functions generated by Construction 1 have optimal algebraic immunity. The proof is very similar to the proof for the Tu-Deng functions. . It means that the constructed functions have optimal algebraic immunity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Immunity to Fast Algebraic Attacks</head><p>In this section, we analyze for the immunity to fast algebraic attacks of the constructed functions in Construction 1.</p><p>For , let be a root of the default primitive polynomial of in Magma version 2.12-16 and be the balanced function with in Construction 1. By a Magma program, we can easily get the truth table of the -variable Boolean function given in Construction 1. Let , be two functions with and such that . We aim to find out the minimal sum to exploit its immunity against fast algebraic attacks for some small number of variables. Clearly, is an annihilator of , which implies . Hence, we investigate all the combinations of and with and . By running the implementation of Algorithm 2 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> provided to us by S. Fischer <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, we observed the following properties of . 1) For , 12, 14, 16, we only found pairs exist for equations by exhaustive search, where . 2) For , 6, 10, pairs such that were never observed by exhaustive search, where . Recall that for any -variable function , there exist a pair of functions of respective degrees and such that . Therefore, has optimal immunity to fast algebraic attacks for , 6, 10 and nearly optimal immunity for , 12, 14, 16. The aforementioned examples show that functions in this class, at least for small values of the number of variables, have a good behavior against fast algebraic attacks, even if not always optimal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Polynomial Representation and Algebraic Degree</head><p>We give now the bivariate representation of the constructed functions and deduce their algebraic degree. Remark 3: Theorem 2 can also be deduced from the univariate representation of given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Nonlinearity</head><p>Before obtaining a lower bound on the nonlinearity of , we need the following lemma. It should be noted that the required function does exist, for instance it can be found in [34, <ref type="bibr">Construction 1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr">Construction 1]</ref>. Moreover, we can prove that the function is balanced.</p><p>Proposition 1: Let be an even integer. The function is balanced. Proof: We can easily see that .

Algebraic Degree and Algebraic Immunity</head><p>We shall see now that has maximal algebraic degree for balanced function and optimal algebraic immunity.</p><p>Theorem 4: The function of variables has algebraic degree . Proof: The constructed function can be written as , where is defined in Construction 1 and equals where is the Dirac symbol. We know that has algebraic degree and has algebraic degree .

As in the case of in the proof of Theorem 1, we still have 1) for all , ; 2) , , by the definition of in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Using the same argument, we get . In other words, has no nonzero annihilator with algebraic degree less than too.</p><p>From the aforementioned discussion, we conclude that the function of variables has optimal algebraic immunity .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Immunity to Fast Algebraic Attacks</head><p>In what follows, we consider the behavior of Construction 2 against fast algebraic attacks for small . In our experiments, We computed, by running the implementation of Algorithm 2 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> provided to us by S. Fischer <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, the behavior against fast algebraic attacks of our functions. Let , be two functions with and such that . For even ranging from 4 to 16, we found all pairs such that by exhaustive search, where and we found only pairs such that . We listed the minimum values of in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">III</ref> for and also for the Tu-Deng and Carlet-Feng functions. From this table, we can see that the immunity to fast algebraic attacks of the functions generated by Construction 2, at least for , is much better than for the Tu-Deng function and is the same as for the Carlet-Feng function. Note that a difference by 1 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">III</ref>  (more or less the practical number of variables in a cryptosystem). We can say that our functions have a good behavior, at least for , against fast algebraic attacks (note that there is no known function for even which is optimal against fast algebraic attacks).  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION For an integer</head><p>, a class of -variable unbalanced Boolean functions and a class of -variable balanced Boolean functions are proposed in this paper. The functions in the former class have high nonlinearity and good algebraic degree. The functions in the latter class have high nonlinearity but in addition they are balanced and have maximal algebraic degree. Both have optimal algebraic immunity and good behavior against fast algebraic attacks. We also further improved the lower bound on the nonlinearity of the Carlet-Feng function. Even compared with this new lower bound, our functions in these two classes possess the highest lower bounds.

Let be the number such that . We give the values of rounded to four decimal places in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>. Hence, we can see that all the values of the nonlinearity are very close to .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS WITH ALL MAIN CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROPERTIES</head><p>In this section, we slightly modify Construction 1 to get a class of -variables balanced Boolean functions with high nonlinearity, large algebraic degree, and optimal algebraic immunity.</p><p>We also show by numeric computations that functions in this new class display good resistance against fast algebraic attacks. It is a new class of Boolean functions almost satisfying all the criteria and potentially satisfying them completely (as checked for small values of ).</p><p>Construction 2: Let be an even integer no less than 4 such that and . We construct the function as follows:</p><p>(5)</p><p>Proof: According to the definition of the Walsh transform, for any , we have (similarly to the computations made in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>) if else where in the last identity we use the facts that since is balanced and from (4). Consequently</p><p>From Theorem 6, we see that the nonlinearity of the function given by Construction 2 decreases a little when compared with the function in Construction 1. But in this way, we are able to obtain an infinite class of balanced functions achieving (at least potentially-and actually for ) all the characteristics needed for being used in the filter model (maximal algebraic degree, optimal algebraic immunity, good behavior against fast algebraic attacks, and good nonlinearity). It is the first time that a function with all these features and such good nonlinearity is found.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Comparison With the Known Results</head><p>In this section, we compare the lower bounds on the nonlinearity of our result with the known Boolean functions resisting algebraic attacks and fast algebraic attacks. The Carlet-Feng function has optimal algebraic immunity, maximal algebraic degree, high nonlinearity, and a good behavior against fast algebraic attacks. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, the same class was presented by Wang et al. in another way (as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>) with a very slightly improved bound on the nonlinearity. Very recently, Zeng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> presented more balanced functions by a modification of this class of functions.</p><p>There is a big gap between the lower bound on the nonlinearity of the Carlet-Feng function and their exact values. Herein, we intend to improve the lower bound of the Carlet-Feng function with the same method as the one used in Section IV-D. Let us first recall the expression of nonlinearity of the Carlet-Feng function.</p><p>Lemma 2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>): Let be any integer such that and be the Carlet-Feng function of variables. Then, . Therefore, as we can see from Lemma 2, the key to get a tighter lower bound on the nonlinearity of the Carlet-Feng function is to improve upon the estimation of obtained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>To do so, we need the following lemma, whose proof is given in the Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 3: For every integer let</head><p>; then, we have . By our new estimation in Lemma 3, we can improve its lower bound on the nonlinearity. We have the following theorem. This completes the proof.</p><p>2) Proof of Lemma 3: From the definition of , we have</p></div>			</div>
