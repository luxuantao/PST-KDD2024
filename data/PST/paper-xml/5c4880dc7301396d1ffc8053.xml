<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In population-based optimization algorithms (POAs), given an optimization problem, the quality of the solutions depends heavily on the selection of algorithms, strategies and associated parameter combinations, constraint handling method, local search method, surrogate model, niching method, etc. In the literature, there exist several alternatives corresponding to each aspect of configuring a population-based algorithm such as one-point / two-points / uniform crossover operators, tournament / ranking / stochastic uniform sampling selection methods, Gaussian / Levy / Cauchy mutation operators, clearing / crowding / sharing based niching algorithms, adaptive penalty / epsilon / superiority of feasible constraint handling approaches, associated parameter values and so on. In POA literature, No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem has been well-documented and therefore, to effectively solve a given optimization problem, an appropriate configuration is necessary. But, the trial and error approach for the appropriate configuration may be impractical because at different stages of evolution, the most appropriate configurations could be different depending on the characteristics of the current search region for a given problem.</p><p>Recently, the concept of incorporating ensemble strategies into POAs has become popular so that the process of configuring an optimization algorithm can benefit from both the availability of diverse approaches at different stages and alleviate the computationally intensive offline tuning. In addition, algorithmic components of different advantages could support one another during the optimization process, such that the ensemble of them could potentially result in a versatile POA. This paper provides a survey on the use of ensemble strategies in POAs. In addition, we also provide an overview of similar methods in the literature such as hyper-heuristics, island models, adaptive operator selection, etc. and compare them with the ensemble strategies in the context of POAs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT</head><p>such a versatile POA is exactly a key concern of the algorithm researchers. Ensemble strategy provides an effective tool and paradigm to implement versatile POAs. In an ensemble POA, there are multiple search operators (e.g. mutation), parameters, constraint handling techniques or neighborhood structures, which generally have different characteristics and capabilities (e.g. exploration and exploitation) and therefore are suited to different types of optimization problems. As a result, a sophisticatedly designed ensemble POA with effective and distinguished ensemble components is potentially able to deal with different kinds of optimization problems. Note that, in this study we call these constituent search operators, parameters, constraint handling techniques or neighborhood structures in one ensemble as components of the ensemble.</p><p>Second, to improve the probability of finding the optimal solution for a hard optimization problem with complex landscapes, it is better to use diverse search (sampling) approaches. The same search approach may make the POA follow similar trajectories and be trapped in one of the local optima. Therefore, ensemble of multiple strategies could make POA particularly efficient for complicated optimization problems (e.g. composition functions of CEC 2014 single objective optimization benchmark) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. In addition, fixed strategies may not be most appropriate for the entire search process. Therefore, during the optimization process the search strategy needs to be updated to suit the search process as the search landscape changes during the population evolution towards the global optimal solution. Ensemble of multiple strategies with proper adaptation mechanism could enable a POA to have higher probability to select the most appropriate strategy during the optimization process <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>. Moreover, ensemble could also make search strategies of different capabilities support each other thus greatly strengthen the performance of a POA. For example, in an ensemble, exploration search strategies could find more unvisited promising areas which could be further refined with exploiting search strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Third, given an optimization problem, the quality of solution to the problem and convergence speed of an algorithm to the optimal solution highly depends on the parameter and search strategy configuration of the optimization algorithm. Configuring the parameters and search strategies of a POA refers to finding the best combination of operators, parameter values and search strategies prior to or during the optimization process to maximize the performance of the algorithm on the given problem. Algorithmic configuration can be performed prior to or during the optimization process. When the algorithmic configuration is conducted prior to the optimization process, it is usually referred to as tuning the algorithm. On the other hand, when the algorithmic configuration is conducted during the optimization process, it is referred to as adapted operator, parameter and strategy control. It should be noted that traditional algorithmic configuration is to search for a fixed combination of strategies, operators and parameter values. However, traditional algorithmic configuration methods based on trial and error are usually time-consuming inefficient and incapable of changing during the evolution. Adapted control approaches dynamically adjust the operators, parameters and strategies of POAs according to the optimization states and have attracted much attention recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. Ensemble of a set of promising candidate parameters values and strategies can properly realize the adapted control of parameters, operators and strategies, thereby alleviating the burden of configuring and selecting parameters and strategies for POAs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT</head><p>The ensemble concept with respect to a POA can be defined as -a combination of different strategies, operators, parameter values and methods (with a single or parallel populations) referred to as an ensemble can provide better results on a set of optimization problems compared to a single set of strategies, operators, parameter values and methods. It should be noted that in machine learning, researchers use the concept of ensemble learning where multiple diverse models are combined to form an ensemble. For instance, neural network ensemble is a successful learning paradigm where a collection of a finite number of neural networks trained for the same task are combined to achieve a better performance on the same task, and has successful applications in diverse areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. The basic idea of ensemble learning is based on the intuition that a group of 'unstable and diverse' learning algorithms can be combined to obtain an overall better learning algorithm. The extension of the ensemble concept to stochastic population-based optimization aims to construct a "stable" optimization algorithm by appropriate combination of "unstable and diverse" stochastic optimization algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>.</p><p>It should be noted that there are some other concepts related to ensemble, including multi-strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, multi-method <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, algorithm portfolios <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>, hyper-heuristic <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, memetic algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref> and hybrid algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. In this survey, we take the concepts of multi-strategy and multi-method under the umbrella of ensemble. This is because multi-strategy can be viewed as a special case of the low-level ensemble of algorithmic components, while multi-method can be viewed as special cases of high-level ensemble of different EA variants. In contrast, the term of memetic algorithm (MA) was proposed by Moscato <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> as being a paradigm for integrating EAs with one or more refinement methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>. In MA, population based EAs (e.g DE, PSO and ABC) are taken as global search techniques while refinement methods (e.g. Nelder-Mead simplex search method, Hill Climber with Sidestep and trust-region derivative-free methods) play the role of local search <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>. In response to the challenge that the performance of an algorithm may vary significantly from problem to problem, algorithm portfolio attempts to find a less risky way to distribute the time among multiple different algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>. A hyper-heuristic is a methodology which, when given a particular problem instance or a class of instances, and a number of low-level heuristics (or their components), automatically produces an adequate combination of the provided components to effectively solve the given problem(s) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Burke et al. categorized</ref> hyper-heuristic into heuristic selection and heuristic generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>. It can be perceived that hyper-heuristic aims to automatically develop new search algorithms based on a pool of low-level heuristics. Hybrid algorithm is a broader concept that may cover the other interrelated ones.</p><p>Nevertheless, there is still a difference between ensemble algorithm and hybrid algorithm. For example, a differential evolution algorithm with ensemble of multiple mutation strategies is an ensemble algorithm while it would not be classified as hybrid algorithm. On the other hand, a particle swarm optimizer combined with a crossover operator is a traditional hybrid algorithm instead of an ensemble algorithm while simultaneous usage of multiple crossover strategies will make it a hybrid ensemble method.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Low-level ensemble</head><p>Search strategies largely determine the characteristics of POAs. In other words, different search strategies are suited to different optimization problems. As a result, to design a versatile POA, an ensemble of multiple search strategies with different advantages provides a promising direction. Many DE variants with multiple mutation strategies were proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[67]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[70]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[72]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[73]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[74]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[75]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[76]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[77]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[78]</ref>. Ensemble of both crossover and mutation strategies was further studied in the design of DE variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">80]</ref>.</p><p>In addition to DE, ensembles of multiple search strategies/operators were also used in cuckoo algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref>, GA <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[82]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[83]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[84]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[85]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[86]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[87]</ref>. The ensembles of multiple evolutionary operators were effectively used for multi-objective optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">89]</ref>.</p><p>The performance of major POAs is significantly affected by the parameter configurations. It is quite clear that the most appropriate parameter values vary when POAs are applied to different optimization problems. In addition, the best parameter values of a POA may vary at different stages of the optimization process. However, parameter tuning prior to the optimization process is usually computationally expensive and dynamic control of parameter values is nontrivial. As a result, parameter self-adaptation approaches are becoming popular <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[90]</ref>. Ensemble of parameter values is a promising method to realize the automatic parameter control <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[91]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[92]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[93]</ref>. The simultaneous ensemble of search strategies and parameters values was investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">63]</ref>. In addition, Choi and Ahn studied the ensemble of search strategies, parameter values and different local search techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[94]</ref>. It should be noted that traditional parameter adaptation/self-adaptation strategy, such as the history and archiving strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[95]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[96]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[97]</ref>, usually make the parameter values be changed in a continuous real-valued interval. Parameters can be adapted by recording previously promising parameter values <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">95]</ref>,</p><p>dynamic adjustment according to evolutionary states <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[98]</ref>, and being encoded in solutions and evolved with the optimization process <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[99]</ref>. The parameter adaptation can be at the population level <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[95,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">98]</ref> or individual level <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>. In contrast, the ensemble of parameter values usually requires the dynamic selection of an appropriate parameter configuration from a set of discretized parameter values <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>. The discretized candidate parameter values can be determined by previous studies of the research community <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref>. Intuitively, compared to a single-valued parameter adaptation in a continuous real-valued interval, the ensemble of discrete parameter values enables the algorithm to switch rapidly</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT</formula><p>to different ranges. Further, the selection discrete values can be varied by small randomization and enhanced by success rates based adaptation.</p><p>Ensembles of several other algorithmic components were also proposed by researchers, such as ensemble of surrogates <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">101]</ref>, neighborhood sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>, and constraint handling techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. In addition, Karthikeyan and Baskar combined different immigrant strategies for GA <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[102]</ref>.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p><p>Many different approaches have been developed to realize the ensemble of components of POAs. For instance, the multi-population based mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[104]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[105]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[106]</ref> partitions the whole population into multiple subpopulations, each member (e.g. search strategy) in the ensemble owns a subpopulation and evolves independently. The information exchange may occur during the optimization process.</p><p>Ensemble can be adapted through dynamic allocation of population resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>, that is, the member in an ensemble performing better can be assigned with larger populations during the optimization process. The exploration and exploitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">107]</ref> mechanism means that in an ensemble, some members are responsible for exploration while others are used to exploit promising areas. In an ensemble, the usage frequencies of its members can be adapted with execution probabilities, which are determined by the former performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">108]</ref>, population diversity and fitness improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[109]</ref>. The dynamic selection of the members in an ensemble can also be implemented in a sequential manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[110]</ref> or by some advanced techniques, such as reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[83]</ref>, artificial neural network regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[71]</ref>, linear time-varying functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[111]</ref>, game theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[112]</ref> and surrogate model <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[113]</ref>. Some studies determined the usage of members in an ensemble according to fitness of individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">114]</ref>, both fitness and positional information <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[115]</ref>, and landscape characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[65]</ref>.</p><p>Ensemble POAs generally show competitive performance. For instance, it is very impressive that the LSHADE-EpSin jointly won the CEC 2016 competition on single objective real-parameter numerical optimization based on the CEC 2014 benchmark set <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[103]</ref>.

With respect to single-objective bound constrained optimization problems the configuration refers to the appropriate selection of strategies and their associated control parameters. The process of selecting appropriate algorithmic configuration is not straight forward and requires extensive parameter tuning. In addition, during the evolution process different algorithmic configurations can be appropriate at different stages. Motivated by these observations, various works have been reported employing ensemble concepts to solve single-objective bound constrained optimization problems.</p><p>The performance of genetic algorithm (GA) depends on the appropriate selection of crossover strategy.</p><p>To enhance the performance of GA, competitive single population ensemble strategies with local <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[134]</ref> and global <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[134]</ref>adaptations were explored.

It has been argued that encoding the constituents of the ensemble into the individual population members demonstrates improved performance, as different individuals are expected to follow different trajectories through the search space, requiring different operators for each trajectory. In GA with global adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[138]</ref>, given different crossover operators, there exist different strategies for updating the operator application probabilities -1) correlated to the occupancy rate of the solutions generated by the respective operator; 2) anti-correlated to the occupancy rate of the solutions generated by the respective operator, 3) maintaining occupancy rate of each crossover as close as possible, and 4) maintaining operator probabilities of all constituent method with an expected rate regardless of the occupancy rates.

In DE algorithm with population reduction, different strategies can be employed depending on the population size <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[153,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">154]</ref>. In other words, if the population size is greater than a threshold then an explorative mutation strategy can be employed while an exploitative mutation strategy is employed if the population size is less than the threshold. In EAs, amount of exploration and exploitation to be done depends on the characteristics of the problem and therefore determining a threshold which allows us to switch between the exploration and exploitation may not be apt. Therefore, competitive single population ensemble DE with local adaptation (EPSDE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> with a pool of distinct mutation strategies (and crossover strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[151]</ref>) along with a pool of values for each control parameter that coexist throughout the evolution process was proposed. In EPSDE, during the evolution, the individual strategies/control parameters compete with the other members in the pool to produce offspring. Later similar ideas have been explored with in the ABC framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">156,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">157]</ref>. Unlike in EPSDE where each population individual is assigned a combination of strategies and parameters picked from the respective pools, an ensemble DE where each target individual has an associated list of strategies and parameters was proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[152]</ref>. During the evolution, a trial individual is generated by using strategies and parameters taken from the lists associated with the target vector and if the obtained trial individual is better than the target vector, the used strategies and parameter values are archived separately. The archived information is employed to update the pools associated with each target vector so that they can gradually self-adapt using the previous experiences to match different phases of evolution.</p><p>In DE, single population competitive ensemble with global adaptation was explored in <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[103,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">137]</ref>, where the probability of selecting a combination of strategies and parameters to produce an offspring depends on the success rate of the combination. In addition, in DE the control parameters -namely the scale factor and the crossover rate are continuous parameters. Therefore, unlike in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">151,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">152]</ref> where the control parameter pools are discrete, the control parameter values associated with each strategy are sampled form the mean and standard deviation values that are updated using the combinations that produce successful offspring <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[103,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">137]</ref>.</p><p>In single population based DE ensembles, the exploration and exploitation are achieved by choosing an appropriate combination of strategies and parameters. In addition, the success of the combinations is determined by the improvement provided by the respective combinations. However, it is well-known</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT</formula><p>that an exploitative combination is expected to provide frequent minor improvements while an explorative combination is expected to provide infrequent significant improvements. In other words, during the initial stages of the evolution depending on the type of improvements obtained the algorithm might get struck with exploitative strategies leading to degraded performance. Therefore, idea of using multiple populations to realize the ensemble was investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">155]</ref>. The number of populations varies depending on the implementation. A multi population cooperative ensemble DE algorithm with two populations -one each for exploration and exploitation was proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. The exploitative population uses the information present in the explorative population and the vice versa is not permitted. In other words, the information flow is uni-directional from explorative to exploitation to make sure the explorative population is diverse even when exploitation group converges thus balancing the exploration and exploitation. When solving a large scale optimization problem, it is essential to maintain a balanced distribution of solutions with different potential that can guide the search process in different directions in future generations <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[67]</ref>. Therefore, a cooperative multi population ensemble with four populations that evolve individually with different strategies for a fixed number of generations (referred to as isolation phase) before exchanging the information (referred to as migration phase) was proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[67]</ref>. In addition, a complete net topology structure was employed for migrating solutions between populations and the migrating solutions are selected in a uniform random manner. Unlike in <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[67]</ref>, a cooperative multi population ensemble with frequent information exchange at the end of every generation was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[155]</ref>. In this ensemble, at the end of every generation the individual populations are combined and then divided again into multiple populations depending on the Euclidean distance between the combined population members. In other words, during the process of dividing the combined population with size N into multiple populations with size N s , a solution is randomly chosen and distance to the other members in the population is calculated in the normalized decision space. Then the nearest (N s -1) solutions are selected to form the first group and are removed from the combined population. The process is repeated until the combined population is divided into (N/N s ) populations.</p><p>In DE, a competitive multi population ensemble with mutation strategies was proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. The algorithm contains three equally sized smaller indicator populations corresponding to each of the strategies employed and one much larger reward subpopulation. After evolving the three subpopulations for a certain number of generations, the best performing mutation strategy is identified based on the ratio between fitness improvements and consumed function evaluations. Then the reward subpopulation will be allocated to the best performing mutation strategy. The process of evolving the indicator populations and allocating the reward population to the best performing strategy repeats after a fixed number of generations. In addition, the control parameters corresponding to each mutation strategy are adapted independently.</p><p>In PSO, to balance the exploration and exploitation, a multi population cooperative ensemble with uni-directional information flow was proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[146]</ref> was proposed where the population is divided into explorative and exploitative populations. In the explorative population, the exemplars are generated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT</formula><p>only using the personal best experiences of the particles present in the explorative population. However, the exploitative population can make use of the personal best experiences of the explorative and exploitative populations to generate the exemplars. The uni-directional information flow helps in preserve the diversity in the explorative subpopulation even when the exploitative subpopulation converges prematurely. In addition, in PSO the search behavior depends on the learning strategy employed. Therefore, to adaptively adjust the search behavior of PSO, an adaptive ensemble of four different learning strategies was explored <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>. In the algorithm, each particle in the population acquires information by an ensemble of four strategies to determine the source of information -a)</p><p>archived position of the global best position, b) its personal best position, c) the personal best position of a random particle, and d) a random position nearby. In the ensemble, each of the above strategies helps convergence, exploitation, exploration and escape local optima, respectively.</p><p>The performance of harmony search (HS) depends on the parameters such as pitch adjustment rate and maximum bandwidth. To improve the performance of HS, a single population competitive ensemble of parameter sets with diverse numerical values was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[142]</ref>, where the applicability of the parameters is self-adapted during the evolution process using global adaptation. To self-adapt the parameter, a set of three different memories referred to as initial parameter set list (IPSL), winning parameter set list (WPSL) and current parameter set list (CPSL) are maintained. IPSL contains a diverse set of parameter combinations. Initially, CPSL is sampled from IPSL. Then a combination is randomly picked from CPSL to check if it can improve the solutions. If the combination is successful it enters WPSL else is deleted. Once the CPSL is empty, it is filled with solutions taken from IPSL and WPSL. The ratio of solutions taken from IPSL and WPSL is tunable. For instance, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> 75% individuals of CPSL are from WPSL and 25% from IPSL. The authors claim that the EHS eliminates the trail-and-error search for the best single parameter set and enables the algorithm to benefit from the match between the parameter sets during the different search phases.</p><p>The performance of evolutionary programming (EP) depends on the employed mutation operators such as Gaussian, Lévy and Cauchy and the scale factor. For example, Gaussian mutation operator is better at searching in a local neighborhood while the Cauchy mutation performs better over a larger neighborhood. Motivated by these observations, an ensemble approach where each mutation operator has its associated population and every population benefits from every function call was proposed mutation operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">158]</ref> . BBO with an ensemble of three migration models using three parallel populations was investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[158]</ref>, while an ensemble with three migration models -a) nonlinear migration model based on sinusoidal curve, b) backup migration operator based on perturb operator and c) blended operator; and two mutation operators -differential mutation operator and Lévy local search was investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p></div>

The algorithm is implemented using parallel populations, where each population is assigned one of the four algorithms and generates its own offspring. All of the offspring populations are combined to select a fixed number of the best individuals, which updates all of the parent populations.

Therefore, for fair evaluation of population-based multi-objective algorithms a performance metric ensemble with double elimination tournament selection was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. The double elimination tournament selection operator compares the approximation fronts obtained by different population-based multi-objective algorithm in a statistically meaningful way. In addition, the elimination of a quality algorithm due to unfair comparison using a single metric can be avoided using ensemble of performance metrics.

A similar idea was explored to solve constrained multi-objective optimization problems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[160]</ref>.</p><p>To solve constrained optimization problems, an overall ensemble in DE framework (SAS-DE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> comprising of a) four mutation operators, b) two crossover operators and c) two constraint handling techniques was proposed. In other words, sixteen different combinations of strategies were employed.</p><p>In SAS-DE, initially, each individual is randomly assigned with one of the sixteen combinations.</p><p>During the evolution, better performing combinations are emphasized by ranking the combinations. In To overcome the inherent drawbacks of PSO in solving constraint problems, a self-adaptive high-level ensemble comprising different PSO variants was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Initially, each PSO variant is assigned an equal number of individuals from the current population. However, in the subsequent generations, the number of solutions from the current population allocated to the PSO variants depends on their performance. In other words, to emphasize better-performing variants the number solutions assigned to each variant are changed based on a success measure. The success measure considers the fitness values, constraint violations and feasibility ratios of individuals in the sub-populations.</p><p>A general optimization framework that could be used for training and testing a self-adaptive multi-operator Genetic Algorithm (SAMO-GA) was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. To facilitate self-adaptation, an improvement index based on the solution quality, constraint violation and feasibility rate is considered. SAMO-GA starts with a random initial population which is further divided into four subpopulations of equal size. Each subpopulation evolves using a combination of assigned crossover and mutation operators; and the generated offspring are evaluated. Depending on the improvement indexes of each subpopulation their sizes are increased, decreased or kept unchanged. In addition, after every few generations (window size) the information is exchanged between the subpopulations by passing the best solutions. To design a generalized framework, a set of 60 benchmark problems with diverse characteristics were considered; and the pool of test problems were divided into three groups, and three iterations were performed. In each iteration, two groups were used for training and the third one was used for testing. From the experiments, the best combination was found to be -population size (80), minimum sub-population size (10% of population size), and window size (50 generations).</p></div>

To improve the performance of DE algorithm on discrete optimization problems by making effective use of different parameter values and crossover operators simultaneously, an ensemble of discrete DE algorithms where each parameter set and crossover operator assigned to one of the parallel populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[148]</ref> was proposed.

However, in general, before-hand it is unclear which surrogate model type suits the best a given problem, and in practice it is not feasible to try different algorithms due to the computational cost of doing function evaluations. In ensemble evolutionary algorithms, the surrogate models are generally used to evaluate the competitiveness of different constituent parameter/strategy combinations <ref type="bibr">[143] [52]</ref>. Therefore, the number of original function evaluations required can be reduced when solving expensive optimization problems.</p><p>Surrogate models are an approximation of the original functions and the accuracy or performance of the surrogate models depends on various factors such as availability of sufficient number of samples.</p><p>However, it has been argued in <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[164]</ref>, that the uncertainty introduced by approximation errors in the surrogate model can benefit as well as obstruct effective optimization search. In other words, since there is often no prior knowledge about the most appropriate surrogate for the problem of interest, the use of multiple meta-models appears to be an intuitive alternative. Therefore, instead of a single best surrogate model, the idea of using an ensemble of surrogate models was investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[141]</ref>. In the ensemble, each individual surrogate model is assigned a weight which is determined based on the errors of the individual surrogates. The main motivation behind employing a weighted ensemble of surrogate models is to emphasize characteristics of "good" models and to restrict the influence of "bad" models in the combination.</p><p>The different ensemble concepts discussed above are summarized in the following table.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Hyper-heuristics</head><p>In contrast to traditional population-based optimization algorithms which operate directly on the solution space, hyper-heuristics search a space of heuristics. In other words, hyper-heuristics automate the heuristic design process based on the structure of the problem to be solved. Due to the process of automation, hyper-heuristics offer advantages such as -a) scope of discovering novel heuristics for a given problem that are unlikely to be invented by human analyst, b) different heuristics can create different subset of instances so that the results obtained on each are more likely to be better than those obtained by one general heuristic. Given an optimization problem, hyper-heuristics are capable of providing a "good enough", "soon enough", "cheap enough" <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[165]</ref> solution compared to the conventional population-based algorithms. Therefore, hyper-heuristics tend to generalize the development of optimization algorithms that can effectively handle a wide range of problem instances such as timetabling <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[166]</ref> without expensive manual parameter tuning.</p><p>In the literature, considering the nature of the heuristic search space, hyper-heuristics are classified into two types: a) hyper-heuristics to choose heuristics -choose the best heuristics given a set of low-level heuristics or produce the best combination from preexisting heuristics, and b) Hyper-Heuristics to Create Heuristics -generate low-level heuristics from a set of building blocks given by the user or heuristic generation methods that generate new heuristics using basic components of preexisting heuristics.</p><p>Hyper-heuristics to choose heuristics: The hyper-heuristics can be developed for different purposes such as identifying the best global search algorithm from a predefined set (simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and ant colony optimization) <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[167]</ref> and/or identifying the best</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT</formula><p>local search algorithm from a predefined set (APRILS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[168]</ref>. In hyper-heuristics, to dynamically determine which low-level heuristic is to be used in finding better candidate solutions, the quality of the individual heuristics are evaluated through diversity and improvement detection operators <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[167]</ref>. In case-base hyper-heuristics, heuristics that worked well during the earlier situations or cases are memorized in a case-base. Then given a problem, depending on the similarity of the current problem with the ones in the case-base, the heuristic corresponding to the most similar case in the case-base is retrieved and refined to solve the problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[169]</ref>.

Island models parallelize (to reduce the computational times when solving hard optimization problems) the evolution process by splitting the population into multiple sub-populations called islands. The sub-populations in each island evolve independently for most of the time. However, they exchange solutions between the islands periodically through a process called migration. To enable communication between them, the islands are connected by a graph structure. In Island models, the following issues have been investigated in the literature.</p><p>1. Effect of different EAs running independently on each island: In <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">[182]</ref>, the authors analyzed the effect of migrating individuals between the islands employing heterogeneous genetic operators and concluded that the heterogeneity enhances the inter-island evolution.</p><p>2. Adaptively allocating function evaluations to solve within a given budget: Motivated by the computational portfolios in <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">[181]</ref>, a population-based algorithm portfolio (PAP) was proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> where the whole population is divided into several subpopulations that evolve in parallel employing different search algorithms and interact through migration. In addition, during the evolution process, the computation time (measured in terms of number of fitness evaluations) is divided between the constituent algorithms depending on their performance. In other words, PAP is a combination of different population-based search algorithms that interact, benefit and compete.</p><p>3. Effect of different representations in each island: In <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">[183]</ref>, authors proposed an island model that uses a different representation in each island (using standard binary encoding in one island and standard reflective Gray code in the other) and during the process of migration, the model transforms individuals from one representation to another. The authors claim that the heterogeneous representations in the islands help the population-based algorithm to escape from local optima and to solve problems that are difficult for single representation EAs.</p><p>4. Reducing computational time by parallelization and effect of different topologies: The effect of different topologies (such as ring, von Neumann grid and hypercube employed to interconnect the islands) on the computational speedup gained due to parallelization <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">[184]</ref> and the solution quality was analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">[184,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b186">185]</ref>.

The success of an AOS framework depends on two main components: a) credit assignment -defines the reward that will be used to evaluate the quality of an operator after its application; and b) operator selection mechanismselects one operator based on some rewards gained by the operators based on their performance.</p><p>During the credit assignment as well as operator selection, it is essential to assign a higher probability to operators that produce better offspring (exploitation) and at the same time needs to maintain operators that perform poorly for the future search (exploration) by assigning minimum probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">[188]</ref>. In population-based algorithm literature, this is referred to as exploration versus exploitation dilemma and to overcome it, different credit assignment and operator selection policies have been proposed.</p><p>Credit Assignment is an important ingredient in AOS and different credit assignment policies developed in the literature can be classified as follows:</p><p>• Credit assignment based on average fitness improvement of the offspring -most commonly employed <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[189]</ref>.</p><p>• Extreme value-based credit assignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[189,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b192">190]</ref> -rewards each operator based on the extreme value of the fitness improvement obtained using the operator during the current or last few application instances (sliding window).

In SaDE, each of the strategies/operators in the pool is initially assigned with identical application probabilities and during the evolution the application probability corresponding to each strategy/operator is updated depending on the number of successful offspring produced. In DE-DPS, each of the parameters related to the DE algorithm -amplification factor, crossover rate and population size is assigned a pool of values. Each individual in the population is assigned a combination by randomly picking the parameter values from the individual pools and the success rate of each combination is noted.

In Island models with adaptive POAs, moderate explicit memory is needed to store the successful combination of methods/parameters.</p><p>However, ensemble-based approaches can use single population (EPSDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>) or multiple populations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[64]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[149]</ref>). Depending on the implementation (single or multiple populations), ensemble-based approaches can be suitable to implement parallel evolution. However, unlike in Island models where each population is connected by a graph structure to facilitate information exchange, ensemble-based approaches employ no specific rigid structure. In addition, communication between different populations is occasional in Island models to preserve diversity while the communication in ensemble-based approaches may be occasional (after every few generations) or frequent (every generation). In addition, similar to the other approaches, the ensemble-based approaches can be adaptive (EPSDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[151]</ref>) or non-adaptive (ECHT <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>). Depending on the level of adaptation being implemented, ensemble approaches may employ moderate explicit memory.</p><p>From the above discussion, it is clear that unlike other methods, ensemble enables the user to have many variations. For instance, an ensemble with parallel populations offers the flexibility of having different parent-offspring selection rules to obtain the next generation individuals while an ensemble with single population enables a single parent-offspring selection rule. In addition, unlike hyper-heuristics and island models, ensemble approaches do not divide the total number of function evaluations between the constituent algorithms/operators. Hence, each function evaluation in the ensemble configuration contributes to the evolution of the population whereas dividing function evaluations between the constituent algorithms/operators prevent the benefit of each function evaluation being enjoyed by the total population.</p><p>In general, ensemble-based approach allows variations such as single or multiple populations, adaptive or non-adaptive, frequent communication for information exchange without loss of diversity and can operate efficiently at both operator-/ parameter-level (like adaptive operator selection) and algorithm-level (like hyper-heuristics). 1) Large-scale ensemble: Currently, the number of elements included in an ensemble is relatively small (e.g. around three). Now that different algorithms/search strategies/parameter values are suited to different kinds of optimization problems, it could be beneficial to make an ensemble contain larger number of elements with diversified characteristics. However, new issues may arise along with such large-scale ensemble. For example, how to implement a large-scale ensemble?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Directions of future research</head><p>The robustness of the larger scale ensemble should be investigated, since the ensemble system becomes complex and may become inefficient. In addition, the computational resource needed by a large-scale ensemble deserves to be studied, as some inappropriate elements may waste computational resources when solving a specified problem.</p><p>2) Hierarchical ensemble: Ensemble strategies in POAs can be categorized into high-level ensemble and low-level ensemble. It could be promising to combine the high-level ensemble and low-level ensemble in one POA. We may simultaneously combine multiple methods and multiple search strategies in an ensemble. In addition, it is possible to integrate multiple methods in an ensemble and these constituent methods are with the ensemble of multiple search strategies. In addition, most of the current ensemble methods are either competitive or cooperative. In hierarchical ensemble, the ensemble strategies performing exploration can be cooperative while the strategies performing exploitation can be competitive. In other words, a hierarchical ensemble that is cooperative and competitive can be designed.</p><p>3) Heterogeneous ensemble: Major ensemble POAs are the ensembles of homogeneous algorithmic components, e.g., a DE algorithm with the ensemble of multiple mutation strategies.

During the evolution process, UMOEA emphasizes on the best performing multi-operator EA, as well as the search operator by adaptively varying the sizes of the populations. In other words, the size of population corresponding to the successful operators is increased, and at the same time the size of population corresponding to the unsuccessful operators is shrunk. The measure of success and failure of any combination of operators is decided based on changes in the fitness values, constraint violations, and the feasibility ratio of the subpopulations individuals. In addition, after a fixed number of generations, information is shared among the subpopulations, to encourage more effective searching. Ensemble Methods in Multi-objective OptimizationIn population-based multi-objective optimization, for a group of solutions to adequately represent the whole Pareto Front it is essential to avoid the clustering of solutions so that the diversity can be improved. In multi-objective optimization literature, ε non-dominance sorting is one such technique that does not allow more than one solution with difference in all objective values less than ε to be non-dominated by each other. However, the effectiveness of ε non-domination sorting method depends on the selection of the individual ε values. In other words, different objectives and different optimization algorithms require different ε values to maintain the diversity of the population. Motivated by this observation, multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO) with an ensemble of ε parameter values and an ensemble of external archives was proposed<ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> to alleviate the difficulty of tuning the numerical values of the ε parameters for every objective in diverse optimization problems.Unlike Pareto dominance based multi-objective algorithms where the goal is to find a set ofM A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTrepresentative Pareto optimal solutions in a single run, multi-objective algorithms based on decomposition decomposes the problem into many single objective optimization sub problems and employs aggregation approaches. In MOEA/D, the objective of each sub problem is a weighted aggregation of all objectives in the multi-objective problem and the neighborhood relations between the sub problems are defined based on the distances among their aggregation weight vectors. Therefore, in MOEA/D, the neighborhood size (NS) plays a crucial role since each sub problem is optimized using the solutions associated with its neighboring sub problems. In literature, it has been demonstrated that different multi-objective problems need different NSs, and even for a particular problem, using different NSs at different search stages could improve the performance. In other words, a large NS is</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_9"><head>5 ) 7 )</head><label>57</label><figDesc>Characteristic identification of the components of an ensemble: It is generally believed that the constituent components of an ensemble should be with distinct characteristics (e.g., exploration and exploitation) to design an efficient ensemble POA. However, how to reliably determine the characteristics of different algorithmic components is still an unresolved problem. It is meaningful to design suitable metrics and methods to extract the features of algorithmic components and select appropriate ones to form an ensemble. 6) Theoretical analysis of ensemble POAs: The published literature mainly focuses on the design of M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT appropriate mechanisms for ensemble strategies and the effectiveness of an ensemble strategy is usually verified through numerical simulations. It is necessary to analyze the ensemble POAs theoretically and describe the effects of each component of an ensemble. The knowledge about the conditions on which the ensemble strategy takes effect could guide us to design efficient ensemble POAs. Effective technique for implementing the ensemble POAs: The ensemble POA is not just a mechanical combination of different algorithms or algorithmic components. It is necessary to make constituent components cooperate during the optimization process rather than purely share and compete for computational resources. In addition, due to the inherent randomness in the POAs, the existing of multiple different algorithmic components may cause the instability of the ensemble POAs (e.g. the difference among the results obtained by different runs may be significant).Therefore, it is important to propose sophisticated mechanisms to realize the ensemble POA. For example, it could be useful to comprehensively consider several factors, such as the fitness improvement, population diversity and landscape characteristic, when evaluating the components of an ensemble in the optimization process. In addition, it is also important to design efficient interaction mechanisms among different components. 8) Ensemble strategies for learning-based optimization: In learning-based optimization, the algorithm is initially expected to explore the huge database of optimization algorithms/search strategies/parameter values before settling down on a few combinations of optimization algorithms/search strategies/parameter values that suit the problem. Therefore, the idea of starting with an ensemble of huge combinations before fine tuning the ensemble to suit the problem at hand can be explored.</figDesc></figure>

Ensemble strategy has become a promising paradigm and framework for designing versatile POAs and improving the efficiency of algorithmic configuration. This paper presents a multi-facet survey on the research related to ensemble POAs. We also provide a brief survey of other related techniques in the literature and compare them with the ensemble-based optimization algorithms.
