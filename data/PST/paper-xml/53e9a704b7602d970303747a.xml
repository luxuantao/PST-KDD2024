<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Object recognition systems constitute a deeply entrenched and omnipresent component of modern intelligent systems. Research on object recognition algorithms has led to advances in factory and office automation through the creation of optical character recognition systems, assembly-line industrial inspection systems, as well as chip defect identification systems. It has also led to significant advances in medical imaging, defence and biometrics. In this paper we discuss the evolution of computer-based object recognition systems over the last fifty years, and overview the successes and failures of proposed solutions to the problem. We survey the breadth of approaches adopted over the years in attempting to solve the problem, and highlight the important role that active and attentive approaches must play in any solution that bridges the semantic gap in the proposed object representations, while simultaneously leading to efficient learning and inference algorithms. From the earliest systems which dealt with the character recognition problem, to modern visually-guided agents that can purposively search entire rooms for objects, we argue that a common thread of all such systems is their fragility and their inability to generalize as well as the human visual system can. At the same time, however, we demonstrate that the performance of such systems in strictly controlled environments often vastly outperforms the capabilities of the human visual system. We conclude our survey by arguing that the next step in the evolution of object recognition algorithms will require radical and bold steps forward in terms of the object representations, as well as the learning and inference algorithms used.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Artificial vision systems have fascinated humans since pre-historic times. The earliest mention of an artificial visually-guided agent appears in classical mythology, where a bronze giant named Talos was created by the ancient god Hephaestus and was given as a gift to King Minos of the Mediterranean island of Crete <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. According to legend the robot served as a defender of the island from invaders by circling the island three times a day, while also making sure that the laws of the land were upheld by the island's inhabitants.</p><p>The fascination and interest for vision systems continues today unabated, not only due to purely intellectual reasons related to basic research, but also due to the potential of such automated vision systems to drastically increase the productive capacity of organizations. Typically, the most essential component of a practical visually-guided agent is its object recognition module.</p><p>Modern computer vision research has its origins in the early 1960s. The earliest applications were pattern recognition systems for character recognition in office automation related tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Early work by Roberts in the 1960s <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> first identified the need to match two-dimensional features extracted from images with the three-dimensional representations of objects. Subsequent research established the practical difficulties in reliably and consistently accomplishing such a task, especially as the scene complexity increased, as the illumination variability increased, and as time, cost, and sensor noise constraints became more prevalent.</p><p>Early systematic work on vision systems is also traced to the Hitachi labs in Japan where the term machine vision originated, to distinguish its more pragmatic goal of constructing practical applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, as compared to the more general term computer vision, popularly used to also include less pragmatic goals. An early research thrust in 1964 involved the automation of the wire-bonding process of transistors, with the ultimate goal of replacing human workers. Even though the automated system achieved 95% accuracy in lab tests, this was deemed too low to replace human workers. By 1973 however, fully automated assembly machines had been constructed <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, resulting in the world's first image-based machine for the automatic assembly of semiconductor devices. Arguably, the most successful application of machine vision technologies is in the assembly and verification processes of the semiconductor industry, enabling the mass production and inspection of complex semiconductors such as wafers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Due to the sheer complexity of this task, human workers could not have possibly solved such problems reliably and efficiently, thus demonstrating how vision technologies have directly contributed to many countries' economic development by enabling the semiconductor revolution experienced over the last couple of decades.</p><p>Early recognition systems also appeared in biomedical research for the chromosome recognition task <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. Even though this work initially had limited impact, its importance became clearer later. Recognition technologies are also successfully used in the food industry (e.g., for the automated classification of agricultural products <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>), the electronics and machinery industry (for automated assembly and industrial inspection purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>), and the pharmaceutical industry (for the classification of tablets and capsules) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Many of the models used for representing objects are also effectively employed by the medical imaging community for the robust segmentation of anatomical structures such as the brain and the heart ventricles <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Handwritten character recognition systems are also employed in mail sorting machines as well as for the digitization and automated indexing of documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Furthermore, traffic monitoring and license plate recognition systems are also successfully used <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, as are monetary bill recognition systems for use with ATMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Biometric vision-based systems for fingerprint recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, iris pattern recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, as well as finger-vein and palm-vein patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> have also gained acceptance by the law enforcement community and are widely used.</p><p>Despite the evident success of recognition systems that are tailored for specific tasks, robust solutions to the more general problem of recognizing complex object classes that are sensed under poorly controlled environments, remain elusive. Furthermore, it is evident from the relevant literature on object recognition algorithms that there is no universal agreement on the definitions of various vision subtasks. Often encountered terms in the literature such as detection, localization, recognition, understanding, classification, categorization, verification and identification, are often ill defined, leading to confusion and ambiguities. Vision is popularly defined as the process of discovering from images what is present in the world and where it is <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Within the context of this paper, we discern four levels of tasks in the vision problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>: Detection: is a particular item present in the stimulus? Localization: detection plus accurate location of item. Recognition: localization of all the items present in the stimulus. Understanding: recognition plus role of stimulus in the context of the scene.</p><p>The localization problem subsumes the detection problem by providing accurate location information of the a priori known item that is being queried for in the stimulus. The recognition problem denotes the more general problem of identifying all the objects present in the image and providing accurate location information of the respective objects. The understanding problem subsumes the recognition problem by adding the ability to decide the role of the stimulus within the context of the observed scene.</p><p>There also exist alternative approaches for classifying the various levels of the recognition problem. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> discerns five levels of tasks of increasing difficulty in the recognition problem:</p><p>Verification: Is a particular item present in an image patch? Detection and localization: Given a complex image, decide if a particular exemplar object is located somewhere in this image, and provide accurate location information on this object.</p><p>Classification: Given an image patch, decide which of the multiple possible categories are present in that patch. Naming: Given a large complex image (instead of an image patch as in the classification problem) determine the location and labels of the objects present in that image. Description: Given a complex image, name all the objects present in the image, and describe the actions and relationships of the various objects within the context of this image. As the author indicates, this is also sometimes referred to as scene understanding.</p><p>Within the context of this paper we will discern the detection, localization, recognition and understanding problems, as previously defined.</p><p>For relatively small object database sizes with small inter-object similarity, the problem of exemplar based object detection in unoccluded scenes, and under controlled illumination and sensing conditions, is considered solved by the majority of the computer vision community. Great strides have also been made towards solving the localization problem. Problems such as occlusion and variable lighting conditions still make the detection, localization and recognition problems a challenge. Tsotsos <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and Dickinson <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> present the components used in a typical object recognition system: that is, feature extraction, followed by feature grouping, followed by object hypothesis generation, followed by an object verification stage (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The advent popularity of machine learning approaches and bags-of-features types of approaches has blurred somewhat the distinction between the above mentioned components. It is not uncommon today to come across popular recognition approaches which consist of a single feature extraction phase, followed by the application of cascades of one or more powerful classifiers.</p><p>The definition of an object is somewhat ambiguous and task dependent, since it can change depending on whether we are dealing with the detection, localization, recognition or understanding problem. According to one definition <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the simpler the problem is (i.e., the further away we are from the image understanding problem as defined above), the closer the definition of an object is to that of a set of templates defining the features that the object must possess under all viewpoints and conditions under which it can be sensed. As we begin dealing with more abstract problems (such as the object understanding problem) the definition of an object becomes more nebulous and dependent on contextual knowledge, since it depends less on the existence of a finite set of feature templates. For example, the object class of toys is significantly abstract and depends on the context. See the work of Edelman <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> for a characterization of what might constitute a proper definition of an object. It is important to emphasize that there were multiple starting points that one can identify for early definitions of what constitutes an object, since this is highly dependent on the recognition system used. As previously discussed, one early starting point was work on the block-world system which led to definitions and generalizations involving 3D objects. However, there were also other significantly different early definitions, which emerged from early applications on character and chromosome recognition and the analysis of aerial images. These latter applications led to progress in pattern recognition, feature detection and segmentation but dealt with objects of a different type. These latter approaches are closely related to modern 2D appearance based object recognition research. Arguably, one of the ultimate goals of recognition research is to identify a common inference, learning and representational framework for objects, that is not application domain specific. In Section 4.3 we discuss how insights from neuroscience might influence the community in the search for such a framework.</p><p>Early research in computer vision was tightly coupled to the general AI problem, as is evidenced by the large overlap in the pub-lication outlets used by the two communities up until the late 1980s. Subsequent approaches to vision research shifted to more mathematically oriented approaches that were significantly different from the classical AI techniques of the time. This spurred a greater differentiation between the two communities. This differentiation between the communities is somewhat unfortunate, especially for dealing with the understanding problem defined above, due to the evident need for high level reasoning capabilities in order to deal with certain vision problem instances which are intractable if these problems are attempted to be solved by extracting a classical object representation from a scene. The need for reasoning capabilities in artificial vision systems is further supported by experiments demonstrating that the human visual system is highly biased by top-down contextual knowledge (an executive controller), which can have a drastic effect on how our visual system perceives the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. More recently a new research thrust is evident, in particular on the part of EU, Japanese, and South Korean funding agencies, towards supporting the creation of more pragmatic object recognition systems that are tightly coupled with cognitive robotics systems. This is evidenced by the fact that during the last decade, around one billion euros have been invested by EU-related funding agencies alone, towards supporting research in cognitive robotics. This last point is further evidenced by the more recent announcement in the US of the National Robotics Initiative for the development of robots that work alongside humans in support of individuals or groups. Assuming that current trends continue, it is fair to predict that research-wise, the future for vision-based robotics systems looks bright.</p><p>The passive approach to vision refers to system architectures which exhibit virtually no control over the data acquisition process, and thus play a minor role in improving the vision system's performance. The passive approach has dominated the computer vision literature, partly due to the influential bottom-up approach to vision advocated by Marr <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, but also partly due to a number of difficulties with implementing non-passive approaches to vision, which are elaborated upon later in this paper. Support for a passive approach to the vision problem is evident even in one of the earliest known treatises on vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, where vision is described as a passive process that is mediated by what is referred to as the ''transparent'' (diauam e1), an invisible property of nature that allows the sense organ to take the form of the visible object.</p><p>In contrast, approaches which exhibit a non-trivial degree of intelligent decision making in the image and data acquisition process, are referred to as ''active'' approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Active approaches offer a set of different techniques for solving similar sets of vision problems. Active approaches are motivated by the fact that the human visual system has two main characteristics: the eyes can move and visual sensitivity is highly heterogeneous across visual space <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. As we will discuss later in this manuscript, active approaches are most useful in vision applications where the issue of mobility and power efficiency becomes a significant factor for determining the viability of the constructed vision system. We can classify these approaches as ''limited active'' approaches which control a single parameter (such as the focus), and ''fully active'' approaches which control more than one parameter within its full range of possibilities.</p><p>From the late 1990s and for the next decade, interest in active vision research by the computer vision community underwent somewhat of a hiatus. However, the recent funding surge in cognitive vision systems and vision based robotics research has reinvigorated research on active approaches to the recognition problem. Historically, early related work is traced to Brentano <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, who introduced a theory that became known as act psychology. This represents the earliest known discussion on the possibility that a subject's actions might play an important role in perception. <ref type="bibr">Barrow</ref> and Popplestone <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> presented what is widely considered the first (albeit limited) discussion on the relevance of object representations and active perception in computer vision. Garvey <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> also presented an early discussion on the benefits of purposive approaches in vision. Gibson <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> critiques the passive approach to vision, and argues that a visual system should also serve as a mediator in order to direct action and determine when to move an eye in one direction instead of another direction. Such early research, followed by a number of influential papers on object representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, sparked the titillating and still relatively unexplored question of how task-directed actions can affect the construction of optimal (in terms of their encoding length) and robust object representations. The concept of active perception was popularized by Bajcsy <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, as ''a problem of intelligent control strategies applied to the data acquisition process''. The use of the term active vision was also popularized by Aloimonos et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> where it was shown that a number of problems that are ill-posed for a passive observer, are simplified when addressed by an active observer. Ballard <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> further popularized the idea that a serial component is necessary in a vision system. Tsotsos <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> proposed that the active vision problem is a special case of the attention problem, which is generally acknowledged to play a fundamental role in the human visual system (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Tsotsos <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> also presented a relevant literature survey on the role of attention in human vision.</p><p>More recent efforts at formalizing the problem and motivating the need for active perception, are discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> for example, the recognition problem is cast within the framework of Probably-Approximately-Correct learning (PAC learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>). This formalization enables the authors to prove the existence of approximate solutions to the recognition problem, under various models of uncertainty. In other words, given a ''good'' object detector the authors provide a set of sufficient conditions such that for all 0 &lt; ; d &lt; 1 2 , with confidence at least 1 À d we can efficiently localize the positions of all the objects we are searching for with an error of at most (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Another important problem addressed is that of determining a set of constraints on the learned object's fidelity, which guarantee that if we fail to learn a representation for the target object ''quickly enough'' it was not due to system noise, due to an insufficient number of training examples, or due to the use of an over-expressive or over-constrained set of object representations H during the object learning/training phase.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The components used in a typical object recognition system <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</p><p>From a less formal perspective, active control of a vision sensor offers a number of benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. It enables us to: (i) Bring into the sensor's field of view regions that are hidden due to occlusion and self-occlusion. (ii) Foveate and compensate for spatial nonuniformity of the sensor. (iii) Increase spatial resolution through sensor zoom and observer motion that brings the region of interest in the depth of field of the camera. (iv) Disambiguate degenerate views due to finite camera resolution, lighting changes and induced motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. (v) Compensate for incomplete information and complete a task. An active vision system's benefits must outweigh the associated execution costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. The associated costs of an active vision system include: (i) Deciding the actions to perform and their execution order. (ii) The time to execute the commands and bring the actuators to their desired state. (iii) Adapt the system to the new viewpoint, find the correspondences between the old and new viewpoint and compensate for the inevitable ambiguities due to sensor noise. By modeling the costs in a way that improves the efficiency of a task solution, a significant benefit could be achieved. For example, the cost could include the distance associated with various paths that a sensor could follow in moving from point A to point B, and the task could involve searching for an object in a certain search region. In such a case, the cost can help us locate the item of interest quickly, by minimizing the distance covered while searching for the object.</p><p>We should point out that a significant portion of the active vision research has been applied on systems where the vision algorithms are not applied concurrently to the execution of the actions. Dickmanns introduced a slightly different paradigm to vision, where machine vision is typically applied on dynamic scenes viewed from a moving platform, or in other words, where vision algorithms are executed concurrently to the actions performed <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. He referred to this framework as dynamic vision. Even though early work on active vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> was based on the argument that the observer is in motion, in practice, most active object recognition systems assume that the sensor is stationary when the images are acquired. We will discuss this framework in more detail in Section 3.</p><p>In recent work the role of learning algorithms has become much more important to the object recognition problem. This has resulted in a blurring of the distinction that emerged during the 1980s, between computer vision research and classical AI. This has also resulted in an emerging debate in the community, as to the intended audience of many computer vision journals. Often the main innovation presented in such papers is more closely related to machine learning, while vision is only treated as a small after-effect/application of the presented learning-based algorithm. Another after-effect of this pattern is that recent work has drifted away from Marr's early paradigm for vision. Nevertheless, and as we will see in Section 4, the fact remains that some of the most successful recognition algorithms rely currently on advanced learning techniques, thus significantly differentiating them from early recognition research. In Section 4.3 we discuss how certain emerging constraints in computing technology might affect the evolution of learning algorithms over the next few years.</p><p>This introductory discussion has outlined the breadth and scope of the approaches adopted by the vision community over the last 50 years, in attempting to solve the recognition problem. The rest of the paper presents a more detailed overview of the literature on object detection, localization and recognition, with a lesser focus on the efforts made to address the significantly more general and challenging problem of object understanding. The relevant literature is broadly categorized into a number of relevant subtopics that will help the reader gain an appreciation of the diverse approaches taken by the community in attempting to solve the problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>. This survey illustrates the extent to which previous research has addressed the often overlooked complexity-related Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The spectrum of attentional mechanisms, as proposed by Tsotsos <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Notice that within this framework, the active vision problem is subsumed by the the attention problem. An active vision system is typically characterized by purposive eye, head or body movements that result in the selection of the visual field, while an attention system is characterized by the full set of mechanisms and behaviors identified above. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. A non-rigorous overview of the assumptions under which the object localization and recognition problems (as formalized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>) are well-behaved and efficiently solvable/learnable problems. Notice that within this framework the recognition problem (bottom right box) subsumes the localization problem (top right box) in that any ''good'' solution to the localization problem, could also be used to solve the recognition problem (although not necessarily optimally), and vice versa. challenges which, in our opinion, have inhibited the creation of robust generic recognition systems. This work also fills a void, by presenting a critical and systematic overview of the literature lying at the intersection of active vision and object recognition. Our work also supports the position that active and attentive approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> to the object recognition problem constitute the next natural evolutionary step in object recognition research.</p><p>In Chart 1 we project the algorithms surveyed in this paper along a number of dimensions, and highlight the evolution of the dimensions' relative importance over the years. A number of patterns become evident upon inspecting Chart 1. For example there is a clear increase in focus over the years with respect to the scalability of inference, search efficiency, and training efficiency. At the same time, in early work there was a significantly greater focus on the use of 3D in recognition systems. Similarly we see that the search for powerful indexing primitives and compact object representations was always recognized as an important topic in the literature, while there is less consistency in the use of function, context and texture features. These points are elaborated later in this survey.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we survey classical approaches to the object recognition and understanding problems, where the data acquisition processes demonstrate limited intelligence. Section 3 further motivates the active and dynamic approaches to vision. In Section 4 we discuss some of the most characteristic approaches adopted over the years by algorithms that have won various vision challenges. The section ends with a brief discussion as to where the field appears to be headed in the near future. Section 5 summarizes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Classical approaches</head><p>We present a critical overview of classical approaches to the object recognition problem. Most of the methods described exhibit limited purposive control over the data acquisition process. Therefore, the word ''passive'' can also be used to differentiate the approaches described from ''active'' approaches to the recognition problem. In subsequent sections we will build upon work in this section, in order to overview the less developed field of active approaches to the recognition problem. Though the earliest work appeared in the late nineteen-eighties, the field still remains in its infancy, with a plethora of open research problems that need further investigation. It will become evident, as we review the relevant literature, that a solution to the recognition problem will require answers to a number of important questions that were raised in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. That is, questions on the effects that finite computational resources and a finite learning time have in terms of solving the problem. The problem of constructing optimal object representations in particular emerges as an important topic in the literature on passive and active object recognition. Algorithms whose construction is driven by solutions that provide satisfactory answers to such questions, must form a necessary component of any reliable passive or active object recognition system. The categorization of the relevant literature on classical approaches to the recognition problem follows the one proposed by Dickinson,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> with modifications in order to include in the survey some more recent neuromorphic approaches that have gained in popularity. This section's presentation on passive approaches to the recognition problem is also used to contextualize the discussion in Section 3, on active approaches to the problem.</p><p>As we survey the literature in the field, we use the standard recognition pipeline described in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> as a common framework for contextualizing the discussion. We will support the hypothesis that most research on object recognition is reducible to the problem of attempting to optimize either one of the modules in the pipeline (feature-extraction ? feature-grouping ? object-hypothesis ? object-verification) or is reducible to the problem of attempting to improve the operations applied to the object database in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, by proposing more efficient querying algorithms, or more efficient object representations (which in turn support better inference and learning algorithms and reduce the related storage requirements). Sporadically throughout the text, we will recap our discussion, by comparing some of the most influential papers discussed so far. We do this by comparing these papers along various dimensions such as their complexity, the indexing strength, their scalability, the feasibility of achieving general tasks, their use of function and context, the level of prior knowledge and the extent to which they make use of 3D information. We provide discussions on the assumptions and applicability of the most Chart 1.

The approach was popularized by a number of people in the field such as Nevatia and Binford <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, Marr <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref> and Brooks <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> amongst others. This section briefly overviews some of the most popular related approaches. It is interesting to notice that the earliest attempts at solving the object recognition problem used high level 3D parts based objects, such as generalized cylinders and other deformable objects, such as geons and superquadrics. However, in practice, it was too difficult to extract such parts from images. A number of important points must be made with regards to parts based recognition. High level primitives such as generalized cylinders, geons and superquadrics-which we describe in more detail later in this paper-provide high level indexing primitives. View-based/appearance-based approaches on the other hand provide less complex indexing primitives (edges, lines, corners, etc.) which result in an increase in the number of extracted features. This makes such low level features less reliable as indexing primitives when using object databases numbering thousands of objects. In other words, the search complexity for matching image features to object database features increases as the extracted object feature complexity decreases. This explains why most of the work that uses such low level primitives is only applied to object databases with a small number of objects. The above described problem is often referred to in the literature as the semantic gap problem. As it is argued in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, a verification/disambiguation/attention-like mechanism is needed to disambiguate and recognize the objects, because such primitives of low complexity are often more frequent and ambiguous. In other words, with simple indexing features, the burden of recognition is no longer determined by the task of deciding which complex high-level features are in the image, a difficult task by itself, but instead, it is shifted to the verification stage and discrimination of simple indexing primitives. The parts-based vs. viewbased approach to recognition has generated some controversy in the field. This controversy is exemplified by a sequence of papers on what is euphemistically called the Tarr-Biederman debate <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. The topic of hierarchies of parts-based and view-based representations has asssumed a central role in the literature for efficiently representing objects and bridging the above described semantic gap problems. This is exemplified by a number of papers that we survey.</p><p>In Chart 2 and Table <ref type="table">1</ref> we present a comparison, along certain dimensions, for a number of the papers surveyed in Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, which includes a number of recognition models that use volumetric parts-based representations. For example, since much of the early research on volumetric parts used manually trained models, a single star is used in the corresponding training efficiency columns. It will become evident that most progress in the field lies in the image classification problem (as opposed to the more demanding object localization and segmentation problems), which is aligned with the current needs of industry for image and video search solutions.</p><p>Binford <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> and Nevatia and Binford <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> introduced and popularized the idea of generalized-cylinder-based recognition. A generalized cylinder is a parametric representation of 3D cylinder-like objects, defined by a 3D curve called an axis, and planar cross-sections normal to the axis. These planar cross-sections are defined by a cross-section function which in turn depends on the 3D curves' parameterization. According to Binford's definition, the cross-sections' center of gravity must intersect the 3D curve. Nevatia and Binford use a subset of generalized cylinders-namely generalized cones-to recognize the objects present in a particular scene. They use the range data of a particular scene to segment the scene into its constituent parts-by clustering together regions with non-rapidly changing depth. Each such segmented cluster is, then, further segmented into parts that can be most easily described by generalized cones. They accomplish this by extracting the medial axis of each segmented cluster-similar to Blum's medial axis transformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>-, and splitting the cluster into a new subcluster whenever the medial axis changes rapidly. This results in a number of segments with smoothly changing medial axes which can be described by the 2D projections of 3D generalized cones. The authors do not advocate using any common optimization technique to determine the rotation and scale of the generalized cone that should be used. Instead, they advocate using a rather brute force approach-i.e., project each 3D generalized cone to a 2D image plane, rotate it a number of times and determine which rotation results in the best fit. The extracted cylinders are then used to build a graph-like representation of the detected object. For example, if a detected cylinder's cone angle exceeds a particular angle threshold, that particular part is labeled as conical as opposed to cylindrical. Elongated parts, with a length to width ratio greater than 3.0, are similarly labeled as well-defined. These qualitative descriptors are used as object features/indices which are in turn used to recognize the object from a database of object descriptors.</p><p>Chart 2. Summary of the Table <ref type="table">1</ref> scores, consisting of the 1971-1996 papers surveyed that make significant contributions to volumetric part modeling, automatic programming, perceptual organization and interpretation tree search. Notice that 3D parts and their use for indexing and encoding objects compactly, forms a significant component of this set of papers.</p><p>Brooks <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> presents the Acronym object recognition system. The author again uses generalized cones to model the objects as shown in Figs. <ref type="figure">4,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">5</ref>. Volumetric models and spatial relations amongst object parts are represented using an object graph. The author also defines a restriction graph which is used to define a class and subclass hierarchy for the object we are modeling. In a way, this provides ''scale'' information which specifies the amount of detail we wish to use when defining and searching for an object (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">5</ref>). For each part's joint the authors define constraints on the relations between the various parts. Most often these constraints are used to define the permissible angles between the various joints that would lead to acceptable instances of the object. For example, if we are interested in modeling an articulated object such as a piston, constraints can be defined denoting the allowable articulation of the object's parts that would lead to an instance of a piston. The author defines a constraint manipulation system and shows how the geometric reasoning that this model provides can be used to reason about the model and discover geometric and quasi-geometric invariants about a particular object model. These discovered invariants are positioned in a prediction graph, which is used in conjunction with extracted image features to determine whether the desired object exists in the image. The distinguishing characteristic of Brooks' work is that it is one of the first systems having used parts-based recognition and generalized cylinders to provide reliable results.</p><p>Zerroug and Nevatia <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> study the use of the orthographic projection invariants that are generated from instances of generalized cylinders. These projective invariants are detected from intensity images. A verification phase is used to verify the goodness-ofmatch of 3D shapes based on the extracted image features, thus providing an alternative approach for recovering 3D volumetric primitives from images.</p><p>In practice, the main limitation of generalized cylinders lies in the need to adapt the input scene to the model based on volumetric parts. The inability to come up with a good optimization scheme for extracting parts from images is a significant drawback of such algorithms. The models we reviewed here are mainly manually trained, and as we will see when we review deformable models, it is not clear how to automatically extract such 3D parts-based components from images. Within the context of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the power of generalized cylinders and cones lies in their potential future evolution as a representationally compact and powerful indexing primitive, which was what motivated early research on the topic. While it is not clear how to achieve repeatability when extracting these primitives from 2D images, when reliable 3D data is available the mapping from images to primitives becomes much more predictable. While ultimately there may not exist a one-to-one mapping between an image and a set of generalized cylinders,  Comparing some of the more distinct algorithms of Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 along a number of dimensions. For each paper, and where applicable, 1-4 stars (⁄, ⁄⁄, ⁄⁄⁄, ⁄⁄⁄⁄) are used to indicate the strength/expended effort along the corresponding dimension. These often implicitly denote why a particular paper became well known. Where appropriate, a not-applicable label (N/A) is used. Inference scalability: The focus of the paper on improving the robustness of the algorithm as the scene complexity or the object class complexity increases.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Automatic programming</head><p>A critical issue in object recognition is the problem of extracting and organizing the relevant knowledge about an object and turning this knowledge into a vision program. This is referred to as automatic programming. This subsection briefly overviews some of the early work on the automatic generation of recognition programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>. This entails learning the important features of an object automatically, learning the most important/discriminating aspects/views of the object and coming up with search strategies for identifying the object from a jumble of objects. In Section 2.7 we will discuss the role of affordances in improving recognition performance, since it is believed that during early childhood development the association between an object's visual appearance and its usage is primed. This in turn will highlight the existence of a relatively unexplored link between active approaches to visual inspection (see Section 3) and automatic programming algorithms, which could in principle improve the full standard recognition pipeline (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>Before the publication of the early work on automatic programming, many components of successful recognition programs were handwritten. For example, in the Acronym system presented in the previous subsection, the user has to manually define an object graph and a restriction graph for each one of the objects he wishes the system to be capable of recognizing. When we are constructing systems that need to recognize thousands of objects, this is obviously a slow, expensive and suboptimal process.</p><p>Goad <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> published one of the first methods for the automatic generation of object recognition programs. He compiles the visible edges of an object in the current field of view into an interpretation tree and uses this tree to interpret the image. However, this work relies on a single view/aspect of the object. Similarly, Bolles and Horaud <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> use three-dimensional models of various objects to find them in range data. This is a system for the recognition of objects in a jumble and under partial occlusions. Given candidate recognized objects, a verification stage follows, and then the algorithm determines some essential object configurational information, such as which objects are on top of each other. A disadvantage of such early work is that it relies heavily on edge/line based models, which are not always suitable for certain objects that are differentiated by more subtle features such as color and texture. Within the context of the standard recognition pipeline of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, this work represents an early effort to the generation and verification of object hypotheses. While the problem of localizing objects of interest from a jumble remains relevant and constitutes one of the earliest problems that vision systems were tasked with solving, the general version of the problem is still open.</p><p>Ikeuchi and Kanade <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> modified slightly the Koenderink and van Doorn <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> definition of an object's aspect to create a multiview recognition system based on the aspect graphs of simple 3D polyhedral objects. According to Ikeuchi and Kanade <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, an aspect consists of the set of contiguous viewer directions from which the same object surfaces are visible. The authors use a tessellated sphere to sample the object from various viewer directions. Subsequently, they classify these samples into equivalence classes of aspects. Various features of the object are then extracted to achieve recognition. Features used include face area, face inertia, number of surrounding faces for each face, distances between the surrounding faces and the face, and the extended gaussian image (EGI) vectors. The polyhedral object extraction as well as many of these features depend on accurate object depth/structure extraction. This is achieved using a light stripe range finder. These features are used in the interpretation tree for the aspect classification stage (see Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). The interpretation tree provides a methodology for determining the aspect currently viewed, the viewer direction and rotation with respect to the aspect (this is achieved again by a decision tree type classification on the features) and finally, once all this information is extracted, it is possible to make a hypothesis as to the object currently viewed. This is a view based recognition system and shares the main disadvantage of view based approaches since a 3D polyhedron with n faces has O(n 3 ) aspects making such a system very expensive computationally. This algorithm uses a light stripe range finder and therefore it belongs to the group of algorithms that relies on the existence of 3D information. Within the context of the standard recognition pipeline (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), this work represents an example of feature grouping for the discovery of viewpoint invariants. Similar ideas re-emerge in modern recognition work, often under the disguise of dimensionality reduction techniques, affine invariant interest-point detectors and features, as well as hierarchical object representations, where high-level shared features are used to compactly represent an object and recognize novel object instances from multiple views. In Section 3 we will discuss some extensions of aspect graph matching to the problem of next-view planning and active multiview recognition systems.</p><p>As we will see in the next subsections, in more recent work, and as we begin using more low-level features (edges, lines, SIFT-like Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. An object model compiled into an interpretation tree. Adapted from Ikeuchi and Kanade <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. This interpretation tree consists of five aspects S1, . . ., S5. At each node of the tree a feature (such as face moment, topology, etc.) is used to discriminate each node's aspect group and ultimately classify each aspect. Then, more features are used to determine the viewpoint direction and rotation of the aspects. Given a region in an input image, the corresponding features are estimated from that region, and if the estimated features lead to a path in this interpretation tree from the root to a leaf, then the object and its attitude/viewpoint have been determined successfully.</p><p>features <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, etc.) which are currently popular, the need for manual interaction decreases and statistical learning based algorithms accomplish the learning with much less user interaction. However, very little work exists in the active vision literature for automatically extracting optimal object representations in terms of the minimum encoding length and robustness. While there exist hierarchical approaches, which are meant to provide compact representations, there do not exist guarantees that these are the minimal or the most robust representations. As it is argued in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, such optimal representations constitute an important component of any real-time vision system. As it is argued in <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, the problem of creating object representations that are independent of sensor specific biases has not received attention commensurate with its importance in the vision problem. The advantages in using object representations with a minimal representation length are well known from the machine learning literature (e.g., Occam's razor and smaller storage requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>). These advantages are especially important in hierarchical object representations, since the goal of such representations is to minimize the encoding length through a parts based representation of objects. However, from at least an information theoretic perspective, there are also advantages in not using a minimum encoding length as this can add a level of redundancy, and redundancy makes recognition systems less fragile. For example, the paper by <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, which we discuss in more detail in a subsequent section, has an inherent redundancy in its decision system, which might partially explain its good performance. It is not clear what is the best representation for maximizing robustness while also maximizing generalization capability, and minimizing representation length.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Perceptual organization</head><p>Perceptual organization techniques typically attempt to model the human visual system's canny ability to detect non-accidental properties of low-level features, and group these features, in order to build more compact object representations. Therefore, perceptual organization techniques represent an attempt at improving the feature-grouping and indexing-primitive generation of the standard recognition pipeline (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). When we extract low level features such as edges and lines, we are usually interested in finding some sort of correspondence/alignment between those features and mapping these groupings to a model of higher complexity. In a typical image, the number of features n can be in the hundreds if not thousands, implying that a brute force approach is impractical for matching 3D object models to 2D image features. The Gestaltists' view is that humans perceive the simplest possible interpretation of the visible data. The greatest success in the study of perceptual organization has been achieved by assuming that the aim of perceptual organization is to detect stable image groupings that reflect non-accidental image properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. A number of common factors which predispose the element grouping were identified by the Gestaltists <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> (also see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">7</ref>):</p><p>Similarity: similar features are grouped together. Proximity: nearby features are usually grouped together. Continuity: Features that lead to continuous or ''almost'' continuous curves are grouped together. Closure: Curves/features that create closed curves are grouped together. Common region: Features that lie inside the same closed region are grouped together.</p><p>In the case of familiar configuration in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">7</ref>, the features corresponding to the Dalmatian dog pop-out easily if this is a familiar image. Otherwise, this can be a challenging image to understand. There is evidence that the brain uses various measures-such as the total closure, by measuring the total gap of perceived contours <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>-as intermediate steps in shape formation and representation. Berengolts and Lindenbaum <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref> demonstrate that the distribution of saliency-defined as increasing as a point gets near an edge-point-is probabilistically modeled fairly accurately along a curve using the first 3 moments of the distribution and Edgeworth series. Tests are performed for the distribution of the saliency for points near a curve's end and far away from the curve's end. The predicted saliency distribution matches closely the distribution in real images. Such probabilistic methods are useful for making inferences regarding the organization of edges/lines in images.</p><p>Lowe <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84]</ref> formalizes some of these heuristics in a probabilistic framework. He uses these heuristics to ''join'' lines and edges that likely belong together and thus, decreases the overall complexity of the model fitting process. In particular, he searches for lines which satisfy parallelism and collinearity, and searches for line endpoints which satisfy certain proximity constraints. For example, given prior knowledge of the average number d of line segments per unit area, the expected number N of segments within a radius r of a given line's endpoint is N = dpr 2 . If this value is very low for a particular region but a second line endpoint within this radius r has been detected, this is a strong indication that the two lines are not together accidentally, and the two lines are joined. Similar heuristics are defined for creating other Gestalt-like perceptual groups based on parallelism and collinearity. He uses these perceptual grouping heuristics in conjunction with an iterative optimization process to fit 3D object models onto images, and recognize the object(s) in the image.</p><p>Huttenlocher and Ullman <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> show that under orthographic projection with a scale factor, three corresponding points between image features and object model features are sufficient to align a rigid solid object with an image, up to a reflexive ambiguity. By taking the Canny edges of an image <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>, and limiting their feature search to edge corners and inflection points, they derive an alignment algorithm that aligns those features with a 3D model's corresponding features. Those features are chosen because they are relatively invariant to rotations and scale changes. An alignment runs in O(m 2 n 2 ) time, where m is the number of model interest points and n is the number of image interest points. Once a potential alignment is found, a verification stage takes place where the image model is projected on the image and all its interest points are compared with the image's interest point for proximity.</p><p>Sarkar and Boyer <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> present one of the earliest attempts at integrating top-down knowledge in the perceptual organization of images. The authors use the formalism of Bayesian-networks, to construct a system that is capable of better organizing the external stimuli based on certain Gestalt principles. The system executes repeatedly two phases. A bottom-up/pre-attentive phase uses the extracted features from the image to construct a hierarchy of a progressively more complex organization of the stimuli. Graph algorithms are then used to mine the image data and find continuous segments, closed figures, strands, junctions, parallels and intersections. Perceptual inference using Bayesian networks is used to integrate information about various spatial features and form composite hypotheses, based on the evidence gathered so far. The goal is to repeat this process so that ultimately a more high-level organization and reasoning of the image features is possible.</p><p>Yu and Shi <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87]</ref> define the concept of ''repulsion'' and ''attraction'' for the perceptual organization of images and figureground segmentation and show how to use normalized-cuts to segment the images into perceptually similar regions. They argue that such forces might contribute to phenomena such as pop-out and texture segmentation and they discuss their importance to the problem of visual search.</p><p>While investigating the role of perceptual organization in vision is a vibrant topic of research, most commercially successful recognition systems currently rely on far simpler 'flat' architectures, typically consisting of a simple feature extraction layer followed by a powerful classifier (see Section 4 on the PASCAL challenges). The need for object representations with a minimal encoding length was briefly discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. For example, Verghese and Pelli <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref> provide some evidence in support of the view that the human visual system is a limited capacity information processing device, by experimentally demonstrating that visual attention in humans processes about 30-60 bits of information. More complex feature groupings and indexing primitives inspired by the modeling of non-accidental image properties, could offer another approach for improving the standard recognition pipeline of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Interpretation tree search</head><p>A number of authors have worked on interpretation tree search based algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. Grimson and Lozano-Perez <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> discuss how local measurements of three-dimensional positions and surface normals, that are recorded by a set of tactile sensors or by three dimensional range sensors, are used to identify and localize objects. This work represents an example of how interpretation trees can moderate the explosive growth in the size of the hypothesis space as the number of sensed points and the number of surfaces associated with the object model is increased. The sensor is assumed to provide 3D position and local orientation information of a small number of points on the object, and as such it serves as another example of a system that makes use of the range information provided by an active range sensor. The authors model the objects as 3D polyhedra with up to six degrees of freedom relative to the sensors (three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom), and use local constraints on the distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles of vectors between sensed points. Given s sensed points and n surfaces in each of the known objects, the total number of possible interpretations is n s . An interpretation is deemed legal if it is possible to determine a rotation and translation that would align the two sets of points. Since it is infeasible computationally to carry n s tests on all possible combinations, an interpretation tree approach-combined with tree pruning-in conjunction with a generate-and-test approach, is used to determine the proper alignment. The constraints used for tree pruning (see Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>), include (i) the distance constraint, where the distances between pairs of points must correspond to the distances on the model, (ii) the angle constraint where the range of possible angles between normals must contain the angle of known object model normals, and (iii) the direction constraint, where for every triple {i, j, k} of model surfaces, the cones of the directions between the points on the pairs i, j and j, k are extracted and are used to determine whether three sensed 3D points might also lie on surfaces i, j, k.</p><p>Each node of the interpretation tree represents one of these model constraints, and at each level of the tree the corresponding model constraint is compared with one of the possible range-dataderived constraints of the scene. If one of the three constraints described above does not hold, the entire interpretation tree branch is pruned. As the authors show experimentally and by a probabilistic analysis, the computational benefits are significant, since the use of such constraints lead to the efficient pruning of hypotheses which in turn speeds up inference. For example, in one of the experiments that the authors perform, they demonstrate that this pruning leads to a reduction in the number of candidate hypotheses: from the 312,500,000 initial possible hypotheses for the object, only 20 were left. Within the context of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the work by Grimson and Lozano-Perez <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> represents a successful attempt at speeding up the hypothesis generation module, by introducing a number of constraints for solving an initially intractable problem. This constitutes an exemplar-based recognition system, and as such it is a good tool for machine vision tasks where we are dealing with the problem of localizing well-defined geometric object (e.g., assembly line inspection).</p><p>Fan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> use dense range data and a graph-based representation of objects-where the graph captures information about the various surface patches and their relation to each other-to recognize objects. These relations might indicate connectivity or occlusion. A given scene's graph is decomposed into subgraphs (e.g., feature grouping) and each subgraph ideally represents a detected object's graph representation. The matching is performed using three modules: A screener module, which determines the most likely candidate views for each object, a graph matcher module, which compares candidate matching graphs, and an analyzer, which makes proposals on how to split/merge object graphs. Features used during the matching between an object model and a scene extracted graph include the visible area of each patch, the orientation of each patch, its principal curvatures, the estimated occlusion ratio, etc. Each patch is encoded by a node in the graph, and adjacent patches are encoded with an edge between the nodes. Heuristic procedures are defined on how to merge/split such graphs into subgraphs based on the edge strength. Heuristic procedures for matching graphs are also provided. The authors attempt to address many issues simultaneously, such as object occlusion and segmenting out background nuisances. However, it is not clear how easy it is to reliably extract low-level features such as patch orientations, and principal curvatures from images. Furthermore, the complexity requirements for reliably learning such object representations might be quite high. Within the context of the general recognition framework in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the system makes a proposal for improving all of the pipeline's components, from the extraction and grouping of strong indexing primitives, all the way to the hypothesis generation and object verification stage. It is not clear, however, how efficient this object representation is in terms of its encoding length, and it is, thus, not clear how well it compares to other similar approaches. Hierarchical representations of objects will be discussed in more detail later in this survey, and are meant to provide reusable and compact object parts. They constitute a popular and closely related extension of graph based representations of objects.</p><p>Many interpretation-tree approaches do not automatically adjust the expressive power of their representation during training and online object recognition. As it is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> this could have serious implications in the training process and the reliability of online recognition. A fundamental problem of interpretation tree search is coming up with a good tradeoff between tree complexity and generalization ability and making the system capable of controlling the representational complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. However, this problem of a constant expressive power is shared by most recognition systems described in this document, so this is not an issue exclusively related to the interpretation-tree approach to recognition.</p></div>

The indexing of these invariants in hash-tables (geometric hashing <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>) is a popular technique for achieving this efficiency. A desirable property of such geometric invariants is that they are invariant under certain group actions, thus providing an equivalence class of object deformations modulo certain transformations. Typical deformations discussed in the literature include 2D translations, rotations and scalings (similarity transformations), as well as 2D affine and projective transformations. Many of these hashing techniques have also been extended to the 3D case and are particularly useful when there exists reliable range information. Such rapid indexing mechanisms have also been quite successful in medical imaging and bioinformatics, and particularly in matching template molecules to target 3D proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>. Thus, under certain restrictions, geometric hashing techniques can reliably address a number of problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>:</p><p>1. Obtaining an object indexing mechanism that is invariant under certain often-encountered deformations (e.g., affine and projective deformations). 2. Obtaining an object indexing mechanism that is fairly robust under partial occlusions. 3. Recognizing objects in a scene with a sub-linear complexity in terms of the number of objects in the object database. The inherent parallelism of geometric hashing approaches is another one of their advantages.</p><p>A problem with such group invariants is that perspective projections do not form a group. Furthermore, early work on the application of group invariants was complicated by the fact that other common object deformations also do not form groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref> and cannot be described easily by closed form expressions.</p><p>Notice that in the recent literature, geometric invariants tend to emerge within the context of local feature-based and parts-based methods (which are discussed in more detail later in Section 2). For example, interest-point detectors that are invariant with respect to various geometric transformations (translation or affine invariance for example) are often used to determine regions of interest, regardless of image or sensor specific transformations/ deformations. This provides a measure of robustness for determining regions around which features or parts can be extracted reliably and with a degree of invariance Agarwal and Roth <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>,</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>.

The figure shows three points A, B, C on the surface of a cube, and the three normals N A , N B , N C of the corresponding surface planes. For each pair of points {A, B}, {B, C}, {A, C} the distance between the two points refers to the corresponding distance constraint. For each pair of normals {N A , N B }, {N B , N C }, {N A , N C } the angle between the normals refers to an angle constraint. For each pair of surfaces, the cone spanned by the directions between all pairs of points on the two surfaces defines another direction constraintgiven three sensed points, the corresponding cones can be extracted and if they form a subset of the corresponding model cones, a match has occurred. These cones can be used to prune the interpretation tree.</p><p>Weber et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>, Fergus et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>, Lazebnik et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref>, Mikolajczyk and Schmid <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref>.</p><p>The origins of the idea of geometric hashing for shapes, are traced to Schwartz and Sharir <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">95]</ref>. Often, subsets of feature points are used to obtain a coordinate frame of the image's object, and all other model/image features use this coordinate frame to get expressed in affine invariant or projective coordinates. Other popular invariants include the differential invariants (under Euclidean actions) of Gaussian curvature and torsion, as well as a number of invariants related to the plane conics which can be applied to lines, arcs, and corners <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>. We will discuss some of these invariants later in this section. These invariants are used to rapidly access a hash table. Typically, this procedure is repeated a number of times for each object, votes are accumulated for each such subset of coordinates, and the object identity hypothesis with the most votes is the choice of the recognized object.

Each such (a, b) coordinate is used as an index to insert into a hash table the affine coordinate basis and an object ID. This makes it possible to encode each interest point using all possible affine basis coordinates. For each triplet of interest points in the image, their corresponding affine coordinate basis is used to calculate the coordinates (a, b) of all the other interest points. These coordinates are hashed in the hash table. The object entry in the hash table with sufficient votes is chosen as the recognized object. If a verification stage also succeeds-where the object edges are compared with those of the scene-the algorithm has succeeded in recognizing the object. Otherwise, a new affine basis coordinate is chosen and the process is repeated (see Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</p><p>Flynn and Jain <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref> describe an approach for 3D to 3D object matching using invariant features indexing. Solid models of objects-composed of cylinders, spheres, planes-are used to determine corresponding triples {(M 1 , S 1 ), (M 2 , S 2 ), (M 3 , S 3 )} where M i denotes a model surface and S i denotes a corresponding scene surface. For each pair of extracted scene cylinders, spheres and planes, an invariant feature is defined and extracted. For example, for each pair of scene cylinders and planes the angle between the plane's normal and the cylinder's axis of symmetry is extracted. Pairs or triples of such invariant features are used to access tables where each table entry contains a linked-list of all the database object Chart 3.

This set of papers emphasizes the use of powerful indexing and object encoding primitives. We notice that apart from the 3-D shape/deformable model papers, the other papers do not make much use of 3-D information for inference and object modeling/representation, and very few of the other papers make use of function or context. In other words there was little crosstalk between the paradigms during 1973-1999.</p><p>Chart 4. Summary of the scores from the Table <ref type="table">2</ref> papers published between 2000-2011 that make significant contributions to geometric invariants, 3-D shapes/deformable models, function, context, and appearance based recognition. This set of papers emphasizes the use of powerful indexing and object encoding primitives. Compared to the chart in Chart 3 we notice an ever smaller role of 3D in recognition, and a greater emphasis on function, context and efficient inference algorithms. models composed of the same invariant features. A vote is placed for each of the objects in that table entry. By performing this process across all the extracted invariant features of the scene object, the table object with the most votes is selected as the recognized object.</p><p>Forsyth et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref> present a framework on invariant descriptors for 3D model-based vision. The authors survey the large mathematics literature on projective geometry and its invariants, and apply these invariants to the recognition problem. One of the projective invariants that they discuss for example, involves the use of plane conics. A plane conic is given by the values of x satisfying x T cx = 0 where c is some symmetric matrix with a determinant of 1. A projective invariant of such a conic is given by the value</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x T 1 cx 2 À Á 2 x T 1 cx 1 À Á x T 2 cx 2 À Á<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>where x 1 , x 2 are any two points not lying in the conic. In other words, the value in (3) is independent of the coordinate frame in which x 1 , x 2 and the conic are measured, and is invariant under projective distortions. For example, this can be useful for consistently detecting a car's wheels from multiple viewpoints.</p><p>A problem with many geometric hashing techniques includes the fact that the resulting feature distributions are not uniform, thus, slowing down the indexing mechanism by unevenly distributing the indices in the hash-table cells. Such problems are usually addressed by uniformly rehashing the table through the use of a distribution function that models well the expected uneven distribution of features in the original hash-table . 
Bayesian formulations of the problem are also useful in modeling positional errors in the hash-tables <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">95]</ref>. For example, one can attempt to maximize the probability P(M k , i, j, BjS 0 ) by using Bayes' theorem to assign weighted votes to the hash-table, where M k is an object model, i, j are indices of two distinct points on the model which correspond to two points from the basis set B (these two points can define an axis of the current coordinate frame) and S 0 is the set of extracted scene points which excluded the currently chosen basis points in B. The use of such a redundant vote representation scheme can also diminish the need to consider all possible model basis combinations in various hashing and voting algorithms.</p><p>Geometric hashing algorithms constitute a proven methodology offering a rapid indexing mechanism. However, there is little work on bridging the semantic gap between the low-level features typically extracted from images, and the high order representations that are ultimately necessary for recognition algorithms to work well with non-trivial objects, while simultaneously maintaining the rapid indexing advantages of such hashing approaches.</p></div>

Is it perhaps the case that we first learn to recognize an object by parts, but as we become more familiar with the object, we recognize it as a whole? The answer to these questions could have Table <ref type="table">2</ref> Comparing some of the more distinct algorithms of Sections 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8 along a number of dimensions. For each paper, and where applicable, 1-4 stars (⁄, ⁄⁄, ⁄⁄⁄, ⁄⁄⁄⁄) are used to indicate the strength/expended effort along the corresponding dimension. These often implicitly denote why a particular paper became well known. Where appropriate, a not-applicable label (N/A) is used. Inference scalability: The focus of the paper on improving the robustness of the algorithm as the scene complexity or the object class complexity increases. Search efficiency: The use of intelligent strategies to decrease the time spent localizing an object when the corresponding algorithm is used for localization. If it is a detection algorithm, this refers to its localization efficiency within the context of a sliding-window approach (i.e., the degree of the use of intelligent strategies to improve detection efficiency). Training efficiency: The level of automation in the training process, and the speed with which the training is done. Encoding scalability: The encoding length of the object representations as the number of objects increases or as the object representational fidelity increases. Diversity of indexing primitives: The distinctiveness and number of indexing primitives used. Uses function or context: The degree to which function and context influences the algorithm. Uses 3D: The degree to which depth/range/3D information is used by the algorithm for inference or model representations. Uses texture: The degree to which texture discriminating features are used by the algorithm. profound implications for the design of computer vision systems. A number of researchers have addressed this issue. This section overviews some of the related research. The combinatorial and minimum encoding length arguments from the previous sections provide a compelling argument as to the need for parts based recognition. It is combinatorially infeasible to achieve 3D recognition of wholes without parts based recognition preceding it first. Pelli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref> provide some compelling arguments in support of the parts based approach. To support their arguments, the authors demonstrate that human efficiency in reading English words is inversely proportional to word length, where ''efficiency'' is defined as the ratio of the ideal observer's threshold energy divided by a human observer's threshold energy-threshold energy being the minimum energy needed in the signal/word to make it observable. The authors demonstrate that despite having read billions of words in their lifetime and the visual system having learnt them as well as it is possible, humans do not learn to recognize words as wholes. They demonstrate that efficiency decreases with increasing word length. If humans recognized words as wholes, this effect should not be as pronounced. A word is never learnt as an independent feature and human performance never surpasses that achievable by letter based models. A word cannot be read unless its letters can be separately recognized and its components are detected. This leads to some interesting ideas with respect to purely feedforward approaches to recognition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>. As localization is very difficult using purely feedforward approaches and since some sort of localization on the object is necessary to recognize the individual parts, an attention mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> is necessary in order to provide this localization/ parts-based information.</p><p>It is, however, unknown what the components used in parts based recognition are. To this extent, numerous hypotheses have been formulated, which attempt to explain the components used in parts based recognition. However, as many years of research on the subject have shown, the extraction of such parts from 2D images is far from trivial, and depends strongly on the image complexity and the similarity of the image features to the finite set of object parts.</p><p>Within the context of the recognition framework in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, 3D shapes and deformable models are believed to provide an extremely powerful indexing mechanism. Their main limitation is, however, the difficulty in extracting and learning such representations from 2D images. As a result in modern work, such 3D part-based representations are not very popular (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">7</ref> for example). Nevertheless, many researchers believe that such 3D representations must play a significant role in bridging the semantic gap of recognition systems (see the Tarr-Biederman debate in Section 2.1). As we will notice, there has been little effort in modern work for merging such 3D parts based representation with modern viewbased methodologies relying on texture, local features and advanced statistical learning algorithms.</p><p>Fischler and Elschlager <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref> present an early system where a reference image is represented by p components and also associate a cost with the relative displacement/deformation in the spatial position of each component. Biederman <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> suggests that the components most appropriate for the recognition process are geons, which are generalized cones such as blocks, cylinders, wedges and cones. A maximum of 36 such geons are suggested. He argues in support of the recognition-by-components approach to vision. The author maintains that these geons are readily extractable from five detectable edge based properties of images: curvature, collinearity, symmetry, parallelism and cotermination (see Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>). Biederman claims that, since these properties are invariant over viewing directions, it should be readily possible to extract geons from arbitrary images. Years of research in the field have demonstrated, however, that the extraction of geons from arbitrary images is a non-trivial task and most likely more sources of regularization are needed if reliable extraction from images of such high-complexity objects is to be achieved. This early research by Biederman on recognition-by-components influenced significantly the computer vision community, and spurred a number of years of intense research in the field. The author argues that the human visual system recognizes a maximum of 30,000 object classes, by using an English language dictionary to approximate the number of nouns in the English language. Notice, however, that one could also argue that humans are capable of distinguishing amongst many more than 30,000 objects (millions of objects) since for each such noun, humans can effortlessly distinguish amongst many sub-classes (e.g., the noun 'car' has multiple distinguishable sub-categories which are not enumerated in a typical English language dictionary). By simple combinatorial arguments Biederman shows that combinations of 2-3 geons should be more than sufficient to provide accurate indices for recognition. A number of experiments are performed with human subjects, demonstrating the ease with which humans can recognize real life object classes that are represented by the 2D projection of a composition of 2-3 geons. Tanaka is well known for his research on uncovering the neuronal mechanisms in the inferotemporal cortex related to the representation of object images <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>.</p><p>Biederman's approach is in some ways similar to Marr's <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> paradigm for object inference from 2-D images. Marr's approach, however, relies on the extraction of 3-D cylinders, rather than geons, from images. In more detail, Marr proposes three main levels of analysis in understanding vision. These include a primal sketch of a scene consisting of low-level feature extraction, followed by a 2.5D sketch where certain features which add a sense of depth might be added to the primal sketch, such as cast-shadows and textures, followed by the above described 3-D cylinder based representation of the objects in the scene.</p><p>Even though Biederman's 36 geons are inherently three-dimensional, he notes that he is not necessarily supporting an object-centered approach to recognition. He argues that since the 3D geons are specifiable from their 2D non-accidental properties, recognition does not need to proceed by constructing a three-dimensional Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>. The geometric hashing approach by <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>.</p><p>interpretation of each volume. Note that the belief that a combination of object-centered and viewpoint-dependent recognition takes place in the human visual system, is currently more widely accepted in the vision community. Biederman also argues that the recognition-by-components framework can explain why modest amounts of noise or random occlusion, such as a car occluded by foliage, do not seem to significantly affect human recognition abilities, as geon-like structures and the extraction of non-accidental properties provide sufficient regularization to the problem. Biederman is careful to indicate that he is not arguing that cues such as color, the statistical properties of textured regions, position of the object in the scene/context do not play a role in recognition. What he is arguing in support of, is that geon-like structures are essential for primal access: the first contact/attempt at recognition that is made upon observing a stimulus and accessing our memory for recognition. Thus, within the context of the general recognition framework of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, Biederman is proposing a potentially powerful indexing primitive. However, it is not yet clear how to reliably and consistently extract these primitives from a regular 2D image, nor is it clear what the optimal algorithm is for learning an object representation that is composed of such parts.</p><p>Pentland <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">110]</ref> presents another parts-based approach to modeling objects using superquadrics (see Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref>). Let cosg = C g and sinx = S x . Then, a superquadric is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Xðg; xÞ ¼ a 1 C 1 g C 2 x a 2 C 1 g S 2 x a 3 S 1 g 0 B B @ 1 C C A<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref>. Examples of various generated superquadrics.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>. Hypothesized processing stages in object recognition according to Biederman <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The process relies on the extraction of five types of non-accidental properties from images, which in turn help in inferring the corresponding 3-D geons.</p><p>where X(g, x) is a 3D vector that defines a surface parameterized by g, x. Furthermore, 1 , 2 are constant parameters controlling the surface shape and a 1 , a 2 , a 3 denote the length, width and breadth. By deforming a number of such superquadrics, and taking their Boolean combinations, a number of solids are defined. The authors propose a methodology for extracting such superquadrics from images, assuming the existence of accurate estimates of the surface tilt for each pixel of the image, where the tilt is defined as s = x n /y n where x n , y n respectively denote the x and y axis components of the surface normal. Through a simple regression methodology they show how the superquadric's center, orientation and deformation parameters can be reliably estimated. The idea is that the relatively compact description of each superquadric can provide a good methodology for indexing into a database of objects and identifying the object from the image. In practice, however, extracting such superquadrics from images has been met with little success. However, superquadrics have been successfully applied to other domains where there is significantly less variability in the image features, such as the medical imaging domain and the segmentation of the cardiac ventricles <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</p><p>Within the context of the general object recognition framework of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the work on superquadrics that was reviewed so far has not dealt with all the modules of the standard recognition pipeline. As indicated previously, while it is difficult to extract a one-to-one map from an image of an object to a superquadric-based representation, one-to-many mappings may exist that provide a sufficiently discriminative and efficiently learnable representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Dickinson and Metaxas <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref> present another superquadric based approach to shape recovery, localization and recognition that addresses to a greater extent the components of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, due to the use of a hierarchical representation of objects. They first use an aspect hierarchy to obtain segmentations of the image into likely aspects (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref>). These aspects in turn are used to guide a superquadric fitting on the 2D images. The superquadric is fit on the extracted aspects by fitting a Lagrange equation of motion</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">M € q þ D _ q þ Kq ¼ f<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>where q is a vector containing the superquadric parameters and parameters for rotation and translation, and f is a vector of image forces which control the deformation of the differential equation. These forces depend on the extracted image aspects. The extracted superquadrics provide a parts-based characterization of the image and also provide a compact indexing mechanism. Sclaro and Pentland <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref> provide a different formulation of a deformable model. Given a closed parameterized curve, which represents the outline of a segmented object, they decompose the object into its so-called ''modes of deformation''. The model's nodes'/ landmarks' displacement vector U is modeled using the Lagrange equation of motion</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">M € U þ D _ U þ KU ¼ R<label>ð6Þ</label></formula><p>where R denotes the various forces acting on the model and causing the deformation-such as edges and lines-and M, D, K denote the element mass, damping and stiffness properties respectively. It is shown how to use this differential equation to obtain a basis matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">U of m eigenvectors U = [/ 1 , . . ., / m ].</formula><p>Linear combinations of these eigenvectors describe the ''modes of deformation'' of the differential equation, thus, allowing us to deform the model displacements U until the best matching model is found. Given a model object whose contour is described by a finite number of landmarks, the authors present a formulation for determining the displacement U that best matches those landmarks. If the matching is sufficiently good, we say that the object has been recognized. Cootes et al. introduced Active Shape Models (ASMs) and Active Appearance Models (AAMs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">115]</ref>, which are also quite popular in the medical imaging domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">13</ref>). While superquadric based approaches use a very specific shape model, AAMs and ASMs try to learn a shape model from general data with regularization. As previously discussed, such 3D parts-based primitives offer a potentially powerful indexing mechanism, but are often difficult to extract reliably from images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7.">Function and context</head><p>Extensive literature exists on the exploitation of prior knowledge about scene context and object function, in order to improve recognition. Function and context are related topics, since by definition, information about the function of a certain object implies that the system is able to extract some information about the scene context as well. For example, knowledge that a particular set of objects can be used as a fork, spoon and plate increases the contextual probability that we are in a kitchen and that edible objects might be close by, which can in turn help improve recognition performance. Conversely, contextual knowledge is strongly related to function since often the scene context (e.g., are we inside a house or are we outside, and what is the scale with which the scene is sensed?) could help us determine whether, for example, a car-like object is a small toy that is suitable for play, or whether it is a big vehicle that is suitable for transportation purposes.</p><p>Thus, within the context of the recognition pipeline in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> we see how function and context could in principle affect all the components of the standard pipeline. For example, contextual knowledge could place a smaller burden on the level of object representational detail required by the object database. Similarly, function and context could affect the feature extraction and group-  ing process when there is scene ambiguity due to sensor noise or occlusions for example. Similarly, context and function can prune the hypothesis space, and thus improve the reliability and efficiency of the object verification and object training phases. We also notice that related work is by necessity closely related to knowledge representation frameworks.</p><p>Various knowledge representation schemes were implemented over the years in order to improve the performance of vision systems, through the integration of task-specific knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[120]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123]</ref>. Contextual knowledge used by such system typically helps in answering certain useful questions such as: Where are we? Are we looking up or down? What kind of objects are typically located here? How will the objects in the scene be used?</p><p>An early and influential knowledge representation framework is attributable to Minsky <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref>. The essence of Minsky's frame theory is encapsulated in the following quotation: ''When one encounters a new situation (or makes a substantial change in one's view of the present problem) one selects from memory a structure called a Frame. This is a remembered framework to be adapted to fit reality by changing details as necessary frames provide us with a structural and concise means of organizing knowledge.'' Essentially frames are data structures for encoding knowledge and represent an early attempt at modeling the way humans store knowledge. As such they have significant applications in vision and influenced early vision research on context and function. Minsky argued that frames could provide a global theory of vision. For example, he argued that frames could be used to encode knowledge about objects, sub-parts, their positions in rooms, and how these relations might change with changing viewpoint (is-a relations, part-of relations, part-whole relations and semantic relations). However, modern recognition research has moved to a learning/probabilistic based model for representing knowledge, which is typically represented in terms of graphical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref>. In Section 3 we will discuss how knowledge representation frameworks were also used in early research on active object localization and recognition.</p><p>Along similar lines, research on exploiting function (a.k.a., affordances) has provided some promising results. Under this framework, the object's function plays a crucial role in recognition. For example, if we wish to perform generic recognition and be capable of recognizing all chairs, we need to identify a chair as any object on which someone can sit. One can of course argue that this is no different from the classical recognition paradigm where we learn an object's typical features, and based on those features try to recognize the object. It is simply a matter of learning all the different types of chairs. Nevertheless, and as discussed in the intro-duction, the huge amount of variation in objects implies that it is unreasonable to assume that an accurate geometric model will always exist.</p><p>In early work on function actions and affordances, there was no focus on how learning is related to the problem. In more recent work the confluence of learning for actions and affordances has gained prominence <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[127,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">128]</ref>. One can think of many object classes (such as the class of all chairs) which contain elements that at least visually are completely unrelated. The only intermediate feature that such classes share is their function. The idea behind learning-based affordance/function research involves associating visual features with the function of the object, and then using the object function to improve recognition.</p><p>According to Gibson's concept of affordances, the sight of an object is associated by a human being to the ways it is usable <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">130]</ref>. It is believed that during early childhood development this association is primed by manipulation, randomly at first, and then in a more and more refined way <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref>. According to this school of thought, a significant reason as to why human object recognition is reliable is because humans immediately associate to the sight of an object its affordances, which results in strong generalization capabilities.</p><p>Recent work on affordances has also focused on its relation to robotics, by building systems that use vision based systems to determine how an object should be grasped and manipulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[131,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">132]</ref>. While some success was achieved for a small number of object classes, consistently reliable affordance-based grasping for a large number of object classes is not yet demonstrated. Notice that object grasping is a many-to-many relationship, since multiple objects are graspable with the same grasp, and one object can be associated with multiple kinds of grasps <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref>.</p><p>An early example of a vision system which used a non-trivial knowledge base, is the VISIONS system by Hanson and Riseman <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126]</ref> which was progressively developed and improved over a number of years (also see Fig. <ref type="figure">14</ref>). This system incorporated a knowledge representation scheme over numerous layers of representation in order to create an advanced vision system <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133]</ref>. At the highest level, their system consists of a semantic network of object recognition routines. This network is hierarchically organized in terms of part-of compositional relations which, thus, decompose objects into object parts.</p><p>Stark and Bowyer <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref> present the GRUFF-2 system for function based recognition and present a function-based category indexing scheme that allows for efficient indexing. Given as input a polyhedral representation of an object, they define a set of knowl-Fig. <ref type="figure">14</ref>. Overview of the VISIONS system, and the three main layers of representation used in the system. Adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126]</ref>.</p><p>edge primitives which define the object. For example, a king sized bed is defined by knowledge primitives which specify the total sleeping area of the bed, the width of the sleeping area, the stability of the object-i.e., does it have a sufficient number of legs?-and so on. A hierarchy is defined for all the objects we wish to recognize. For example, a chair has a number of subcategories (conventional chair, balance chair, lounge chair etc.) and each subcategory might have another subcategory or it might be a leaf in the hierarchy, in which case the set of knowledge primitives from the leaf to the root need to be verified to see if we are dealing with such an object. Acceptable ranges are defined for each of the tested features-such as the acceptable total sleeping area of the object if we are to classify it as a bed-and based on the total score of all the ranges, a confidence measure is defined on the hypothesized identity of the object. An indexing scheme is also proposed, which uses the results of the initial input shape estimation to remove impossible categories. For example, if the total volume of the object is not within a specified bound, we know that a big subset of the objects in our database can be ignored as they do not have the same volume bounds.</p><p>Similarly, a large amount of published research exists on context-based vision. Strat and Fischler <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref> present the Condor recognition system (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">15</ref>). It is a system designed for recognizing complex outdoor natural scenes, by relying to a large extent on contextual knowledge without depending on geometric models of the learned objects. The authors do not make certain assumptions that are inherent to many recognition systems. Namely, that all objects of interest are definable by a small number of parts, and that all objects have well defined locally measurable features. Context sets are defined, which are sets of predicates/image features that, if satisfied, a certain action is taken. An example of a context set is for example {SKY-IS-CLEAR, CAMERA-IS-HORI-ZONTAL, RGB-IS-AVAILABLE}. If the context set is true, a certain operator is executed which helps us determine whether a certain object (soil, trees, etc.) is present in the image. Such context sets are used in 3 different types of rules: Type I: Candidate generation. Type II: Candidate evaluation. Type III: Consistency determination.</p><p>Type I rules are typically entered manually. In the candidate evaluation phase a feature selection is performed and which context sets are most discriminative for each operator and object/class are determined. This makes it possible to order the rules and thus, obtain in a more efficient manner the maximal set (referred to as the maximal clique in the paper) of objects present in the image. The maximal clique must contain objects whose rules contradict each other as little as possible. Since it is intractable to enumerate all the sets in order to determine the best one, this ordering of rules is a heuristic that makes it possible to find a good set within reasonable time.</p><p>Hoiem et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref> use probabilistic estimates of 3D geometry of objects relative to other objects in the scene to make estimates of the likelihood of the various object hypotheses. For example, if a current hypothesis detects a building and a person in the image, but the extracted 3D geometry indicates that the person is taller than the building, the hypothesis is discarded as highly unlikely. Their approach can be incorporated as a ''wrapper'' method around any object detector. Markov random fields (MRFs) are also a popular method for incorporating contextual information via spatial dependencies in the images <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>. In more recent work, Kumar and Hebert <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref> use Discriminative Random Fields (DRFs), an extension of MRFs, for incorporating neighborhood/scene interactions. The main advantage of DRFs is their ability to relax the conditional independence assumption of MRFs. A number of researchers use the statistics of bags of localized features (edges, lines, local orientation, color, etc.) to determine the likely distribution of those features depending on the scene or current context <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">120,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">123,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">122]</ref>. This is often referred to as extracting the gist of the image. Recent work has examined the use of graphical models as means of an event-based generative modeling of the objects in an image <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">137]</ref>. For example, Murphy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136]</ref> use a conditional random field for simultaneously detecting and classifying images. The authors take advantage of the correlations between typical object placements to improve recognition performance (e.g., a keyboard is typically close to a screen). Instead of modeling such correlations directly, they use a hidden common cause, which they call the ''scene''. In subsequent sections we discuss how such contextual clues have also been used to improve the efficiency of next-view-planners in active vision systems.</p><p>In more recent work, the role of contextual knowledge extracted from the outputs of segmentation algorithms and local neighborhood labeling algorithms was investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[138,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">139]</ref>. A recent evaluation of the role of context in recognition algorithms is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140]</ref>.</p><p>There is a general consensus in the vision community that function and context contribute significantly to the vastly superior performance of the human visual system, as compared to the performance of artificial vision systems. As it is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, function and context can play a significant role in attentional priming and during the learning process of new object detectors. Edelman <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> argues that the major challenges inhibiting the design of intelligent vision systems include the need to adapt to diverse tasks, the need to deal with realistic contexts, and the need to prevent vision systems from being driven exclusively by conceptual knowledge (which effectively corresponds to template matching, as previously described). Edelman argues that the use of intermediate representations instead of full geometric reconstruction, is a necessary condition for building a versatile artificial vision system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.8.">Appearance based recognition</head><p>Early research on appearance-based recognition used global low-level image descriptors based on color and texture histograms <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref>. See Niblack et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143]</ref>, Pontil and Verri <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[144]</ref>, Schiele and Crowley <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref> for some related early work. The introduction of appearance based recognition using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) arguably provided the first approach for reliable exemplar based recognition of objects under ideal imaging conditions (e.g., no occlusion, controlled lighting conditions, etc.). The first breakthrough in the area arose with Turk and Pentland's ''eigenfaces'' Fig. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref>. The Condor recognition system of Strat and Fischler <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>.</p><p>paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[146]</ref> which used PCA at the level of image pixels, to recognize faces. A slew of research on appearance based recognition followed. The work by Cootes et al. on Active Appearance Models <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">115]</ref>, constituted an early proof-of-concept on the applicability of such appearance based techniques within the context of other vision-related tasks, such as in the tracking and medical imaging domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref>. One of the first approaches using PCA at the pixel level for recognition was Murase and Nayar's work <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141]</ref>. In contrast to the traditional approach to object recognition, the recognition problem is formulated as a problem of matching appearance and not shape. PCA provides a compact representation of the object appearance parameterized by pose and illumination (see Fig. <ref type="figure">16</ref>). For each object of interest, a large set of images is obtained by automatically varying pose and illumination. The image set is compressed to obtain a low dimensional subspace called an eigenspace in which an object is represented as a manifold. The object is recognized based on the manifold it lies on. Every object is represented as a parametric manifold in two different eigenspaces: The universal eigenspace, which is computed using image sets of all objects, imaged from all views and the object eigenspace which is a different manifold for each object, computed using only images/ views of a single object. Given an image consisting of an object of interest, the authors assume the object can be segmented from the rest of the scene, and is not occluded by other objects.</p><p>After a scale and brightness normalization of all the views of a certain object, they transform the image pixel intensities into a vector. They call all the vectors for each view of an object, the object image set, and the union of all object image sets the universal image set. The idea is that for the object image set O p of each object p, and for the universal image set U, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied and eigenvectors explaining a certain percentage of the image variation are retained-typically 90-95%. Using PCA, an eigenbasis for the universal image set is obtained, and a different eigenbasis for each object image set is also obtained. For each object image set, the algorithm projects the images on the universal image set eigenbasis and on their respective object image set eigenbasis.</p><p>Notice that for each training image the algorithm knows the view from which the image was acquired. The algorithm also simulates variations in the illumination conditions of each image by using a single variable. Thus, for each object image set, the projected point is parameterized in terms of the view from which the image was acquired and in terms of the illumination conditions under which the image was acquired. By interpolation, two continuous functions are obtainable: g (p) (h 1 , h 2 ), the appearance of object p in the universal eigenbasis from view h 1 , illumination h 2 and f (p) (h 1 , h 2 ), the appearance of object p in the object eigenbasis from view h 1 , illumination h 2 . The projection of an image on the univer-sal eigenbasis gives z. The object recognition problem is reduced to the problem of finding the object p in the universal eigenbasis which gives the minimum value for min h 1 ;h 2 kz À g ðpÞ ðh 1 ; h 2 Þk. If we denote the projection of the image on the eigenbasis corresponding to the recognized class p as z (p) , the pose is determined by finding the h 1 , h 2 which minimize kz (p) À f (p) (h 1 , h 2 )k. The above method has a number of advantages that are shared by a big proportion of the appearance based recognition literature. It is simple, it does not require knowledge of the shape and reflectance properties of the object, it is efficient since recognition and pose estimation can be handled in real time, and the method is robust to image noise and quantization. It also shares a number of disadvantages which are also common in the appearance based recognition literature. It is difficult to obtain training data, since (i) there is a need to segment general scenes before the object training can happen, (ii) the method requires that the objects are not occluded, (iii) the algorithm cannot easily distinguish between two objects that differ in one small but important surface detail and (iv) the method would not work well for objects with a high dimensional eigenspace and a high number of parameters, since the non-linear optimization problem in high dimensions is notoriously difficult. Nevertheless, despite these limitations, its training is much easier than that of manually trained systems, such as the ones in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. These training limitations are shared by most modern training algorithms which require labeled and segmented data (see Section 4). Thus the algorithm compares favorably to many of the best performing recognition systems which require detailed manual annotations.</p><p>A number of researchers proposed algorithms for addressing these issues. Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147]</ref> present an approach to recognition using appearance parts. Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[149]</ref> use particle filters in conjunction with inter-frame appearance based modeling to achieve a robust face tracker and recognizer under pose and illumination variations. Leonardis and Bischof <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[148]</ref> use RANSAC to handle occlusion in a more robust way. Given a basis set of eigenvectors which describe a training set of objects, the authors present a robust method of determining the coefficients of the eigenvectors which best match a target image. Using RANSAC, they randomly select subsets of the target image pixels, and find the optimal eigenvector coefficients that fit those pixels. At each iteration, the worst fitting pixels are discarded-as sources of occlusion or noise, for example-and the process is repeated. At the end, the algorithm calculates a robust measure of the eigenvector coefficients that best fit the image. These coefficients are used to recognize the object.</p><p>Thus, within the context of the pipeline in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, we see that appearance based approaches are strongly related to the feature grouping module of recognition algorithms. Their power lies in the projection of the raw extracted features to a lower dimensional feature space which is more easily amenable to powerful classifiers. This demonstrates how powerful feature grouping algorithms led to some of the earliest reliable exemplar-based recognition systems. In Section 3 we show how active vision approaches, in conjunction with dimensionality reduction algorithms, were proven capable of leading to a drastic reduction in the size of the object database (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) needed for acceptable recognition performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.9.">Local feature-based recognition and constellation methods</head><p>Local feature-based recognition methods gained popularity in the second half of the 1990s mainly due to their robustness in clutter and partial occlusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[150,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">151,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[152]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[153]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[154]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref>.

Example of a potential transformation of an image to parametric eigenspace (from <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141]</ref>).

Thus, if the transformed image lies close to the manifold, the image contains an instance of the object that the manifold represents.</p><p>investigating methods for extracting features from images and applying machine learning techniques to identify the likely object from which those features were extracted.</p><p>Local-based features are useful for local or global recognition purposes. Local recognition is useful when we want the ability to recognize the identity and location of part of an object. Local-based features are also useful for global recognition purposes, when we are not interested in the exact location of the object in an image, but we are just interested in whether a particular image contains a particular object at any image location (classification). Such global features are particularly popular with Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems where the user is typically interested in extracting global image properties/statistics (see Section 2.12). As discussed in more detail in Section 4, image categorization/classification algorithms (which indicate whether an image contains an instance of a particular object class), are significantly more reliable than object localization algorithms whose task is to localize (or segment) from an image all instances of the object of interest. Good localization performance has been achieved for restricted object classes: in general there still does not exist an object localization algorithm that can consistently and reliably localize arbitrary object classes. In Chart 5 and Table <ref type="table">3</ref> we present a comparison, along certain dimensions, for a number of the papers surveyed in Sections 2.9 and 2.10.</p><p>An early local feature-based approach to recognition is Rao and Ballard's iconic representation algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[150]</ref>, which extracts local feature vectors encoding the multiscale local orientation of various image locations. These vectors are used for recognition purposes. Lowe presents the SIFT algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, where a number of interest points are detected in the image using difference-of-gaussian like operators. At each one of those interest points, a feature vector is extracted. Over a number of scales and over a neighborhood around the point of interest, the local orientation of the image is estimated using common techniques from the literature. Each local orientation angle is expressed with respect to the dominant local orientation, thus, providing rotation invariance. If a number of such features are extracted from an object's template image, we say that the object is detected in a new test image if a number of similar feature vectors are localized in the new test image at similar relative locations. Quite often such features are used as elements of orientation histograms. A comparison of the similarity between two such histograms helps determine the similarity between two shapes. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[156,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">157]</ref> for some early precursors of such approaches. Currently such approaches are extremely popular in addressing the image classification problem, and we will discuss them in more detail in Section 4. Thus, within the context of the recognition pipeline in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, we see that early work on local fea-tures was most closely related to the feature grouping module. In Section 2.12 we will see why such features are also useful in reducing the object database storage requirements of content based image retrieval systems.</p><p>Mikolajczyk and Schmid present an affine invariant interest point detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[158]</ref> that provides a feature grouping procedure that is more robust under certain image transformation, and can thus improve the reliability of the recognition modules in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> that depend on the feature grouping module. The local features are robust in the presence of affine transformations and changes in scale, thus, providing invariance under viewpoint changes. Interest point candidates are firstly extracted using the multi-scale Harris detector. Then, based on the gradient distribution of the interest point's local neighborhood, an affine transformation is estimated that makes the local image gradient distribution isotropic and that corrects the displacements in the interest point locations across scales due to the Harris detector. Once these isotropic neighborhoods are obtained, any typical feature based recognition approach could be used. The authors estimate a vector of local image derivatives of dimension 12, by estimating derivatives up to 4th order. A simple Mahalanobis comparison formulates hypotheses of matching interest points across two images, and a RANSAC based approach further refines the correspondences and provides a robust estimate of a homography describing the transformation between the two images. Using this homography, if there is a sufficient number of matching interest points, the two images match, potentially recognizing the object in one image if the object present in the other image is known. Similar approaches are described elsewhere for affine invariant matching, wide-baseline stereo and multiview recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[159]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[160]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[161]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[163]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[164]</ref>.

Summary of the 1995-2012 papers from Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. We notice that the local feature-based representation, constellation method, grammar and graph representation papers surveyed in the respective sections are mostly focused on inference and training efficiency, encoding scalability and expanding the diversity of the indexing primitives used. There is no consistent effort amongst this group of papers in simultaneously modeling 3D representations, texture and function/context. Csurka et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[169]</ref> and Sivic and Zisserman <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[170]</ref> introduced the ''bag-of-features'' approach for recognition, an influential and efficient approach for recognition which was widely adopted by the community. The main advantages of the framework is its simplicity, efficiency and invariance under viewpoint changes and background clutter, which typically results in good image categorization. The framework has four main steps: (i) Detection of image patches (ii) Using the descriptors of image patches to assign them to a cluster of mined clusters (iii) counting the number of keypoints/features assigned to each cluster and (iv) treating the bag of features as a feature vector and using a classifier to classify the respective image patch.</p><p>Grauman and Darrell <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[171]</ref> use a ''bag-of-features'' type of an approach to recognition. They extract SIFT features from a set of images and then, define a pyramid-based metric which measures the affinity between the features in any two images. A spectral clustering based approach clusters the images based on this affinity, providing a semi-supervised method for determining classes from a set of images. Each cluster is then further refined, removing any potential outliers from the clusters.</p><p>Another bag-of-features type of an approach is presented in Nistér and Stewénius <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, where the authors present a recognition scheme that scales well to a large number of objects. They present an online test suite using a 40,000 image database from music CD covers. The authors also tested their system using a set of 6376 labeled images that were embedded in a dataset of around 1 million frames captured from various movies. Features are extracted by using the Maximally Stable Extremal Region algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[164]</ref> to locate regions of interest, followed by fitting an ellipse to each such region, and followed by transforming each ellipse into a circular region. Then SIFT features are extracted from these normalized regions and they are quantized using a vocabulary tree algorithm. Effectively, the vocabulary tree uses hierarchical k-means to create a feature tree, where at each layer of the tree, the features are grouped into k subtrees. Each node of the tree is assigned an information theoretic weight w i = ln(N/N i ), where N is the number of images in the database and N i is the number of training images with at least one quantized vector passing through node i in the tree. A query image is matched with the database images by extracting all the feature vectors from the query image, and then finding the path in the tree that best matches each feature vector. Each node i of the tree is weighed by the number of query image vectors that traverse the corresponding node i, and this provides a vector which is matched with each database image vector. The matching provides the vector's ''distance'' to the closest matching database images. It is surprising that the algorithm gives good performance despite the fact that information about the relative position of the various features is discarded. This reinforces the point discussed elsewhere in this survey, that detection algorithms which do not attempt to actually localize the position of an object in an image, tend to perform better than localization algorithms. Thus, within the context of the pipeline in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, we see that this work makes a proposal on how local features could improve the Table <ref type="table">3</ref> Comparing some of the more distinct algorithms of Sections 2.9 and 2.10 along a number of dimensions. For each paper, and where applicable, 1-4 stars (⁄, ⁄⁄, ⁄⁄⁄, ⁄⁄⁄⁄) are used to indicate the strength/expended effort along the corresponding dimension. These often implicitly denote why a particular paper became well known. Where appropriate, a notapplicable label (N/A) is used. Inference scalability: The focus of the paper on improving the robustness of the algorithm as the scene complexity or the object class complexity increases. Search efficiency: The use of intelligent strategies to decrease the time spent localizing an object when the corresponding algorithm is used for localization. If it is a detection algorithm, this refers to its localization efficiency within the context of a sliding-window approach (i.e., the degree of the use of intelligent strategies to improve detection efficiency). Training efficiency: The level of automation in the training process, and the speed with which the training is done. Encoding scalability: The encoding length of the object representations as the number of objects increases or as the object representational fidelity increases. Diversity of indexing primitives: The distinctiveness and number of indexing primitives used. Uses function or context: The degree to which function and context influences the algorithm. Uses 3D: The degree to which depth/range/3D information is used by the algorithm for inference or model representations. Uses texture: The degree to which texture discriminating features are used by the algorithm.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref>. The contour outline of an object is discretized into a number of points, which are in turn mapped onto a log-polar histogram.</p><p>feature grouping, object hypothesis and object verification phases, compared to a baseline feature based approach. Sivic and Zisserman <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[170]</ref> present a method inspired by the text retrieval literature, for detecting objects and scenes from videos. A number of affine invariant features are extracted and an index is created using those features. A Mahalanobis distance metric is used to cluster these features into ''visual words'', or frequent features. Those visual words are used to achieve recognition. For a given image/document, each visual word is assigned a weight of importance which depends on the product of the frequency of the word in the document with another number which downplays words that appear frequently in the database. Given a query vector of the visual words in an image/video sequence, and a set of visual word vectors with their weights, extracted from our database of videos, a matching score is based on the scalar product of query vector with any database vector. The authors also discuss various ways in which the weights could affect the matching score/ranking of images/videos. Kokkinos and Yuille <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[172]</ref> present scale invariant descriptors (SIDs) and use these descriptors as the basis of an object recognition system that detects whether certain images contain cars, faces or background texture. The authors use a logarithmic sampling (centered at each pixel of the image) that is similar to the human visual front-end. As a result the image region around each pixel is parameterized in terms of a logarithmically spaced radius r and a rotation value u. The authors show that as a result of the non-uniform scale of spatial sampling, it is possible to obtain feature vectors that are scale and rotation invariant. These feature vectors depend on the amplitude, orientation and phase at each corresponding image position. They are obtained by transforming the corresponding amplitude, orientation and phase maps of each image into the Fourier domain, resulting in orientation and scale invariance. These feature vectors are in turn used as the basis of an object detector: The authors describe a methodology for extracting candidate sketch tokens from training images and describing their shape and appearance distributions in terms of SIDs, which in turn enables object detection to take place.</p><p>Lampert shows how a branch and bound algorithm can be used in conjunction with a bag-of-visual-words model in order to achieve efficient image search, by circumventing the sliding window approach that has dominated much of the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[190,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">191,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">173,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b191">192]</ref>. The algorithm is able to localize the target of interest in linear or sublinear time. The authors also show how classifiers, such as SVMs, which were considered too slow for similar localization tasks, can be used within this framework for efficient object localization. This resulted in significant efficiency improvements in the hypothesis generation phase of the algorithm (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), which contributed to its popularity.</p><p>Local feature-based approaches have been successfully applied to a number of tasks in computer vision. However, it is generally acknowledged that significantly more complex types of object representations are necessary to bridge the semantic gap between low level and high level representations, which we discussed in Sections 1, 2.1. It is important to keep in mind that some recent work questions whether popular object representations and recognition algorithms do indeed offer superior performance, as compared to other much simpler algorithms, or whether this difference in performance is usually just an artifact of biased datasets (see Pinto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">[193]</ref>, Torralba and Efros <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">[194]</ref>, and Andreopoulos and Tsotsos <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>). As discussed in the above papers, the empirical evidence is clearly pointing to the fact that a common thread of most recognition algorithms is their fragility and their inability to generalize in novel environments. This is an indication that there is significant room for breakthrough innovations in the field. While local features are the only thing that can be observed reliably, there is a significant on-going discussion on the situations when these local features need to be tied together to obtain more complex representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. This topic of local features vs. scene representation tends to re-emerge within the context of the semantic gap problem. For example, when dealing with commercial vision systems that are expected to mine massive datasets using a large number of object classes (see Section 2.12 on content based image retrieval systems) there is an inverse relationship between an increase in the system's efficiency and its reliability: as the complexity of the extracted features and the constructed scene representations increases, the computational resources and the amount of training data required can easily become intractable <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>Constellation methods are ''parts-and-structure'' models for recognition that lie at the intersection of appearance/localfeature-based methods and parts-based methods. They represent an attempt to compensate for the simplicity of local-featurebased representations, by using them to form dictionaries of more complex and compact object representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">[195,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b195">196,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">179,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">177,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">176,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">197,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">178,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">180,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">198,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b198">199,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">174,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b199">[200]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[201]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[202]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b202">[203]</ref>. As such they represent an evolution in the local-feature-based grouping phase of the pipeline in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Within this context, the work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref> which was previously discussed, could also be classified as falling within this category since it relies on a parts-based representation of objects. In early work on recognition, when referring to parts-based approaches, authors were often referring to 3-D object parts (superquadrics, cylinders, deformable models, etc.), while more recent local-feature-based approaches are mostly used to from 2-D parts-based representations of objects. In general, sophisticated learning techniques have been applied to a much greater extent on local-feature-based object representations and constellation methods. This differentiates much of the literature on 3-D and 2-D parts representations of objects.</p><p>An advantage of many constellation methods is that they are learnt from unsegmented training images and the only supervised information provided is that the image contains an instance of the object class <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[174]</ref>. It is not always necessary for precise object localization information to be provided a priori of course. However, the less extraneous/background scene information present in the training images, the better the resulting classifier. Typically, this is achieved through latent variable estimation using the EM algorithm. A disadvantage of such approaches is that their training can sometimes be quite expensive. For example, many formulations of constellation methods, typically, require fully connected graphs, where the graph nodes might represent local features or parts. As a means of simplifying such problems, authors often use various heuristics to decrease the connectivity of the related graphs or to simplify other aspects of the problem. The published literature does not tend to distinguish its recognition algorithms as exemplar or generic. The spectrum of object categories, encountered in the literature, is as general as that of cars and as specific as that of cars with a particular pattern of stripes on it. Typically, as it is common in the literature, only successful approaches are published making it difficult to understand why a particular approach that works well in one situation might not work so well in another. We discuss this topic in more detail in Section 4.</p><p>Fergus, Perona and Zisserman are arguably some of the strongest advocates of the approach and have published a series of papers on constellation methods, some of which we overview here <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">195,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">174,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b199">200,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b202">203]</ref>. Their work is an early example of viewbased approaches combined with a graphical model based learning and representation framework. Within the context of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, their papers represent a characteristic example of an effort to use low level indexing primitives to learn progressively more complex primitives (so called words). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref> the shape, appearance, relative scale of the parts, and potential occlusion of parts is modeled. For each image pixel and over a range of image scales the local saliency is detected and the regions whose saliency is above a certain threshold are the regions from which the features used for recognition are extracted. The saliency metric is a product of the image intensity histogram's entropy over an image radius determined by the scale, weighed by the sum over all image intensities of the rate of change of the corresponding intensity channel as the scale varies. The training is completely unsupervised, which is the main strength of the paper. However, the method's training is extremely slow as a 6-7 part model with 20-30 features, using 400 training images, takes 24-36 h to complete on a Pentium 4 PC. A number of short-cuts have been proposed that improve the training times. The number of parts P is specified a priori. To each part, the algorithm assigns a feature out of the N features in the image. The features not assigned to a part are classified as belonging to the background, and therefore, are irrelevant. The object's shape is represented as a Gaussian distribution of the features' relative locations and the scale of each part with respect to a reference frame is also modeled by a Gaussian distribution. Each part's appearance is modeled as a 121-dimensional vector whose dimension is further decreased by applying PCA on the set of all such 121-dimensional vectors in our training set. A Gaussian distribution is then used to model each part's appearance. As it is common with such constellation methods, an EM algorithm is applied to determine the unknown parameters (shape mean, shape covariance matrix, each part's scale parameters, part occlusion modeling, appearance mean and covariance matrix). As the E-step of the EM algorithm would need to search through an exponential number of parameters (O(N P )), the A ⁄ search algorithm is applied to improve the training complexity. Once the training is complete, the decision as to whether a particular object class O is present in the image is done by maximizing the ratio of probabilities pðOjparametersÞ pð:OjparametersÞ where parameters denotes all the parameters estimated during training with the EM algorithm. Fei-Fei Li et al. have picked up on this work and published numerous related papers. In Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[197]</ref> for example, the authors use an online version of the EM-algorithm so that the model learning is not done as a batch process.</p><p>Fergus et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">[195]</ref> extend their approach by also encoding each part by its curve segments. A Canny edge operator determines all the curves, and each curve is split into independent segments at its bi-tangent points. On each such curve a similarity transformation is applied so that the curve starts at the origin and ends at (1, 0). The curve endpoint positioned at the origin is determined by whether or not its centroid falls beneath the x-axis. By evenly sampling each curve at 15 points along its x-axis, a 15-dimensional feature vector of the curve is obtained and is modeled by a 15 dimensional Gaussian. The model is again learnt via the EM algorithm. The training data set used contains valid data of the object we wish to learn but it might also contain background irrelevant images. RANSAC is used to fit a number of models and determine the best trained model. By applying each learned model on two datasets-one containing exclusively background/irrelevant data and the other containing many correct object instances-the best model is chosen based on the idea that the best model's scoring function pðOjparametersÞ pð:OjparametersÞ should be the lowest on the background data and the highest on the data with valid object instances. The algorithm is used to learn object categories from images indexed by Google's search engine.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">[200]</ref> the authors use the concept of probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) from the field of textual analysis to achieve recognition. If we have D documents/images and each document/image has a maximum of W words/feature types in it, we can denote by n(w, d) the number of words of type w in document d. If z denotes the topic/object, the pLSA model maximizes the log likelihood of the model over the data: In <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[174]</ref> the authors address the previously mentioned problem of a fully connected graphical model representing all the possible parts-features combinations. By using a Star model to model the probability distributions, the complexity is reduced to O(N 2 P). In the Star model (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">18</ref>) all the other object parts are described with respect to a landmark part. If the position of the non-landmark parts is expressed with respect to the position of the landmark parts, translation invariance is also obtained. The authors also obtain scale invariance by dividing the non-landmark's location by the scale of the landmark's position. The rest of the approach is similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">L ¼ Y D d¼1 Y W</formula><p>Sivic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[175]</ref> present a method based on pLSA for detecting object categories from sets of unlabeled images. The same objective function as in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is used, where now the EM algorithm is used to maximize the objective function and discover the topics/object classes corresponding to a number of features. The features used by the authors are SIFT-like feature vectors. Two types of affine covariant regions are computed in each image, using various methods described in the literature. One method is based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[158]</ref> which we described above. For each such elliptical region a SIFT like descriptor is calculated. K-means clustering is applied to these SIFT descriptors to determine the ''words'' comprising our data set. The authors demonstrate that even though this is a ''bag of words'' type of an algorithm, it is feasible to use the algorithm for localizing/segmenting an object in an image. The authors demonstrate that doublets of features can be used to accomplish this.</p><p>Ullman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">[176]</ref> present an approach that uses a constellation of face-part templates (eyes, mouth, nose, etc.) for detecting faces. The templates are selected using an information maximization based approach from a training set, and detection is achieved by selecting the highest scoring image fragments under the assumption that the object is indeed present in the image.</p><p>Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[177]</ref> present a recognition algorithm based on constellations of iconic feature representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[150]</ref> that can also recognize articulated objects. The work is motivated by the pictorial structure models first introduced by Fischler and Elschlager <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>. The authors use a probabilistic formulation of deformable parts which are connected by spring-like connections. The authors indicate that this provides a good generative model of objects which is of help with generic recognition problems. The authors test the system with person-tracking systems.</p><p>Leibe, Schiele and Leonardis <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[178,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">198,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b198">199]</ref> model objects using a constellation of appearance parts to achieve simultaneous recognition and segmentation. Image patches of 25 Â 25 pixels are ex- tracted around each interest point detected using the Harris interest point detector. Those patches are compared to codebook entries of patches which were discovered by agglomerative clustering on a codebook of appearance patches of an object of interest. The similarity criterion is based on the normalized grey-scale correlation. From each such cluster its center is selected as the representative patch for the center. Once an image patch is matched to a codebook entry, that codebook entry casts votes for the likely objects it might have come from and places a vote in the image of the object center with respect to the object patch. This voting mechanism is used to select the most likely object identity. The likely object is backprojected onto the image and this provides a verification and segmentation of the object. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">[198]</ref> this work is extended to achieve a greater amount of scale invariance. Opelt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">[196]</ref> use a similar approach only that instead of using patches of appearance, they use pairs of boundary fragments extracted using the Canny operator in conjunction with an Adaboost based classification. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[179]</ref> present what amounts to a feature selection algorithm for selecting the most meaningful features in the presence of a large number of distracting and/or irrelevant features. Ferrari et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[180]</ref> present a method for recognition which initially detects a single discriminative feature in the image and by exploring the image region around that feature, slowly grows the set of matching image features.</p><p>From this survey on local features and constellation methods, we see that most research efforts in the field have been applied to the feature grouping phase of the pipeline in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. In Section 3 we will discuss a number of active recognition approaches, which in conjunction with local feature based approaches and constellation methods, form an alternative framework for viewpoint selection, object hypothesis formation and object verification (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.10.">Grammars and related graph representations</head><p>An often encountered argument in linguistics, refers to the need to use a sparse set of word representations in any given language, as a means of ensuring redundancy and efficient communication, despite the existence of potentially ambiguous basic speech signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">[204,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b204">205]</ref>. As it was first argued by Laplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[206]</ref>, out of the large set of words that could be formulated by taking random and finite-length arrangements of the letters in any popular alphabet (such as the Latin or Greek alphabets) it is this sparsity of chosen words and the familiarity associated with some subset of the word, that makes a valid word stand-out as a non-random arrangement of letters.</p><p>This has motivated the vision community to conduct research into the use of grammars as a means of compactly encoding the fact that certain parts of an image tend to occur more often in unison than in random. This in turn precipitates the construction of compact representations, with all the associated benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Thus, grammars provide a formalism for encoding certain recurring ideas in the vision literature, such as using 2-D and volumetricparts for constructing compact object representations, as we have earlier discussed. As we will demonstrate in this section, the parse trees associated with a particular grammar, provide a simple graph-based formalism for matching object representations to parsed-image representations, and for localizing objects of interest in an image. It is important to point out that in practice, the published literature does not tend to distinguish the recognition algorithms as being exemplar or generic. An early identification of the task and scope that a particular algorithm is meant to solve, can affect the graph based recognition architecture used. Thus, within the context of the pipeline in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, grammars are meant to offer a compact, redundant and robust approach to feature grouping.</p><p>More formally, a grammar consists of a 4-tuple G ¼ ðV N ; V T ; R; SÞ where V N , V T are finite sets of non-terminal and terminal nodes respectively, S is a start symbol, and R is a set of functions referred to as production rules, where each such function is of the form c: a ? b for some a, b 2 (V N [ V T ) + . A language associated with a grammar G denotes the set of all possible strings that could be generated by the applications of compositions of production rules from this grammar. A stochastic grammar associates a probability distribution with the grammar's language. Given a string from a language, the string's parse tree denotes a sequence of production rules associated with the corresponding grammar, which generate the corresponding string. Image grammars use similar production rules, in order to define in a compact way generative models of objects, thus, facilitating the generalizability of object recognition systems which use such production rules for the object representations. An interesting observation from Table <ref type="table">3</ref> is that very little work has been done on grammars and graph representations that simultaneously incorporate function, context, 3D (both in sensing and object representations), texture and efficient training strategies. This is good indication that within the context of graph models and hierarchical representations, the previously discussed semantic-gap problem for bridging low level and high level representations is still open. As it will be discussed in Section 3, within the active vision paradigm a number of similar problems emerge.</p><p>Zhu and Mumford <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">[205]</ref> classify the related literature on image grammars into four streams. The earliest stream is attributed to Fu <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">[207]</ref> who applied stochastic web grammars and plex grammars to simple object recognition tasks. These web and plex grammars are generalizations of the linguistic grammars earlier discussed, and are meant to provide a generalization of the standard grammars to 2-D images.</p><p>The second stream is related to Blum's work on medial axes. Inspired by Blum's argument <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b207">208]</ref> that medial axes of shape outlines are a good and compact representation of shape, Leyton <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">[209]</ref> developed a grammar for growing more complex shapes from simple objects. More recent work has expanded the scope of graph based algorithms using shock graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[181,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b209">[210]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b210">[211]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b211">[212]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b212">[213]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[214]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b214">[215]</ref>. Inspired by Blum's concept of the medial axis and given the significance that symmetry plays in parts-based-recognition systems-symmetry in generalized cylinders/geons for example-algorithms have appeared for encoding the medial axis of an object in a graph structure and matching the graph structures of two objects in order to achieve recognition. Shock graphs encode the singularities that emerge during the evolution of the ''grassfire'' that defines the skeleton/medial-axis of the object. These are the ''protrusion'', ''neck'', ''bend'' and ''seed'' singularities. Thus, these shocks can be used to segment the medial axis into a tree-like structure.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">19</ref> provides examples of the four kinds of shocks that are typically encountered in an object's medial axis. By encoding those shocks into a tree-like structure (see Fig. <ref type="figure">20</ref>) the recognition problem is reduced to that of graph/tree matching. As this corresponds to the largest subgraph isomorphism problem, a large portion of the research has focused on efficient techniques for matching two tree structures and making them robust in the presence of noise. An interesting matching algorithm is proposed by Siddiqi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[181]</ref>. The authors represent a shock tree using a 1-0 adjacency matrix. The authors show, that finding the two shock subtrees whose adjacency representation has the same eigenvalue sum, provides a good heuristic to finding the largest isomorphic subtrees and thus, achieves recognition via matching with a template object's shock tree (see Fig. <ref type="figure">20</ref>). In general, shock graphs provide a powerful indexing mechanism if segmentations/outlines of the desired objects are provided. Using such approaches on arbitrary images however, requires a segmentation phase, which in turn remains an unsolved problem and is also probably the most fundamental problem in computer vision.</p><p>The third stream proposed by Zhu and Mumford <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">[205]</ref> refers to more recent work which was inspired from Grenander's work on General Pattern Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>. According to this paradigm, patterns in nature (including images) are formed by primitives called generators. The outputs of these generators are joined together using various graph-like criteria. Random diffeomorphisms applied to these patterns add another degree of generalization to the generated patterns. And-Or graphs lie within this stream (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">21</ref>). An And-Or graph uses conjunctions and disjunctions of simple patterns/generators to define a representation of all the possible deformations of the object of interest.</p><p>The fourth stream is similar to the previous stream, with the main difference being that an extremely sparse image coding model is used (employing simple image bases derived from Gabor filters parameterized by scale, orientation and contrast sensitivity for example) and that the related grammars can be viewed as being stochastic context free grammars.</p><p>A number of feedforward hierarchical recognition algorithms have been proposed over the years <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">[216,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b216">217,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">104,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b217">218,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">105,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b182">183,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b183">184,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b218">[219]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b219">[220]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b220">[221]</ref>. Such hierarchical architectures can be associated with the grammars discussed so far. One of the main characteristics of such hierarchical representations is that they often strive for biological plausibility. Typically, such algorithms define a multiscale feedforward hierarchy, where at the lowest level of the feedforward hierarchy, edge and line extraction takes place. During a training phase, combinations of such features are discovered, forming a hierarchical template that is typically matched to an image during online object search.</p><p>For example, LeCun's work on convolutional networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">[217,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b221">222,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b181">182]</ref>, and a number of its variants, have been successfully used in character recognition systems. Convolutional networks combine the use of local receptive fields, the use of shared weights, and spatial subsampling. The use of shared weights and subsampling adds a degree of shift invariance to the network, which is important since it is difficult to guarantee that the object of interest will always be centered in the input patch that is processed by the recognition algorithm. Because convolutional networks are purely feedforward they are also easily parallelizable, which has contributed to their popularity.</p><p>Another goal of hierarchical architectures is to provide an efficient grammar for defining a set of re-usable object parts. These parts are typically meant to enable us to efficiently compose multiple views of multiple objects. As a result, the problem of efficient feature grouping (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) that removes any ambiguities due to environmental noise or poor imaging conditions, keeps re-emerging in the literature on hierarchical recognition systems. The resultant ambiguities are one of the main reasons why hierarchical representations do not scale very well when dealing with thousands of object classes. For example, Ommer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">[183]</ref> and Ommer and Buhmann <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">[184]</ref> propose a characteristic methodology that attempts to deal with the complexity of real world image categorization, by first performing a perceptual bottom-up grouping of edges followed by a top-down recursive grouping of features. It is important to point out that unrestricted object representation lengths and unrestricted representation class sizes can lead to significant problems when learning a new object's representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Often with graph-like models, and especially in early research, their representation strength (number of nodes and edges) is hand-picked for the training dataset of interest, which can potentially lead to a significant bias when tested with new datasets.</p><p>Deng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">[185,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b185">186]</ref>, present an algorithm for learning hierarchical relations of semantic attributes from labeled images. These relations are similar to predicates, and are arranged in the form of a hierarchical tree structure. The closeness of nodes in this hierarchical structure can be used to match similar images, which is in turn used for image classification purposes. The authors also introduce a hashing algorithm for sublinear image retrieval. Similarly, Bart et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">[187,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b187">188]</ref> describe a graphical model for learning object taxonomies. Each node in this hierarchy represents information that is common to all the hierarchy's paths that pass from that node, providing a compact representation of information. The authors present a Gibbs sampling based approach for learning the model parameters from training data and discuss potential applications of such taxonomies in recognition. More recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[189]</ref> demonstrates the continuous evolution of research on graph-based object representations using massively large training data sets and clusters of thousands of CPUs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.11.">Some more object localization algorithms</head><p>We now focus on object localization algorithms which are robust, and which localize objects in an image efficiently. This provides an overview of the approaches attempted over the years for efficiently localizing objects in a static image. In subsequent sections we deal with the more complex case of active object localization and recognition, where we also have to physically move the sensor over large distances. As we will see, and as it is evident from other localization algorithms that were previously discussed within other contexts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">[191]</ref>), object localization efficiency is closely related to improvements in the hypothesis generation and object verification module of recognition systems (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The breadth of algorithms tested for improving search efficiency is vast. They range from simple serial search mechanisms with winnertake-all, and reach all the way to complex systems, integrating parallel search with probabilistic decision making that make use of function, context, and hierarchical object representations. Within this context, active vision plays an important role. As such, this section also serves as a precursor to the active search and recognition systems discussed in Section 3.</p><p>As previously discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, time, noise, as well as other cost constraints, can make the problem significantly more difficult.</p><p>Furthermore, as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, searching for an object in an object class without knowledge of the exact target we are looking for-as the target appearance could vary drastically due to occlusions for example-makes the problem intractable as the complexity of the object class increases. This issue becomes more evident in the case of the SLAM problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, where we want to simultaneously localize but also learn arbitrary new objects/features that might be encountered in the scene. This leads to the slightly counter-intuitive conclusion that the feature detection algorithm/sensor used must be characterized by neither too high nor too low of a noise rate, since too low of a desirable object detector noise rate makes the online learning of new objects prohibitively expensive. In the active object localization problem, where we typically have to move robotic platforms to do the search in 3D space under occlusions, and we know apriori the object we are searching for, any reduction in the total number of such mechanical movements would have a drastic effect on the search time and the commercial viability of our solution. Thus, a central tenet of our discussion in this section involves efficient algorithms for locating objects in an environment. In Chart 6 and Table <ref type="table">4</ref> we present a comparison, along certain dimensions, for a number of the papers surveyed in Sections 2.11 and 2.12.</p><p>Avraham and Lindenbaum present a number of interesting papers that use a stochastic bottom-up attention model for visual search based on inner scene similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">[223]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b223">[224]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b224">[225]</ref>. Inner scene similarity is based on the hypothesis that search task efficiency depends on the similarities between scene objects and the similarities between target models and objects located in the scene. Assume, for example, that we are searching for people in a scene containing people and trees. An initial segmentation provides image regions containing either people or trees. An initial detector on a tree segment returns a ''no'' as an answer. We can, thus, place a lower priority on all the image segments having similar features as the rejected ''no'' segment, thus, speeding up search. These ideas were first put forward by Duncan and Humphreys <ref type="bibr" target="#b225">[226]</ref> who rejected the parallel vs. serial search idea put forward by Treisman and Gelade and suggested that a hierarchical bottom-up segmentation of the scene takes place first with similar segments linked together. Suppression of one segment propagates to all its linked segments, potentially offering another explanation for the pop-out effect. Avraham and Lindenbaum demonstrate that their algorithm leads to an improvement compared to random search and they also provide measures/grades indicating how easy it is to find an object. They define a metric based on the feature space distances between the various features/regions that are discovered in an image. Assuming that each such feature might correspond to a target, they present some lower and upper bounds on the number of regions that need to be queried before a target is discovered. Three search algorithms are presented and some bounds on their performance are derived:</p><p>1. FNN -Farthest Nearest Neighbor. Given the set of candidates' feature vectors or segments {x 1 , . . ., x n }, compute the distance of each such feature vector/segment to each nearest neighbor, and order the features based on descending distance. Query the object detector module until finding the object of interest. The idea is that the target object is usually different from most of the rest of the image, so it should be close to the top 2 of the list. 2. FLNN -Farthest Labeled Nearest Neighbor. Given the set of candidates' feature vectors/segments {x 1 , . . ., x n }, randomly choose one of these feature vectors/segments and label it using the object detector. Repeat until an object is detected. For each unlabeled feature vector/segment, calculate its distance to the nearest labeled neighbor. Choose the feature vector/segment with maximum distance to query with the object detector and get its label. Repeat. 3. VSLE -Visual Search Using Linear Estimation. Define the covariance between two binary labels l(x i ), l(x j ) as cov(l(x i ), l(x j )) = c(d(x i , x j )) for some function c and distance function d. Since the labels which denote the presence or absence of the target are binary, their expected values denote the probability that they take a value of 1. Given that we have estimated the labels l(x 1 ), . . ., l(x m ) for m feature vectors/segments, we seek to obtain a linear estimate lk ¼ a 0 þ P m i¼1 a i lðx i Þ which minimizes the Chart 6. Summary of the 1994-2006 papers from Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. We notice that search efficiency was not consistently a primary concern in the localization literature since many algorithms tended to use an inefficient sliding window approach to localize objects. Furthermore content-based image retrieval systems mostly focused on the classification of individual images and not on the localization problem within individual images. Nevertheless from Table <ref type="table">4</ref> we see that search efficiency was identified as an important topic in a number of papers. CBIR systems were focused on using a diverse set of efficient indexing primitives. However it is far from clear that they achieved the inference scaling properties desired, since in order to make such systems responsive and user friendly, often accuracy was sacrificed in favor of query efficiency. We also notice very little use of 3D in these systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 4</head><p>Comparing some of the more distinct algorithms of Sections 2.11 and 2.12 along a number of dimensions. For each paper, and where applicable,  The authors perform a number of tests and demonstrate that especially the VSLE algorithm leads to an improvement in the number of detected objects and the speed at which they are detected compared to a random search using the Viola-Jones detection algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b226">[227]</ref>.</p><p>Draper et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[228]</ref> present a Markov Decision Process (MDP) based approach for performing an online sort of feature selection, where an MDP is used to determine which set of recognition modules should be applied for detecting a set of houses from aerial images. Paletta et al. have published a number of papers proposing the use of reinforcement learning techniques-based on Q-learning-for deciding the image sub-regions where the recognition module should attend to and extract features from and achieve recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b228">[229]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">[230]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">[231]</ref> present an attention based mechanism using a sequence of hierarchical classifiers for attending to image regions and recognizing objects from images. Bandera et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">[232]</ref> present work that is similar to Paletta's work in that they also propose a Q-learning based approach for determining the fixation regions that would lead to the greatest decrease in entropy and object class discrimination. The features used in the experiments are simple corner based features and are encoded in a vector denoting the presence or absence of each feature in a scene. Recognition is achieved using a neural network trained on such example vectors. Note that in none of these papers do the authors use active cameras. Darrell <ref type="bibr" target="#b232">[233]</ref> presents a formulation based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) with reinforcement learning to decide where to look to discriminate a target from distractor patterns. The authors apply their approach to the problem of gesture recognition.</p><p>Tagare et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">[234]</ref> present a maximum likelihood attention algorithm. The algorithm identifies object parts and features within each object part. They propose pairs of object parts and part features which most likely come from the object. In many ways the algorithm is an interpretation tree algorithm formulated using attention-like terminology. Probability densities are defined for the chance of occlusion-using a Poisson distribution-and a maximum likelihood estimation is performed to determine the most probable part-feature pair, the second most probable part-feature pair, etc. Features used in their experiments include corners and edges. The algorithm ends up evaluating only about 2% of all part-feature pairs on the test images used by the authors.</p><p>Torralba et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">[237]</ref> present a method for multiclass object detection that learns which features are common in various disparate object classes. This allows the multiclass object detector to share features across classes. Thus, the total number of features needed to detect objects, scales logarithmically with the number of classes. Many object localization algorithms train a binary classifier for each object the algorithm is attempting to localize, and slide a window across the image in order to detect the object, if it exists. As the authors argue, the use of shared features improves recognition performance and decreases the number of false positives. The idea is that for each object class c, a strong classifier H c is defined which is a summation of a number of weak classifiers. Each of the weak classifiers is trained to optimally detect a subset of the C object classes. Since in practice there are 2 C such classes the authors suggest some heuristics for improving the complexity. Linear combinations of these weak classifiers under a boosting framework are acquired which provide the strong classifiers H c . The authors' working hypothesis is that by fitting each weak classifier on numerous classes simultaneously, they are effectively training the classifiers to share features, thus, improving recognition performance and requiring a smaller number of features. The authors present some results demonstrating that joint boosting offers some improvements compared to independent boosting under a ROC curve of false positives vs. detection rate. They also present some results on multiview recognition, where they simply use various views of each object class to train the classifiers. Similarly to the Viola and Jones algorithm, the authors demonstrate a characteristic of the algorithm which makes it suitable for localizing objects in scenes-using the shifted template/window approach-, namely, its small number of false positives.</p><p>Opelt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">[238]</ref> present a boundary fragment model approach for object localization in images. Edges are detected using a Canny edge detector, from pre-segmented image regions containing the object of interest and containing a manually annotated centroid of each object. A brute force approach searches through the boundary fragments and sub-fragments, and a matching score of the fragment with a validation set is calculated. The matching score is based on the Chamfer distance of the fragments from the fragments located in each image of the validation set. The matching score also depends on how close the centroids of each object are to each other; each fragment is associated to its centroid. The authors define a set of weak detectors which typically learn pairs or triples of boundary fragments that lead to optimal classification. Those weak detectors are joined into a strong detector which recognizes the desired object from an image. Overall, the use of boundary fragments makes this algorithm quite robust under illumination changes, and should be quite robust for solving simple exemplar-like detection tasks. Its high complexity is a significant drawback of the algorithm though. Simple approaches to multiview object localization are proposed. Their work is further expanded upon in <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">[196]</ref>.</p><p>Amit and Geman <ref type="bibr" target="#b239">[240]</ref> present a computational model for localizing object instances. Local edge fragments are grouped based on known geometrical relationships of the desired object that were learnt during the training phase. The authors note that even though their search model is not meant to be biologically plausible, it exhibits some of the characteristics of neurons in the Inferior Temporal Cortex such as scale and translation invariance.</p><p>A local feature based method for object localization is also presented by Piater <ref type="bibr" target="#b240">[241]</ref>. Steerable filters are used to extract features at various scales. These features are used to extract blobs, corners and edges from images. These provide salient image features. As Amit and Geman <ref type="bibr" target="#b239">[240]</ref> did, Piater clusters these features into compound features based on their geometric relations. Piater's thesis is interesting in that it proposes an online algorithm for learning new discriminative features and retraining the classifier. Their algorithm is composed mainly of a Bayesian network/classifier that uses features to achieve recognition, and a feature learning system that uses the Bayesian classifier to train on training images and decide when a new discriminative feature needs to be added to the Bayesian network.</p><p>Viola and Jones <ref type="bibr" target="#b226">[227,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b234">235,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b235">236]</ref> present a robust approach for object localization (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">22</ref>). Their approach is ideally suited for localizing objects due to the low number of false negatives it produces. Search is done by the simple method of shifting a template across space and scale, making it somewhat inefficient in its search. A number of Haar like features are extracted from the image. In the original formulation by Viola and Jones, Haar-like templates provide features similar to first and second order derivatives acquired from a number of orientations. By extracting from each image location p a number of such features at different scales and neighborhoods close to p, it is easy to end up with thousands of features for each image pixel p. The authors propose using a cascade of classifiers, where each classifier is trained using Adaboost to minimize the number of false negatives by putting a lower weight of importance to features which tend to produce such false negatives. However, the method is only suited for detecting simple objects characterized by a small number of salient features, such as faces and door handles <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">[239]</ref>. See Fig. <ref type="figure">23</ref> for an example of door handle localization using the Viola and Jones algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b226">[227]</ref>. The algorithm would have problems detecting highly textured objects. Furthermore, the method's training phase is extremely slow and care must be taken during the training phase as it is easy to end up with a classifier producing many false positives.</p><p>Fleuret and Geman <ref type="bibr" target="#b241">[242]</ref> present a coarse-to-fine approach to object localization. The authors measure their algorithm's performance in terms of the number of false positives and the amount of on-line computation needed to achieve a small false negative rate. The approach is tested on the face detection problem. The object class is represented by a large disjunction of conjunctions. Each conjunction represents salient object features under strict known conditions in lighting, scale, location and orientation and the disjunctions account for a large number of variations of these conditions. The authors also present an interesting approach for measuring the efficiency of object localization tasks based on the number of branches followed in a decision tree, where each branch might correspond to a search in a different image location, or different scale. They use such ideas to argue in support of a coarse to fine approach for object localization. In other words, when searching for a certain object, we should first search across all scales and at the first failure to detect a necessary feature in one of the scales, search in a different image location. The authors present a rigorous proof of the optimality of such a search under a simpler model where the non-existence of the target is declared upon the first negative feature discovered. They also indicate that a coarse to fine approach was proven optimal under a number of simulations they performed, even though the proof for the general case still eludes them.</p><p>A number of Monte-Carlo approaches for object localization have also been attempted in an effort to escape the inefficiency of exhaustive search across scale-space for an object. Two such approaches based on particle filters were proposed by Sullivan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">[243]</ref> and Isard <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[202]</ref> who presented particle filter based approaches for performing inference.</p><p>An overall observation is that many papers described as localization algorithms, simply follow the sliding window approach due to their low false-positive or low false-negative rate. Few of the original algorithms attempted to focus on salient regions based on prior knowledge of the object they were searching for. Cognizant of these problems, more recent work has focused on using saliency algorithms in conjunction with task-directed biases to speed up the search process <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">[252]</ref>. As bottom-up algorithms do not use any task-directed biases, the benefits they offer during visual search only become evident when dealing with low-complexity scenes where the objects of interest pop-out easily with respect to the background. While there has been some effort in incorporating top-down biases in such systems, it is not clear whether they are capable of offering benefits for foreground and background regions of arbitrary complexity. As Avraham and Lindenbaum showed, proper attentional mechanisms can lead to better performance, so more focus on the problem is worthwhile. Notice that usually no cost/time constraints are included in the formulation of such papers. In subsequent sections we discuss a number of papers demonstrating the effect that such mechanisms can have on search efficiency. Thus, within the context of the recognition framework of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, we notice a gradual shift of the effort expended on the hypothesis generation and object verification phase. The shift is towards a preference for the integration of ever more powerful and complex inference algorithms that improve search efficiency, moving us beyond the impediments of the sliding window approach to recognition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.12.">Content-based image retrieval</head><p>Every day around 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is created. It is estimated that 90% of the data in the world was created over the last two years <ref type="bibr" target="#b252">[253]</ref>. A significant portion of this data consists of digital pictures and videos. Online video and multimedia content has experienced annual double digit growth for the last few years [254], precipitating the need for steady improvements in the automated mining of video and pictorial data for useful information. Numerous content based image retrieval (CBIR) systems have been proposed for addressing this problem. Proposed CBIR solutions typically lie at the intersection of computer vision, databases, information retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[168]</ref>, HCI and visualization/computergraphics. Arguably, the first workshop on the topic took place in Florence in 1979 <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[168,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b253">255]</ref>. This was followed in 1992 by a workshop organized by the US National Science Foundation <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[168,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b254">256]</ref> where the need for interactive image understanding was emphasized. The need to include a non-trivial interaction component is what differentiates research on CBIR systems from the more classical object recognition algorithms previously discussed. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[168,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b255">[257]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b256">[258]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b257">[259]</ref> for good surveys on the topic. Some early influential example systems in the commercial domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b256">[258]</ref> include IBM's QBIC <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">[244]</ref>, VIRAGE <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">[245]</ref>, and the NEC AMORE system <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">[246]</ref>, as well as the MIT Photobook <ref type="bibr" target="#b246">[247]</ref>, the Columbia VisualSEEK/Web-SEEK <ref type="bibr" target="#b247">[248]</ref>, Stanford's WBIIS system <ref type="bibr" target="#b248">[249]</ref> and the UCSB NeTra system <ref type="bibr" target="#b249">[250]</ref> from academia.</p><p>CBIR has been a vibrant topic of research. Huijsmans and Sebe <ref type="bibr" target="#b258">[260]</ref> note that image search can be split into three main categories: (i) search by association, where an iterative process is used to refine the browsed images, (ii) aimed search where the user explicitly specifies the image he wishes to search for, and (iii) category search where a more loosely defined semantic class is searched for (which could be defined by a text string, an image example, or a combination of both).</p><p>Similarly, Datta et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b256">[258]</ref> categorize CBIR systems based on four axes: User Intent, Data Scope, Query Modalities and Visualization. User Intent is characterized by the clarity of the user's intent: is the user browsing for pictures with no clear goal (in which case the user is a Browser), a moderate goal where the user slowly becomes more clear in his end-goal (the user is a Surfer) or he has from the very beginning a very clear understanding of what he is looking for (the user is a Searcher). Identifying the user type and adjusting the user interface accordingly could vastly improve the user experience and potentially influence the commercial viability of a system, exemplifying the importance of the HCI component in the design of a CBIR system.</p><p>Clarifying the scope of the image and video data can also be very important since this can influence the system design in terms of how reliable the image search has to be, how fast and responsive the underlying hardware architecture has to be as well as what type of user interface to implement. These dimensions could be particularly important in the case of social media websites for example, where users tend to share photo and video albums using a variety of data acquisition modalities (e.g., smartphones). Datta et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b256">[258]</ref> classifies the image and video data based on whether it is intended for: (i) a personal collection expected to be stored locally, to be of relatively small size and to be accessible only to its owner, (ii) a domain specific collection such as medical images or images and videos acquired from a UAV, (iii) enterprise collection for pictures and videos available in an intranet and potentially not stored in a single central location, (iv) archives for images and videos of historical interest which could be distributed in multiple disk arrays, accessible only via the internet and requiring different levels of security/access controls for different users, (v) Web-based archives that are available to everyone and should be able to support non-trivial user traffic volumes, store vast amounts of data, and search semi-structured and non-homogeneous data.</p><p>Query modalities for CBIR system can rely on keywords, freetext (consisting of sentences, questions, phrases, etc.), images (where the user requests that similar images, or images in the same semantic category as the query image to be retrieved), graph-ics (where the user draws the query image/shape) as well as composite approaches based on combinations of the aforementioned modalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b256">[258]</ref>.</p><p>Finally visualization is another aspect of a CBIR system that can influence its commercial success <ref type="bibr" target="#b256">[258]</ref>. Relevance-ordered results are presented based on some order of importance of the results, and it is the approach adopted by most image search engines. Time-ordered results are presented in chronological order and are commonly used in social media websites such as Facebook. A clustered presentation of the results can also provide an intuitive way of browsing groups of images. A hierarchical approach to visualizing the data could be implemented through the use of metadata associated with the images and videos. As noted in Datta et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b256">[258]</ref>, a hierarchical representation could be useful for educational purposes. Finally combinations of the above visualization systems could be a useful feature when designing personalized systems.</p><p>CBIR systems need to be efficient and scalable, resulting in a preference towards the use of storage wise scalable feature extraction algorithms. However such feature extraction algorithms must also be powerful in terms of their indexing capabilities. The so-called semantic gap, which we discussed in some detail in Sections 1, 2.1, is a topic which re-emerges in the CBIR literature. The ability to integrate feature primitives which are also powerful indexing mechanisms is typically moderated by the fact that powerful indexing primitives tend to also be quite expensive computationally.</p><p>Scalable features are either color-based, texture-based or shape based. See Veltkamp and Tanase <ref type="bibr" target="#b257">[259]</ref> for a good overview. Color features can rely on the use of an image's dominant color, a region's histogram, a color coherence vector, color moments, correlation histograms, or a local image histogram. Common texture features used include edge statistics, local binary patterns, random field decomposition, atomic texture features and Wavelet, Gabor or Fourier based features. Common shape features include the use of bounding boxes such as ellipses, curvature scale space, elastic models, Fourier descriptors, template matching and edge direction histograms.</p><p>Thus, within the CBIR context, we see that the general recognition framework of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> forms a submodule of a more complex system lying at the confluence of HCI (user interfaces, user intent prediction, visualization) database systems, and object recognition.</p><p>Flickner et al. developed the QBIC system which uses color, texture and shape features <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">[244,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b257">259]</ref>. The RGB, YIQ, Lab and Munsell color spaces are used to extract whole image color representations or average color vectors. The shape features rely on algebraic moments invariants (corresponding to eigenvalues of various constructed matrices), major axis orientation, shape area and eccentricity. Tamura's texture features were the inspiration for the coarseness, contrast and directionality features used <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[261]</ref>. Querying is based on example images, sketches drawn by the user, and through the use of various query colors and texture patterns. Matching relies on variants of the Euclidean distance between Fig. <ref type="figure">23</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">[239]</ref> a vision-based computer-controlled wheelchair equipped with a 6DOF arm, actively searches an indoor environment to localize a door, approaches the door, pushes down the door handle, opens the door, and enters the next room.</p><p>the extracted color, shape and texture features. Relevance feedback enables the user to select retrieved images and use them as seeds in subsequent queries.</p><p>The Photobook from MIT's Media Lab <ref type="bibr" target="#b260">[262]</ref>, is a system that relies on the extraction of faces, 2D shapes and texture images. The faces and 2D shape features rely on the eigenvectors of a covariance matrix depending on pixel intensities and various feature points defining the object's shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref>. The texture description of the object depends on periodicity, directionality and randomness. For each image category a few characteristic prototypes for the image category are selected. For each database image the average distance to these image prototypes is calculated. The distance of the query image to these averages is used during query time in order to match the query image to a category.</p><p>The PicSOM system <ref type="bibr" target="#b250">[251,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b261">[263]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b262">[264]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b263">[265]</ref> will be discussed in more detail towards the end of the paper as these features have also been used successfully in the annual PASCAL competitions. Briefly, a number of color features are extracted from the RGB channels, and the YIQ channels. Also the image edges (extracted with a Sobel operator) in conjunction with the low-passed Fourier spectrum, provide another 128-dimensional vector which is useful for recognition purposes. A Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is used to match the images, where the distance between SOM units corresponds to the Euclidean distance between the above described feature vectors.</p><p>From the CBIR systems compared in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, we notice that it is difficult to compare and discriminate CBIR systems along the typical dimensions used to compare recognition systems. This is because few performance metrics are typically disclosed for such systems. Early published work relied on fairly similar features (mostly color, shape, texture, and sometimes text based) and made little to no use of function, context, or 3D object representations. More recent work on image classification (as reviewed in Sections 2.7, 2.9 for example) relies to a greater extent on the use of context. The main differentiating factor amongst CBIR systems lies in the user interface (how users enter their queries, the type of queries, the use of relevance feedback), how data is visualized, and query responsiveness.</p><p>The discussion on classical approaches to object recognition, has provided the reader with an overview of the types of algorithms that could be incorporated in a CBIR system. Practical CBIR systems have to make certain compromises between the indexing power of the feature extraction algorithms, their generality, and their computational requirements. The practical success of a CBIR system will also ultimately rely on its user interface, the power of its relevance feedback mechanism, the system's ability to predict what the user is searching for, as well as on the representational power of the system's core recognition algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Active and dynamic vision</head><p>In the introduction we overviewed some of the advantages and disadvantages of the active vision framework. The human visual system has two main characteristics: the eyes can move, and visual sensitivity is highly heterogeneous across visual space <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Curiously, these characteristics are largely ignored by the vision community.</p><p>The human eyes exhibit four types of behaviors: saccades, fixation, smooth pursuit, and vergence. Saccades are ballistic movements associated with visual search. Fixation is partially associated with recognition tasks which do not require overt attention. Smooth pursuit is associated with tracking tasks and vergence is associated with vision tasks which change the relative directions of the optical axes. How do these behaviors fit within the active vision framework in computer vision? As discussed in Section 2.7, it is believed that during early childhood development, the association between the sight of an object and its function is primed by manipulation, randomly at first, and then in a more and more refined way. This hints that there exists a strong association between active vision and learning. Humans are excellent in recognizing and categorizing objects even from static images. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">3</ref> It can thus be argued that active vision research is at least as important for learning object representations as it is for online recognition tasks.</p><p>Findlay and Gilchrist <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> make a compelling argument in support of more research in the active approach to human vision:</p><p>1. Vision is a difficult problem consisting of many building blocks that can be characterized in isolation. Eye movements are one such building block. 2. Since visual sensitivity is the highest in the fovea, in general, eye movements are needed for recognizing small stimuli. 3. During a fixation, a number of things happen concurrently: the visual information around the fixation is analyzed, and visual information away from the current fixation is analyzed to help select the next saccade target. The exact processes involved in this are still largely unknown.</p><p>Findlay and Gilchrist <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> also pose a number of questions, in order to demonstrate that numerous basic problems in vision still remain open for research.</p><p>1. What visual information determines the target of the next eye movement? 2. What visual information determines when eyes move? 3. What information is combined across eye movements to form a stable representation of the environment?</p><p>As discussed earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, a brute force approach to object localization subject to a cost constraint, is often intractable as the search space size increases. Furthermore, the human brain would have to be some hundreds of thousands times larger than it currently is, if visual sensitivity across the visual space was the same as that in the fovea <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Thus, active and attentive approaches to the problem are usually proposed as a means of addressing these constraints.</p><p>We will show in this section that within the context of the general framework for object recognition that was illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, previous work on active object recognition systems has conclusively demonstrated that active vision systems are capable of leading to significant improvements in both the learning and inference phases of object recognition. This includes improvements in the robustness of all the components of the featureextraction ? feature-grouping ? object-hypothesis ? object-verification ? object-recognition pipeline.</p><p>Some of the problems inherent in single view object recognition, include <ref type="bibr" target="#b264">[266]</ref>:</p><p>1. The impossibility of inverting projection and the fragility of 3D inference. It is, in general, impossible to recover a three dimensional world from its two dimensional projection on an image, unless we make restrictive assumptions about the world. 2. Occlusion. Features necessary for recognition might be selfoccluded or occluded by other objects. 3. Detectibility. Features necessary for recognition might be missing due to low image contrast, illumination conditions and incorrect camera placement <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. 4. View degeneracies. As discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, view degeneracies that are caused by accidental alignments can easily lead to wrong feature detection and bad model parameterizations.</p><p>It is straight-forward to see how the above problems can adversely influence the components of a typical object recognition system shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Various attempts have been made to address these problems. The various 3D active object recognition systems that have been proposed so far in the literature can be compared based on the following four main characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b265">[267]</ref>:</p><p>1. Nature of the next view planning strategy. Often the features characterizing two views of two distinct objects are identical, making single view recognition very difficult. A common goal of many active recognition strategies is to plan camera movements and adjust the camera's intrinsic parameters in order to obtain different views of the object that will enable the system to escape from the single view ambiguities. While classical research on active vision from the field of psychology has largely focused on 'eyes and head' movements, the next-view planning literature in computer vision and robotics assumes more degrees of freedom since there are no constraints on how the scene can be sensed or what types of actuators the robotic platform can have. 2. Uncertainty handling capability of the hypothesis generation mechanism. One can distinguish between Bayesian based and non-Bayesian based approaches to the hypothesis generation problem and the handling of uncertainty in inference. 3. Efficient representation of domain knowledge. The efficiency of the mechanism used to represent domain knowledge and form hypotheses is another feature distinguishing the recognition algorithms. This domain knowledge could emerge in the form of common features-such as edges, moments, etc.-as well as other features that are appropriate for using context or an object's function to perform recognition. 4. Speed and efficiency of algorithms for both hypothesis generation and next view planning. Complexity issues arise, for example, in terms of the reasoning and next view planning algorithm that is used, but also in terms of other components of the recognition algorithm. The complexity of those sub components can play a decisive role as to whether we will have a real-time performing active object recognition algorithm, even if we use a highly efficient representation scheme of the domain knowledge from point 3.</p><p>As indicated in the introduction, the dynamic vision paradigm subsumes the active vision paradigm, and is more focused on dynamic scenes where vision algorithms (such as recognition algorithms) are applied concurrently to the actions being executed. Within this context, a significant topic of research in dynamic vision systems is the incorporation of predictions of future developments and possibilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b266">268]</ref>. Historically, dynamic vision systems have focused on the construction of vision systems that are reliable in indoor and outdoor environments. Within this context, dynamic vision systems are also more tightly coupled to the research interests of the robotics community, as compared to classical computer vision research.</p><p>Historically, dynamic vision research emerged due to the need to integrate recursive estimation algorithms (e.g., Kalman filters) with spatio-temporal models of objects observed from moving platforms. As pointed out by Dickmanns <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, applying vision algorithms concurrently to the actions performed requires the following (also see Fig. <ref type="figure">24</ref>): (i) The computation of the expected visual appearance from fast moving image sequences and the representation of models for motion in 3-D space and time. (ii) Taking into account the time delays of the different sensor modalities, and taking into account these time delays in order to synchronize the image interpretation. (iii) The ability to robustly fuse different elements of perception (such as inertial information, visual information and odometry information) whose strengths and weaknesses might complement each other in different situations. For example, visual feedback is better for addressing long term stability driftproblems which might emerge from inertial signals, while inertial signals are better for short-term stability when implementing egomotion and gaze stabilization algorithms. (iv) Incorporating a knowledge-base of manoeuvre elements for helping with situational assessment. (v) Incorporating a knowledge base of behavioral capabilities for various scene objects, so that the objects' behavior and identity could be identified more easily from small temporal action elements.

A significant insight of Dickmanns' spatio-temporal approach to vision was that the modeling of objects and motion processes over time in 3-D space (as compared to modeling them directly in the image plane) and the subsequent perspective projection of those models in the image plane, led to drastic improvements in the calculation of the respective Jacobian matrices used in the recursive estimation processes, and thus became necessary components of a dynamic vision system. This approach led to the creation of robust vision systems that were far more advanced than what had been considered to be the state-of-the-art up until then. Examples of such systems include pole balancing using an electro-cart <ref type="bibr" target="#b267">[269]</ref>, the first high-speed road vehicle guidance by vision on a highway <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> (which includes modules for road recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">[270]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b269">[271]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b270">[272]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b271">[273]</ref>, lane recognition, road curvature estimation, and lane switching <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[274,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>, obstacle detection and avoidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">[275]</ref>, recognition of vehicles and humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b274">[276]</ref>, and autonomous off-road driving <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>) as well as aircraft and helicopters with the sense of vision for autonomously landing <ref type="bibr" target="#b275">[277,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b276">278]</ref>. Within the context of the recognition pipeline shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, we see that the work by Dickmanns improved the reliability of the measured features, it improved the reliability of predicted features, of the object hypotheses and their subsequent grouping, when attempting to extract these features under egomotion. These improvements led to significant and surprising for the time innovations in vision, by demonstrating for example the first self-driving vision-based vehicle.</p><p>In Section 1 we discussed some of the execution costs associated with an active vision system. These problems (such as the problem of determining correspondences under an imperfect stereo depth extraction algorithm and the problem of addressing dead-reckoning errors) are further exacerbated in dynamic vision systems where the actions are executed concurrently to the vision algorithms. This is one major reason why the related problems are more prominently identified and addressed in the literature on dynamical vision systems, since addressing these problems usually becomes a necessary component of any dynamic vision system.</p><p>At this point we need to make a small digression, and discuss the difference between passive sensors, active sensors, active vision and passive vision. While passive and active vision refers to the use (or lack thereof) of intelligent control strategies applied to data acquisition process, an active sensor refers to a sensor which provides its own energy for emitting radiation, which in turn is used to sense the scene. In practice, active sensors are meant to complement classical passive sensors such as light sensitive cameras. The Kinect [295] is a popular example of a sensor that combines a passive RGB sensor and an active sensor (an infrared laser combined with a monochrome CMOS camera for interpreting the active sensor data and extracting depth). One could classify vision systems into those which have access to depth information (3D) and those that do not. One could argue that the use of active sensors for extracting depth information is not essential in the object recognition problem, since the human eyes are passive sensors and stereo depth information is not an essential cue for the visual cortex. In practice, however, active sensors are often superior for extracting depth under variable illumination. Furthermore, depth is a useful cue in the segmentation and object recognition process. One of the earliest active recognition system <ref type="bibr" target="#b284">[286]</ref> made use of laser-range finders. Within the context of more recent work, the success of Kinect-based systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b293">[296]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b294">[297]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b295">[298]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b296">[299]</ref> demonstrates how combined active and passive sensing systems improve recognition. For example, the work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b293">[296]</ref> achieved top ranked performance in a related recognition challenge, by leveraging the ability of the Kinect to provide accurate depth information in order to build reliable 3D object models. Within the context of the recognition pipeline shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, active sensors enable us to better register the scene features with the scene depth. This enables the creation of higher fidelity object models, which in turn are useful in improving the feature grouping phase (e.g., determining the features which lie at similar depths) as well as the object hypothesis and recognition phases (by making 3D object model matching more reliable).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Active object detection literature survey</head><p>With the advent popularity in the 1990s of machine learning and Bayesian based approaches for solving computer vision problems, active vision approaches lost their popularity. The related number of publications decreased significantly between the late 1990s and the next decade.</p><p>This lack of interest in active vision systems is partially attributable to the fact that power efficiency is not a major factor in the design of vision algorithms. This is also evidenced by the evaluation criteria of vision algorithms in popular conferences and journals, where usually no power metrics are presented. Note that an algorithm's asymptotic space and time complexity is not necessarily a sufficiently accurate predictor of power efficiency, since this does not necessarily model well the degree of communication between CPU and memory in a von-Neumann architecture. One of the main research interests of the object recognition community over the last 10-15 years, has been on the interpretation of large datasets containing images and video. This has been mainly motivated by the growth of the internet, online video, and smartphones, which make it extremely easy for anyone to capture high quality pictures and video. As a result most resources by the vision community have been focused on addressing the industry's need for good vision algorithms to mine all this data. As a result, research on active approaches to vision was not a priority.</p><p>Recently, however, there has been a significant upsurge of interest in active vision related research. This is evidenced by some of the more recent publications on active vision, which are also discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. In this section we focus on the active object detection problem, which involves the use of intelligent data acquisition strategies in order to robustly choose the correct value of at least one binary label/classification associated with a small 3D region. The main distinguishing characteristic of the active object detection literature, as compared to the literature on active object localization and recognition, is that in the detection problem we are interested in improving the classification performance in some small 3D region, and are not as interested in searching a large 3D region to determine the positions of one or more objects. In Charts 7, 8 and Tables <ref type="table">5,</ref><ref type="table">6</ref> we compare, along certain dimensions, a number of the papers surveyed in Sections 3.1, 3.2. Notice that the active object detection systems of Table <ref type="table">5</ref> make little use of function and context. In contrast to the non-active approaches, all the active vision systems rely on 3D depth extraction mechanisms through passive (stereo) or active sensors. From Tables <ref type="table">5,</ref><ref type="table">6</ref> we notice that no active recognition system is capable of achieving consistently good performance along all the compared dimensions. In this respect it is evident that the state of the art in passive recognition (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">7</ref>) surpasses the capabilities of active recognition systems.</p><p>Wilkes and Tsotsos <ref type="bibr" target="#b264">[266]</ref> published one of the first papers to discuss the concept of active object detection (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">25</ref>) by presenting an algorithm to actively determine whether a particular object is present on a table. As the authors argue, single view object recognition has many problems because of various ambiguities that might arise in the image, and the inability of standard object recognition algorithms to move the camera and obtain a more suitable viewpoint of the object and thus, escape from these ambiguities. The paper describes a behavior based approach to camera motion and describes some solutions to the above mentioned ambiguities. These ambiguities are discussed in more detail by Dickinson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b278">[280]</ref>. Inspired by the arguments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b264">[266]</ref>, the authors begin by presenting certain reasons as to why the problem  <ref type="table">5</ref> on active object detection. By definition search efficiency is not the primary concern in these systems, since by assumption the object is always in the sensor's field of view. However inference scalability constitutes a significant component of such systems. We notice very little use of function and context in these systems. Furthermore, training such systems is often non-trivial.</p><p>Chart 8. Summary of the 1992-2012 papers on active object localization and recognition from Table <ref type="table">6</ref>. As expected, search efficiency and the role of 3D information is significantly more prominent in these papers (as compared to Chart 7).</p></div>

The work is an example of an active object detection system that incorporates contextual knowledge. This contextual knowledge is used to select viewpoints that are optimal with respect to a criterion. This constrains the gaze control loop, and leads to more reliable object detection. The authors define contextual knowledge as the join of a discrete set of prior hypotheses about the relative likelihood of various model parameters s, given a set of object views, with the likelihood of each object hypothesis as the agent explores the scene. The active camera control mechanism is meant to augment this contextual knowledge and, thus, enable a reduction in the amount of data needed to form hypotheses and provide us with more reliable object recognition. The paper describes three main operations that an agent must perform: (a) Data collection, registration with previous data and modeling using a pre-defined scene class. (b) Classification of the scene models using a set of object hypotheses. (c) Disambiguation of ambiguous hypotheses/classifications by collecting new object views/data to reduce ambiguity. The paper does not discuss how to search through an arbitrary 3D region to discover the objects of interest. The paper assumes that the sensor is focused on some object, and any motion along the allowed degrees of freedom will simply sense the object from a different viewpoint (i.e., it tackles a constrained version of the object search problem). Thus, this active vision system provided a methodology for improving the object hypothesis and verification phases of the pipeline in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>[280] Combine various computer vision techniques in a single framework in order to achieve robust object recognition. The algorithm is given the target object as its input. Notice that even though the paper does deal with the problem of object search and localization within a single image, its next viewpoint controller deals mostly with verifying the object identity from a new viewpoint, which is the reason we refer to this algorithm as an active object detector.</p><p>The paper combines a Bayesian based attention mechanism, with aspect graph based object recognition and viewpoint control, in order to achieve robust recognition in the presence of ambiguous views of the object. See Figs. 26, 27 for an overview of the various modules implemented in the system. The object representation scheme is a combination of Object Centered Modeling and Viewer Centered Modeling. The object centered modeling is accomplished by using 10 geons. These geons can be combined to describe more complex types of objects. The Viewer Centered modeling is accomplished by using aspects to represent a small set of volumetric parts from which an object is constructed, rather than directly representing an object. One obvious advantage of this is the decrease in the size of the aspect hierarchy. However, if a volumetric part is occluded, this could cause problems in the recogni-tion. To solve this problem, the authors extend the aspect graph representation into an aspect graph hierarchy (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref>) which consists of three levels. The set of aspects that model the chosen volumes, the set of component faces of the aspects, and the set of boundary groups representing all subsets of contours bounding the faces. The idea is that if an aspect is occluded, they can use some of these more low-level features to achieve the recognition. From this hierarchy of geon primitives, aspects, faces and boundary groups, the authors create a Bayesian network, and extract the associated conditional probabilities. The probabilities are extracted in a straightforward manner by uniformly sampling the geons using a Gaussian sphere. For example, to estimate the probability of face x occurring given that boundary group y is currently visible, they use the sampled data to calculate the related probability. From this data, the authors use a slight modification of Shannon's entropy formula to discover that for the geon based representation, faces are more discriminative than boundary groups. Therefore, they use faces as a focus feature for the recovery of volumetric parts (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">28</ref>).</p><p>Using various segmentation algorithms described in the literature, the authors segment the images and create region topology graphs (denoting region adjacencies), region boundary topology graphs (denoting relations between partitioned segments of bounding contours) and face topology graphs (indicating the labeled face hypothesis for all regions in the image). Each region's shape in the image is classified by matching its region boundary graph to those graphs representing the faces in the augmented aspect hierarchy graph using interpretation tree search. This enables the creation of face topology graphs labeling the current image. They use this face topology graph labeling with attention driven recognition in order to limit search in both the image and the model database. Given as input the object they wish to detect, the authors define a utility function U that can be used in conjunction with the previously defined conditional probabilities and the aspect graph, to determine the most likely face to start their search with, given the object they are trying to find. The search uses concepts inspired from game theory, and does the search until there is a good match between the face topology graph for the image and the augmented aspect graph.</p><p>Then, a verification step is done, by using various metrics to see if the aspects and volumes also match. If there is no match the authors proceed with the next most likely matching face, and the process continues like this. Extensions of this recognition algorithm to multipart objects are also described and involve some extra steps in the verification phase searching for connectedness among their part aspects. The final component of the recognition algorithm involves viewpoint control. Viewpoint control makes it possible to resolve viewpoint degeneracies. As already discussed in this survey (also see the discussion towards the end of this section), such degeneracies have been shown to frequently occur in practice. The authors define an aspect prediction graph which is a more compact version of the aspect graph and specifies Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">25</ref>. A sequence of viewpoints from which the system developed by Wilkes and Tsotsos <ref type="bibr" target="#b264">[266]</ref> actively recognizes an origami object.</p><p>transitions between topologically equivalent views of the object. They use this graph to decide the direction of camera motion. The main idea is to move the camera to the most likely aspectexcluding the already viewed aspects-, based on the previously calculated conditional probabilities and the most likely volume currently viewed, in order to verify whether it is indeed this hypothesized volume that is in the field of view. Then the algorithm described above is repeated.</p><p>The main innovation of the paper is the combination of lots of ideas in computer vision (attention, object recognition, viewpoint control) in a single framework. Limitations of the paper include the assumption that objects can be represented as constructions of volumetric parts-which is difficult for various objects such as clouds or trees-, and its reliance on salient homogeneous regions in the image for the segmentation. Real objects contain a lot of details, and the segmentation is in general difficult. Notice that there is room for improvement in the attentive mechanisms used. No significant effort is made to create a model that adaptively adjusts its expressive power during learning, potentially making proper Fig. <ref type="figure">26</ref>. The face recovery and attention mechanism used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b278">[280]</ref> (diagram adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b278">[280]</ref>).

The object verification and next viewpoint selection algorithm used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b278">[280]</ref> (diagram adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b278">[280]</ref>). Spectacular recognition rates of nearly 100% are presented in the paper. The main idea of the paper is to represent the 3D objects by using the probability density function of local 2D image characteristics acquired from different viewpoints. The authors use Gaussian derivatives as the local characteristics of the object. These derivatives allow them to build histograms (probability density functions) of the image resulting after the application of the filter. Assuming that a measurement set M of some local characteristics {m k } is acquired from the image-where the local characteristics might be for example the x-coordinate derivatives or the image's Laplacian-they obtain a probability distribution p(Mjo n , R, T, P, L, N) for the object o n (where R, T, P, L, N denote the rotation, translation, partial occlusion, light changes and noise). The authors argue that for various reasons (the filters they use, the use of histograms and so on) the distribution is conditionally independent of various of these variables and it suffices to build histograms for p(Mjo n , S) where S denotes the rotation and one of the translation parameters. The authors define the quantity</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">pðo n ; S j jfm k gÞ ¼ Y k pðm k jo n ; S j Þ X n 0 ;j 0 Y k pðm k jo n 0 ; S j 0 Þ<label>ð9Þ</label></formula><p>which gives the probability of object o n in pose S j occurring given that we know the resulting images under set {m k } of filters. The probabilities on the right hand side are known through the histogram based probability density estimation we described above. We can use this probability to recognize the object we currently view and its pose by simply maximizing the probability over all values for variables n, j. Test results that the authors cite indicate that this performs very well even in cases where only 40% of the object is visible. The authors then describe the object recognition process in terms of the transmission of information.</p></div>

Intuitively, the lower the quantity, the ''closer'' the two sets are to being statistically independent, implying that one set's values do not affect the other set's values. This is used to choose the salient viewpoints of an object and thus, provide an algorithm for active object detection. By rewriting the previous equation for transinformation as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">TðO; MÞ ¼ X N n¼1 pðo n Þ X K k¼1 pðm k jo n Þlog pðm k jo n Þ pðm k Þ<label>ð11Þ</label></formula><p>we see that the transinformation can be interpreted as the average transinformation of some object o n 's transinformation Tðo n ; MÞ ¼ P K k¼1 pðm k jo n Þlog pðm k jon Þ pðm k Þ . By going one step further and incorporating the pose S j of an object in the previous definition of transinformation we get</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Tðo n ; S j ; MÞ ¼ X K k¼1 pðm k jo n ; S j Þlog pðm k jo n ; S j Þ pðm k Þ<label>ð12Þ</label></formula><p>and we see that we can find the most significant viewpoints of an object by finding the maximum over all j of this equation. The authors use this last formula to hypothesize the object identity and pose from an image. Then, they use again this last formula to estimate the most discriminating viewpoint for the hypothesized object, move the camera to that viewpoint, perform verification and proceed until some threshold is passed, indicating that the object has been identified. Overall, the main advantage of the paper is that it provides an elegant and simple method to perform object recognition. The test results provide strong evidence of the power of the active object recognition framework. The more verification steps performed, the lower the misclassification rate. A drawback of the method is that it has not been tested on much larger datasets, and little work has been done to see how it performs under non-uniform backgrounds. Furthermore, a question arises on the algorithm's performance as the errors in the estimation of the camera position increase. As discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, the implications could be significant.</p><p>Similarly to the above paper, Borotschnig et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b280">[282]</ref> use an information theoretic based quantity (entropy) in order to decide the next view of the object that the camera should take to recognize the object and obtain more robust object recognition in the presence of ambiguous viewpoints. The approach uses an appearance based recognition system (inspired by Murase and Nayar's <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141]</ref> popular PCA based recognition algorithm) that is augmented by probability distributions. The paper begins by describing how to obtain an eigenbasis of all the objects in our database from all views. Then, given a new image, the algorithm can project that new image on the eigenbasis to obtain a point g in that basis, denoting the image. Denote by p(gjo i , u j ) the probability of point g occurring in the eigenspace of all objects that are projecting an image of object o i with pose parameters u j . Under ideal circumstances p(gjo i , u j ) would be a spike function. In other words, the function would be zero for all values of g, except for one value for which it would be equal to 1. However, due to various sources of error (fluctuations in imaging conditions, pan, tilt, zoom errors, segmentation errors etc.) the authors estimate this probability from a set of sample images with fixed o i and u j values. The probability density function is modeled as a multivariate Gaussian with mean and standard deviation estimated from the sample images. By Bayes' theorem it can be shown that</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Pðo i ; u j jgÞ ¼ pðgjo i ; u j Þpðu j jo i Þpðo i Þ pðgÞ<label>ð13Þ</label></formula><p>In the experiments the authors assumed that p(o i ) and p(u j jo i ) are uniformly distributed. In their test cases the authors choose a number of bins in which they will discretize the possible number of viewpoints and use them to build these probability distribution functions. Then, given some vector g in the eigenspace of shapes, the conditional probability of seeing object o i is given by pðo i jgÞ ¼ P j Pðo i ; u j jgÞ. By iterating over all the objects in the database and finding the most likely object, objects are recognized. The authors then further expand on this idea and present an algorithm for actively controlling the camera. They show that in cases where the object database contains objects that share similar views, the active object recognition framework leads to striking improvements.</p><p>The key to this is the use of planned camera movements that lead to viewpoints from which the object appears distinct. Note also that the authors use only one degree of freedom for rotating around the object along a constant radius. However, extensions to arbitrary rotations should be straightforward to implement. The authors define a metric s(Dw) which gives the average entropy reduction to the object identity if the point of view is changed by Dw. Since there is a discreet number of views, finding the optimal Dw is a simple linear search problem. The authors make 3 major conclusions based on their results: (a) The dimension of the eigenspace can be lowered significantly if active recognition is guiding the object classification. In other words active recognition might open the way to the use of very large object databases, suitable for real world applications (b) Even objects that share most views can be successfully disambiguated.</p><p>(c) The number of steps needed to obtain good recognition results is much lower than random camera placement, again indicating the usefulness of the algorithm (2.6 vs. 12.8 steps on average). This last point is further supported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The three above points demonstrate how an active vision framework might decrease the size of the object database needed to represent an object, and help improve the object hypotheses and verification phase, by improving the disambiguation of objects that share many views (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). These ideas were further expanded upon by Paletta and Prantl <ref type="bibr" target="#b281">[283]</ref>, where the authors incorporated temporal context as a means of helping disambiguate initial object hypotheses. Notice that in their previous work, the authors treated all the views as ''bags of features'' without taking advantage of the view/temporal context. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b281">[283]</ref> the authors work on this shortcoming by adding a few constraints to their probabilistic quantities. They add in their probabilistic formulation temporal context by encoding that the probability of observing a view (o i , u j ) due to a viewpoint change Du 1 must be equal to the probability of observing view (o i , u j -À Du 1 ). This leads to a slight change in the Bayesian equations used to fuse the data and leads to an improvement in recognition performance. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b298">[301]</ref> the authors use a radial-basis function based network to learn object identity. The authors point out that the online evaluation of the information gain, and most probabilistic quantities as a matter of fact, are intractable, and therefore, learned mappings of decision policies have to be applied in next view planning to achieve real-time performance.</p><p>Roy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b282">[284]</ref> presents an algorithm for pose estimation and next-view planning. A novelty of this paper is that it presents an active object recognition algorithm for objects that might not fit entirely in the camera's field of view and does not assume calibrated intrinsic parameters. In other words it improves the feature grouping and object hypothesis modules of the standard recognition pipeline (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), through the use of a number of invariants that enable the recognition of objects which do not fit in a camera's field of view, and thus are not recognizable using a passive approach to vision. It should be pointed out that this was the first active recognition/detection system to tackle this important and often encountered real world problem. The paper introduces the use of inner camera invariants for pose estimation. These image computable quantities, in general, do not depend on most intrinsic camera parameters, but assume a zero skew. The authors use a probabilistic reasoning framework that is expressed in terms of a graphical model, and use this framework for next-view planning to further help them with disambiguating the object. Andreopoulos and Tsotsos <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">[239]</ref> also present an active object localization algorithm that can localize objects that might not fall entirely in the sensor's field of view (see Fig. <ref type="figure">23</ref>). Overall this system was shown to be robust in the case of occlusion/clutter. A drawback of the method is that it was only tested with simple objects that contained parallelograms. It is interesting to see how the method would extend if we were processing objects containing more complicated features. Again, its sensitivity to dead-reckoning errors is not investigated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b283">[285]</ref> present a related paper with a few important differences. First of all, the paper does not make use of invariant features as <ref type="bibr" target="#b282">[284]</ref> does. Furthermore, the graphical model is used to describe an appearance based aspect graph: features q ij represent the aspects of the various objects in our database, and the classes C k represent the set of topologically equivalent aspects. These aspects might belong to different parts of the same object, or to different objects altogether, yet they are identical with respect to the features we measure. For each class C k the authors build an eigenspace U k of object appearances. Given any image I, they find the eigenspace parameter c, and affine transformation parameter a, that would minimize qðIðx þ f ðx; aÞÞ À ½U k cðxÞ; rÞ ð 14Þ where q is a robust error function, r is a scale parameter and f is an affine transformation. They use this c, to find the most likely class C k corresponding to the object. The probabilities are estimated by the reconstruction error induced by projecting the image I on each one of the class eigenspaces U k . The smaller the reconstruction error, the more likely we have found the corresponding class. Then, the a priori estimated probabilities P(q ij jC k ) are used to find the most likely object O m corresponding to the viewed image. If the probability of the most likely object is not high enough, we need to move to a next view to disambiguate the currently viewed object. The view-planning is similar to that of paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b282">[284]</ref>, only that there is just 1 degree of freedom in this paper (clockwise or counter clockwise rotation around some axis). By using a heuristic that is very similar to the one in paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b282">[284]</ref> and based on knowledge from previously viewed images of the object, the authors form a list of the camera movements that we should make to disambiguate the object. This procedure is repeated until the object is disambiguated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Roy and Kulkarni</head><p>The authors use the COIL-20 object database from Columbia University to do their testing. The single-view based correct recognition rate was 65.70% while the multi-view recognition rate increased to 98.19%, indicating the usefulness of the recognition results and the promise in general of the active object recognition framework under good dead-reckoning. Furthermore, the average number of camera movements to achieve recognition was 3.46 vs. 5.40 moves for the case of random camera movements, again indicating the usefulness of the heuristic the authors defined for deciding the next view. Notice that this is consistent with the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b280">282]</ref>. Disadvantages of the paper include the testing of the method on objects with only a black background (of apparently little occlusion) and the use of only a single degree of freedom in moving the camera to disambiguate the object.</p><p>Hutchinson and Kak <ref type="bibr" target="#b284">[286]</ref> presents one of the earliest attempts at active object detection. The authors generalize their work by assuming that they can have at their disposal lots of different sensors (monocular cameras, laser range-finders, manipulator fingers etc.). Thus, within the context of the standard object recognition pipeline (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), this is an example of a system that combines multiple types of feature extractors. It also represents one of the earliest active approaches for object hypothesis and verification. Each one of those sensors provides various surface features that can be used to disambiguate the object. These features include surface normal vectors, Gaussian and Mean curvatures, area of each polyhedral surface and orientation, amongst others. By creating an aspect graph for each object and by associating with each aspect the features corresponding to the surfaces represented by that aspect, the algorithm can formulate hypotheses as to the objects in a database that might correspond to the observed object. The authors then do a brute force search on all the aspects of each aspect graph in the hypotheses, and move the camera to a viewpoint of the object that will lead to the greatest reduction in the number of hypotheses. In general, this is one of the first papers to address the active object detection problem. A disadvantage of this paper is the oversimplifying assumption of polyhedral objects. Another disadvantage is the heuristic used to make the camera movements since in general it gives no guarantees that this sensor movement will be optimal in terms of the number of movements till recognition takes place. Notice that complexity issues need to be addressed, since in practice the aspect graphs of objects are quite large and can make brute force search through the aspects of all aspect graphs infeasible. Furthermore, as it is the case with most of the active object recognition algorithms described so far, the issue of finding the optimal sequence of actions subject to a time constraint is not addressed.</p><p>Gremban and Ikeuchi <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">[287]</ref> investigate the sensor planning phase of object recognition, and thus their work constitutes another effort in improving the object hypothesis and verification of the standard recognition pipeline (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Like many of the papers described in this survey, the algorithm uses aspect graphs to determine the next sensor movement. Similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b283">[285]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b282">[284]</ref>, the authors of this paper make use of so called congruent aspects. In a computer vision system, aspects can be defined in various ways. The most typical way of defining them is based on the set of visible surfaces or the presence/absence of various features. Adjacent viewpoints over a contiguous object region, for which the features defining the aspect remain the same, give an aspect equivalence class. In practice, however, researchers who work with aspect graphs have noticed that the measured features can be identical over many disparate viewpoints of the object. This makes it impossible to determine the exact aspect viewed. These indistinguishable aspects which share the same features are called congruence classes. The authors argue that any given feature set will consist of congruent aspects and this is responsible for the fact that virtually every object recognition system uses a unique feature set-in order to improve the performance of the algorithm on that particular domain and distinguish between the congruent aspects. Other reasons why congruent aspects might arise include noise and occlusion. The authors argue that since congruent aspects cannot be avoided sensing strategies are needed to discriminate them. In Fig. <ref type="figure">29</ref> we give an example of the aspects of an object and its congruence classes, where the feature used to define the aspects is the topology of the viewed surfaces in terms of the visible edges. The authors use Ikeuchi and Kanade's aspect classification algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> to find the congruence class corresponding to the aspect viewed by the camera. The camera motion is used to decide the aspect that this particular class corresponds to. This is referred to as aspect resolution. This enables the system to recognize whether the image currently viewed contains the target object. The authors define a class restricted observation function X(w, h) that returns the congruence class currently viewed by the camera. The variable w defines the angle of rotation of the sensor around some axis in the object's coordinate system-the authors assume initially that the only permissible motion is rotation around one axis-and h denotes the rotation of the object with respect to the world coordinate frame. An observation function X(w, h) can be constructed for the object model that is to be identified in the image. The authors discuss in the paper only how to detect instances of a single object, not how to perform image understanding. The authors initially position the camera at w = 0-they assume that the object they wish to recognize is manually positioned in front of the camera with an appropriate pose-and estimate the congruence class c that is currently viewed by investigating the extracted features (see Fig. <ref type="figure">30</ref>). By scanning through the function X(w, h) they find the set of values of h, (if any), for which X(0, h) = c. If no values of h satisfy this function, the object viewed is not the one they are searching for. Otherwise, by using a heuristic, the authors move the camera to a new value of w, estimate the congruence class currently viewed by the camera and use this new knowledge to further constrain the values of h satisfying this new constraint (see Fig. <ref type="figure">30</ref>). If they end up with a single interval of values of h that satisfy all these constraints, they have recognized an instance of the object they are looking for. The authors can also use this knowledge to extrapolate the aspect that the sensor is currently viewing, and thus, achieve aspect resolution. The authors describe various data structures for extending this idea to more than a single degree of camera motion.</p><p>Dickinson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> quantify an observation that degenerate views occupy a significant fraction of the viewing sphere surrounding an object and show how active and purposive control of the sensor could enable such a system to escape from these degeneracies, thus leading to more reliable recognition. A view of an object is considered degenerate if at least one of the two conditions below hold (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">31</ref>):</p><p>1. a zero dimensional (point-like) object feature is collinear with both the front nodal point of the lens 2. and either:</p><p>(a) another zero dimensional object feature, or (b) some point on a line (finite or infinite) defined by two zerodimensional object features.</p><p>The paper gives various examples of when such degeneracies might occur. An example of degeneracy is when we have two cubes such that the vertex x of one cube is touching a point y on an edge of the other cube. If the front nodal point of the lens lies on the line defined by points x, y the authors say that this view of the object is degenerate. Of course, in the case of infinite camera resolution, the chances of this happening are virtually non-existent. However, cameras have finite resolution. Therefore, the chances of degeneracies occurring are no longer negligible.</p><p>The authors conduct various experiments under realistic assumptions and observe that for a typical computer vision setup the chances of degenerate views are not negligible and can be as high as 50%. They also tested a parameterization which partially matched the human foveal acuity of 20 s of arc, and noticed that the probability of degeneracies is extremely small. The authors argue that this is one reason why the importance of degenerate views in computer vision has been traditionally underestimated. Obviously an active vision system could be of immense help in disambiguating these degeneracies. The authors argue that if the goal is to avoid the degenerate views in a viewer-centered object representation or to avoid making inferences from such viewpoints, the vision systems must have a system for detecting degeneracies and actively controlling the sensor to move it out of the degeneracy. One solution to the problem of reducing the probability of degeneracy-or reducing the chance of having to move the camera-is to Fig. <ref type="figure">29</ref>. The aspects of an object and its congruence classes (adapted from Gremban and Ikeuchi <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">[287]</ref>).</p><p>simply change the focal length of the camera to increase the resolution in the region of interest. The analysis performed in the paper indicates that it is important to compensate for degeneracies in computer vision systems and also further motivates the benefits of an active approach to vision. Intelligent solutions to the viewdegeneracy problem can decrease the probability of executing expensive and unnecessary camera movement to recognize an object. Within the context of the recognition pipeline in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, we see that these degeneracies could potentially affect all the modules in the pipeline, from the quality of the low-level feature extracted, to the way the features are grouped, and to the reliability of the final object verification.</p><p>Herbin <ref type="bibr" target="#b286">[288]</ref> presents an active recognition system whose actions can influence the external environment (camera position) or the internal recognition system. The author assumes the processing of segmented images, and uses the silhouette of the objects-chess pieces-to recognize the object. The objects are encoded in aspect graphs, where each aspect contains the views with identical singularities of the object's contour. Each view is encoded by a constant vector indicating whether a convex point, a concave point or no extremum was found. Three types of actions are defined: A camera movement by 5 degrees upwards or downwards and a switch between two different feature detection scales. The author defines a training phase for associating an action a t at time t given the sequence of states up until time t. This simply learns the permissible actions for a certain object. Standard Bayesian methods determine whether there is high enough confidence so far on the object identity, or whether more aspects should be learned.</p><p>Kovacic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b287">[289]</ref> present a method for planning view sequences to recognize objects. Given a set of objects and object views, where the silhouette of each object view is characterized by a vector of moment-based features, the feature vectors are clustered. Given a detected silhouette, the corresponding cluster is determined. For each candidate new viewpoint, the object in the cluster are mapped onto another feature set of the same objects but from the new viewpoint. A number of different mappings are attempted-where each mapping depends on the next potential view-and each mapping's points are clustered. The next view which results in the greatest number of clusters is chosen, since this will on average lead to the quickest disambiguation of the object class. This procedure is repeated until clusters with only one feature vector remain, at which point recognition is possible.</p><p>Denzler and Brown <ref type="bibr" target="#b288">[290]</ref> use a modification of mutual information to determine optimal actions. They determine the action a l that leads to the greatest conditional mutual information between the object identity X and the observed feature vector c. Laporte and Arbel <ref type="bibr" target="#b289">[291]</ref> build upon this work and choose the best next viewpoint by calculating the symmetric KL divergence (Jeffrey divergence) of the likelihood of the observed data given the assumption that this data resulted from two views of two distinct objects. By weighing each Jeffrey divergence by the product of the Fig. <ref type="figure">30</ref>. An aspect resolution tree used to determine if there is a single interval of values for h that satisfy certain constraints (adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">[287]</ref>). probabilities of observing the two competing objects and their two views, they can determine the next view which provides the object identity hypothesis, thus again demonstrating the active vision system's direct applicability in the standard recognition pipeline (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>Mishra and Aloimonos <ref type="bibr" target="#b290">[292]</ref> and Mishra et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b291">[293]</ref> suggest that recognition algorithms should always include an active segmentation module. By combining monocular cues with motion or stereo, they identify the boundary edges in the scene. This supports the algorithm's ability in tracing the depth boundaries around the fixation point, which in turn can be of help in challenging recognition problems. These two papers provide an example of a different approach to recognition, where the intrinsic recognition module parameters are intelligently controlled and are more tightly coupled to changes to the low-level feature cues and their grouping in the standard recognition pipeline (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>Finally, Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b292">[294]</ref> present an interesting paper on feature selectivity. Even though the authors present the paper as having an application to active recognition, and cite the relevant literature, they limit their paper to the medical domain (Ultrasound) by selecting the most likely feature(s) that would lead to accurate diagnosis. The authors present three slight modifications to information gain and demonstrate how to choose the feature y that would lead to maximally reducing the uncertainty in classification, given that a set of features X is used. They perform tests to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and recommend a hybrid approach based on the presented metrics as the optimal approach to conditional feature selection. Within the context of an active vision system, feature selection algorithms could be used to choose the optimal next sensor action.</p><p>While most of the methods discussed in this section mainly show that active image acquisition makes the problem easier, the last few papers discussed give an insight of a general nature for object recognition, where active image acquisition is tightly coupled to the more classical vision and recognition modules. Another general conclusion is that very few of the papers surveyed so far, take into consideration the effects of cost constraints, noise-constraints (e.g., dead-reckoning errors) or object representational power. As it was previously argued <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, taking into account such constraints is of importance, since they can lead to a reassessment of proper strategies for next-view-planning and recognition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Active object localization and recognition literature survey</head><p>We now present an overview of the literature on the active object localization and recognition problems. In more recent literature, the problems are sometimes referred to under the title of semantic object search. In Table <ref type="table">6</ref> and Chart 8 we compare the algorithms discussed in this subsection, along a number of dimensions. A general conclusion one can reach, is that on average, the scalability of inference for active object localization algorithms is worse than the current state of the art in passive recognition (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">7</ref> of Section 4.2 for example). This is partially attributable to the online requirements of active localization/recognition mechanisms, which make the construction of such real-time and online systems a significant challenge.</p><p>Notice that in contrast to the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem, in the active object localization problem the vision system is tasked with determining an optimal sequence of sensor movements that enable the system to determine the position of the apriori specified object, as quickly as possible. In contrast, in the SLAM problem, the scene features/objects are usually learnt/determined online during the map building process. Notice that within the context of Section 1, the localization and recognition problems subsume the detection problem, since the detection problem is a limited/constrained version of the localization and recognition problems.</p><p>When dealing with the vision-based SLAM problem, the issue of extracting scene structure from a moving platform and using this information to build a map of the environment emerges. While this problem also emerges in the active object localization and recognition problem, in practice, it is typically of secondary importance, since the main research effort while constructing active object localization and recognition systems is focused around the creation of the object recognition module and the creation of the next-viewpoint selection algorithm. As it was pointed out at the beginning of Section 3, active object localization and recognition research on dynamic scenes is limited, and in this regard it is less developed than the structure from motion and SLAM literature.</p><p>For example Ozden et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b314">[317]</ref> indicate that the main requirements for building a robust dynamic structure from motion framework, include:</p><p>Constantly determining the number of independently moving objects. Segmenting the moving object tracks. Computing the object 3D structure and camera motion with sufficient accuracy. Resolving geometric ambiguities. Achieving robustness against degeneracies caused by occlusion, self-occlusion and motion blur. Scaling the system to non-trivial recording times.</p><p>It is straightforward to see that these also constitute important requirements when constructing an active object localization and recognition system, since making a recognition system robust to these challenges would likely require changes to all the components of the standard recognition pipeline (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). However, none of the active localization and recognition systems that we will survey is capable of dealing with dynamic scenes, demonstrating that the field is still evolving. Note that this last point differentiates active vision research from dynamic vision research (see Section 3).</p><p>In the active object localization and recognition problems, any reduction in the total number of mechanical movements involved would have a significant effect on the search time and the commercial viability of the solution. Thus, a central tenet of the discussion in this section involves efficient algorithms for locating objects in an environment subject to various constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. The constraints include time constraints, noise rates, and object and scene representation lengths amongst others. In Table <ref type="table">6</ref> and Chart 8 we present a comparison, along certain dimensions, for a number of the papers surveyed in Section 3.2.</p><p>Rimey and Brown <ref type="bibr" target="#b299">[302]</ref> present the TEA-1 vision system that can search within a static image for a particular object and that can also actively control a camera if the object is not within its field of view. Within the context of Minsky's frame theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref> which we discussed in Section 2.7, the authors define a knowledge representation framework that uses ''PART-OF'', ''IS-A'' and ''adjacent'' relationships-a form of contextual knowledge-for guiding the search. The authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b299">[302]</ref> also focus on the decision making algorithms that are used to control the current focus of attention during the search for the object. A Bayesian network is used to encode the confidences regarding the various hypotheses. As the authors point out, a significant constraint in any vision system that purposively controls an active sensor, such as a camera, is resource allocation and minimization of the time-consuming camera movements. Purposiveness is necessary in any active vision system. The system must attempt specific tasks. Open ended tasks such as ''randomly move the camera around the entire room until the desired object falls in our field of view'' lack the purposiveness constraint. A number of papers <ref type="bibr">[282,?,24]</ref> have experimentally demonstrated that random search exhibits a significantly worse reliability and localization speed than purposive search, giving further credence to the arguments given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b299">[302]</ref>. This approach to vision is inspired by the apparent effect that task specification has on human eye movements. As Yarbus demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b315">[318]</ref>, human foveation patterns depend on the task at hand and the fixated objects seem to be the ones relevant for solving a particular task. Somehow, irrelevant features are ignored and humans do not search through the entire scene. This is exactly what Rimey and Brown are trying to accomplish in their paper, namely, to perform sequential actions that extract the most useful information and perform the task in the shortest period of time. Thus, within the context of the standard recognition pipeline in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, this constitutes an effort in improving the object hypothesis generation module. The authors provide a nice summary of the main differences in the selective/attentive approach to vision and the reconstructionist/non-active/non-attentive approach to vision (see Fig. <ref type="figure">32</ref>).</p><p>The authors use two different Bayesian-network-like structures for knowledge representation: composite nets and two-nets. The composite net, as its name suggests, is composed of four kinds of nets: PART-OF nets, IS-A trees, expected area nets and task nets (see Figs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>. PART-OF nets are graphical models which use PART-OF relations to model the feasible structure of the scene and the associated conditional probabilities (see Fig. <ref type="figure">33</ref>). Each node is a Boolean variable indicating the presence or absence of a particular item. For example, a node might represent a tabletop, its children might represent different kinds of tables, and each kind of table might have nodes denoting the types of utensils located on the particular table type. Expected area nets have the same structure as PART-OF nets and identify the area in the particular scene where the object is expected to be located and the area it will take up. These are typically represented using 2D discrete random variables representing the probability of the object being located in a certain grid location. Also values for the height and width of objects are typically stored in the expected area net. A relation-map is also defined which uses the expected area net to specify the relative location probability of one object given another object. An IS-A tree is a taxonomic hierarchy representing mutually exclusive subset relationships of objects (see Fig. <ref type="figure">34</ref>).</p><p>For example, one path in the hierarchy might be object ? tableobject ? bowl ? black-bowl. A task-net specifies what kind of scene information could help with solving a recognition problem but it does not specify how to obtain that information. The twonet is a simpler version of the composite net, and is useful for experimental analysis. The authors then define a number of actions such as moving the camera or applying a simple object detection algorithm. By iteratively choosing the most appropriate action to perform, and updating the probabilities based on the evidence provided by the actions, recognition is achieved. Each action has a cost and profit associated with it. The cost might include the cost of moving a camera and the profit increases if the next action is consistent with the probability table's likelihoods. Three different methods for updating the probabilities are suggested. The dummy-evidence method sets a user specified node in the compositenets and two-nets to a constant value, specifying judgemental values about the node's values. The instantiate-evidence method is set when a specific value of a random variable is observed as true. Finally, the IS-A evidence approach uses the values output by an action to update the IS-A net's probabilities using the likelihood ratios for some evidence e: k = p(ejS)/p(ej:S) where S denotes whether a specific set of nodes in the IS-A tree was detected or not by the action. The cost and profits are used to define a goodness function which is used to select the best next action. A depth first search in the space of all action sequences is used to select the best next action that would minimize the cost and lead to the most likely estimation of the unknown object or variable. The authors perform some tests on the problem of classifying whether a particular tabletop scene corresponds to a fancy or non-fancy meal and present some results on the algorithm's performance as the values of the various costs were adjusted. The method is tested only for recognizing a single 2D scene.</p><p>Wixson and Ballard <ref type="bibr" target="#b300">[303]</ref> present an active object localization algorithm that uses intermediate objects to maximize the effi-Fig. <ref type="figure">32</ref>.

The paper was quite influential and similar ideas are explored in more, recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b301">[304,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b316">319,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b317">320]</ref>. The system by Wixson and Ballard <ref type="bibr" target="#b300">[303]</ref> incorporates some sort of contextual knowledge about the scene by encoding the relation between intermediate objects. Such intermediate objects are usually easy to recognize at low resolutions and are, thus, located quickly. Since we typically have some clues about the target object's location relative to the intermediate object's location, we can use intermediate objects to speed up the search for the target. The authors present a mathematical model of search efficiency that estimates the factors which affect search efficiency, and they use these factors to improve search efficiency. They note that in their experiments, indirect search provided an 8-fold increase in efficiency. As the authors indicate, the higher the resolution needed to accurately recognize an object, the smaller the field of view of the camera has to be-because, for example, we might need to bring the camera closer to the object. However, this forces more mechanical movements of the camera to acquire more views of the scene, which are typically quite time consuming. This indicates a characteristic trade-off in the active localization literature that many researchers in the field have attempted to address, namely, search accuracy vs. total search time.</p><p>In this work the authors speed up the search through the use of intermediate objects. An example is the task of searching for a pencil by first locating a desk-since pencils are usually located on desks. Thus within the context of the standard recognition pipeline in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, this constitutes an effort in improving the feature grouping and object hypothesis generation module, by using intermediate object to influence the grouping probabilities and relevant hypotheses of various objects or object parts. The authors demonstrate the smaller number of images required to detect the pencil if the intermediate object detected was the desk-an almost twothirds decrease. The efficiency of a search is defined as c/T where c is the probability that the search finds the object and T is the expected time to do the search. The authors model direct and indirect search. Direct search (see Figs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref> is a brute force search defined in terms of the random variable R denoting the number of objects detected by our object detection algorithm over a search sequence spanning the search space, in terms of the probability b of detecting a false positive, the number of possible views V for the intermediate object and c j , the average cost for each view j. Usually c j is a constant c for all j. The success probability of indirect search is</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">c dir ¼ ½1 À PðR ¼ 0Þð1 À bÞ ð 15Þ</formula><p>and the expected cost for the direct search is</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">T dir ½PðRÞ; V; c ¼ ðPðR ¼ 0ÞV þ X 1 r¼1 PðR ¼ rÞsð1; r; VÞÞ Â c<label>ð16Þ</label></formula><p>where s(k, r, V) denotes the expected number of images that must be examined before finding k positive responses, given that r positive responses can occur in V images. A close look at the underlying parameters shows that b and P(R) are coupled: If everything else remains constant, a greater number of positive responses-a smaller value of P(R = 0)-causes the expected values of R to be higher, but it also increases b.</p><p>An indirect search model (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">35</ref>) is defined recursively by applying a direct search around the neighborhood indicated by each indirectly detected object. The authors perform a number of tests on some simple scenes using simple object detectors. One type of test they perform, for example, is detecting plates by first detecting tables as intermediate objects. An almost 8-fold increase in detection speed is observed. These mathematical models examine the conditions under which spatial relationships between objects can provide more efficient searches. The models and experiments demonstrate that indirect search may require fewer images/foveations and increases the probability of detecting an object, by making it less likely that we will process irrelevant information. As with most early research, the work is not tested on the large datasets that more recent papers usually are tested on. Nevertheless, the results are consistent with the results presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, regarding the significant speed up of object search that is achieved if we use a purposive search strategy, as compared to random search. We should point out that this paper does not take into account the effects of various cost constraints and dead-reckoning errors. In contrast, it is mostly concentrated on the next-viewplanner while ignoring somewhat the possible effects due to the next-view-planner's synergy with an object detector, in terms of simulating attentional priming effects to speed up the search for example.</p><p>Brunnström et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b302">[305,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b303">306]</ref> present a set of computational strategies for choosing fixation points in a contextual and taskdependent manner. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">37</ref>, a number of junctions are specified, and a grouping strategy for these junctions is specified, where this grouping strategy is dependent on depth discontinuities (determined by a stereo camera), and also affects the sensor's fixation strategy (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The authors present a methodology for determining the junction type present in the image, and argue that this strategy could be quite useful for recognizing an even larger variety of textureless objects.</p><p>Ye and Tsotsos <ref type="bibr" target="#b304">[307]</ref> provide an early systematic study of the problem of sensor planning for 3D object search. The authors propose a sensor planning strategy for a robot that is equipped with a pan, tilt and zoom camera. The authors show that under a particular probability updating scheme, the brute force solution to the problem of object search-maximizing the probability of detecting the target with minimal cost-is NP-Complete and, thus, propose a heuristic strategy for solving this problem. The special case of the problem under Bayesian updating was discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b319">322]</ref>. The search agent's knowledge of object location is encoded as a discrete probability density, and each sensing action is defined by a viewpoint, a viewing direction, a field of view and the application of a recognition algorithm. The most obvious approach to solving this problem is by performing a 360°pan of the scene using wide angle camera settings and searching for the object in this whole scene. However, this might not work well if we are searching for a small object that is relatively far away, since the object might be too small to detect.

They use a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and the Q-learning algorithm to determine the next saccade given the current state, where states are defined as clusters of images representing the same region in the environment. A simple histogram intersection-using color information-is used to match an image I with a template M. If a match is found with a low resolution version of the image, the camera zooms in and obtains a higher resolution image and verifies the matching. If no match is found, (i.e., the desired object is not found), they use the pan tilt unit to direct the camera to the most salient region (saliency is determined by a symmetry operator defined in the paper) located with one of 8 subregions. Choosing the subregion to search within is determined by the MDP and the prior contextual knowledge it has about the room.</p><p>Kawanishi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">[309]</ref> use multiple pan-tilt-zoom cameras to detect known objects in 3D environments. They demonstrate that with multiple cameras the object detection and localization problems can become more efficient (2.5 times faster) and more accurate than with a single camera. The system collects images under various illumination conditions, object views, and zoom rates, which are categorized as reference images for prediction (RIP) and verification (RIV). RIP images are small images that are discriminative for roughly predicting the existence of the object. RIV images are higher resolution images for verifying the existence of objects. For each image region that detected a likely object when using the RIP images, the cameras zoom in, and pan and tilt, in order to verify whether the object was indeed located at that image region.</p><p>More recently, Ekvall et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b307">[310]</ref> integrated a SLAM approach with an object recognition algorithm based on receptive-field co-occurrence histograms.

The range finder is used to detect free space and vision is used to detect the objects. The detection module is based on color histogram information and SIFT features. Color features are used for coarse object detection, and the SIFT features are used for verification of the candidate object's presence. Two planning strategies are proposed. One is for the coarse object detection and one is for the object verification. The object detection planner maximizes a utility function for the next movement, which is based on the increase in the observed area divided by the cost of making this movement. The verification planner proposes a sequence of observations that minimizes the total cost while making it possible to verify all the relevant candidate object detections. Thus, this paper makes certain proposals for improving the object hypothesis and verification module of the standard recognition pipeline (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) by using a utility function to choose the optimal next viewpoint.</p><p>Sjöö et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b312">[315]</ref> present an active search algorithm that uses a monocular camera with zoom capabilities.

For each room, a greedy algorithm is used to select the order in which the room's viewpoints are sensed, so that all possible object locations in the map are sensed. The algorithm uses receptive field co-occurrence histograms to detect potential objects. If potential objects are located, the sensor's zoom settings are appropriately adjusted so that SIFT based recognition is possible. If recognition using SIFT features is not possible, this viewpoint hypothesis is pruned (also see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), and the process is repeated until recognition has been possible for all the possible positions in the room where an object might be located.</p><p>Ma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b313">[316]</ref> use a two-wheeled non-holonomic robot with an actuated stereo camera mounted on a pan-tilt unit, to search for 3D objects in an indoor environment.

A normalized metric for target uniqueness within a single image but also across multiple images of the scene that were captured from different viewpoints, is introduced. This metric provides a robust probability updating methodology. The paper makes certain proposals for building more robust active visual search systems under the presence of various errors. Imperfect disparity estimates, an imperfect recognition algorithm, and dead-reckoning errors, place certain constraints on the conditions chosen for determining when the object of interest has been successfully localized. A combination of mutliple-view recognition and single-view recognition approaches is used to achieve robust and real-time object search in an indoor environment. A hierarchical object recognition architecture, inspired by human vision, is used <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">[218]</ref>. The object training is done by in-hand demonstration and the system is extensively tested on over fourhundred test scenarios. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of using state of the art vision-based robotic systems for efficient and reliable object localization in an indoor 3D environment. This constitutes an example of a neuromorphic vision system applied to robotics, due to the use of (i) a humanoid robot that emulates human locomotion, (ii) the use of a hierarchical feed-forward recognition system inspired by human vision, and (iii) the use of a next-view planner that shares many of the behavioral properties of the ideal searcher <ref type="bibr" target="#b320">[323]</ref>. Within the context of the recognition pipeline in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, this constitutes a proposal for hypothesizing and verifying the objects present in the scene (by adjusting the viewpoint parameters with which the object is sensed) and for extracting and grouping low-level features more reliably based on contextual knowledge about the relative object scale.</p><p>As previously indicated, on average, the scalability of inference for active object localization algorithms is worse than the current state of the art in passive recognition. This is partially attributable to the online requirements of active localization/recognition mechanisms, which make the construction of such real-time and online systems a significant challenge. Furthermore, powerful vision systems implemented on current popular CPU architectures are extremely expensive power-wise. This makes it difficult to achieve the much coveted mobility threshold that is often a necessary requirement of active object localization algorithms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Datasets and evaluation techniques</head><p>Early object recognition systems were for the most part tested on a handful of images. With the exception of industrial inspection related systems, basic research related publications tended to focus on the exposition of novel recognition algorithms, with a lesser focus on actually quantifying the performance of these algorithms. More recently, however, large annotated datasets of images containing a significant number of object classes, have become readily available, precipitating the use of more quantitative methodologies for evaluating recognition systems. Everingham et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b321">[324]</ref> overview the PASCAL challenge dataset, which is updated annually (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">40</ref>). Other popular datasets for testing the performance of object/scene classification and object localization algorithms include the Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets (Fei-Fei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b322">[325]</ref>, Griffin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b323">[326]</ref>), Flickr groups, <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">4</ref> the TRECVID dataset Smeaton et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b324">[327]</ref>, the MediaMill challenge Snoek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b325">[328]</ref>, the Lotus-Hill dataset Yao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b326">[329]</ref>, the ImageCLEF dataset Sanderson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b327">[330]</ref>, the COIL-100 dataset Nene et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b328">[331]</ref>, the ETH-80 Fig. <ref type="figure">38</ref>.

Notice that such offline datasets have almost exclusively been applied to passive recognition algorithms, since active vision systems cannot be easily tested using offline batches of datasets. Testing an active vision system using offline datasets would require an inordinate number of images that sample the entire search space under all possible intrinsic and extrinsic sensor and algorithm parameters. Typically, such systems are initially tested using simple simulations, followed by a significant amount of time that is spent field testing the system.</p><p>A number of metrics are commonly used to provide succinct descriptors of system performance. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are often used to visualize the true positive rate versus the false positive rate of an object detector (see Section 1) as a class label threshold is changed, assuming of course that the algorithm uses such a threshold (note that sometimes in the literature the false positive rate is also referred to as the false accept rate, and the false negative rate is referred to as the false reject rate). In certain cases Detection Error Tradeoff (DET) curves are used to provide a better visualization of an algorithm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b338">[341]</ref>, especially when small probabilities are involved. The equal error rate (EER) corresponds to the false positive value FP achieved when the corresponding ROC curve point maps to a true positive value TP that satisfies FP = 1 À TP. This metric is convenient as it provides a single value of algorithm quality (a lower EER value indicates a better detector). The area under the curve of an ROC curve is also often used as a metric of algorithm quality. The use of the average precision (AP) metric in the more recent instantiations of the PASCAL challenge has also gained acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b321">[324,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b339">342]</ref>: The average precision (AP) is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">AP ¼ 1 jRj X jRj k¼1 c k<label>ð17Þ</label></formula><p>where which output continuous values (e.g., comparing the percentage of overlap between the automated object localization/segmentation with the ground-truth segmentation). See <ref type="bibr" target="#b340">[343]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b341">[344]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b342">[345]</ref> for a discussion on good strategies for annotating datasets and evaluating recognition algorithms. Our discussion on evaluation techniques for recognition algorithms would be incomplete without the presentation of the criticism associated with the use of such datasets. Such criticism is sometimes encountered in the literature or in conferences on vision research (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">[193,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">194,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b343">346]</ref> for example). In other words, the question arises as to how good indicators these datasets and their associated tests are for determining whether progress is being made in the field of object recognition. One argument is that the current state-of-the-art algorithms in object recognition identify correlations in images, and are unable to determine true causality, leading to fragile recognition systems. An example of this problem arose in early research on neural networks, where the task was to train a neural network to determine the presence or absence of a certain vehicle type in images. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">5</ref> The neural network was initially capable of reliably detecting the objects of interest from the images of the original dataset. However, on a new validation dataset of images, the performance dropped drastically. On careful examination it was determined that in the original dataset, the images containing the object of interest had on average a higher intensity. During training, the neural network learned to decide whether the object was present or absent from the image, by calculating this average image intensity and thresholding this intensity value. It is evident that in the original dataset there existed a correlation between average image intensity and the object presence. However in the new dataset this correlation was no longer present, making the recognition system unable to generalize in this new situation that the human visual system is capable of addressing almost effortlessly. It has been argued that only correlation can be perceived from experience, and determining true causality is an impossibility. In medical research the mitigation of such problems is often accomplished through the use of control groups and the inclusion of placebo groups, which allow the scientist to test the effect of a particular drug by also testing the effect of the drug under an approximation of a counter-factual state of the world. However, as experience has shown -and as it is often the case in computer vision research -the results of such controlled experiments, whose conclusions ultimately rely on correlations, are often wrong. <ref type="bibr" target="#b344">[347]</ref> analyses the problem, and provides a number of suggestions as to why this phenomenon occurs, which we quote below:</p><p>The smaller the case studies, the more likely the findings are false. The smaller the effect sizes in a research field, the less likely the research findings are true. For example a study of the impact of smoking on cardiovascular disease will more likely lead to correct results than an epidemiological study that targets a small minority of the population. The greater the number and the lesser the selection of tested relationships in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true. As a result, confirmatory designs such as large controlled trials are more likely true, than the results of initial hypothesis-generating experiments. The greater the flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes and analytical models in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true. For example, flexibility increases the potential of turning ''negative'' results into ''positive'' results. Similarly, fields that use stereotyped and commonly agreed analytical methods, typically result in a larger proportion of true findings. Adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b321">[324]</ref>.</p><p>The greater the financial and other interests and prejudices in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true. As empirical evidence shows, ''expert opinion'' is extremely unreliable. The hotter a scientific field, with more scientific teams involved, the less likely the research findings are true.</p><p>The fact that usually only positive results supporting a particular hypothesis are submitted for publication, while negative results not supporting a particular hypothesis are often not submitted for publication, can make it more difficult to understand the limitations of many methodologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b344">[347]</ref>. Despite these potential limitations, the hard reality is that the use of datasets currently constitutes the most reliable means of testing recognition algorithms. As Pinto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">[193]</ref> indicate, an improvement in evaluation methodologies might entail simulating environments and testing recognition systems on these environments. But of course creating environments that are acceptable by the vision community and which are sufficiently realistic, is a challenging task. As argued in <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, typically offline datasets are pre-screened for good quality in order to eliminate images with saturation effects, poor contrast, or significant noise. Thus, this pre-screening introduces an implicit bias in the imaging conditions of such datasets. In the case of active and dynamic vision systems, which typically sense an environment from a greater number of viewpoints and under more challenging imaging conditions, it becomes more difficult to predict the performance of a vision system by using exclusively such datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Sampling the current state-of-the-art in the recognition literature</head><p>A survey on the object recognition literature that does not attempt to determine what the state-of-the-art is in terms of performance, would be incomplete. To this extent, we present in some detail some of the algorithms for which there is some consensus in the community in terms of them belonging to the top-tier of algorithms that reliably address the object detection, localization and recognition problems (see Section 1). In Chart 9 and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">7</ref> we present a comparison, along certain dimensions, for a number of the papers that will be surveyed in Section 4.2. For the reasons earlier elaborated upon, determining the best performing algorithms remains a difficult problem. In the active and dynamic vision literature there does not currently exist a standardized methodology for evaluating the systems in terms of their performance and search efficiency. However, sporadically, there have been certain competitions (such as the semantic robot vision challenge) attempting to address these questions. Arguably the most popular competition for evaluating passive recognition algorithms is the annual PASCAL challenge. We thus focus our discussion in this section on presenting in some detail the general approaches taken by some of the best performing algorithms in the annual PASCAL challenge for classifying and localizing the objects present in images. In general, good performance on the PASCAL datasets is a necessary condition of a solution to the recognition problem, but it is not a sufficient condition. In other words, good performance on a dataset does not guarantee that we have found a ''solution'', but it can be used as a hint, or a simple guiding principle, for the construction of vision systems, which is why we focus on these datasets in this section. For each annual PASCAL challenge, we discuss some of the best performing algorithms and discuss the reasons as to why the approaches from each year were able to achieve improved performance. These annual improvements are always characterized within the general setting described in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">7</ref> and Chart 9 we notice that the top-ranked PASCAL systems make very little use of 3D object representations. In modern work, 3D is mostly used within the context of robotics and active vision systems (see Tables <ref type="table">5</ref> and<ref type="table">6</ref>). In general, image categorization/classification algorithms (which indicate whether an image contains an instance of a particular object class), are significantly more reliable than object localization algorithms whose task is to localize (or segment) in an image all instances of the object of interest. Good localization performance has been achieved for restricted object classes: in general there still does not exist an object localization algorithm that can consistently and reliably localize arbitrary object classes. As Chum and Zisserman <ref type="bibr" target="#b362">[365]</ref> indicate, image classification algorithms have achieved significant improvements since early 2000, and this is in general attributed to the advent popularity of powerful classifiers and feature representations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Pascal 2005</head><p>We now briefly discuss some of the best performing approaches tested during the 2005 Pascal challenge for the image classification and object localization problems (see Fig. <ref type="figure">41</ref>). This is not meant to be an exhaustive listing of the relevant approaches, but rather to provide a sample of some relatively successful approaches tested over the years. 2005 was the first year of the PASCAL Visual Object Challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b367">[370]</ref>. One of the best performing approaches was presented by Leibe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">[199]</ref>, which we also overviewed in Section 2.9.</p><p>Dalal and Triggs <ref type="bibr" target="#b332">[335]</ref> tested their Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) descriptors in this challenge. In their original paper, Dalal and Triggs focused on the pedestrian localization problem, but over the years HOG-based approaches have become quite popular, and constitute some of the most popular descriptors in the object recognition literature. See Fig. <ref type="figure">42</ref> for an overview of the pipeline proposed by Dalal and Triggs. The authors' experiments suggest that the other best-performing keypoint-based approaches have false positive rates that are at least 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than their presented HOG dense grid approach for human detection. As the authors indicate, the fine orientation sampling and the strong photometric normalization used by their approach, constitute the best strategy for improving the performance of pedestrian detectors, because it enables limbs and body segments to change their position and their appearance (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">43</ref>). The authors evaluated numerous pixel color representations such as greyscale, RGB and LAB color spaces, with and without gamma equalization. The authors also tested various approaches for evaluating gradients, and based on their results the simplest scheme which relied on point-derivatives with Gaussian smoothing gave the best results. The main constituent component of the HOG representation is the orientation binning with normalization that is applied to various descriptor blocks/cells. The cells tested are both rectangular and radial. Orientation votes/histograms are accumulated in each one of those cells. The orientation bins tested are both unsigned (0-180 degrees) and signed (0-360 degrees). The authors choose to use 9 orientation bins since more bins only lead to marginal improvements at best. Furthermore, the authors note that the use of signed orientations decreases performance. The authors also tested various normalization schemes, which mostly entail dividing the cell histograms by the orientation ''energy'' present in a lo-cal neighborhood. The above-described combinations for constructing histograms of orientation were then used in conjunction with linear and non-linear SVMs, achieving state-of-the art performance for pedestrian detection. Note, however, that the system was tested on images where the size of the pedestrians' projection on the image was significant. A final observation that the authors make is that any significant amount of smoothing before gradient calculation degrades the system performance, demonstrating that the most important discriminative information is from sudden changes in the image at fine scales.</p><p>Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref> discuss a number of local-image-feature extraction techniques for texture and object category classification. In conjunction with powerful discriminative classifiers, these approaches have led to top-tier performance in the VOC2005, VOC2006 and VOC2007 competitions. Their work is mostly focused on the problem of classifying an image as containing an instance of a particular object, and is not as much focused on the object localization problem. As we discussed earlier, and as we will discuss in more detail later in this section, a good classifier does not necessarily lead to a good solution to the object localization problem. This is due to the fact that simple brute-force sliding-window approaches to the object localization problem are extremely slow, due to the need to enumerate all possible positions, scales, and aspect ratios of a bounding-box for the object position.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">41</ref>. Documents describing some of the top-ranked algorithms for classifying and localizing objects in the PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenges of 2005-2011. Note that this is not an exhaustive list of the algorithms tested in the VOC challenges: it is simply meant to provide a sample of the most ''distinct'' approaches that have been proven over the years to provide satisfactory results in these challenges. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b368">[371]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b321">[324]</ref> for an overview of the competition and a listing of all the algorithms tested over the years. Fig. <ref type="figure">42</ref>. The pipeline used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b332">[335]</ref>. As Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref> indicate, in the texture recognition problem local features play the role of frequently repeated elements, while in the object recognition problem, these local features play the role of ''words'' which are often powerful predictors of a certain object class. The authors show that using a combination of multiple interest-point detectors and descriptors, usually achieves much better results than the use of a single interest-point detector/ descriptor pair achieves. They also reach the conclusion that using local features/descriptors with the highest possible degree of invariance, does not necessarily lead to the optimal performance. As a result, they suggest that when designing recognition algorithms, only the minimum necessary degree of feature invariance should be used. The authors note that many popular approaches make use of both foreground and background features. They argue that the use of background features could often be seen as a means of providing contextual information for recognition. However, as the authors discover during their evaluation, such background features tend to aid when dealing with ''easy'' datasets, while for more challenging datasets, the use of both foreground and background features does not improve the recognition performance.</p><p>Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref> use affine-invariant versions of two interest point detectors: the Harris-Laplace detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref> which responds to corners, and the Laplace detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b369">[372]</ref> which responds to blob regions (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">44</ref>). These elliptical regions are normalized into circular regions from which descriptors are subsequently extracted. The authors also test these interest-point detectors using scale invariance only, using scale with rotation invariance, and by using affine invariance. As descriptors, the authors investigated the use of SIFT, SPIN, and RIFT descriptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b370">[373,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b371">374]</ref>. The SIFT descriptor was discussed in Section 2.9. The SPIN descriptor is a two dimensional rotation invariant histogram of intensities in a neighborhood surrounding an interest-point, where each histogram cell (d, i) corresponds to the distance d from the center of the region and the weight of intensity value i at that distance. The RIFT descriptor is similar to SIFT and SPIN, where rotation invariant histograms of orientation are created for a number of concentric circular regions centered at each interest point. The descriptors are made invariant to affine changes in illumination, by assuming pixel intensity transformations of the form aI(x) + b at pixel x, and by normalizing those regions with respect to the mean and standard deviation. The authors use various combinations of interest-point detectors, detectors and classifiers to determine the best performing combination. Given training and test images, the authors create a more compact representation of the extracted image features by clustering the descriptors in each image to discover its signature {(p 1 , u 1 ), . . ., (p m , u m )}, where m is the number of clusters discovered by a clustering algorithm, p i is the cluster's center and u i is the fraction of image descriptors present in that cluster. The authors discover that signatures of length 20-40 tend to provide the best results. The Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b372">[375]</ref> is used to define a ''distance'' D(S 1 , S 2 ) between two signatures S 1 , S 2 . The authors also consider the use of mined ''vocabularies/words'' from training sets of images, corresponding to ''clusters'' of common features. Two histograms S 1 = (u 1 , . . . ,u m ), S 2 = (w 1 , . . ., w m ) of such ''words'' can be compared to determine if a given image belongs to a particular object class. The authors use the v 2 distance to compare two such histograms:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">DðS 1 ; S 2 Þ ¼ 1 2 X m i¼1 ðu i À w i Þ 2 u i þ w i<label>ð19Þ</label></formula><p>Image classification is tested on SVMs with linear, quadratic, Radial-Basis-Function, v 2 and EMD kernels, where the v 2 and EMD kernels are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">KðS i ; S j Þ ¼ exp À 1 A DðS i ; S j Þ<label>ð20Þ</label></formula><p>where D(Á, Á) can represent the EMD or v 2 distance and A is a normalization constant. The bias term of the SVM decision function is varied to obtain ROC curves of the various tests performed. The system is evaluated on texture and object datasets. As we have already indicated, the authors discover that greater affine invariance does not necessarily help improve the system performance. The Laplacian detector tends to extract four to five times more regions per image than the Harris-Laplace detector, leading to better performance in the image categorization task, and overall a combination of Harris-Laplace and Laplacian detectors with SIFT and SPIN descriptors. Both the EMD and v 2 kernels seem to provide good and comparable performance. Furthermore, the authors notice that randomly varying/shuffling the backgrounds during training, results in more robust classifiers. Within the context of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> (i.e., the feature-extraction ? feature-grouping ? object-hypotheses ? object-verification ? object-recognition pipeline), we see that the best performing systems of PASCAL 2005 demonstrate how the careful pre-processing during the low level feature extraction phase makes a significant difference in system reliability. Small issues such as the number of orientation bins, the number of scales, or whether to normalize the respective histograms, make a significant difference in system performance. This demonstrates the importance of carefully studying the feature-processing strategies adopted by the winning systems. One could argue that vision systems should not be as sensitive to these parameters. However, the fact remains that current state-of-the-art systems have not reached the level of maturity that would make them robust against such variations in the low-level parameters. Another observation with respect to Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> is that the object representations of the winning systems in PASCAL 2005, were for the most part ''flat'' and made little use of the object hierarchies whose importance we have emphasized in this survey. As we will see, in more recent work, winning systems have made greater use of such hierarchies. Finally, while one could argue that Leibe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">[199]</ref> made use of a generative object hypothesis and verification phase, in general, winning algorithms of PASCAL 2005 were discriminative based, and did not make use of sophisticated modules for implementing the full pipeline of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Pascal 2006</head><p>In addition to the previously described methodologies, a combination of the approaches described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">[263,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b262">264]</ref> was proven successful for many of the object classes tested in VOC2006 (see Fig. <ref type="figure">41</ref>). The presented algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">[263,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b262">264,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b366">369]</ref>) is used both for the VOC challenge's image classification task as well as for the object localization task. In testing their algorithm for the object localization task, the authors consider an object as successfully localized if a 0 &gt; 0.5 where</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">a 0 ¼ areaðB p \ B gt Þ areaðB p [ B gt Þ<label>ð21Þ</label></formula><p>and B gt , B p denote the ground truth and localized image regions. The object classification and localization system tested relies to a large extent on the PicSOM framework for creating self-organizing maps (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">45</ref>). The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b262">[264]</ref> take advantage of the topology preserving nature of the SOM mapping to achieve an image's classification by determining the distance of the image's representation on the grid, from positive and negative examples of the respective object class hypothesis. For the classification task a greedy sequential forward search is performed to enlarge the set of features used in determining the distance metric, until the classification performance stops increasing on the test dataset. The feature descriptors used, include many of the descriptors used in the MPEG-7 standard as well as some non-standard descriptors. The authors experimented with using numerous color descriptors. These include, for example, color histograms in HSV and HMMD color spaces and their moments, as well as color layout descriptors, where the image is split in non-overlapping blocks and the dominant colors in YCbCr space are determined for each block (the corresponding discrete cosine transform coefficients are used as the final descriptors). Furthermore, Fourier descriptors of segment contours are used as features, as well as histograms and co-occurrence matrices of Sobel edge directions. The object localization algorithm relies to a large extent on the use of a simple greedy hierarchical segmentation algorithm that merges regions with high similarity. These regions are provided as input to the classifier, which in turn enables the object localization. Thus, within the context of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> we see that during PASCAL 2006, and as compared to PASCAL 2005, one of the winning systems evolved by making use of a significantly greater number of low level features. Furthermore, the use of a self organizing map by Viitaniemi and Laaksonen <ref type="bibr" target="#b262">[264]</ref> demonstrated that the proper grouping and representation of these features plays a conspicuous role in the best performing algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3.">Pascal 2007</head><p>During the 2007 challenge, the work by Felzenszwalb et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b363">[366]</ref> was tested on a number of object localization challenges. The algorithm's ability to localize various object classes was further demonstrated in subsequent years' competitions, where it consistently achieved good performance for various object classes (see Fig. <ref type="figure">46</ref>). The authors achieved a twofold improvement in the person detection task (as compared to the best performing person detection algorithm from the 2006 Pascal challenge) and for many object classes it outperformed the best results from the 2007 challenge. As the authors point out, there appears to be a performance gap in terms of the performance difference between parts-based Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">45</ref>. The distributions of various object classes corresponding to six feature classes. These results were generated by the self-organizing-map algorithm used in the PicSOM framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">[263]</ref>. Darker map regions represent SOM areas where images of the respective object class have been densely mapped based on the respective feature (from <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">[263]</ref> with permission). van de Weijer and Schmid <ref type="bibr" target="#b365">[368]</ref> expand local feature descriptors by appending to the respective feature vectors photometric invariant color descriptors. These descriptors were tested during the 2007 Pascal competition. The authors survey some popular photometric invariants and test the effects they have in recognition performance. It is demonstrated that for images where color is a highly discriminative feature, such color invariants can be quite useful. However, there is no single color descriptor that consistently gives good results. In other words, the optimal color descriptor to use is application dependent.</p><p>Chum and Zisserman <ref type="bibr" target="#b362">[365]</ref> introduced a model for learning and generating a region of interest around instances of the object, given labeled and unsegmented training images. The algorithm achieves good localization performance in various PASCAL challenges it was tested on. In other words, the algorithm is given as input only images of the object class in question, with no further information on the position, scale or orientation of the object in the image. From this data, an object representation is learnt that is used to localize instances of the object of interest. Given an input or training set of images, a hierarchical spatial pyramidal histogram of edges is created. Also a set of highly discriminative ''words'' is learned from a set of mined appearance patches (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">48</ref>). A cost function that is the sum of the distances between all pairs of training examples is used to automatically learn the object position from an input image. The cost function takes into account the distances between the discriminative words and the edge histograms. A similar procedure, with a number of heuristics, is used to measure the similarity between two images and localize any instances of the target object in an image.</p><p>Ferrari et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b364">[367]</ref> present a family of translation and scaleinvariant feature descriptors composed of chains of k-connected approximately straight contours, referred to as kAS. See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">49</ref> for examples of kAS for k = 2. It is shown that for kAS of intermediate complexity, these fragments have significant repeatability and provide a simple framework for simulating certain perceptual grouping characteristics of the human visual system (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">7</ref>). The authors show that kAS substantially outperform interest points for detecting shape-based classes. Given a vocabulary of kAS, an input image is split into cells, and a histogram of the kAS present in each cell is calculated. An SVM is then used to classify the object present in an image, by using a multiscale sliding window approach to extract the respective SVM input vector that is to be classified. Given an input image, the edges are calculated using the Berkeley edge detector which takes into consideration texture and color cues (in addition to brightness) when determining the objects present in an image. Two extracted edges are ''connected'' if they are only separated by a small gap or if they form a junction. This results in a graph structure. For each edge, a depth-first search is performed, in conjunction with the elimination of equivalent paths, in order to mine candidate kAS. A simple clustering algorithm is used in order to mine clusters of kAS and a characteristic ''word''/kAS for each cluster. In other words, each kAS is an ordered list P = (s 1 , s 2 , . . ., s k ) of edges. For each kAS a ''root'' edge s 1 is determined, and a vector r i ¼ r x i ; r y i À Á of the distance from the midpoint of s 1 to s i is determined. Similarly an orientation h i and length l i is determined for each s i . Thus, the measure used to determine the similarity D(a, b) between two kAS P a , P b is given by Dða</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">; bÞ ¼ w r X k i¼2 r a i À r b i þ w h X k i¼1 D h h a i ; h b i þ X k i¼1 j log l a i =l b i j ð<label>25Þ</label></formula><p>where D h h a i ; h b i 2 ½0; p=2 is the difference between the orientations of the corresponding segments in kAS 'a' and 'b'. As with many algorithms in the literature, the algorithm focuses on building a detector for a single viewpoint. An interesting observation of the authors is that as the resolution of the tiles/cells used to split an input image increases, the spatial localization ability of kAS grows stronger, thus, accommodating for less spatial variability in the object class. This implies that there exists an optimal number of cells, suggesting a tradeoff between optimal localization and tolerance to intraclass variation. The authors also observe that as k increases, the optimal number of cells in which the image is split has to decrease. Notice that this behavior on the part of recognition algorithms is predicted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> where the influence of object class complexity, sensor noise, scene complexity and various time constraints on the capabilities of recognition algorithms are examined Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">47</ref>.

The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b364">[367]</ref> conclude their paper by comparing their object localization algorithm to the algorithm by Dalal and Triggs <ref type="bibr" target="#b332">[335]</ref>, and demonstrating that their algorithm performs favorably.</p><p>Compared to the Pascal competitions from previous years, a push towards the use of more complex hierarchies is evident in Pascal 2007. The use of these hierarchies resulted in improved performance. Despite the belief on the part of many researchers that finding truly universal words/part-based representations has proven a failure so far, their research indicates that for class specific datasets these representations can be of help. Within the context of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, these hierarchies represent a more complex type of feature grouping. Effectively the authors are using similar low level features (e.g., edges, color) and they are grouping them in more complex ways in order to achieve more universal representations of object parts. In terms of object verification and object hypothesizing (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) the work by Felzenszwalb et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b363">[366]</ref> represents the most successful approach tested in Pascal 2007, for using a coarse generative model of object parts to improve recognition performance.</p></div>

For example, knowing the type of image can help improve the localization of certain objects (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">50</ref>). Motivated by the cascade of classifiers proposed by Viola and Jones <ref type="bibr" target="#b226">[227,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b234">235,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b235">236]</ref> (see Section 2.11) the authors propose a low-computational cost linear SVM classifier for preselection of regions, followed by a costly but more reliable non-linear SVM (based on a v 2 kernel) for scoring the final localization output, providing a good trade-off between speed and accuracy. A winning image classifier from VOC 2007 is used for the image classification algorithm. Objects are represented using a combination of shape and appearance descriptors. Shape descriptors consist of HOG descriptors calculated over 40 and 350 overlapping or non-overlapping tiles (the authors compare various approaches for splitting the image into tiles). The appearance descriptors are built using SIFT features that are quantized into ''words'' and calculated over multiple scales. These words are used to construct visual word histograms summarizing the content of each one of the tiles. Tahir et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b359">[362,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b339">342]</ref> propose the use of Spectral Regression combined with Kernel Discriminant Analysis (SR-KDA) for  </p></div>

In contrast to their earlier work, they now use stochastic gradient descent to perform the latent SVM training. Furthermore, they investigate the use of PCA-based dimensionality reduction techniques to transform the object representation vectors and obtain lower dimensional vectors for representing the image cells. They also introduce the use of contextual knowledge to improve object localization performance. They achieve this by obtaining the set of localizations from k detections, thus constructing a related ''context'' vector from these scores, and then using this vector in conjunction with a quadratic-kernel based SVM to rescore the images. The authors test their algorithm on various PASCAL challenge datasets, achieving comparatively excellent performance.</p><p>Vedaldi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b353">[356]</ref> investigate the use of a combination of kernels, where each kernel corresponds to a different feature channel (such as bag of visual words, dense words, histograms of oriented edges and self-similarity features). The use of combinations of multiple kernels results in excellent performance, demonstrating that further research on kernel methods has a high likelihood of further improving the performance of vision systems. Similarly to the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b357">[360,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b358">361]</ref>, the authors use a cascade of progressively more costly but more accurate kernels (linear, quasi-linear and non-linear kernels) to efficiently localize the objects. However, as the authors note, further work could be done to reduce the computational complexity of the framework. This algorithm also results in comparatively excellent results on the PASCAL datasets it was tested on.</p><p>Similarly, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b354">[357]</ref> present the Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC) approach for obtaining sparse representations of scenes. These sparse bases are obtained through the projection of the data onto various local coordinate frames. Linear weight combinations of these bases are used to reconstruct local descriptors. The authors also propose a fast approximation to LLC which speeds up the LLC computations significantly. An SVM is used to classify the resulting images' descriptors, achieving top-ranked performance when tested with various benchmarks.</p><p>Khan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b355">[358,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b356">359]</ref> attempt to bridge the gap between the bottom-up bags-of-words paradigms which have been quite successful in the PASCAL challenges, by incorporating a top-down attention mechanism that can selectively bias the features extracted in an image based on their dominant color (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">51</ref>). As the authors point out, the two main approaches for fusing color and shape information into a bag-of-words representation is via  early fusion (where joint shape-color descriptors are used) and via late fusion (where histogram representations of color and shape are simply concatenated). Given separate vocabularies for shape and color, each training image's corresponding color histogram is estimated and a class specific posterior p(classjword) is estimated. By concatenating the posteriors for all the color words of interest, the corresponding low-level features are primed. Difference of Gaussian detectors, Harris Laplace detectors and SIFT descriptors are used to obtain the shape descriptors. The Color Name and HUE descriptor are used as color descriptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b365">[368,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b373">376,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b374">377]</ref>. A standard v 2 SVM is used for classifying images. These top-down approaches are compared to early-fusion based approaches that combine SIFT descriptors with color descriptors, and which are known to perform well <ref type="bibr" target="#b375">[378]</ref>. It is shown that for certain types of images the top-down priming can result in drastic classification improvements.</p><p>Within the context of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, it is evident that during Pascal 2009 there was a significant shift towards more complex object representations and more complex object inference and verification algorithms. This is evidenced by the incorporation of top down priming mechanisms, complex kernels that incorporate contextual knowledge, as well as by novel local sparse descriptors which achieved top-ranked performance. Consistent in all this work is the preference in using SVMs for contextual classification, model building during training, as well as object recognition, demonstrating that the use of SVMs has become more subtle and less monolithic compared to early recognition algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.6.">Pascal 2010</head><p>Perronnin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b351">[354]</ref> present an extension of their earlier work <ref type="bibr" target="#b361">[364]</ref>, which we have already described in this section. The modifications they introduce, result in an increase of over 10% in the average precision. An interesting aspect of this work is that during the 2010 challenge the work was also trained on its own dataset (non-VOC related) and subsequently tested successfully on various tasks, demonstrating the algorithm's ability to generalize. The authors achieve these results by using linear classifiers. This last point is important since linear SVMs have a training cost of OðNÞ, while non-linear SVMs have a training cost of around OðN 2 Þ to OðN 3 Þ, where N is the number of training images. Thus, training non-linear SVMs becomes impractical with tens of thousands of training images. The authors achieve this improvement in their results by normalizing the respective gradient vectors first described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b361">[364]</ref>. Another problem with the gradient representation is the sparsity of many vector dimensions. As a result the authors apply to each dimension a function f(z) = sign(z)jzj a for some a 2 [0, 1], which results in a significant classification improvement.</p><p>A number of other novel ideas were tested within the context of the 2010 Pascal challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b348">[351,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b349">352,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b350">353,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b352">355]</ref> . van de Sande et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b348">[351]</ref> proposed a selective search algorithm for efficiently searching within a single image, without having to exhaustively search the entire image (see Sections 2.11, 3.2 for more related work). They achieve this by adopting segmentation as a selective search strategy, so that rather than aiming for a few accurate object localizations, they generate more approximate object localizations, thus placing a higher emphasis on high recall rates. A novel objectclass-specific part representations was also introduced for human pose estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b349">[352,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b350">353]</ref>. It achieved state-of-the-art performance for localizing people, demonstrating the significance of properly choosing the object representations.</p><p>Overall, in the top-ranked systems of Pascal 2010 there is evidence of an effort to mitigate the effects of training set biases. This has motivated Perronnin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b351">[354]</ref> to test the generalization ability of their system even when trained on a non-Pascal related data- corresponds to ways of improving the hypothesis generation and object verification process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.7.">Pascal 2011</head><p>Zhu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b345">[348]</ref> present an incremental concave-convex procedure (iCCP) which enables the authors to efficiently learn both two and three layer object representations. The authors demonstrate that their algorithm outperforms the model by Felzenszwalb et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b360">[363]</ref>. These results are used by the authors as evidence that deep-structures (3-layers) are better than 2-layer based object representations (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">52</ref>). The authors begin their exposition by describing the task of structural SVM learning. Let (x 1 , y 1 , h 1 ), . . ., ðx N ; y N ; h N Þ 2 X Â Y Â H denote training samples where the x i are training patches, the y i are class labels, and h i ¼ ðV i ;p i Þ with V i denoting a viewpoint and pi denoting the positions of object parts. In other words, the h i encode the spatial arrangement of the object representation. In structural SVM learning the task is to learn a function F w (x) = argmax y, h [w Á U(x, y, h)] where U is a joint feature vector encoding the relation between the input x and the structure (y, h). In practice U encodes spatial and appearance information similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b360">[363]</ref>. If the structure information h is not labeled in the training set (as the case usually is since in training data we are customarily only given the bounding box of the object of interest and not part-relation information) then, we deal with the latent structural SVM problem, where we need to solve min</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">w 1 2 kwk 2 þ C X N i¼1 ½max y;h ½w Á U i;y;h þ L i;y;h À max h ½w Á U i;y i ;h<label>ð26Þ</label></formula><p>where C is a constant penalty value, U i,y,h = U(x i , y, h) and L i,y,h = L(y i , y, h) is the loss function which is equal to 1 iff y i = y. The authors use some previous results from the latent structural SVM training literature: By splitting the above expression in two terms, they iteratively find a hyperplane (a function of w) which bounds the last max term (which is concave in terms of w), replace the max term with this hyperplane, solve the resulting convex problem, and repeat the process. This trains the model and enables the authors to use F w to localize objects in an image, achieving comparatively excellent results. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">[349]</ref> present a similar latent hierarchical model which is also solved using a concave-convex procedure, and whose results are comparable to other state of the art algorithms. The latent-SVM procedure is again used to learn the hierarchical object representation. A top-down dynamic programming algorithm is used to localize the objects. Song et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b347">[350]</ref> present a paper on using context to improve image classification and object localization performance when we are dealing with ambiguous situations where methodologies that do not use context tend to fail (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">53</ref>). The authors report top-ranked results on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2010 datasets. In more detail, the authors present the Contextualized Support Vector Machine. In general, SVM based classification assumes the use of a fixed hyperplane w T 0 Á x f þ b ¼ 0. Given an image X i specific feature vector x f i and image specific contextual information vector x c i the authors adapt the vector w 0 into a vector w i ¼ Px c i þ w 0 that is based on x c i and a transformation matrix P. Matrix P ¼ P R r¼1 u r Á q T r is constrained as a low rank matrix with few parameters and as a result w i ¼ w 0 þ P R r¼1 q T r x c i À Á Á u r Thus, the SVM margin of image X i is c i ¼ y i w T</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">0 x f i þ P R r¼1 q T r x c i À Á Á u T r x f i þ b</formula><p>where y i 2 {À1, 1} is a class label. The authors define each vector u r so that for unambiguous features x f i , the scalar u T r x f i takes a small value close to 0, in which case c i % y i w T 0 x f i þ b . Thus, only for ambiguous images is contextual knowledge used. The context vector length is equal to the number of objects we are searching for, and is built using a straightforward search for the highest confidence location in an image of each one of those objects. The authors specify an iterative methodology for adapting these vectors w i until satisfactory performance is achieved. The significant improvements that this methodology offers demonstrate how important context is in the object recognition problem. Overall, in one of the top-ranked approaches of Pascal 2011, Zhu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b345">[348]</ref> demonstrated that even deeper hierarchies are achievable. They showed that such hierarchies can provide even better results than another top-ranked Pascal competition algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b360">[363]</ref>. Within the context of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the work by Zhu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b345">[348]</ref> provides an approach for building deeper hierarchies which affect the grouping, hypothesis generation and verification modules of the standard recognition pipeline. Song et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b347">[350]</ref> provided an elegant way for adaptively controlling the object hypothesis module, by using context as an index that adaptively selects a different classifier that is appropriate for the current context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">The evolving landscape</head><p>In 1965, Gordon Moore stated that the number of transistors that could be incorporated per integrated circuit would increase exponentially with time <ref type="bibr" target="#b376">[379,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b377">380]</ref>. This provided one of the earliest technology roadmaps for semiconductors. Even earlier, Engelbart <ref type="bibr" target="#b378">[381]</ref> made a similar prediction on the miniaturization of circuitry. Engelbart would later join SRI and found the Augmentation Research Center (ARC) which is widely credited as a pioneer in the creation of the modern Internet era computing, due to the center's early proposals for the mouse, videoconferencing, interactive text editing, hypertext and networking <ref type="bibr" target="#b379">[382]</ref>. As Engelbart would later point out, it was his early prediction on the rapid increase of computational power that convinced him on the promise of the research topics later pursued by his ARC laboratory. The early identification of trends and shifts in technology, can provide a competitive edge for any individual or corporation. The question arises as to whether we are currently entering a technological shift of the same scope and importance as the one identified by Moore and Engelbart fifty years ago.</p><p>For all intents and purposes, Moore's law is coming to an end. While Moore's law is still technically valid, since multicore technologies have enabled circuit designers to inexpensively pack more transistors on a single chip, this no longer leads to commensurate increases in application performance. Moore's law has historically provided a vital technology roadmap that influenced the agendas of diverse groups in academia and business. Today, fifty years after the early research on object recognition systems, we are simultaneously confronted with the end to Moore's law and with a gargantuan explosion in multimedia data growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b252">[253]</ref>. Fundamental limits on processing speed, power consumption, reliability and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">53</ref>.

It is becoming clear that traditional von-Neumann architectures are becoming unsuitable for human-level intelligence tasks, such as vision, since the machine complexity in terms of the number of gates and their power requirements tends to grow exponentially with the size of the input and the environment complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b381">[384,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b380">383]</ref>. The question for the near future is that of determining to what extent the end to Moore's law will lead to a significant evolution in vision research that will be capable of accommodating the shifting needs of industry. As the wider vision community slowly begins to address this fact, it will define the evolution of object recognition research, it will influence the vision systems that remain relevant, and it will lead to significant changes in vision and computer science education in general by affecting other related research areas that are strongly dependent on vision (such as robotics).</p><p>According to the experts responsible for the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors <ref type="bibr" target="#b381">[384]</ref>, the most promising future strategy for chip and system design is that of complementing current information technology with low-power computing systems inspired by the architecture of the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b380">[383]</ref>. How would von-Neumann architectures compare to a non-von-Neumann architecture that emulates the organization of the organic brain? The two architectures should be suitable for complementary applications. The complexity of neuromorphic architectures should increase more gradually with increasing environment complexity, and it should tolerate noise and errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b380">[383]</ref>. However, such neuromorphic architectures would likely not be suitable for high precision numerical analysis tasks. Modern von-Neumann computing precipitates the need for a program that relies on synchronous, serial, centralized, hardwired, general purpose and brittle circuits <ref type="bibr" target="#b382">[385]</ref>. The brain architecture on the other hand relies on neurons and synapses operating in a mixed digital-analog mode, is asynchronous, parallel, fault tolerant, distributed, slow, and with a blurred distinction between CPU and memory (as compared to von-Neumann architectures) since the memory is, to a large extent, represented by the synaptic weights.</p><p>How does our current understanding of the human brain differentiate it from typical von-Neumann architectures? Turing made the argument that since brains are computers then brains are computable ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b383">[386]</ref>). But if that is indeed the case, why do reliable image understanding algorithms still elude us? Churchland <ref type="bibr" target="#b384">[387]</ref> and Hawkins <ref type="bibr" target="#b385">[388]</ref> argue that general purpose AI is difficult because (i) computers must have a large knowledge base which is difficult to construct, and because (ii) it is difficult to extract the most relevant and contextual information from such a knowledge base. As it was demonstrated throughout our discussion on object recognition systems, the problem of efficient object representations and efficient feature extraction constitutes a central tenet of any non-trivial recognition system, which supports the viewpoint of Churchland and Hawkins.</p><p>There is currently a significant research thrust towards the construction of neuromorphic systems, both at the hardware and the software level. This is evidenced by recent high-profile projects, such as EU funding of the human brain project with over a billion Euros over 10 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b380">[383]</ref>, US funding for the NIH BRAIN Initiative <ref type="bibr" target="#b386">[389]</ref>, and by the growing interest in academia and industry for related projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b387">[390]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b388">[391]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b389">[392]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b390">[393]</ref><ref type="bibr">[394]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b391">[395]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b392">[396]</ref><ref type="bibr">[397]</ref>. The appeal of neuromorphic architectures lies in <ref type="bibr" target="#b393">[398]</ref> (i) the possibility of such architectures achieving human like intelligence by utilizing unreliable devices that are similar to those found in neuronal tissue, (ii) the ability of neuromorphic strategies to deal with anomalies, caused by noise and hardware faults for example, and (iii) their low-power requirements, due to their lack of a power intensive bus and due to the blurring of a distinction between CPU and memory.</p><p>Vision and object recognition should assume a central role in any such research endeavor. About 40% of the neocortex is devoted to visual areas V1, V2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b385">[388]</ref>, which in turn are devoted just to low-level feature extraction. It is thus reasonable to argue that solving the general AI problem is similar in scope to solving the image understanding problem (see Section 1). Current hardware and software architectures for vision systems are unable to scale to the massive computational resources required for this task. The elegance of the solution to the vision problem is astounding. The human neocortex consists of 80% of the human brain, which has around 100 billion neurons and 10 14 synapses, consumes just 20-30 Watts, and is to a large extent self trained <ref type="bibr" target="#b394">[399]</ref>. One of the most astounding results in neuroscience is attributable to Mountcastle <ref type="bibr" target="#b395">[400,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b385">388,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b396">401]</ref>. By investigating the detailed anatomy of the neocortex, he was able to show that the micro-architecture of the regions looks extremely similar regardless of whether a region is for vision, hearing or language. Mountcastle proposed that all parts of the neocortex operate based on a common principle, with the cortical column being the unit of computation. What distinguishes different regions is simply their input (whether their input is vision based, auditory based etc.). From a machine learning perspective this is a surprising and puzzling result, since the no-free-lunch theorem, according to which it is best to use a problem specific optimization/learning algorithm, permeates much of the machine learning research. In contrast the neocortex seems to rely on a single learning architecture for all its tasks and input modalities. Looking back at the object recognition algorithms surveyed in this paper, it becomes clear that no mainstream vision system comes close to achieving the generalization abilities of the neocortex. This sets the stage for what may well become one of the most challenging and rewarding scientific endeavors of this century.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented a critical overview of the object recognition literature, pointed out some of the major challenges facing the community and emphasized some of the characteristic approaches attempted over the years for solving the recognition problem. We began the survey by discussing how the needs of industry led to some of the earliest industrial inspection and character recognition systems. It is pleasantly surprising to note that despite severe limitations in CPU speeds and sensor quality, such early systems were astoundingly accurate, thus contributing to the creation of the field of computer vision, with object recognition assuming a central role. We pointed out that recognition systems perform well in controlled environments but have been unable to generalize in less controlled environments. Throughout the survey we have discussed various proposals set forth by the community on possible causes and solutions to this problem. We continued by surveying some of the characteristic classical approaches for solving the problem. We then discussed how this led to the realization that more control over the data acquisition process is needed. This realization contributed to the popularity of active and attentive systems. We noted how this led to a stronger confluence between the vision and robotics community and surveyed some relevant systems. We continued the survey by discussing some common testing strategies and fallacies that are associated with recognition systems. We concluded by discussing in some depth some of the most successful recognition systems that have been openly tested in various object recognition challenges. As we alluded in the previous section, titillating evidence from neuroscience indicates that there is an elegant solution to the vision problem that should also be capable of spanning the full AI problem (e.g., voice recognition, reasoning, etc.), thus providing the necessary motivation for a radical rethinking of the strategies used by the community in tackling the problem.</p><p>In Tables 1-7 we compared some of the more distinct recognition algorithms along a number of dimensions which characterize each algorithm's ability to bridge the so-called semantic gap: the inability of less complex but easily extractable indexing primitives, to be grouped/organized so that they provide more high-level and more powerful indexing primitives. This dilemma has directly or indirectly influenced much of the literature (also see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). This is exemplified, for example, by CBIR systems which rely on low-level indexing primitives for efficiency reasons. This is also exemplified by the fact that no recognition system has consistently demonstrated graceful degradation as the scene complexity increases, as the number of object classes increases, and as the complexity of each object class increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. While there is significant success in building robust exemplar recognition systems, the success in building generic recognition systems is questionable. Furthermore, from Tables 1-7 we notice that few papers have attempted to address to a large extent all the dimensions of robust recognition systems. For example, in more recent systems, the role of 3D parts-based representations has significantly diminished. Within this context, active recognition systems were proposed as an aid in bridging the semantic gap, by adding a greater level of intelligence to the data acquisition process. However, in practice, and as it is exemplified from Tables <ref type="table">5</ref> and<ref type="table">6</ref>, very few such systems currently address the full spectrum of recognition sub-problems. As the role of the desktop computer is diminished and the role of mobile computing becomes more important, a commensurate increase in the importance of power-efficient systems emerges. A power-efficient solution to the recognition problem precipitates significant advancements to all of the above mentioned problems.</p><p>Within the context of the vision problem, recognition constitutes the most difficult but also the most rewarding problem, since most vision problems can be reformulated in terms of the recognition problem (albeit perhaps not as efficiently). Some general comments are in place. The recognition and vision problem is highly interdisciplinary, spanning the fields of machine learning and decision making under uncertainty, robotics, signal processing, mathematics, statistics, psychology, neuroscience, HCI, databases, supercomputing and visualization/graphics. The highly interdisciplinary nature of the problem is both an advantage and a disadvantage. It is an advantage due to the vast research opportunities it gives to the experienced vision practitioner. It is a disadvantage because the diversity of the field makes it all the more pertinent that the practitioner is careful and sufficiently experienced in identifying research that can advance the field.</p><p>Based on the above survey, we reach a number of conclusions: (i) The solution to the recognition problem will require significant advances in the representation of objects, the inference and learning algorithms used, as well as the hardware platforms used to execute such systems. In general, artificial recognition systems are still far removed from the elegance, and generalization capabilities that solutions based on the organic brain are endowed with. (ii) The issue of bridging the semantic gap between low level image features and high level object representations keeps re-emerging in the literature. Such low-level indexing primitives are easy to extract from images but are often not very powerful indexing primitives (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). In contrast high level object representations are significantly more powerful indexing primitives, but efficiently learning object models based on such primitives, and extracting such primitives from images, remains a difficult problem. The dilemma of indexing strength vs. system efficiency permeates the recognition literature and plays a decisive role in the design of commercial systems, such as Content Based Image Retrieval systems. (iii) A parts-based hierarchical modeling of objects will almost certainly play a central role in the problem's solution and the bridging of the semantic gap. While such models have shown some success in distinguishing between a small number of classes, they generally fail as the scene complexity increases, as the number of object classes increases and as the similarity between the object classes increases. (iv) For each neuron in the neocortex there correspond on average 10,000 synapses, thus demonstrating that there is a significant gap in terms of the input size and the computational resources needed to reliably process the input. Active and attentive approaches can help vision systems cope with many of the intractable aspects of passive approaches to the vision problem by reducing the complexity of the input space. An active approach to vision can help solve real world problems such as degeneracies, occlusions, varying illumination and extreme variations in object scale.</p><p>A great deal of the research on passive recognition has focused, to some extent, on the feature selection stage of the recognition problem without taking into consideration the effects of various cost constraints discussed in the paper. Virtually all the research on active object recognition has only attempted to optimize a small number of extrinsic camera parameters while assuming that the recognition algorithm is a rather static black box. More work on investigating the confluence of the two sets of parameters could potentially lead to more efficient search strategies. Finally, the survey has supported the view that the computational complexity of vision algorithms must constitute a central guiding principle during the construction of such systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 5 .</head><label>5</label><figDesc>Fig.5.

The authors point out that a strong point of their paper is the demonstration that parts-based methods are capable of bridging this performance gap. The system is based on shifting a scanning window over the input image in order to fit the target object representation on the input image. The object representation consists of a root and a single level of subparts. A deformation cost is defined for the subpart windows' deformations/positions with respect to the root window position (see Fig. <ref type="figure">47</ref>). The score of the placement of an object representation placement is the sum of the scores of all the windows. A latent variable SVM is used during the training process, where the latent variable is used to learn a set of filter parameters (F 0 , F 1 , . . ., F n ) and deformation parameters (a 1 , b 1 , . . ., a n , b n ). For each input image and any subpart deformation z, a vector of HOG features (H) and subpart displacements w(H, z) is extracted. The score of positioning an object representation on an image using arrangement z, is given by the dot product b Á w(H, z), where b = (F 0 , F 1 , . . ., F n , a 1 , b 1 , . . ., a n , b n ).</p><p>In more detail, the authors define a latent SVM as</p><p>where b Á w(x, z) is the score of positioning the object representation according to deformation z, and Z(x) denotes all possible deformations of the object representation. Given a training dataset D = (hx 1 , y 1 i, . . ., hx n , y n i) (where x i denotes the ith HOG pyramid vector and y i 2 {À1, 1} denotes a label), the authors attempt to find the optimal vector b ⁄ (D) which is defined as</p><p>Notice, however, that due to the existence of positive labeled examples (y i = 1), this is not a convex optimization problem. As a result the authors execute the following loop a number of times: (i) Keep b fixed and find the optimal latent variable z i for the positive example. This dataset is iteratively solved using the methodologies above in order to find the filter representations for the entire object and its subparts.The authors decide to use six subparts since this leads to the best performance. Perronnin and Dance <ref type="bibr" target="#b361">[364]</ref> use the Fisher kernel for image categorization. The authors extract a gradient vector from a generative probability of the extracted image features (local SIFT and RGB statistics). These gradient vectors are then used in a discriminative classifier. An SVM and a logistic regression classifier with a Laplacian prior is tested. They both perform similarly. The authors indicate that historically, even on databases containing very few object classes, the best performance is achieved when using large vocabularies with hundreds or thousands of visual words. However, the use of such high-dimensional histogram computations can have a high associated computational cost. Often the vocabularies extracted from a training image dataset are not universal, since they tend to be tailored to the particular object categories being learnt. The authors indicate that an important goal in vision research is to discover truly universal vocabularies, as we already discussed in Section 2. However, the lack of significant progress in this problem, has caused some researchers to abandon this idea. In more detail, given a set of visual words X = {x 1 , x 2 , . . ., x T } extracted from an image, a probability distribution function p(Xjk) with parameters k is calculated. In practice, this pdf is modeled as a Gaussian Mixture Model. Given the Fisher information matrix</p><p>the authors obtain the corresponding normalized gradient vectors F À 1 2 k r k pðXjkÞ. The authors derive analytical expressions for these gradients with respect to the mean, variance and weight associated with each one of the Gaussians in the mixture that model this probability. These gradients were used to train powerful classifiers, which provided state-of-the-art image classification performance on the Pascal datasets. Viitaniemi and Laaksonen <ref type="bibr" target="#b263">[265]</ref> overview a general approach for image classification, object localization, and object segmentation. The methodology relies on the fusion of multiple classifiers. The authors report the slightly counter-intuitive observation that while their approach provides the best performing segmentation results, and some of the best image classification results, the approach is unable to provide the best object localization results.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b363">[366]</ref> localizing a person using the coarse template representation and the higher resolution subpart templates of the person (from <ref type="bibr" target="#b363">[366]</ref> with permission).</p></div>			</div>
