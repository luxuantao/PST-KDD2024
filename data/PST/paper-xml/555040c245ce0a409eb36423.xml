<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Recently, compressive sensing-based encryption methods which combine sampling, compression and encryption together have been proposed. However, since the quantized measurement data obtained from linear dimension reduction projection directly serve as the encrypted image, the existing compressive sensing-based encryption methods fail to resist against the chosen-plaintext attack. To enhance the security, a block cipher structure consisting of scrambling, mixing, S-box and chaotic lattice XOR is designed to further encrypt the quantized measurement data. In particular, the proposed method works efficiently in the parallel computing environment. Moreover, a communication unit exchanges data among the multiple processors without collision. This collision-free property is equivalent to optimal diffusion. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed encryption method not only achieves the remarkable confusion, diffusion and sensitivity but also outperforms the existing parallel image encryption methods with respect to the compressibility and the encryption speed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Background</head><p>Nowadays, multimedia data have been widely spread through the Internet. Since the private data are particularly vulnerable to eavesdropping during the data transmission, the confidentiality is required for such applications as Internet conference, Internet security camera, live TV, video-on-demand and telemedicine. Various encryption standards like DES, AES, RSA and IDEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> have been developed and widely used as a protection against illegal access to the private textual information. However, conventional text encryption method is not directly appropriate for multimedia data due to the following three reasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. First, the image size is always larger than that of text. Thus, the time consumption of image encryption and decryption greatly increase according to the image size. Second, the contour of original image still appears in its encrypted image because the conventional cryptography methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> fail to eliminate the considerable amount of perceptual redundancy. For example, the resulting image which is directly encrypted by AES (ECB mode) is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b</ref>). As can be observed, the corresponding encrypted image is still intelligible to some extent <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. Third, an exact decryption of textual data is required while that is not always necessary for image decryption. In many applications, a decrypted image preserving its original semantic information is acceptable. In addition, due to the large amounts of multimedia data, it is usually desired to implement compression prior to transmission especially under the circumstance of limited storage resource or transmission bandwidth.</p><p>Compressive Sensing (CS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> is a newly emerged sampling-reconstruction technique which reduces the sampling rate at the expense of a complex reconstruction on the recipient. To sum up, the essence of CS is to randomly downsample the original data, and to search the optimal solution of an underdetermined linear system for reconstruction. A more detail introduction of CS is given in section 2. CS-based magnetic resonance imaging is a representative application with the potential for significant scan time reductions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In this paper, we propose a parallel image encryption method which is well geared towards the CS circumstance. Our proposal fulfills optimal diffusion owing to dimension adjustability of the CS framework. It is worthwhile to mention that the proposed method caters to the requirement of compression prior to transmission by encrypting an image in its dimension reduction space. In this sub-section, we survey existing works related to CS-based encryption and parallel image encryption methods. Comparative studies are conducted in the performance evaluation section taking these related methods as competitors.</p><p>The compression-combined encryption methods based on CS were proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. Sampling and compression were combined together through a linear dimension reduction measurement process. Moreover, the randomness of measurement matrix rendered the measurement data unintelligible. This implied that encryption was also completed as a by-product.</p><p>Rachlin and Baron <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> demonstrated that, from the perspective of ciphertext-only attack, although the CS-based encryption method could not achieve the perfect security, cracking the secret key required prohibitive time complexity. Orsdemir et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> proposed a notion named as robust encryption. As the terminology suggests, the encrypted image was tolerant of noise contamination. The security analysis covered the resistance against the brute force and structured attacks. They claimed that the computational intractability made attacks infeasible in practice. Facing the unavoidable problem of packet loss during wireless transmission, Liu, Gao and et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> quantified the anti-packet loss ability of the CS-based encryption method. Although all above CS-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> can provide encrypted images without leaking any visual contour, the absence of the diffusion mechanism leaves a door widely open for the chosen-plaintext attack. This loophole is analyzed in the section 3.</p><p>Parallel image encryption had also spurred a great deal of research activities due to the promising high speed encryption. Mirzaei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proposed a parallel image encryption method. Image segmentation stage produced four sub-images, and then exchanged their positions. Pixel permutation was governed by a total shuffling matrix while parallel gray value substitution depended on the joint states of two chaotic systems. However, their method lacked of the diffusion mechanism, and thus the security was vulnerable in terms of the chosen-plaintext attack. Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> invented a parallel image encryption structure involving a well designed communication unit which exchanged data among multiple processors. Their method solved the intrinsic contradiction between parallelism and diffusivity. The experimental results exhibited that the full diffusion could be achieved after three rounds of encryption. Liao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> imitated the self-adaptive encryption <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and proposed a parallel method based on the property that waveform of a sine wave was sensitive to its three parameters: amplitude, wavelength and distance. Their encryption method could achieve the full diffusion profiting from a similar communication unit. As usual cases, at least three rounds of encryption were essential. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Challenging issues</head><p>We summarize three challenge issues and list them as follows.</p><p>(1) The CS-based encryption methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> merely survive against the ciphertextonly attack due to the absence of a diffusion process. The first challenging issue is how to enhance the security for resisting against the chosen-plaintext attack.</p><p>(2) The necessary round of encryption is usually regarded as a significant performance criterion since repeated iteration operations undermine the computational efficiency.</p><p>The second challenging issue is how to decrease the necessary round<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> while retaining full confusion and diffusion performance. (3) An additional requirement, namely computation and communication load balance among multiple processors, arises from the parallel structure. Specifically, if and only if each processor is allocated by balance unit throughput,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> the whole system can work concertedly, otherwise processors with lightweight unit throughput have to wait for the ones allocated by heavy unit throughput. The third challenging issue is how to balance the workload so that all processors share a fair unit throughput.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Our contribution</head><p>In this paper, we aim at the loophole of previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>, and propose a parallel encryption method well geared towards the compressive sampling. We highlight contributions and list them as follows.</p><p>(1) For security enhancement, the proposed encryption method works under a two-stage mode. The first stage, akin to the previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>, compressively samples an image in parallel. In the second stage, the diffusion process is introduced by iteratively implementing permutation, substitution, block-wise exclusive-or (XOR) operation and communication. Our proposal enhances the security in terms of resisting against the chosen-plaintext attack. (2) The proposed communication unit yields the collision-free data exchange which is equivalent to optimal diffusion. Benefiting from the dimension adjustability mechanism, our proposal can achieve the optimal diffusion independent of the aspect ratio of original image. (3) To avoid discussing the optimal scheduling problem, we assume that each processor has the same processing capacity. On the basis of this assumption, the unit throughput of each processing is balanced as long as multiple processors share equal workload. As discussed later, the balanced workload allocation problem becomes equivalent to the achievement of collision-free data exchange. Therefore, the additional requirement given in challenging issues (3) is no longer intractable, and can be satisfied independent of the aspect ratio.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the compressive sensing in brief. Section 3 analyzes the loophole of previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> in terms of the chosen-plaintext attack. Section 4 will be devoted to elaborating the proposed encryption method. In Section 5, the quantitative experiment results are exhibited, and we draw the conclusion in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Compressive sensing overview</head><p>Compressive sensing, also known as compressive sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, can sample a sparse or compressible signal below the Nyquist rate. CS has been generally recognized as a high speed signal acquisition technique. The prerequisite for a successive reconstruction is that the original signal should be sparse. Intuitively, most natural images are not simple in the spatial domain. Fortunately, the sparse representation of an image can be derived from various decomposition algorithms such as Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) or overcomplete basis transform <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Suppose that x is a signal with length N. We deal with image data by first vectorizing it into one-dimension vector. For simplicity, assume that {ψ i }(i=1,⋯,N) is a normal orthonormal basis in ℝ N . Basis matrix with the ψ i as columns is denoted by Ψ. The decomposition coefficient s is the equivalent representation of x in Ψ domain. If only K entries of s are non-zero, where K≪N, x is termed as K-sparse signal. The linear measurement process can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y ¼ Φx ¼ ΦΨs ¼ Θs<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where Φ is the M×N measurement matrix, and y stands for the measurement data with length M (M&lt;N). The sensor matrix Θ is the product of Φ and Ψ.</p><p>Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> describes M×N inner products between x and M rows of Φ. The asymmetric size of measurement matrix results in an ill-posed problem with respect to the reconstruction, which means Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) has infinitely many solutions. To simplify this problem, a necessary and sufficient condition has been proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, namely Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), which can be cast as follow:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">1 À " K ð Þ s k k 2 Θs k k 2 1 þ " K ð Þ s k k 2</formula><p>We loosely say that a matrix Θ obeys the RIP of order K if ε K is not too close to one. If the RIP holds, a steady solution can be obtained from the above underdetermined system. A more intuitive equivalent condition requires that the measurement matrix Φ must be incoherent with the basis matrix Ψ. Specifically, it means that the rows {ϕ i } of Φ cannot sparsely represent the columns {ψ j } of Ψ (and vice versa) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The above condition can be satisfied with overwhelming probability, when elements of measurement matrix Φ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) random variables taking on their values from a Gaussian probability density function with mean zero and variance 1/N <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Meanwhile, as another prerequisite for successful reconstruction, the measurement data length M is restricted by the inequality below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">M ! cK log N K = ð Þ<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>where c is a small constant. The length M in inequality (2) is a crucial factor related to the compression rate. Another factor is the quantization level for measurement data. On the observation of the Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>), we conclude that dimension reduction projection compresses the data, and cipher property owes to the randomness of measurement matrix. The reconstruction boils down to a convex optimization process:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">b s ¼ argmin s 0 k k 1 subject to s 0 ¼ Θy</formula><p>In this paper, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) is adopted to reconstruct the original signal from the measurement data y. OMP is a reliable and efficient greedy algorithm whose computational complexity is O(KlnN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Security analysis on CS-based encryption method</head><p>In the previous methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>, the security analysis only concerns the computational complexity of brute force attack. However, that is not adequate if opponents have obtained temporary access to the encryption machinery. In this section, we reveal their security loophole from the perspective of chosen-plaintext attack, in the sense that N plain-cipher pairs are sufficient to break them, where N is the length of plaintext.</p><p>In secret key cryptography, the unintelligible measurement data are transmitted over the public channel while the key used for generating random measurement matrix is assigned to the intended receivers through the secure channel. We bypass by guessing the key instead of directly exposing the random measurement matrix.</p><p>Suppose that the basis matrix Ψ equals an identity matrix I. It is worthwhile to mention that this assumption is impartial since the general sparse transform Ψ is public to all users. As an expansion form of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>), the measurement data y can be represented linearly by columns ϕ i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">y ¼ x 1 f 1 þ x 2 f 2 þ; Á Á Á ; þx N f N</formula><p>where x i stands for i th element of vector x. Likewise, the i th column of Φ is denoted by ϕ i .</p><p>Define a sparse vector x [k] taking following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">x ½k ¼ x i ¼ 0 i 6 ¼ k x i ¼ 1 i ¼ k &amp; i ¼ 1; Á Á Á ; N</formula><p>where each sparse vector contains only one non-zero entry. We collect a complete plaintext set</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">X ¼ x k ½ k ¼ 1; Á Á Á; N j È É consisting of N sparse vectors.</formula><p>Plaintext in set X is multiplied by random measurement matrix Φ one by one. According to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) and the assumption Ψ= I, N outputs become y ½k ¼ Φx ½k ¼ f k , where k=1, …, N. In this case, the ciphertext set Y ¼ fy ½k jy ½k ¼ Φx ½k ; k ¼ 1; Á Á Á ; N g is equivalent to the random measurement matrix taking the form Φ ¼ ½f 1 jf 2 j Á Á Á jf N ¼ ½y ½1 jy ½2 j Á Á Á jy ½N . Therefore, an attacker can expose the random measurement matrix as long as he/she sequentially traverses and encrypts all N plaintext vectors in the set X.</p><p>Our proposed encryption method can not only work in parallel but also resist against the chosen-plaintext attack through introducing the diffusion mechanism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Our proposed enhancement method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Overview</head><p>Since image data after one-dimension vectorizing brings on an enormous measurement matrix, to alleviate this problem, Gan <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> proposes the block compressive sensing which is memory efficient and enables parallel sampling. Image acquisition is performed in a block-by-block manner through a block measurement matrix Φ B . The complete block diagonal measurement matrix takes the following form: As mentioned before, the proposed method is composed of two stages. The first stage carries out the image acquisition akin to the previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. We slightly deviate from their way with respect to block-wise and parallel sampling. In the second stage, the well designed block cipher aims at inheriting the parallelism and introducing the diffusion process to resist against the chosen-plaintext attack. Both two stages gear together and work in harmony. The encryption configuration flowchart is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. We emphasize that block compressive sensing plays a role of signal sampling or image acquisition. Digital operations beginning from the second stage are directly applied on the quantized measurement data in their dimension reduction space. Thus, compared with the existing parallel encryption methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, our proposal possesses the merit of compressibility.  We set a fixed key length as 128-bit suggested by the AES. The 128-bit key K=k 0 ,k 1 ,⋯, k 127 is divided into four 32-bit sub-keys: K j sub ¼ k 32j ; k 32jþ1 ; Á Á Á ; k 32jþ31 ðj ¼ 0; 1; 2; 3Þ . Four initial values of Logistic map are derived from each sub-key ratio computed as follow:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Φ ¼ Φ B Φ B . . . Φ B</formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">I j ¼ K j sub P K j sub j ¼ 0; 1; 2; 3<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">F X j t À Á ¼ μX j t 1 À X j t À Á j ¼ 0; 1; 2; 3 &amp; t ¼ 0; 1; 2; Á Á Á<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>Equation (4) shows the Logistic map which is a discrete quadratic recurrence equation derived from the population growth model. This chaotic system displays a great sensitivity to initial conditions when the parameter μ takes the value between about 3.57 and 4. In order to improve the initial condition sensitivity, a pre-iteration process is carried out. Specifically, fetching values is triggered after Logistic map (4) undergoes t&gt;t 0 rounds of iteration. Here, the constant t 0 is preset to 100 empirically. Four initial conditions are X j o ¼ I j ; j ¼ 0; 1; 2; 3 . The first element z seed directly takes the floating-point number F X 0 t 0 þ1 after the preiteration process. A Gaussian random number generator drove by z seed is intended to produce the block Gaussian random matrix Φ B . The remaining three elements, b z a ,b z b and b Z W×H , are the quantization version converted from the raw floating-point number. A decimal z j t ¼ 0:z j t ð0Þz j t ð1Þz j t ð2Þ Á Á Á is quantized according to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">5</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">b z j t ¼ mod 100z j t ð0Þ þ 10z j t ð1Þ þ z j t ð2Þ; 2 8<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>where z j t ð0Þ stands for the decile of z j t , and the rest can be deduced by analogy. Then we have two quantized sequences:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">b z a ¼ fb z 1 t 0 þ1 ;b z 1 t 0 þ2 ; Á Á Á ;b z 1 t 0 þL g b z b ¼ fb z 2 t 0 þ1 ;b z 2 t 0 þ2 ; Á Á Á ;b z 2 t 0 þL g</formula><p>The approach to generating b Z W×H is inspired by the two-dimensional Coupled Map Lattice (CML) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. As a spatiotemporal chaos model, the two-dimensional CML is characterized by ergodicity, sensibility and random-like behaviors. Generation procedure includes three step: lattice initialization, lattice iteration and lattice quantization. In the lattice initialization step, the chaotic sequence z 3 t 0 þ1 ; z 3 t 0 þ2 ; Á Á Á ; z 3 t 0 þW ÂH generated by Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">4</ref>) is reshaped to a matrix of size W×H. This matrix is regarded as the initial lattice, and denoted by Z O W ÂH . The lattice iteration step is represented by Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">6</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">z n c þ1 ii;jj ¼ 1 À " ð ÞF z n c þ1 ii;jj þ 1 2 " F z n c iiþ1;jj þ F z n c ii;jjþ1 h i<label>ð6Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">z n c þ1 ii;jj ¼ z n c þ1 ii;jj þ z n c þ1 iiþ1;jj mod 1<label>ð7Þ</label></formula><p>where the function F(⋅) refers to the Logistic map. The subscripts ii=1,2,⋯,H and jj=1,2, ⋯,W represent the element positions in the current lattice. Note that the periodic boundary condition z n c ii; jjþW ¼ z n c iiþH; jj ¼ z n c ii; jj is satisfied. The enumerator n c counts the rounds of iteration. Parameter ε ∊[0,1] harmonizes the weight average between two items. The operation "mod 1" restricts the value range of z n c þ1</p><p>ii; jj 2 0; 1 ½ Þ . Lattice quantization is implemented according to the same approach given in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">5</ref>). The iteration stops when the set b Z W×H has contained L quantized lattices. The following encryption and decryption procedure makes use of this four-tuple {z seed , b z a , b z b , b Z W×H }.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Encryption procedure</head><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, an original image is block-wise measured in parallel. The quantized measurement data undergo following five processes including Arnold scrambling, Mixing <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, S-box, block-wise XOR operation and communication. Let R denote the maximum round of iteration. The procedure of encryption/decryption as well as parameter setting is elaborated in the following.</p><p>[ The measurement matrix of size M×N is produced column by column using a Gaussian random number generator initialized by the seed z seed . The measurement data y p are harvested from the Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) block by block. The discussion about parameter M will be given later. <ref type="bibr">[</ref>Step 3]: Quantization. For a given 8-bit rate, measurement data quantization is implemented through the Lloyd quantizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> which is known as an optimal quantizer in the mean square error sense. as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. In this way, the number of elements within a block becomes equal to the number of blocks, mathematically, M⋅b/B=B. Obviously, the problem how to determine the parameters M, B, b should be carefully studied. To this end, three requirements are given to handle this issue. First, M≥N/4, which is an empirical version of inequality (2) for guaranteeing the successful reconstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Second, the square root of M, B and b must be integer. Third,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">B ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi M Á b p , which is derived from M⋅b/B=B.</formula><p>Taking the typical 512×512 image as an example, we divide it into b= 64 blocks, then each block contains N=4096 data. Fixing M=1024 results in B=256. We remark that the reallocation manipulation does not violate the workload balance among multiple processors, since each block shares the same size. Therefore, challenging issues in item ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>) and (3) become equivalent. Moreover, based on the fact that the length of measurement data M is adjustable, the workload balance property can be achieved even for non-square images. An example is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, where b=64, M=1024 and B=256. Note that, in this case, the square root of N is no longer an integer. For the sake of simplicity, in the following, we denote each block as Ŷ m,n , where m; n ¼ 1; Á Á Á ;  measurement within each block as (m,n). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> The position moving rule of (m,n) is formulated by Eq.

S-box is a basic component of block cipher, and serves as a non-linear projection through table lookup. A slight alteration causes great difference on the output side. This step provides confusion property which obscures the relationship between the key and the encrypted image. For the sake of simplicity, we employ a fixed 8×8 bits S-box suggested by AES. Let S(⋅) denote the S-box substitution manipulation. [Step 8]: Block-wise XOR.

Obviously, the collisionfree data exchange can be fulfilled if and only if the number of elements within a block is equal to the number of blocks. This issue has been discussed and solved in the reallocation step. In the following, we draw forth the concept of optimal diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>Definition Suppose that each block contains B elements. After the r th round of encryption, the effect of a single bit change spreads over B r elements.</p><p>Recall that the reallocation step segments the quantized measurement image Ŷ into B blocks, and each block contains B elements. Therefore, the optimal diffusion can be fulfilled at the second round. We give concise analysis:</p><p>After the first round, the value change of an arbitrary element c m;n 2 C o m;n is propagated within the corresponding block, where 8m; n; m; n 2 1; Á Á Á ; ffiffiffi ffi B p È É . The mixing step guarantees the above internal alteration propagation mechanism. The collision-free communication unit uniformly propagates those infected elements over all blocks. Therefore, after the second round, the whole image will be infected. For a data-collision communication, more than one infected elements will co-exist in a block after the first round communication, which also indicates that some blocks lack of infected elements. Therefore, after two round encryption, the number of infected elements will be less than B 2 , and thus more round encryption is required. We conclude that optimal diffusion is equivalent to the collision-free data exchange.</p><p>Communication unit of Zhou's method <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and Liao's method <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> exist data-collision exchange. This inefficient stage needs more than two rounds of encryption to achieve the full diffusion.</p><p>The above description is related to the encryption procedure. The operations from step 5 to step 9 should be implemented iteratively for R rounds. In the last round, the communication unit can be skipped.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Security and performance evaluation</head><p>To evaluate the security and performance of an encryption algorithm, the resistance against a series of known attacks, such as brute-force attack, statistical attack and differential attack is generally investigated. In this section, security and performance evaluation includes recovery, key space, statistical analysis, sensitivity analysis, information entropy analysis and efficiency analysis. Five grayscale images with resolution 512×512 were selected as the original images as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>. It should be mentioned that the proposed method is also applicable to color images by parallel encrypting each color channel.</p><p>(a) The "Lena" image, is a high-contrast image with sharp corners and textured area. (b) The "Pepper" image, contains multiple separate plain areas with various shape. The distinct edges exist in the junction between two peppers. (c) The "Baboon" image, contains a large textured area (the fur) and a homogeneous area (the face). (d) The "Testpat" image, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a)</ref>, is a general test pattern. Multiple blocks with gradual grayscale surround the shrunken "Lena". (e) The "Black" image, consists of black pixels and can be regarded as an all-zero matrix.</p><p>As mentioned before, in practice, CS serves as the sampling stage. In our experiment, we simulated the CS measuring by randomly downsampling the digital image. The original image was split into b=64 blocks, and each block contained N=4096 pixels. For achieving the optimal diffusion and successful reconstruction, M=1024 was an appropriate setting. The 128-bit length original key was set to K=(0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABC-DEF) hex . As an intuitive contrast with Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b)</ref>, we first exhibited our encrypted "Testpat" as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7(d)</ref>.</p><p>In the following, CS-based image encryption <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> and parallel image encryption <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> were involved as competitors for following comparative studies. We excluded the parallel method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> from the comparison due to the absence of diffusion mechanism. The terminology "recovery" refers to decrypting and then reconstructing the plain image from its measurement data. In this sub section, assuming that the original key K was available to the recipient, we investigated the compression ratio and reconstruction quality.</p><p>Since a fixed 8-bit rate quantization was adopted, the compression ratio only relied on the parameter M. Naturally, a large M yielded the high quality reconstruction while small M leaded to an aborted case. For the original image of size 512×512, the appropriate setting M=1024 rendered the compression ratio at 0.25. For the case of non-square image as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, its corresponding compression ratio would be 0.4551.</p><p>We computed the Peak Signal Noise Ratio (PSNR) as an objective metric to evaluate the reconstruction quality. The specific calculation formulas were given as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">MSE ¼ 1 bN X bN i¼1 ðx i À b x i Þ 2 PSNR ¼ 10 Â lg 255 2 MSE = À Á</formula><p>where x i represented the intensity of a pixel in the original image, while its reconstruction counterpart was denoted by b x i .</p><p>In our proposal, all five PSNRs exceeded 30 dB, which indicated that the reconstruction quality was acceptable. Notably, the issue about how to improve the reconstruction quality was out of the scope of this paper. So far, there had existed too many reconstruction techniques to enumerate here. The impressive ones include orthogonal matching pursuit <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, Gradient pursuit <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, FOCUSS <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and SPARLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>

A parallel image encryption method was proposed under the compressive sampling circumstance to enhance the security and performance. The proposed block cipher structure consisted of scrambling, mixing, S-box and block-wise XOR with chaotic lattice. Both collision-free data exchange and optimal diffusion were achieved owing to a well designed reallocation and communication unit. We evaluated the security, and conducted performance comparative studies through the experiment. The results demonstrated that our method had the ability of resistance against the chosen-plaintext attack and outperformed the existing parallel image encryption with respect to the compressibility and the encryption speed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Encryption performance of applying the AES on a grayscale image. a the original image. b the corresponding encrypted image</figDesc><graphic coords="2,46.77,406.83,346.48,182.15" type="bitmap" /></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1" xml:id="foot_0"><p>Liao et  al.<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> claimed that the full diffusion could be achieved even after the first round of encryption. However, their experiment in diffusion performance evaluation was not impartial. If one changes the original image pixel in the second quadrant, at least three rounds of encryption were necessary. Therefore, the property that full diffusion could be achieved after the first round encryption was just a best case. It should be bear in mind that when evaluating the security, only the worst boundary can be taken as a result.</p></note>
