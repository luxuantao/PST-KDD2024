<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Since the pioneering works of Reynolds <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and Vicsek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the consensus problem of multi-agent systems has attracted researchers from a wide range of disciplines, such as biology, physics, robotics, computer science, social science and control engineering, due to its applications in the formation control of unmanned air vehicles, the cooperative control of mobile robots, the design of distributed sensor networks, and so on. For a cooperative multiagent system, leaderless consensus means that each agent updates its state based on local information of its neighbors such that all agents eventually reach an agreement on a common value, while leader-following consensus means that there exists a virtual leader which specifies an objective for all agents to follow.</p><p>In the past few years, the first-order consensus problem of multi-agent systems has been intensively studied. Olfati-Saber and Murray <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> presented a systematic framework to analyze the firstorder consensus algorithms, and showed that the consensus problem can be solved if the diagraph is strongly connected. Ren and Beard <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> further proved that first-order consensus can be achieved if the union of the dynamically changing interaction graphs has a directed spanning tree frequently enough as the system evolves. Sun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> discussed the first-order average consensus problem of dynamic agents with multiple time-varying communication delays. Lu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> studied the first-order consensus problem over directed networks with arbitrary finite communication delays and nonlinear couplings. Recently, the second-order consensus problem of multi-agent systems has received increasing attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Unlike the first-order consensus, Ren and Atkins <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> showed that the existence of a directed spanning tree is a necessary rather than a sufficient condition to reach second-order consensus, i.e., second-order consensus may not be achievable even if the interaction topology has a directed spanning tree. Therefore, the extension of consensus algorithms from first-order to secondorder is non-trivial <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and the second-order consensus problem is more complicated and challenging than the first-order case.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the first-order consensus problem of multiagent systems can be treated as a special case of the synchronization problem of complex dynamical networks, which has been extensively studied in the past few decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Usually, a complex network consists of a set of nonlinear oscillators with firstorder dynamics. Nevertheless, in reality some oscillators, e.g., harmonic oscillators <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> and pendulums <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, are governed by second-order dynamics with the position and velocity terms. Hence, it is necessary to study the consensus problem of a multiagent system composed of second-order oscillators, in which the dynamics of each agent is not only determined by the interactions 0167-6911/$ -see front matter Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.sysconle.2010.06.016 among agents, but also by its own dynamics, i.e., self-dynamics. Up to date, few consensus protocols consider the intrinsic dynamics of each individual agent in a multi-agent system with secondorder dynamics. It is noted that the second-order consensus problem of coupled linear oscillators was addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. However, all physical systems are nonlinear in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Recently, Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> proposed a nonlinear multi-agent system by introducing complex dynamics into each agent, and studied the leaderless second-order consensus with directed topology. Thus, it is high time to deeply investigate the second-order consensus problem of multi-agent systems with nonlinear dynamics.</p><p>For a multi-agent system with fixed interaction topology, most leaderless consensus algorithms require the existence of a directed spanning tree. Otherwise, one can design some appropriate controllers to force all agents to reach on the state of the virtual leader. Considering that it is practically impossible to apply control actions to all agents in a large-scale multi-agent system, some authors developed consensus algorithms based on pinning control, which means that only a small fraction of agents have access to the reference state. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and Ren <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> studied first-order consensus of multi-agent systems via pinning control. Ren <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> considered second-order consensus of coupled doubleintegrators with partial access to a time-varying reference state.</p><p>Due to the fact that many pinning control schemes for complex networks have been developed in the past few years, it would be beneficial to apply these pinning control techniques to study the consensus problem of multi-agent systems. It is well-known that one of the most difficult problems in the pinning control of complex networks is how to choose a set of pinned nodes. For undirected complex networks, Wang and Chen <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> pointed out that it is better to specifically pin the most-highly connected nodes. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> showed that there is no significant difference between specifically and randomly pinning schemes for random networks. Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> found that the nodes with low degrees should be pinned first when the coupling strength is small. Based on the concept of V-stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, Xiang and Chen <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> proposed a renormalization approach to select pinned nodes. However, it is quite challenging to select pinned nodes for a directed complex network. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> pointed out that it is possible to pin a complex network with strong coupling strength by a single controller. Using minimum number of controllers, Lu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> studied the pinning stabilization of linearly coupled stochastic neural networks. Xiong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> developed an algorithm to choose pinned nodes by computing the determinants of principle minors. Lu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> proposed an approach to select pinned nodes by finding the strongly connected components which have no edges with heads in and tails out. Song and Cao <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> showed that the nodes whose out-degrees are bigger than their in-degrees should be chosen as pinned candidates.</p><p>The main purpose of this paper is to study the pinningcontrolled second-order leader-following consensus of nonlinear multi-agent systems. The contributions of the paper are four-fold. First, the intrinsic dynamics of each individual agent in a multiagent system is considered, and the interaction topology of the multi-agent system is general, which can neither be strongly connected nor have a directed spanning tree. Second, a consensus algorithm based on pinning control for a nonlinear multi-agent system with second-order dynamics is proposed. Also, a pinning consensus protocol is developed for coupled double-integrators. Third, this paper addresses two challenging problems in the pinning control of multi-agent systems: what kind of agents should be pinned and how many agents are needed to be pinned such that all agents reach consensus? Some sufficient conditions are established to ensure that the states of all agents globally asymptotically approach the state of the virtual leader. Fourth, comparing with the second-order leaderless consensus in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, this paper further studies how to achieve second-order leader-following consensus of nonlinear multi-agent systems via pinning control when the interaction digraph does not have a directed spanning tree.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides some necessary preliminaries. Section 3 presents pinning-controlled algorithms for nonlinear multi-agent systems and coupled double-integrators, respectively, and then develops a pinned-agent selection scheme to achieve second-order leaderfollowing consensus. Numerical examples are given in Section 4 to verify the theoretical analysis. Finally, some concluding remarks and future trends are stated in Section 5.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Notations</head><p>Some mathematical notations are used throughout this paper. Let I N â R NÃN be an N-dimensional identity matrix, 1 N = (1, . . . , 1) T â R N be a vector of all ones, A T and A -1 be the transpose and the inverse of matrix A, respectively. For a matrix M â R NÃN , denote the ith row and the ith column of M as the ith row-column pair <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, and let M l represent its minor matrix by removing arbitrary l (1 â¤ l &lt; N) row-column pairs of M, M and Î» max (M) be the Euclidean norm and maximal eigenvalue of matrix M, respectively. Write M &gt; 0 (M &lt; 0) if M is positive (negative) definite. For two real symmetric matrices X and Y , X &gt; Y (X &lt; Y ) means that X -Y &gt; 0 (X -Y &lt; 0). The symbol â denotes the Kronecker product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Graph theory</head><p>Information exchange among agents in a multi-agent system can be modeled by an interaction graph. Let G = {V, E , A} be a weighted diagraph with a node set V = {1, . . . , N}, an edge set E â V Ã V, and a weighted adjacency matrix A = (a ij ) NÃN with nonnegative elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. A directed edge denoted by (j, i) means that node i has access to node j, i.e., node i can receive information from node j. The elements of the adjacency matrix A are defined such that a ij &gt; 0 â (j, i) â E , while a ij = 0 â (j, i) â E <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. We assume that a ii = 0 for all i â V. The neighbor set of node i is defined by N i = {j â V|(j, i) â E }, and the in-degree and out-degree of node i are, respectively, defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> deg in (i</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">) = N j=1,j =i a ij , deg out (i) = N j=1,j =i a ji .<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">A diagraph is called balanced if deg in (i) = deg out (i), âi â V [3].</formula><p>The Laplacian matrix L = (l ij ) NÃN associated with the adjacency matrix A is defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref>]</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">l ij = -a ij , i = j, l ii = - N j=1,j =i l ij , i, j = 1, . . . , N,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>which ensures that N j=1 l ij = 0. Generally speaking, the Laplacian matrix of a diagraph is asymmetric. A directed path from node j to node i is a sequence of edges (j, i 1 ), (i 1 , i 2 ), . . . , (i l , i) in the directed graph G with distinct nodes i k , k = 1, . . . , l <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. A directed graph is strongly connected if for any two distinct nodes j and i, there exists a directed path from node j to node i. A directed graph has a directed spanning tree if there exists at least one node called root which has a directed path to all the other nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p></div>

Actually, this paper uses pinning control techniques for complex networks to study the consensus problem of multi-agent systems.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions and future works</head><p>In this paper, we have studied the second-order leaderfollowing consensus problem of nonlinear multi-agent systems composed of coupled second-order oscillators. Without assuming that the interaction diagraph contains a directed spanning tree, we have developed leader-following consensus algorithms based on pinning control for second-order multi-agent systems with time-varying and constant reference velocities, respectively. In particular, we have provided a pinned-agent selection scheme to  determine what kind of followers and how many followers should be informed by the virtual leader, and have derived some sufficient conditions to guarantee the global asymptotic stability of secondorder leader-following consensus. In our future work, we will extend the theoretical analysis to high-order multi-agent systems, and consider the effects of time-delay, nonlinear couplings, and switching interaction graph.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
