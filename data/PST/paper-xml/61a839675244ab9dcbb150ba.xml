<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The pretrain-finetune paradigm is a classical pipeline in visual learning. Recent progress on unsupervised pretraining methods shows superior transfer performance to their supervised counterparts. This paper revisits this phenomenon and sheds new light on understanding the transferability gap between unsupervised and supervised pretraining from a multilayer perceptron (MLP) perspective. While previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> focus on the effectiveness of MLP on unsupervised image classification where pretraining and evaluation are conducted on the same dataset, we reveal that the MLP projector is also the key factor to better transferability of unsupervised pretraining methods than supervised pretraining methods. Based on this observation, we attempt to close the transferability gap between supervised and unsupervised pretraining by adding an MLP projector before the classifier in supervised pretraining. Our analysis indicates that the MLP projector can help retain intra-class variation of visual features, decrease the feature distribution distance between pretraining and evaluation datasets, and reduce feature redundancy. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that the added MLP projector significantly boosts the transferability of supervised pretraining, e.g. +7.2% top-1 accuracy on the concept generalization task, +5.8% top-1 accuracy for linear evaluation on 12-domain classification tasks, and +0.8% AP on COCO object detection task, making supervised pretraining comparable or even better than unsupervised pretraining.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>While Supervised Learning with the cross-entropy loss 1  (SL) were the de facto pretraining paradigm in computer vision for a long period, recent unsupervised learning methods <ref type="bibr">[6-11, 16, 18, 19, 54, 56]</ref> show better transfer learn-ing performance on various visual tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57]</ref>. This raised the question of why unsupervised pretraining surpasses supervised pretraining even though supervised pretraining uses annotations with rich semantic information.</p><p>Several works have attempted to explain the better transferability of unsupervised pretraining than supervised pretraining by the following two reasons: (1) Learning without semantic information in annotations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57]</ref>, which makes the backbone less-overfitted to semantic labels to preserve instance-specific information which may be useful in transfer tasks, and (2) Special design of the contrastive loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57]</ref>, which helps the learned features to contain more low/mid-level information for effective transfer to downstream tasks. Starting from the perspective of supervision and loss design, these works provide intuitive explanations for better transferability.</p><p>In this paper, we shed new light on understanding transferability by considering the multilayer perception (MLP) projector. While previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> verified its effectiveness on the unsupervised image classification task: unsupervised training and evaluating the model on the same ImagNet-1K dataset, they did not explore its effectiveness on transfer tasks thoroughly and rigorously. It is not straightforward to extend the effectiveness of MLP on the unsupervised image classification task to downstream tasks if not supported by rigorous experiments or theoretical analysis, because the performance on the pretraining task is not always predictive of the performance on transfer tasks when there exists a large semantic gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>. To our best knowledge, we are the first to identify the MLP projector as the core factor for the transferability with deep empirical and theoretical analysis. With this new viewpoint, we find that a simple yet effective method, adding an MLP projector, can promote the transferability of the conventional supervised pretraining methods with the cross-entropy loss (SL) to be comparable or even better than representative unsupervised pretraining methods. Specifically, we use the concept generalization task <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> on ImageNet-1K, where the pretraining and the evaluation datasets have a large semantic distance, as a probe to ana-arXiv:2112.00496v1 [cs.CV] 1 Dec 2021 lyze the transferability of different models. Our experimental results and corresponding analysis indicate that the MLP projector in unsupervised pretraining methods is important for their better transferability. Motivated by this observation, we insert an MLP projector before the classifier in SL, forming SL-MLP. The added MLP can improve the transferability of supervised pretraining, making supervised pretraining comparable or even better than unsupervised pretraining. Experimental results on SL and SL-MLP show three interesting findings: 1) The added MLP preserves the intra-class variation on the pretraining dataset. 2) The added MLP decreases the feature distribution distance between the pretraining and the evaluation dataset; 3) The added MLP decreases the feature redundancy in the pretraining dataset. We also provide theoretical analysis on how the preserved intra-class variation and the decreased feature distribution distance improve the performance on the target dataset, by adding an MLP projector.</p><p>Extensive experimental results confirm that adding an MLP projector into the supervised pretraining method (SL) can consistently improve the transferability of the model on various downstream tasks. Specifically, on the concept generalization task <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, SL-MLP boosts the top-1 accuracy compared to SL (55.9%→63.1%) by +7.2%. It also achieves better performance (64.1%) than Byol (62.3%) by +1.8% on the 300-epochs pretraining setting. In classification tasks on 12 cross-domain datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, SL-MLP improves SL by +5.8% accuracy on average. Moreover, SL-MLP shows better transferability than SL on COCO object detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> by +0.8% AP. These improvements brought by the MLP projector can largely bridge the transferability gap between supervised and unsupervised pretraining as detailed in Sec. 5.2.</p><p>The main contributions of our paper are three-fold. (1) We reveal that the MLP projector is the main factor for the transferability gap between existing unsupervised and supervised learning methods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> We empirically demonstrate that, by adding an MLP projector, supervised pretraining methods can have comparable or even better transferability than representative unsupervised pretraining methods.</p><p>(3) We theoretically prove that the MLP projector can improve transferability of pretrained models by preserving intra-class feature variation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Works</head><p>MLP in unsupervised learning methods. Adding a multilayer perceptron (MLP) projector after the encoder was first introduced in SimCLR <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and followed by recent unsupervised learning frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. SimCLR claims that the MLP can reduce the loss of information caused by the contrastive loss, and various works <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> have verified that the MLP projector can enhance the discriminative ability of unsupervised models on the unsupervised image classification task, where unsupervised training and evaluation are conducted on the same dataset, e.g., ImageNet-1K. However, the relation between the MLP and the transferability of unsupervised learning is under-explored. In this paper, we reveal that the MLP projector is also important for the desirable transferability of unsupervised learning. MLP in supervised learning methods. The typical supervised learning method only uses the cross-entropy loss and shows inferior performance on various transfer tasks than recent unsupervised learning methods. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>, recent researches <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> introduced the contrastive loss equipped with an MLP projector into supervised learning to improve its transferability. Nonetheless, those works ignored the ablation on the MLP projector and attributed the better transfer performance to the contrastive mechanism in the loss. In this paper, we propose that the MLP projector is important for the improved transferability of recent supervised learning methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, and further provide some empirical and theoretical analysis to justify its importance. Transferability gap between supervised and unsupervised learning. Previous works attributed the superior transferability of unsupervised learning to lack of annotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57]</ref> or special design of the contrastive loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57]</ref>. Different from both reasons, we explain the transferability gap by considering the architectural difference between the supervised and the unsupervised learning frameworks. From this perspective, we analyze the role of the MLP projector in both supervised and unsupervised learning methods, and are the first to identify its key importance to model transferability to the best of our knowledge.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">The Concept Generalization Task</head><p>We use the concept generalization task <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> to analyze the transferability gap between the unsupervised and supervised pretraining methods. Data preparation. Sariyildiz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> evaluated the transferability of methods when the pretraining and evaluation dataset have semantic distance. Their experimental results show that larger semantic distance will lead to more accuracy differences among different pretraining methods. Therefore, we enlarge the semantic gap between the pretraining and the evaluation dataset to help us compare different pretraining methods. Sariyildizet al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> use the hierarchy in WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and divide ImageNet-21K <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> into six class-exclusive datasets with different semantic distance -one for pretraining, and others for evaluation. Without loss of generality, we construct a smaller pretraining dataset (pre-D) and evaluation dataset (eval-D) based on ImageNet-1K <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> to reduce the experimental burden. Pre-D contains 652 classes mostly of organisms, and eval-D contains the other 348 classes of instrumentality. Transferability evaluation. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, to assess the transferability, we freeze all parameters in the pretrained backbone <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> , and finetune the classifier with the ImageNet-1K training samples in eval-D for reporting top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K validation samples in eval-D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Stage-wise Evaluation on Existing Methods</head><p>Motivated by works <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57]</ref> we make a more thorough stage-wise investigation of the conventional supervised pretraining method (SL) and the existing representative unsupervised pretraining methods (Mocov1, Mocov2, Byol) by evaluating the transferability of intermediate feature maps (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). After pretraining the model on pre-D, we freeze all model parameters and use the extracted intermediate feature maps of images in eval-D to finetune a stage-wise classifier for a stage-wise linear evaluation.</p><p>The evaluation results of these existing methods are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (underlined on the legend). Our stage-wise evaluation shows two new findings that have not been reported by existing works. First, on stage-wise evaluation from stage 1 to stage 4, SL is consistently higher than Byol, Mocov1, and Mocov2, which suggests that the semantic information in annotations can benefit the transferability of low/middle-level feature maps. Second, on stage-wise evaluation from stage 4 to stage 5, the performance of Byol and Mocov2 still increase while SL and Mocov1 have a transferability drop. By carefully inspecting these methods, we notice an architectural difference between SL, Mocov1, Mocov2, and Byol after stage 5: An MLP projector is inserted after stage 5 in Byol and Mocov2, which does not exist in SL and Mocov1. Such difference, together with the experimental results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, leads to a new hypothesis that the MLP projector might be the core factor of the desirable transferability of unsupervised pretraining. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">MLP Improves the Transferability of Unsupervised Pretraining Methods</head><p>To confirm our hypothesis of the effectiveness on unsupervised pretraining methods, we ablate the MLP projectors on existing unsupervised methods,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref> using stage-wise evaluation. Specifically, we remove the MLP projector in Byol and Mocov2 as Byol w/o MLP and Mocov2 w/o MLP, and add an MLP projector in Mocov1 as Mocov1 w/ MLP. The stage-wise evaluation results of these ablations are summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. We use solid lines for methods that have an MLP projector and dash lines for those that do not have.</p><p>These ablation results offer us two observations. First, when evaluating the layer4-pooled-features (depicted in the legend), unsupervised learning methods with an MLP projector achieve better transferability than their variants without the MLP projector, e.g., Byol, Mocov1 w/ MLP, Mo-cov2 achieve higher accuracy than Byol w/o MLP, Mocov1, and Mocov2 w/o MLP by +23.3%, +5.1% and +3.7%, respectively. Second, on stage-wise evaluation from stage 4 to stage 5, the MLP projector can help unsupervised learning methods without the MLP projector to avoid the transferability drop. These consistent improvements by adding an MLP projector empirically show that the MLP projector is important for the transferability of unsupervised pretraining. While there might exist some other non-linear structures that can boost the transferability, we only explore from an MLP perspective in this paper because of its simplicity and demonstrated effectiveness.   mote the transferability of supervised pretraining? We attempt to insert an MLP projector before the classifier on SL for better transferability. We denote this supervised pretraining method as SL-MLP (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> for their comparison). Specifically, SL-MLP includes a feature extractor f (•), an MLP projector g(•), and a classifier W. Given an input image x, the feature extractor outputs a feature f = f (x). For example, f (x) transforms an image x to a 2048 dimensional feature f when using the ResNet-50 backbone. The MLP projector maps f into a projection vector g = g(f ). Following Byol, the MLP projector consists of two fully connected layers, a batch normalization layer, and a ReLU layer, which can be mathematically formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">g(f ) = f c 2 (ReLU (BN (f c 1 (f )))) ∈ R Dg</formula><p>, where f c 1 and f c 2 are fully connected layers, the hidden feature dimension in the MLP projector is set to 4096, and D g is set to 256. Given the label denoted by y for image x, the objective function for SL-MLP can be formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L(x) = CE(W • g(f (x)), y),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where CE(•) is the cross-entropy loss. Same as SL, only the learned feature extractor f (•) is utilized in downstream transfer tasks after supervised pretraining.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Empirical Findings of MLP in SL-MLP</head><p>MLP projector avoids transferability drop at stage 5 in supervised pretraining. We conduct stage-wise evaluation as Sec. 3.2 again to see whether the transferability drop from stage 4 to stage 5 exists in SL-MLP. In Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>(a), the transferability of SL-MLP continuously increases from stage 1 to 5, avoiding a decrease at stage 5 as SL. Besides, we observe that the transferability of SL-MLP is higher than that of Byol from stage 1 to 4, indicating that annotations benefit the transferability of intermediate feature maps.</p><p>MLP projector enlarges the intra-class variation of features. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57]</ref>, features with large intra-class variation can preserve more instance discriminative information, which is beneficial for transfer learning. We reveal that adding an MLP projector also can enlarge the intraclass variation. We compare two supervised pretraining methods, i.e., SL, SupCon <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and one unsupervised pretraining method, i.e., Byol, with their variants with/without MLP. Qualitatively, we visualize their features learned on pre-D by t-SNE in Fig. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, we pretrain SL, SL-MLP, and Byol for 300 epochs.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, we pretrain SL, SL-MLP, and Byol for 300 epochs. D in the representation space can benefit transfer learning.</p><p>Intuitively, the distribution distance between two sets of features is small when features are well mixed (visualization provided in Supplementary A). Therefore, we compare the mixtureness of features in pre-D and eval-D to indicate the feature distribution distance between SL and SL-MLP. Graphically, we visualize features from pre-D and eval-D by t-SNE in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>. We observe that features from pre-D and eval-D are more mixed comparing SL and SL-MLP, indicating that MLP projector can mitigate the distribution distance between pre-D and eval-D. Quantitatively, we define Feature Mixtureness Π in the feature space as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Π = 1 − 1 C C i=1 top eval k (i) k − C eval C ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where C = 1000 is total number of classes in ImageNet-1K, C eval represents the number of classes in eval-D, and top eval k (i) represents the number of classes in eval-D found by top k neighbors search of any class i ∈ C. Since the percentage of finding a sample from eval-D in k nearest neighbors is C eval /C when pre-D and eval-D are uniformly mixed, Feature Mixtureness measures the similarity of the current and the uniformly mixed distribution between pre-D and eval-D in the feature space. We examine Feature Mixtureness of SL, SL-MLP, and Byol during different pretraining epochs in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7(a)</ref>. Feature Mixtureness of SL gradu-ally decreases, which indicates that SL will enlarge the distribution difference between pre-D and eval-D. In contrast, SL-MLP and Byol show consistently high Feature Mixtureness, indicating that the MLP projector can reduce the distribution distance between pre-D and eval-D. We visualize the evolution of Feature Mixtureness in Supplementary B.2. MLP projector reduces feature redundancy. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref>, high channel redundancy limits the capability of feature expression in deep learning. Mathematically, we compute Pearson correlation coefficient among feature channels to evaluate feature redundancy R, i.e,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">R = 1 d 2 d i=1 d j=1 |ρ(i, j)|, ρ(i, j) = N n=1 fn,i • fn,j N n=1 ||fn,i|| 2 N n=1 ||fn,j || 2<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where d = 2048 is the feature dimension, ρ(i, j) is Pearson correlation coefficient of feature channel i and j. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>(b), SL-MLP has lower feature redundancy than SL, which indicates that the MLP projector can reduce feature redundancy. In Tab. 1, we further confirm that the MLP projector can reduce the feature redundancy and thus increase the accuracy on eval-D by ablating the MLP projector on various pretraining methods.</p></div>

Theorem 1 reveals that continuously minimizing the intra-class variation (maximizing the discriminative ratio) on the pretraining dataset will decrease the transferability of the model when the discriminative ratio φ(I pre ) is larger than t.

This insight suggests that we should not make the intra-class variation on the pretraining dataset too small when designing the objective function or network architecture (adding an MLP projector is such a design). Insights for the relation between the feature distribution distance and threshold t. When the feature distribution distance between the pretraining and evaluation dataset is large, the threshold t is small, in which case it is easier to have the undesirable effect of increasing the discriminative ratio φ(I pre ) on pre-D leading to decreasing the discriminative ratio φ(I eval ) on eval-D (and thus the accuracy on the evaluation data). This insight suggests that we should maintain more intra-class variation on the pretraining dataset when transferring the model to a target dataset which has a larger semantic distance from the pretraining dataset.</p></div>

Byol is used as a representative method for comparisons in backbone analysis and object detection. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, we use LARS optimizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref> with a cosine decay learning rate schedule and a warm-up of 10 epochs to pretrain the network. The initial learning rate is set to 4.8. We set the batch size to 4096 and the initial exponential moving average parameter τ to 0.99. Except for the backbone analysis, we use ResNet50 as the default backbone. More detailed pretraining setups of different backbones and different methods are provided in Supplementary H.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Experimental Results</head><p>Generalize to unseen concepts with diverse backbones. We verify the effectiveness of the added MLP projector on SL using concept generalization task with different backbones. Following evaluation method mentioned in Sec. 3.1, we train a linear classifier with the frozen backbone for 100 epochs, and report the top-1 accuracy on eval-D in Tab. 2. Firstly, SL-MLP obtains better performance than SL among different backbones. Specifically, with ResNet50, SL-MLP improves SL to 63.1 (+7.2%) when we pretrain the model by only 100 epochs, which bridges the performance gap between SL and Byol. In 300 epochs setting, SL has a transferability drop compared to 100 epochs setting (55.9%→54.4%), but the transferability of SL-MLP continue to increase (63.1%→64.1%). Secondly, SL-MLP (64.1%) performs better than Byol (62.3%) when both are trained by 300 epochs. Experimental results in Tab. 2 also confirm that SL-MLP can consistently improve the transferability of SL on various backbones, e.g. ResNet101 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, MobileNetv2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, and EfficientNetb2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p><p>Generalize to other classification tasks. To evaluate if the added MLP can help SL to transfer better on crossdomain tasks, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, we pretrain the model on ImageNet-1K, and evaluate the transferability on 12 classification datasets from different domains. As illustrated in Tab. 4, supervised pretraining methods with the MLP projector, i.e., SL-MLP and SupCon, outperform their no MLP counterparts, i.e., SL and SupCon w/o MLP on linear evaluation, by 5.79%, 13.71% on the averaged Top-1 accuracy, respectively. Consistent results can be observed on finetuning and few-shot learning settings. Besides, by comparing SupCon, SL-MLP and SupCon w/o MLP, SL, we conclude that the MLP projector instead of the contrastive loss plays the key role in increasing transferability. Our conclusion contrasts with previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57]</ref> because they ignore the MLP projector before the contrastive loss.</p><p>Generalize to object detection. We assess the transferability improvement by the MLP projector on COCO object detection task. We follow the settings in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> to finetune the whole network with 1× schedule. In Tab. We analyze the influence of different components on discriminative ratio φ on pre-D, Feature Mixtureness Π, feature redundancy R qualitatively and quantitatively in Supplementary D.3. Besides, we also observe an interesting phenomenon on Tab. 5(e) that only inserting a lightweight BN-ReLU also achieves good transfer performance. As this is not our main focus, we will investigate it in future works. Epochs and layers. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>(a) shows that adding one MLP projector achieves the optimal transferability. In addition, larger pretraining epochs benefit the transferability of SL-MLP when one MLP projector is added, but it has little influence when more MLP projectors are used. SL-MLP is less sensitive to batch size. Most unsupervised methods depend on big mini-batches to train a representation with strong transferability. To investigate the sensitivity of SL-MLP to batch size, we do experiments with batch size from 256 to 4096 for Byol and to 1024 for SL-MLP over 300 epochs. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>(b), the transferability of Byol drops when the batch size decreases. In contrast, the transferability of SL-MLP retains when batch size changes. SL-MLP is less sensitive to augmentation. Unsupervised methods benefit from a broader space of colors and more intensive augmentations during pretraining, which always lead to undesirable degradation when some augmentations are missing. Supervised models trained merely with hori-   zontal flipping may perform well <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>. We set Byol's augmentations as a baseline setting for both SL-MLP and Byol.</p><p>We then compare the robustness on augmentation between SL-MLP and Byol by removing augmentation step by step. Experiments of SL-MLP and Byol are all constructed on their default condition with only augmentations changed.</p><p>The results are illustrated on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10(c</ref>). We find that SL-MLP inherits the robustness of SL and shows a little accuracy drop with simple augmentations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Limitations and Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we study the transferability gap between supervised and unsupervised pretraining. Based on empirical results, we identify that the MLP projector is a key factor for the good transferability of unsupervised pretraining methods. By adding an MLP projector into supervised pretraining methods, we close the gap between supervised and unsupervised pretraining and even make supervised pretraining better. Our finding is confirmed with extensive experiments on diverse backbone networks and various downstream tasks, including the concept generalization tasks, cross-domain image classifications, and objection detection. While the MLP is a simple design for better transferability, there might exist some straightforward designs on the objective function, which we leave for future work. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Visualization of Feature Mixtureness</head><p>We provide an intuitive understanding of the relation between Feature Mixtureness and the feature distribution distance by manually generating two sets of features with different distribution distance. We use red and blue to represent class centers from pre-D and eval-D, respectively. The visualization results are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>. From (a) to (c), when the distribution distance between pre-D and eval-D increases, Feature Mixtureness decreases accordingly. When we fix the variance of features in pre-D and gradually enlarge the variance of features in eval-D (from (d) to (f)), Feature Mixtureness will decrease as well. Based on the observations above, we conclude that our Feature Mixtureness can empirically measure the feature distribution distance between pre-D and eval-D.</p></div>

Different colors represent different classes. In SL, the intra-class variation will continuously decrease to a small value with more training epochs. In contrast, the intra-class variance of SL-MLP and Byol retains even though we pretrain the networks at large pretraining epochs. This visualization graphically validates that the MLP projector can enlarge the intra-class variation of features in pre-D.</p></div>

By using the method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, we visualize the maximum response of convolution channels in layer 4 of ResNet50 (seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) pretrained with methods without-MLP, i.e. SL, Mocov1, and Byol w/o MLP, and methods with-MLP, i.e. SL-MLP, Mocov1 w/ MLP, and Byol. Specifically, given a backbone with fixed parameters θ as f (•; θ), we denote the parameters before the convolution channel j as f (•; θ j ), we optimize the most representative sample x i of the convolution channel j by maximizing the output logits f (x; θ j ), i.e., x i = argmax x (f (x; θ j )), where x is optimized from a random initialized image x 0 .</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">18</ref>, methods without-MLP (Mocov1, Byol w/o MLP, SL) learn more knowledge about animals from pre-D, highlighted by red rectangles. This is due to that we select classes of organisms to construct pre-D. Instead, we find that methods with-MLP (Mocov1 w/ MLP, Byol, SL-MLP) learn more texture information. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>, high-level semantic information is less critical to transfer learning, which explains effectiveness of the MLP.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H.1. Pretraining</head><p>For SL and SL-MLP, we use the SGD optimizer with a cosine decay learning rate of 0.4 with Nesterov momentum of 0.9 to optimize all the networks and set the batch size to 1024. A 3 epochs warm-up with a starting learninig rate of 0.1 is applied. The weight decay of ResNets, MobileNetv2, EfficientNetb2 is set to 1 × 10 −4 , 5 × 10 −5 , 1 × 10 −5 , respectively. Data augmentations include random-crop (224x224), color-jitter, and random horizontal flip. For SupCon and SupCon w/o MLP pretraining, we set the temperature parameter to τ = 0.07, and queue size to 65596. We use random-crop (224x224), color-jitter, random gray-scale, Gaussian blur, random horizontal flip for pretraining data augmentations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H.2. Concept Generalization Task</head><p>In unseen generalization task, we divide ImageNet-1K into two class-exclusive datasets following the hierarchical structure built in WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> -one for pretraining (denoted as pre-D) and the other for evaluation (denoted as eval-D). Eval-D has 348 classes of instrumentality, and pre-D contains 652 classes mostly of organisms. All the networks are pretrained on pre-D, and then examined by linear evaluation protocal on eval-D. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, we train a linear classifier with the frozen backbone for 100 epochs. During evaluation, images are resized to 256 pixels, after which 224 × 224 center crop is used. We optimize the cross-entropy loss with SGD optimizer with cosine decay scheduler with Nesterov momentum of 0.9 over 100</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Comparing (a) and (b), we can see adding a fully connected layer can hardly increase Feature Mixtureness between pre-D and eval-D. Comparing (c-d) with (b), we can conclude that the batch normalization layer and the ReLU layer can increase Feature Mixtureness between pre-D and eval-D. Comparing (b-d) with (e), we can summarize that the batch normalization and the ReLU layer are the most important components. A batch normalization layer with a ReLU layer can significantly increase Feature Mixtureness between pre-D and eval-D, which has already been similar to Feature Mixtureness when the MLP projector has the complete architectural.</figDesc></figure>

ReLU, a batch normalization layer can increase Feature Mixtureness, reduce discriminative ratio, which could improve transferability of the pretrained model. Specifically, the ReLU layer brings a little improvement on feature redundancy. Comparing (a,b) with (c,e), we can conclude that BN not only reduces the discriminative ratio on pre-D, but also increases Feature Mixtureness. BN has a significant influence on future redundancy, which reduces feature redundancy by 50% (from 0.0671 to 0.0369). Last but not least, the combination of all components achieves the best transferability with the lowest feature redundancy, the highest Feature Mixtureness and a relatively large intra-class variation.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell>Components</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Exp</cell><cell>Input FC BN ReLU Output FC</cell><cell cols="2">Top-1 D pre inter /D pre intra</cell><cell>Π(↑)</cell><cell>R(↓)</cell></row><row><cell>(a)</cell><cell></cell><cell>55.9</cell><cell>2.034</cell><cell cols="2">0.515 0.0776</cell></row><row><cell>(b)</cell><cell></cell><cell>56.6</cell><cell>1.505</cell><cell cols="2">0.679 0.0671</cell></row><row><cell>(c)</cell><cell></cell><cell>61.0</cell><cell>1.269</cell><cell cols="2">0.870 0.0369</cell></row><row><cell>(d)</cell><cell></cell><cell>60.1</cell><cell>1.362</cell><cell cols="2">0.804 0.0654</cell></row><row><cell>(e)</cell><cell></cell><cell>60.5</cell><cell>1.045</cell><cell cols="2">0.846 0.0369</cell></row><row><cell>SL-MLP</cell><cell></cell><cell>62.5</cell><cell>1.124</cell><cell cols="2">0.871 0.0351</cell></row><row><cell cols="6">ratio on pre-D.

The statistics of datasets are illustrated in Tab. 8. Linear Evaluation. For fixed-feature linear evaluation, we add a linear layer on the frozen pretrained backbone to train the model on the downstream datasets. A batch normalization layer is added between the backbone and linear layer. All models are trained for 50 epochs with step learning scheduler which decreases the learning rate by 0.1 at epoch 25 and 37. 70% of the training set is used for training and the rest is used for validation, the models are then trained with • learning rate: 0.001, 0.01, 0.1;</p><p>• batch size: 32, 128;</p><p>• weight decay: 0, 1 × 10 −4 , 1 × 10 −5 .</p><p>The optimal hyperparameters are chosen based on the performance on the validation set. The top-1 accuracy is reported as the evaluation metric. Full Network Finetuning. In full network finetuning, the whole pretrained backbone and a linear classifier are trained on the downstream dataset. All models are trained for 50 epochs with step learning scheduler which decreases the learning rate by 0.1 at epoch 25 and 37. A batch normalization layer is added between the backbone and linear layer to make the extracted features comparable among different models.

Few-shot Learning. For few-shot learning, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, we use a logistic regression layer on the top of the features during meta-testing phase. The implementation from scikit-learn is used for logistic regression.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I.1. Few-shot Recognition Results</head><p>Using the code provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, we pretrain all models over 300 epochs with a cosine decay learning scheduler on ImageNet-1K, and then testing on 12 downstream datasets (shown in Tab.8). We provide 5-ways 5-shots and 20-shots results in Tab. 9. All reported accuracy is the mean of 600 randomly sampled tasks. Comparing average results among different methods, we observe that supervised pretraining methods with the MLP projector, i.e. SL-MLP and SupCon, outperform their no MLP counterparts, i.e. SL and SupCon w/o MLP, on both 5-ways 5-shots and 20-shots few-shot classification tasks. Table <ref type="table">9</ref>. 5-ways 5-shots and 20-shots classification performance on 12 downstream datasets in terms of top-1 accuracy. Using the code in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, we pretrain all models over 300 epochs on ImageNet-1K. The reported accuracy is the mean of 600 randomly sampled tasks. Average results style: best, second best.  Table <ref type="table">10</ref>. Linear evaluation results and top-1 accuracy during pretraining on SL and SL-MLP.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I.2. Ablation on Hidden Units and Output Dimensions</head><p>On concept generalization task, we also explore whether hidden units and output dimensions of the added MLP projector influence the final transferability. We pretrain SL-MLP on pre-D over 100 epochs using various hidden units and output dimensions of the added MLP projector, and report the evaluation results on eval-D (illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">19</ref>). We observe that, different from other unsupervised pretraining methods, e.g. BYOL and SimCLR, where the output dimension of the MLP projector have considerable impacts on transferability, the hidden units and output dimensions of the added MLP projector has little influence on the performance of SL-MLP. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>J. Pretrain Results on pre-D</head><p>We also provide the top-1 accuracy of SL-MLP on pre-D in Tab. 10. We remove the MLP in SL-MLP for linear evaluation on pre-D, only the fixed backbones of SL and SL-MLP are used to train new classifiers over 100 epochs. We also report top-1 accuracy during pretraining in which accuracy of the whole SL-MLP is reported. Which features are used to evaluate these two metrics are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">20</ref>. As backbones and classifiers are jointly trained during pretraining, classifiers are not well optimized at small pretraining epochs. Thus, models always achieve better performance on linear evaluation at small pretraining epochs because linear evaluation provides more epochs for networks to optimize better classifiers on fixed backbones. For SL, two evaluation methods display the same result at epoch 100, as they have all trained well-optimized classifiers.</p><p>Note that SL-MLP shows slight −2.6% performance drop (80.8% to 78.2%) on linear evaluation when SL and SL-MLP have all been pretrained over 100 epochs, which achieves closer performance gap than Exemplar-v2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref> when compared with SL. Besides, as SL-MLP only adds an MLP projector before the classifier, the whole SL-MLP shows almost the same performance of SL on top-1 accuracy during pretraining at epoch 100.</p></div>			</div>
