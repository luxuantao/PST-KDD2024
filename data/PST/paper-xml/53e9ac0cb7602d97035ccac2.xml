<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar is an emerging technology that has significant potential for advancing the state-of-the-art of modern radar. When orthogonal waveforms are transmitted, with + ( transmit and receive) antennas, an -element filled virtual array can be obtained. To successfully utilize such an array for high-resolution MIMO radar imaging, constant-modulus transmit signal synthesis and optimal receive filter design play critical roles. We present in this paper a computationally attractive cyclic optimization algorithm for the synthesis of constant-modulus transmit signals with good auto-and cross-correlation properties. Then we go on to discuss the use of an instrumental variables approach to design receive filters that can be used to minimize the impact of scatterers in nearby range bins on the received signals from the range bin of interest (the so-called range compression problem).

In this literature, the design tools used are either analytical in nature or they are based on computationally intensive optimization approaches. However, using such tools or approaches appears to be feasible only for synthesizing transmitted pulses with rather small sample numbers (hundreds of samples or less). In many radar imaging applications, the number of data samples of the transmitted pulses can be rather large (thousands of samples or more; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>).</p><p>We present in this paper a computationally attractive cyclic optimization algorithm for the synthesis of constant-modulus transmit signals with good auto-and cross-correlation properties.

The transmit signal synthesis and receive filter design could be formulated as a single optimization problem. However, the resulting problem would be rather difficult to solve. We consider the signal synthesis and receive filter design in two separate steps. We show that there exists an interplay between them: A flexible receive filter design approach, such as the IV approach introduced in the paper, can be used to compensate for missing features of the transmitted signals that could not be easily realized by the synthesis procedure (such as a higher than desired peak sidelobe level in the down-range dimension of the image).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. FORMULATION OF THE SIGNAL SYNTHESIS PROBLEM</head><p>Consider a MIMO radar equipped with transmit antennas. Each antenna transmits a relatively long (compared to the maximum round trip delay difference between the nearest and farthest range bins of the radar footprint) train of modulated subpulses towards the area of interest. The said subpulses may be rectangular or they may have a different shape-we will not be concerned with the subpulse design in this paper. In any case, the subpulse train will have a much smaller peak power than a single subpulse, at the same total transmitted energy. Let denote the number of subpulses transmitted by each antenna. Let the columns of be the modulating code sequences, referred to as the transmitted signals or waveforms. The signal that arrives at each of the receive antennas of the radar system is first demodulated (by means of subpulse matched filtering) and then analog-to-digital converted.</p><p>We assume that (typically ). The th transmitted constant-modulus signal has the form: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where is the th element of . The constant-modulus requirement is imposed for energy-efficient transmission and transmit circuit (amplifiers, D/A converters, etc.) considerations. In some literature, (1) is said to define polyphase sequences (sometimes, this name is reserved for the case in which the phases take on values in a finite set; here we will not constrain the set of in any way, for generality's sake). Let</p><p>(2) Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Depending on the size of the radar footprint and the length of the transmitted pulses, the returned pulses can overlap significantly. denote the (cross)-correlation of and at lag . For least-squares (LS) (i.e., matched filtering)-based MIMO radar imaging applications, as well as in other related applications such as MIMO communications, an important requirement on is that they have "good correlation properties." Mathematically, this requirement can be met, for example, by designing the signals so that the following criterion is minimized:</p><p>(3) where is an integer. Note that here may denote the maximum round trip delay (measured in terms of the number of sampling intervals) between near and far ranges of the imaging spot (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and further discussion on this aspect below). In other words, minimizing (3) means that we minimize the sum of the sidelobe levels (for ) of the autocorrelation functions (note that ) as well as the sum of the cross-correlation functions at all lags ( for ). This is needed because in a LS range-compression operation, the signals received by the radar are matched filtered by multiplying them with the transmitted signals, appropriately delayed for the range bin of current interest; then signals backscattered to the radar by scatterers from other range bins (such as range bins adjacent to the one of interest) will be attenuated in the range-compression stage only if (3) be minimized (in this way, a weak scatterer in a range bin of interest will not be masked by the reflection from a strong scatterer in another bin).</p><p>In a MIMO radar imaging application, the value of is determined by the maximum expected difference between the arrival times of the backscattered signals from the range bin of interest and of the signals from other range bins. Note that in the previous literature on signal waveform design, was almost always chosen to be . However, and are determined by the specific applications the radar is designed for. In many radar imaging applications, is chosen to be sufficiently large so that <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. For this case, the returned pulses from near and far ranges can overlap significantly (as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. We will show later on that from the transmit signal synthesis point of view, it is an advantage to have the returned pulses significantly overlap with one another; i.e., there are good reasons for selecting (possibly ). Note that , which equals the number of lags at which the auto-and cross correlations of the transmitted sequences must be minimized, basically signifies the number of design constraints, whereas represents the degree-of-freedom of waveform design.</p><p>As already mentioned in the Section I, there is an extensive literature on the design of such that (3) takes on some small value (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and the references therein). In some recent literature on this topic, the stated design problem was tackled by minimizing (3) with respect to . This is a computationally intensive task that cannot be done unless and are "small": and</p><p>. For larger values of and , solving the said minimization problem becomes computationally prohibitive, in spite of some special minimization algorithms suggested in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This limitation on the values allowed for may provide a partial explanation as to why the previous literature has focused on : indeed, if must be kept "small" (for computational reasons), then we have to choose to avoid limiting the value of unduly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. CYCLIC ALGORITHM FOR CONSTANT-MODULUS SIGNAL SYNTHESIS</head><p>The approach proposed in the following is much simpler computationally than those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, which makes it possible to work with quite large values of (in some radar imaging applications, we can have</p><p>). This means that we can choose first, from practical considerations, and then select on computational as well as practical operational accounts. The advantage of being able to do so will become clear shortly.</p><p>We begin by reformulating the problem slightly. Let be the following block-Toeplitz matrix: . . . </p><p>Note that is . The auto-and cross correlations that appear in (3) are the elements of the positive-semidefinite matrix . Consequently, a criterion related to (3) but which has a more compact form than (3) is the following:</p><p>(5)</p><p>We refer to (5) as the generalized correlation coefficient, and we use it to evaluate the correlation quality of a waveform.</p><p>If , as it is usually assumed in the previous literature, then for , and therefore . The consequence is that the matrix cannot be exactly equal to even if we relax the constant-modulus requirement on the elements of and the block-Toeplitz structure requirement. In fact, because is singular in such a case, it follows that the maximum magnitude of its off-diagonal elements must be of the order or larger; consequently, the ratio between and is of the order but not smaller. As will be shown numerically later on, by allowing , we can achieve smaller ratios. In what follows, we assume that possibly ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) Under ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>), if we relax any requirement on the elements and the structure of , then the class of matrices that satisfy the equality is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(7)</ref> where is an arbitrary semi-unitary matrix, i.e., . Using this observation, we can reformulate (3) or ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) in the following related (but not equivalent) way: <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8)</ref> While this is a nonconvex problem, the following cyclic minimization algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, that is conceptually and computationally simple and also has good local convergence properties, can be used to solve <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8)</ref>.</p><p>We first summarize the steps of the cyclic algorithm (CA) and then describe each step in detail.</p></div>

(Note that for , the generalized correlation coefficient is too large to be of any practical interest.) We note that as increases, we achieve the goal of obtaining probing signals with small auto-and cross correlations much more effectively. Additional simulation examples (not shown here) demonstrate that although the waveforms synthesized via CA are not strictly orthogonal to one another, when is reasonably large, the beampattern of the transmit array (see the definition and discussion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>) is nearly identical to the beampattern of each individual antenna of the array (assuming that all the antennas in the transmit array have the same beampattern).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. RECEIVE FILTER DESIGN VIA IV RANGE COMPRESSION</head><p>At the signal generation and transmission phase, discussed in the previous section, we have focused on achieving constantmodulus and good auto-and cross-correlation properties. At the signal processing stage, we need to consider other important constraints. To explain how these constraints occur, we need a few details about the data model for a MIMO radar system. As usual, we divide the imaging scene into down-range bins and cross-range (angle) bins, which form the grid points. For illustration purposes, we chose the down-range grid as one bin per sample, with the sampling rate at the receiver equal to the one for the transmitted samples. To reduce the loss of the signal-to-noise ratio for targets not located exactly on the grid points, we can choose a finer grid-the extension to a finer grid is straightforward.</p><p>We assume that the number of receive antennas is . Let denote the transmit waveform matrix as discussed in the previous section. Then the received data matrix of such a system (assuming intrapulse Doppler effects negligible) can be written as (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>): <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(13)</ref> where and are the receive and, respectively, transmit steering vectors for the scatterers in the range bin of current interest, are the complex amplitudes (proportional to the radar cross-sections) of these scatterers, , , and along with have the same meaning but are for the scatterers in other range bins that surround the bin of interest, is a "shift" matrix that takes into account the fact that the signals reflected by the scatterers in adjacent range bins need different propagation times to reach the radar receiver (see below for more details on ), and is an interference-plus-noise matrix whose columns are assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random vectors with mean zero and covariance matrix . Moreover, and are generic numbers that can be set to the number of the grid points of the image in the cross-range (angle) dimension. To define the shift matrix , assume that is the number of additional sampling intervals that are needed by a backscattered signal coming from an adjacent range bin to reach the radar receiver, compared with the signal from the range bin of interest; then . . . <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref> The above definition of is valid for . For , should be defined as the transpose of the matrix in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref>.</p><p>Most MIMO radar techniques for detection or parameter estimation of the scatterers in the range bin of interest use matched filtering (i.e., postmultiplying by ) for range compression. However, whereas the matched filter (MF) maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), it does not maximize the signal-toclutter ratio (SCR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>, where the SCR for MIMO radar is defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref> In fact, MF relies implicitly on the assumption that the second and third terms in ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) are uncorrelated with . Note that when this assumption is true, then matched filtering will have the beneficial effect of significantly attenuating the second (out-ofrange) term in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(13)</ref>. For this to happen, we may need, for example, that 50 dB, . However, enforcing orthogonality among the transmitted waveforms as well as requiring such good autocorrelation properties at the signal generation phase significantly complicates the waveform synthesis problem. It may even be possible that such a constrained optimization problem is infeasible.</p><p>To avoid the difficulty indicated above, we do not require strict orthogonality among the waveforms nor do we impose any hard constraint on the autocorrelation properties at the signal generation stage. Consequently, we just try to do the best we can regarding both the auto-and cross-correlation properties of the transmitted waveforms by formulating the signal generation problem as in (3), (5), or <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8)</ref>.</p><p>Then, depending on the synthesized waveforms, the radar system performance can be clutter limited since the clutter is often stronger than the noise, and the possible interferences in are usually directional and can therefore be suppressed spatially via adaptive array techniques. Hence, we need to design a receive filter so that i) the residual term due to signals reflected by scatterers from other range bins than the one of interest is attenuated to the desired level, and ii) the interference-plus-noise term is kept as small as possible.</p><p>Inspired by the method of instrumental variables (IV) used in time-series analysis, system identification, and array processing (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, and the references therein), to achieve the above goals we postmultiply by another matrix in lieu of postmultiplying by . The result is <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16)</ref> where <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref> We choose the receive "filtering" matrix such that <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(18)</ref> Let the SVD of be denoted as <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(19)</ref> where is , is , and is . Let <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(20)</ref> and which guarantees that . The class of matrices that satisfy ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21)</ref> where is a semiunitary matrix whose columns span the null space of or (which means that and hence that ), and is an arbitrary matrix. Because we assume that the matrix has full column rank, the dimensions of and are and, respectively, . We will choose in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21)</ref> to attenuate the second term in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16)</ref>. Usually are unknown, so we will select such that </p><p>and ( <ref type="formula">25</ref>)</p><p>Then ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>) becomes ( <ref type="formula">26</ref>) Next, we note that the number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) in the IV filtering matrix is equal to the number of DOFs of , which is . This compares favorably with the number of DOFs in the matched filtering matrix ; the latter number can in fact be much less than : indeed, since the elements of are required to have constant modulus, then the number of DOFs in is equal to , which is about half of ; moreover, most of the DOFs in are used to satisfy before they could be used for <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref>. Hence, appears to have many more DOFs for the satisfaction of ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>) than does for enforcing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref>.</p><p>The use of the IV matrix to obtain a "data" model with the desired properties can therefore lead to a more significant attenuation of the response term corresponding to uninteresting range bins, than the use of can. However, this is achieved at the cost of lowering the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Note that (27) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(28)</ref> Note that if , then , too. Hence, the SINR loss of the IV filter relative to the matched filter is due to the additional term . Since is unknown, we can try to minimize (or, alternatively, ) to keep (28) small, and therefore minimize the SINR loss relative to the matched filter. Hence, we can select such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">s.t. (<label>29</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>The optimization problem in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">29</ref>) is a convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which can be solved efficiently in polynomial time using public-domain software packages (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>).</p><p>Remarks: When ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) is satisfied, the first term of ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) becomes , and by stacking the columns of this matrix on top of each other, we get . Therefore, the steering vector of the virtual array of the MIMO radar is . This explains why when a filled -element ULA is used as the receive array and a sparse -element ULA with -wavelength interelement spacing is used as the transmit array, the virtual array is a filled -element ULA. When the virtual array is used for radar imaging alone, the cross-range resolution is determined by the aperture length of the virtual array. When the virtual array is used to form a much longer synthetic aperture, the cross-range resolution can be much improved. For the case of virtual ULA, a standard window function (such as the Taylor window) can be applied to the synthetic aperture to reduce the sidelobe level in the cross-range dimension. However, the standard data-independent window function reduces the sidelobe level at the cost of poorer resolution and is incapable of suppressing strong interferences. We will show in Section V that adaptive techniques presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> can be used instead to achieve high resolution, low sidelobe levels, and interference rejection in the cross-range dimension, after range compression via the IV filtering matrix .</p><p>Finally, we emphasize that both the signal synthesis and receiver design algorithms presented above are data-independent and hence both the synthesized waveform matrix and the optimal receive filter matrix can be precomputed offline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. NUMERICAL ILLUSTRATIONS</head><p>We present below several numerical examples demonstrating the performance of using CA for signal synthesis and IV for receive filter design. We also examine the effectiveness of using these two methods together with adaptive methods for radar image formation. Both the transmit and receive arrays are uniform linear arrays with antennas. We consider a MIMO radar system with array configuration of (2.5, 0.5). The two numbers inside the parentheses indicate the interelement spacings (in units of wavelengths) of the transmit and receive arrays, respectively. The transmitted probing signals are constant modulus waveforms. The array signal-to-noise ratio (ASNR) is defined as</p><p>, where denotes the sum of the signal powers of all transmit antennas, and is the variance of the additive white thermal noise. Hence, in the absence of interference (or jamming), we assume that . We also assume that and .</p><p>In the examples below, either we use CA for waveform synthesis or we employ QPSK Hadamard codes ( QPSK sequences composed by Hadamard codes) of length scrambled by a pseudo-noise (PN) sequence of length . The Hadamard codes are orthogonal to each other and the PN sequence has good autocorrelation properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Signal Synthesis and Receiver Design</head><p>We compare the performance of MF with that of the IV filter in the absence of interference or jamming. For fair comparison purposes, we use the following MF in lieu of :</p><p>(30) which is the original MF scaled by so that, like for the IV filter, . Therefore, the MF operation consists of postmultiplying by . To compare the performance of the MF and IV filters, we define the relative sidelobe level of IV as (31) and the corresponding relative sidelobe level of MF is obtained by replacing the above with . We also define the SINR Loss (in decibels) of the IV filter as compared to the MF filter as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">SINRLoss SINR SINR (<label>32</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">SINR (<label>33</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">)</formula><p>(SINR is defined similarly by replacing the above with ). Note that for illustration purposes, we have assumed in (33) that the signal power is simply . Furthermore, the signal-to-clutter-and-noise Ratio (SCNR) for the IV filter is defined as: SCNR (34) The SCNR for the MF filter is defined similarly, replacing above with . Again, for illustration purposes, we have assumed in (34) that the clutter power is simply the second term in the denominator of (34).</p><p>Consider first the case where we employ QPSK Hadamard codes of length scrambled by a pseudo-noise (PN) sequence of length as the transmitted waveforms. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> shows the relative sidelobe levels of both the MF and IV filters when ASNR 40 dB. We note that the IV filter can achieve the prescribed sidelobe level of 50 dB, while the MF filter has a much higher sidelobe level. The SINR Loss of the IV filter relative to the MF filter is 8.8766 dB. On the other hand, the SCNR of the IV filter is 32.7132 dB, which is much higher than the SCNR of 0.9169 dB for the MF filter.</p><p>Consider next the use of the CA algorithm for signal synthesis. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> shows the corresponding relative sidelobe levels of both the MF and IV filters when ASNR 40 dB. We can see from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> that the MF filter has very low sidelobe levels at some range bins due to optimizing the auto-and cross correlations of the waveforms. The SCNR of the MF filter is also much larger than the one in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> (31.8825 versus 0.9169 dB). However, for the MF filter the sidelobe levels have some variations and the prespecified sidelobe level may not be satisfied. The IV filter can again be used to achieve the prespecified sidelobe level of 50 dB. Due to the optimized transmitted waveforms, the SINR Loss of the IV filter relative to the MF filter for this case is much smaller than the one in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> (0.0017 versus 8.8766 dB), while the SCNR value stays at about the same level.</p></div>

The steering vector differences are manifested as phase factors dependent on the data collection position .

However, to apply the adaptive techniques for MIMO radar image formation and interference suppression, we arrange the data matrices as in (35). The dimension of is . We assume that and in our numerical examples. The MIMO radar data matrix obtained after the MF filtering is similar except that the in (35) is replaced with . Consider first using the QPSK Hadamard codes scrambled by a PN sequence as the transmitted waveforms. The MIMO radar image formed by using the data-independent delay-and-sum (DAS) approach (i.e., a least-squares (LS) approach in cross-range <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>) is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6(b)</ref>. Note that the DAS approach fails to provide a clean image due to the presence of the strong jammer and due to the interferences from the scatterers in the neighboring range bins. We have considered forming the MIMO radar image by using the following data-adaptive methods: the robust Capon beamformer (RCB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>, the standard Capon beamformer (SCB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, the amplitude and phase estimation (APES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, the generalized likelihood-ratio test (GLRT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>, and the refined combined Capon and APES (CAPES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> methods. All these data-adaptive methods perform much better than the data-independent DAS due to their capabilities of jamming suppression. For the sake of conciseness, we will only show the results of the refined CAPES. CAPES was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> to reap the benefits of both Capon (which has high resolution) and APES (which gives accurate amplitude estimates).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>(c) is obtained by using the MF filter for range compression. The refined CAPES image in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6(c</ref>) is obtained by showing the results of CAPES only at the locations where the corresponding GLRT values are above a given threshold (0.1 in this example) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>). (Note that a higher threshold will decrease both the probability of detection and the probability of false alarm.) Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>(d) is similar to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>(c), except that the IV filter is used for range compression, with a relative sidelobe level of 50 dB. Note that the number of false alarms is reduced significantly as a result of using the IV filter at the receiver.</p><p>Consider next using the waveforms optimized via the CA algorithm for MIMO radar imaging. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>(e) and (f) are similar to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6(c</ref>) and (d), respectively, except that the transmitted waveforms are those synthesized via CA. Note that due to transmitting optimized waveforms, the number of false alarms in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>(e) is much smaller than that in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6(c</ref>). Moreover, there is no false alarm observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>(f), which is obtained by using the IV filter together with the CA-optimized transmitted waveforms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS</head><p>Constant-modulus transmit signal synthesis and receive filter design play critical roles in many MIMO radar applications including MIMO radar imaging. The design of constant-modulus transmit signal waveforms with good auto-and cross-correlation properties is an interesting and challenging research topic. We have presented a computationally attractive cyclic optimization algorithm for the synthesis of such transmit signals. When there are no strict requirements on the peak sidelobe levels, the signal waveforms synthesized via CA can be used directly in MIMO radar applications. When strict requirements on the peak sidelobe levels are imposed (e.g., 50-dB relative sidelobe level), the optimization problem at the signal synthesis stage becomes rather complicated and may even be infeasible. We have taken an alternative route and proposed a "filtering" operation based on the use of an instrumental variables (IV) matrix, which can be effectively designed via solving a convex QCQP problem in polynomial time to achieve the desired goals at the cost of a slight loss in the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques have been demonstrated using numerical examples.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
