<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The increasing demand for providing expert level medical diagnosis and treatment remotely has attracted a wide interest on wireless body area networks (WBANs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. As a subgroup of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), WBANs have been implemented to continuous measure and monitor vital parameters of aging population and patients with chronic diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. A WBAN mainly consists of wearable/implanted (bio-) medical sensors and portable personal device (PPD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, where the intelligent sensors of WBAN can monitor the health/motion information of people with different degrees of physical and mental disabilities, while PPD is employed to ensure the reliable message delivery between the sensors and the application providers (APs) such as the physician, hospital or medical staff <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Several key applications ranging from remote health monitoring to military/fitness training can and improving the patient/elder's experience, WBANs have become increasingly attractive to industry and academia <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>With the continuing development of WBANs, users' concerns about the privacy of their sensitive physiological information such that these data can only be accessed by the authorized parties become the main obstacles impede WBANs from wide adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. However, security design for WBANs is nontrivial when the unique features of WBANs, such as the limited resources and mobility of body sensors, open medium of the communication channel and the lack of infrastructure, are taken into account. To allow the neighboring nodes in WBANs to share a common key, Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> proposed a novel key agreement scheme by using the electrocardiogram signals. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> suggested a group key agreement protocol that establishes shared secret keys between the WBAN sensors and the PPD from scratch. He et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> developed a secure admission and transmission protocol for WBSNs based on polynomial-based authentication to allow each sensor establishes an individual key shared with PPD and a pairwise key shared with another sensor node. Most of the existing security protocols were proposed for securing intrabody communication in WBANs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> or simply for privacy protection without an authentication mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Regarding to the security issues in the extra-body communication field, Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> suggested two certificateless remote anonymous authentication protocols along with an efficient certificateless signature by incorporating the idea of certificateless cryptography <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and Identitybased remote anonymous authentication protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> recently. Using the remote authentication protocols reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, a WBANs client and the requested AP can authenticate each other and share a session key to secure the subsequent communication. Furthermore, the privacy of the client can be realized without encryption operation. The certificateless anonymous remote authentication protocols in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> combine the merits of the remote anonymous authentication in the traditional public key infrastructure (PKI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and Identitybased public key cryptography (ID-PKC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, while saving from the inborn key escrow problem in ID-PKC <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and the heavy certificate management overhead in conventional PKI.</p><p>Unfortunately, we observe that the certificateless signature in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> cannot resist the attack mounted by the key replacement adversary <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Moreover, Liu et al.' certificateless authentication protocols cannot offer the feature of forward security <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. In particular, the session key in the previous round will be revealed if the long term private key  of the AP has been corrupted. Finally, Liu et al.' protocols did not address the scalability issue in the sense that the account information of the WBANs client must be distributed to the APs before the client can access the service offered by these APs .</p><p>To remedy the weaknesses in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, this paper proposes a scalable certificateless remote authentication protocol with anonymity and forward security for WBANs. Our major contributions can be summarized as follows:</p><p>• We first demonstrate that Liu et al. 's certificateless signature scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> is insecure against the public key replacement attack. After that, we show some weaknesses in Liu et al. 's certificateless remote anonymous authentication protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. • Next, we build a secure and lightweight certificateless remote authentication protocol by elaborately incorporating the certificateless encryption and two-party authenticated key agreement protocol. Our protocol is also shown to be secure under the standard computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption in the random oracle model <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Furthermore, our protocol not only provides mutual authentication, session key establishment, anonymity, unlinkability and nonrepudiation, but also achieves forward security, key escrow resilience and scalability. • Experimental simulation reveals that our protocol outperforms the previous protocols in terms of communication overhead and computation cost. In particular, our protocol reduces at least 52.6% and 17.6% of the overall running time and communication overhead compared with the most efficient ID-based remote anonymous authentication protocol in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, respectively, and the reduction in the computation cost and communication overhead achieves at least 73.8% and 55.8% respectively compared with upto-date certificateless remote authentication protocol in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Elliptic curve group</head><p>In this section, we review the notion of elliptic curve group along with the hard problem defined over it. Interested reader can refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> for the related mathematic background.</p><p>The elliptic curve E over a prime finite field F p (rather than the real numbers) represents the set of points (x, y) defined by the equation y 2 = x 3 + ax + b mod p with a, b ∈ R F p , and with the descriminant 4a 3 + 27b 2 = 0 mod p. This set of points on F p along with a distinguished point O at infinity {(x, y) | x, y ∈ F p ∧ E(x, y) = 0} ∪ {O} outline the curve E.</p><p>The curve E together with the point addition law " + " form a cyclic additive group G, where O is regarded as the identity element of this group. The group law (addition operation "+") is briefly defined as follows. Given P, Q ∈ G, the sum P + Q can be viewed as the reflected point of R about the x-axis. Here, the point R is the intersection between the curve E and the line l, where l is determined by P and Q in case P = Q, and l denotes the tangent line to E/F q in case P = Q. Moreover, a large multiples of a point P can be implemented as repeated addition operations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">mP = P + P + • • • + P mtimes .</formula><p>Definition 1: (Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) Assumption). Given a tuple {P, aP, bP } ∈ G for some a, b ∈ R Z * p , the CDH problem in G is to compute the element abP .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Bilinear Maps</head><p>Since bilinear maps are the basis of certificateless signature and authentication protocols in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, we briefly recall the main concepts and properties of bilinear pairings here.</p><p>Let G 1 and G 2 be a cyclic additive group generated by P of prime order q and a cyclic multiplicative group of the same order q, respectively. A computable bilinear map is a map e : G 1 × G 1 → G 2 featured with the following properties:</p><p>1) Bilinearity: For all P, Q ∈ G 1 , and a, b ∈ Z * q , e(aP, bQ) = e(P, Q) ab . 2) Non-degeneracy: There exists P, Q ∈ G 1 such that e(P, Q) = 1 G2 . 3) Computability: There is an efficient algorithm to compute e(P, Q) for all P, Q ∈ G 1 . Such a bilinear map e can be implemented by the modified Weil or Tate pairing defined on elliptic curves, and the details of the bilinear map can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. System model</head><p>The considered system consists of three types of entities: the WBAN client, the application provider (AP), and the network manager (NM), and the system model of WBAN can be found in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.</p><p>• WBAN client: All WBAN clients, equipped with certain WBAN terminals, i.e., wearable sensors, biosensor and portable medical device, need to be preloaded with public parameters and registered with the NM before they can access the medical services provided by AP. • AP: Medical institutions such as hospital, clinic or even weather forecast center also need to be preloaded with public parameters and registered with the NM before they serve as application providers (APs) to offer expertlevel medical treatment remotely to WBAN clients. The services provided by APs include the patient status monitoring and physician consultation, etc. • NM: NM is in charge of the registration of WBAN clients and APs. In general, NM is always assumed to be a commercial organization instead of a fully trusted third party. To derive the commercial benefits, it is very likely for the NM to illegally collect a client's personal health status by impersonating the AP or access the service offered by APs free of charge by impersonating the legitimate WBAN client. Therefore, it is desirable to avoid the key escrow problem in the sense that the NM cannot impersonate the clients or APs without being detected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Objectives</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and the analysis in section I, our design objectives are straightforward. (1) Anonymity: The real identity of the requesting client cannot be revealed by anyone.</p><p>(2) Unlinkability: Any two sessions should not be linked to the same client. (3) Mutual authentication: WBAN client and AP should be allowed to authenticate each other to avoid potential malicious attacks. (4) Session key establishment: A session key to secure the later communication should be established between WBAN client and AP after the successful authentication. (5) Forward security: The exchanged data in the previous session will still be secure even if the longterm private key of the participant has been corrupted. (6)  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. A BRIEF REVIEW OF PREVIOUS WORKS</head><p>In this section, we first briefly review Liu et al's certificateless signature scheme and certificateless remote anonymous authentication protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Then we demonstrate that their signature scheme fails to resist the public key replacement attack. Moreover, Liu et al's authentication protocols cannot offer forward security and scalability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Liu et al's certificateless signature scheme</head><p>• Setup: Given a security parameter l, two cyclic groups (G 1 , +) and (G 2 , •) with prime order q &gt; 2 l are chosen by the private key generator (PKG). Let P and e : G 1 × G 1 → G 2 denote the generator of G 1 and the bilinear pairing, respectively. The PKG also chooses two secure hash functions</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">H : {0, 1} * × G 1 → G 1 and h : {0, 1} * × G 2 → Z *</formula><p>q , picks a random s P KG ∈ Z * q as its master private key and sets Q P KG = s P KG P as its public key. Finally, PKG publishes the system parameter list as {l, G 1 , G 2 , q, P, e, H, h, Q P KG } and keeps s P KG secret.</p><p>• Set-Partial-Private-Key: This algorithm is performed by the signer to select s 1 ∈ Z * q randomly as its user private key.</p><p>• Set-Partial-Public-Key: This algorithm is performed by the signer to take as input the system parameter list and compute Q 1 = s 1 P as its user public key. • Partial-Private-Key-Extract: This algorithm is performed by the PKG to issue the partial private key to the signer according to its identity and user public key. Given the identity id and the user public key Q 1 of the signer, the PKG generates the partial private key S 2 = s P KG Q 2 for the signer, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Q 2 = H(id, Q 1 ). Here, &lt; id, Q 1 &gt;</formula><p>and &lt; s 1 , S 2 &gt; are regarded as the signer's full public key and private key respectively. • CL-Sign: To sign a message m, the signer, whose identity is id and the corresponding user public key is Q 1 , chooses k ∈ Z * q randomly and performs the following steps.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">1) Compute r = e(Q 2 , Q P KG ) k . 2) Compute v = h(m r, P ). 3) Compute U = kS 2 -vs 1 Q 2 . 4) Output (v, U ) ∈ (Z * q , G 1 )</formula><p>as the signature on message m.</p><p>• CL-Verify: To verify a signature (v, U ) issued by the signer with the identity id and the corresponding user public key Q 1 , the verifier performs the following steps.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">1) Compute Q 2 = H(id, Q 1 ).</formula><p>2) Verify whether the equation v</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">? = h(m e(U, P ) • e(Q 2 , Q 1 ) v , P ) holds or not.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Forgery attack of Liu et al's certificateless signature scheme</head><p>Due to the lack of the public key certificates issued by the certificate authority (CA), it is reasonable to assume that the adversary can replace the original user public key with a false user public key chosen by himself <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. If the key replacement attack is considered, it is easy to show that Liu et al.'s certificateless signature is forgeable. A publickey-replacement adversary can perform the following steps to generate a valid signature on any message m * . 1) Choose s * 1 ∈ Z * q randomly and compute</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Q * 1 = s * 1 P . 2) Replace the signer's user public key with Q * 1 . 3) Choose k ∈ Z * q randomly and computes r = e(Q 2 , P ) k where Q 2 = H(id, Q * 1 )</formula><p>and id denotes a valid user's identity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Compute</head><formula xml:id="formula_9">v = h(m * r, P ). 5) Compute U = kQ 2 -vs * 1 Q 2 . 6) Output (v, U ) ∈ (Z * q , G 1 )</formula><p>as the signature on message m * . It is obvious that the forged signature on the message m * is valid under the replaced public key Q * 1 and the identity id. Anyone can verify the validity of this signature by performing the CL-Verify algorithm as follows.</p><p>1</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">) Compute Q 2 = H(id, Q * 1 ). 2) Verify whether the equation v ? = h(m * e(U, P ) • e(Q 2 , Q * 1 )</formula><p>v , P ) holds or not. This verification will pass due to the fact that</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">v = h(m * r, P ) = h(m * e(Q 2 , P ) k , P ) = h(m * e(kQ 2 , P ), P ) = h(m * e(kQ 2 -vs * 1 Q 2 + vs * 1 Q 2 , P ), P ) = h(m * e(U, P ) • e(s * 1 Q 2 , P ) v , P ) = h(m * e(U, P ) • e(Q 2 , Q * 1 )</formula><p>v , P ) Thus, Liu et al's certificateless signature scheme is insecure against the key replacement attack. The basic reason why our forgery attack works is due to the fact that Liu et al's signature scheme didn't use the PKG's public key Q P KG in the input of the verification algorithms.</p><p>Having shown that Liu et al's signature scheme is not secure, we now point out the flaw in the security proof for Liu et al's signature scheme. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, there are basically two types of adversaries, A 1 and A 2 , should be considered in the certificateless signature scheme. Specifically, adversary A 1 simulates a normal third party attacker who has no access to the PKG's secret key but is allowed to replace public keys of users, while adversary A 2 simulates a malicious PKG who is equipped with the master key but is not able to replace public keys. However, the adversary A 1 , who can mount the public key replacement attack, has not been mentioned in Liu et al's security proof for their certificateless signature scheme. Consequently, the proof fails.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Liu et al's first authentication protocol</head><p>1) Initialization. NM is in charge of the system initialization by generating the public system parameters and enrolling the involved members (WBAN clients and APs). Given the security parameter l, NM generates the master secret/public key pair (s N M , Q N M ) such that Q N M = s N M P , and publishes the system parameters {l, G 1 , G 2 , q, P, e, H, h, Q N M }. Also, each AP is supposed to have a long-term private key pair (s AP , Q AP ) such that Q AP = s AP P . 2) Registration. Before accessing the AP of interest, each WBAN client with identity C needs to perform the following steps with NM. a) Client C will load the system parameters {l, G 1 , G 2 , q, P, e, H, h, Q N M } along with a message authentication code MAC (•) (•). After that, client C generates the user private key s 1 ∈ Z * q and partial private key </p><formula xml:id="formula_12">S 2 = s N M Q 2 such that Q 1 = s 1 P and Q 2 = H(C, Q 1 )</formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">v = h(σ t c r, T ). c) Compute U = kS 2 -vs 1 Q 2 .</formula><p>d) Compute the session key key as h(v, T ). e) Send a service request message Req = (v, U, m, σ, t c , T ) to the target AP. Once receiving the request message Req = (v, U, m, σ, t c , T ) from the client, the requested AP first checks the validity of the signature σ on message m and the freshness of the time stamp t c . The AP refuses to provide the service if the signature σ or the timestamp t c is not valid. Otherwise, AP performs the following steps to authenticate the requesting client. a) Compute r = e(U, P )</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">• ind v Cv . b) Compute T = s -1</formula><p>AP T using its secret key s AP . c) Verify v ? = h(σ t c r, T ) holds or not. d) Compute the session key key = h(v, T ). e) Compute MAC key (v) and send it back to the requesting client. Once receiving the reply from the AP, the client C first checks the validity of MAC key (v) using session key key. If this check fails, C will rejects this session. Otherwise, C will authenticate AP and regard key as the session key in the later communications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Liu et al's second authentication protocol</head><p>To provide the property of unlinkability between different authentication sessions initialized by the same client, an improved protocol has also been proposed by Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> based on their first authentication protocol. The security enhanced authentication protocol is identical to the preliminary version except that NM issues the item &lt; I(= ind Cv P ), ind Cv , right &gt; to the AP and client C respectively instead of only sending ticket &lt; m, σ &gt; to the client during the Registration phase. Besides, during the Authentication phase, the client C sends Req = (v, U, I (= I + T ), t c , T ) instead of Req = (v, U, m, σ, t c , T ) to the AP, and the requested AP computes I = I -T and finds the index ind Cv with I in the database.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Comments on Liu et al.'s authentication protocol</head><p>In this section, we present several weaknesses of Liu et al.'s authentication protocols.</p><p>1) Inefficiency of certificate managements: Motivated by saving from the heavy overhead of certificate management and key escrow problem simultaneously, the idea of certificateless public key cryptography (CL-PKC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> has been incorporated into Liu et al's authentication protocol. Unfortunately, the certificate of the public key has been reintroduced in Liu et al's first authentication protocol, which inevitably incurs heavy certificate management overhead. Observing that Liu et al's preliminary certificateless anonymous authentication protocol cannot resist the key replacement attack without the signature σ of the verifying index ind Cv . Indeed, the signature σ issued by the NM can be viewed as the certificate of the verifying index ind Cv . Additionally, the public key Q AP of the AP should also be validated by the certificate issued by the NM. Thus, Liu et al's protocol cannot be considered to be featured with the property of certificateless.</p><p>2) Lack of scalability: Since a client's account information &lt; I, ind Cv , right &gt; must be first sent to the AP before this client can request the service provided by the AP in Liu et al's second authentication protocol, securely updating the account information to all APs in the system is a nontrivial (if not impossible) task, as the number of clients increases. Furthermore, each AP is required to store the account information of all clients in the system, which may represent a significant storage overhead in a system with numerous clients. Thus, this approach lacks scalability.</p><p>3) Lack of forward security: Forward security refers to the property that a session key established by one party in the previous round will not be compromised in case the longterm secret key of this party is leaked <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Both of Liu et al's authentication protocols cannot provide the property of forward security as follows.</p><p>The adversary A, who compromises the secret key s AP of AP, can easily compute the session key in the previous round by carrying out the following steps.</p><p>1) Eavesdrop the request message Req = (v, U, m, σ, t c , T ).</p><p>2) Compute T = s -1 AP T using the secret key s AP .</p></div>

Furthermore, the certificateless encryption in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> has been adapted to achieve the client anonymity and eliminate the need to distribute WBAN clients' account information to the APs before the client can access the service offered by these APs. Finally, the issues regarding to the performance and forward security have also been inspected cautiously in the design of our protocol.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. OUR PROPOSED PROTOCOL</head><p>In this section, we propose a scalable certificateless remote authentication protocol with anonymity. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, our protocol involves three entities, i.e., Network manager, Application provider and the WBAN clients, and consists of the Initialization, Registration and Authentication phases.</p><p>1) Initialization. Given the security parameter l, NM performs the following steps:</p><p>• NM generates a prime p and determines the tuple {F p , E/F p , G, P } according to the definition in Sect.

Since WBAN clients and APs are assumed to be registered with centralized network manager and the clock synchronization does not need to be very accurate, it is not difficult to realize loose time synchronization by adopting the indirect time synchronization technique in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Specifically, the synchronization can be achieved through a GPS or Galileo device or thanks to the Network Time Protocol version 4 (NTPv4). The detail of loose synchronization can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and is really outside the scope of this paper.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">H 1 (ID AP R IDAP upk IDAP )P pub )) ⊕ (ID C upk IDC R IDC T A t c ). d) Send a service request message Req = (C 1 , C 2 )</formula><p>to the target AP.</p><p>• Once receiving the request message Req = (C 1 , C 2 ) from the client, the requested AP performs the following steps to authenticate the requesting client. </p><formula xml:id="formula_18">a) Compute ID C upk IDC R IDC T A t c = H 3 ( (x IDAP + s IDAP )C 1 ) ⊕ C 2 . b)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">B = bP . d) Compute K 1 AP -C = s IDAP T A + b(R IDC + H 1 (ID C R IDC upk IDC )P pub ) + x IDAP T A + b • upk IDC and K 2 AP -C = bT A . e) Compute key = H 4 (ID C , ID AP , upk IDC , upk IDAP , R IDC , R IDAP , T A , T B , K 1 AP -C , K 2 AP -C ). f) Compute</formula><p>MAC key (T B ) and send (MAC key (T B ), T B ) back to the requesting client.</p><p>• Once receiving the reply (MAC key (T B ), T B ) from the AP, the client C performs the following steps.</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">a) Compute K 1 C-AP = s IDC T B + a(R IDAP + H 1 (ID IDAP R IDAP upk IDAP )P pub ) + a • upk IDAP + x IDC T B and K 2 C-AP = aT B . b) Compute key = H 4 (ID C , ID AP , upk IDC , upk IDAP , R IDC , R IDAP , T A , T B , K 1 C-AP , K<label>2</label></formula><p>C-AP ). c) Check the validity of MAC key (T B ) using session key key.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SECURITY ANALYSIS</head><p>In this section, we analyze the security of the proposed protocol in terms of correctness and the security requirements mentioned in Section II.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Correctness Analysis</head><p>We firstly analyze the correctness of the decryption and key agreement procedure. Upon receiving the request message Req = (C 1 , C 2 ) from the client, the AP decrypt this ciphertext using its user secret key x IDAP and partial private key s IDAP as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">H 3 ((x IDAP + s IDAP )C 1 ) ⊕ C 2 = H 3 ((x IDAP + s IDAP )rP ) ⊕ H 3 (r(upk IDAP +R IDAP + h IDAP P pub )) ⊕ (ID C upk IDC R IDC T A t c ) = H 3 (r(upk IDAP + R IDAP + h IDAP P pub )) ⊕H 3 (r(upk IDAP + R IDAP + h IDAP P pub )) ⊕(ID C upk IDC R IDC T A t c ) = ID C upk IDC R IDC T A t c</formula><p>Here, h IDAP = H 1 (ID AP R IDAP upk IDAP ). Furthermore, the shared secrets agree due to the fact that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">K 1 AP -C = s IDAP T A + bs IDC P + x IDAP T A + b • upk IDC = bs IDC P + s IDAP T A + x IDAP T A + b • upk IDC = s IDC T B + a(s IDAP P ) + a • upk IDAP + x IDC T B = K 1 C-AP K 2 AP -C = abP = baP = K 2 C-AP</formula><p>Thus, the agreed session key for the authentication provider AP and the client C can be computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">key = H 4 (ID C , ID AP , upk IDC , upk IDAP , R IDC , R IDAP , T A , T B , K 1 AP -C , K 2 AP -C ) = H 4 (ID C , ID AP , upk IDC , upk IDAP , R IDC , R IDAP , T A , T B , K 1 C-AP , K 2 C-AP )</formula><p>B. Security Strength Theorem 1 (Anonymity): Anonymity in our protocol means that except for the requesting WBAN client and the requested AP, any outsider (including the NM) is unable to link a particular protocol session to a particular identity.</p><p>Proof. In our proposed protocol, the anonymity of the requesting WBAN client is achieved by adopting the certificateless encryption in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. On the one hand, the AP can decrypt the Req = (C 1 , C 2 ) using its full private key (x IDAP , s IDAP , R IDAP ) and then obtain the pseudo-identity ID C and the public key (upk IDC , R IDC ) of the client. However, the real identity pertaining to this pseudo-identity can not be revealed by the AP.</p><p>On the other hand, the pseudo identity of the requesting client is only involved in Req = (C 1 , C 2 ) in our protocol. Any third party who eavesdrops on the communication channel and wants to reveal the real identity of the WBAN client faces the decryption operation. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, the certificateless encryption adopted in our protocol can resist the adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack provided that the standard Computational Diffie-Hellman problem is hard to be solved. Thus, the adversary (including the NM) cannot obtain the real identity of the WBAN client without the knowledge of the full private key of AP.</p><p>Theorem 2 (Unlinkability): Unlinkability is a stronger property than anonymity and requires that except for the requesting WBAN client and the requested AP, any outsider (including the NM) is unable to link two different protocol sessions to the same WBAN client. In other words, the adversary can not distinguish whether s/he has seen the same WBAN client twice.</p><p>Proof. Suppose that Req i = (C 1i , C 2i ) and Req j = (C 1j , C 2j ) are two requesting messages produced by one client in two different authentication sessions, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">C 1i = r i P , C 2i = H 3 (r i (upk IDAP + R IDAP + H 1 (ID AP R IDAP upk IDAP )P pub )) ⊕ (ID C upk IDC R IDC T Ai t ci ), C 1j = r j P , C 2j = H 3 (r j (upk IDAP + R IDAP + H 1 (ID AP R IDAP upk IDAP )P pub )) ⊕ (ID C upk IDC R IDC T Aj t cj ).</formula><p>One may wonder at first glance whether these ciphertexts (C 1i , C 2i ) and (C 1j , C 2j ) would leak some relation since they are generated by the same client with the same identity and user public key. However, due to the usage of the random factor r i and r j , C 1i is independent of C 1j . As H 3 is a secure cryptographic hash function, the same is true for C 2i and C 2j .</p><p>To sum up, (C 1i , C 2i ) gains independence of (C 1j , C 2j ), and thus, any adversary over the communication channel has no ability to distinguish whether the clients in two authentication sessions are identical.</p><p>Theorem 3: [Mutual authentication] Our protocol can achieve the mutual authentication in the sense that a requesting WBAN client authenticates itself to a requested AP and that AP authenticates itself to the client at the same time and both parties are assured of the others' identity.</p><p>Proof. The security of our protocol is defined by two security games between the challenger CH and an adversary A 1 or A 2 respectively. To capture the attack launched by the outside adversary, A 1 is simulated as the attacker who can replace the public key of any entity in the system, but can not access the NM's master secret key. To catch the attack mounted by the malicious NM, A 2 is assumed to be an attacker who has the ability to access the master-key with the restriction that any user's public key cannot be replaced by A 2 . Interesting reader can refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> for more details. This theorem follows directly from Lemmas 1 and 2 corresponding to the A 1 and A 2 respectively. The proofs of lemms 1-2 are given in the Appendix.</p><p>Lemma 1: The widely accepted CDH assumption will fail with non-negligible advantage in case that the security of our authentication protocol has been broken by a Type I adversary A 1 .</p><p>Lemma 2: The widely accepted CDH assumption will fail with non-negligible advantage in case that the security of our authentication protocol has been broken by a Type II adversary A 2 .</p><p>Theorem 4 (Session key establishment): The requested AP and the requesting client can share the secure session key after the successful authentication.</p><p>Proof. Observing that</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">K 1 AP -C = K 1 C-AP and K 2 AP -C = K 2</formula><p>C-AP are secrets shared between the AP and client. Namely, the session key key can only be shared by AP and client. More specifically, K 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">AP -C = s IDAP T A + b(R IDC + H 1 (ID C R IDC upk IDC )P pub ) + x IDAP T A + b • upk IDC , K 2</formula><p>AP -C = bT A can only be generated by the AP with the full private key (s IDAP , x IDAP ) and the ephemeral key b. Similarly,</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">K 1 C-AP = s IDC T B + a(R IDAP + H 1 (ID IDAP R IDAP upk IDAP )P pub ) + a • upk IDAP + x IDC T B , K<label>2</label></formula><p>C-AP = aT B can only be computed by the client with the full private key (s IDC , x IDC ) and the ephemeral key a. Hence, based on the exchanged messages in the authentication phase, our proposed protocol can afford the explicit key confirmation in the sense that AP and client can confirm its peer generates the session key correctly.</p><p>Theorem 5 (Forward security): Our protocol can offer the forward secrecy property, which guarantees that the session key established in the previous round will not be disclosed even if the full private key of the client or the AP has been corrupted.</p><p>Proof. Suppose that the full private key (s IDAP , R IDAP , x IDAP ) of the AP and (s IDC , R IDC , x IDC ) of the C were corrupted after the establishment of a shared session key key between the AP and C. Let a and b be the ephemeral key chosen by AP and C, respectively, during the establishment of the session key key. It is obvious to observe that, to compute the established session key key, the adversary who owns (s IDAP , R IDAP , x IDAP ), (s IDC , R IDC , x IDC ), T a = aP and T b = bP must know the value of abP . However, in order to compute abP without the knowledge of either a or b, the adversary must solve the CDH problem in G. Thus, our protocol features with the forward secrecy property.</p><p>Theorem 6 (Key escrow resilience): The NM cannot impersonate the client or the AP without being detected.</p><p>Proof. According to Lemma 2, the type II adversary (namely, NM) cannot mount the impersonation attack successfully provided that the computational Diffie-Hellman problem is hard. The basic reason is that the client (resp. the AP) generates the user secret key x IDC (resp. x IDAP ) itself in our protocol, and thus the client (resp. the AP)'s full private key is not available to the NM. We emphasize that NM never mounts a public key replacement attack with a false public key against a target client since two legitimate public key associated with one identity in the system will badly destroy the NM's reputation.</p><p>Theorem 7 (Nonrepudiation): Client ID C cannot deny that s/he has accessed the service provided by the AP after the successful access.</p><p>Proof. Client ID C is the unique client who can authenticate with AP under the identity ID C and public key (R IDC , upk IDC ). Even the NM cannot impersonate the client ID C according to Theorem 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS PROTOCOLS</head><p>In this section we compare the security properties and efficiency of the proposed protocols, Cao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>'s protocol which is the most efficient existing ID-based remote anonymous authentication protocol, and Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>'s protocol which is the only certificateless remote authentication protocol with anonymity for WBANs. The comparison result is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">II</ref>, which includes anonymity (ANO), unlinkability (UL), mutual authentication (MA), session key establishment (SKE), forward security (FS), key escrow resilience (KER), non-repudiation(NR) and scalability (SC). Here, the entry means that the protocol satisfied the requirement and × indicates that the protocol does not meet the goal. The above comparison shows that our protocol conforms to all of the security requirements, whereas the competitive protocols satisfy only partial security properties.</p><p>As for the computation efficiency comparison, the benchmark (the running time of the cryptographic operations) is obtained by using the Multi-precision Integer and Rational Arithmetic Cryptographic Library (MIRACAL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The hardware environment for the AP is adopted by a Windows XP OS equipped with PIV 3-GHz processor and 512M bytes memory, whereas the simulation platform of the WBAN client is set as the Linux personal digital assistant over a Intel PXA270 624-MHz processor. With regard to the pairingbased protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, to achieve the comparable level of security to 1024-bits RSA, we employed a supersingular elliptic curve E/F p : y<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> = x 3 + x providing groups in which a Tate pairing e : G 1 × G 1 → G 2 is defined. Here, the embedding degree of this curve is 2, q is a 160-bit Solinas prime equal to 2 159 + 2 17 + 1, and p a 512-bit prime such that p = 12qr -1. Regarding to ECC-based protocol, to offer the security with the equivalent level, we used the Koblitz elliptic curve y 2 = x 3 +ax 2 +b defined on F 2 163 providing ECC group. Here, a is equal to 1 and b is a 163-bit random prime. The running time of the cryptographic operations on AP is derived by repeated simulation experiment, and the running time on the client terminal can be easily estimated according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The running time of the involved cryptographic operations on AP and client are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">III</ref>  <ref type="figure">3</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> indicates that compared with the most efficient ID-based remote anonymous authentication protocol, our protocol reduces at least 52.6% of the overall running time; the reduction in the computation cost reaches at least 73.8% compared with up-to-date certificateless remote authentication protocol with anonymity.</p><p>We compare the communication overhead by evaluating the overall size of the request and response messages during one round of a protocol. For example, in Cao et al.'s protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, a client's request message consists of two points of G 1 and the response message from AP contains a hash value 2  The performance comparison between our protocol and the previous protocols in terms of energy consumption at the client side has also been evaluated. The MICA2 sensor mote equipped with the 8-bit processor ATmega128L is set as the    simulation platform of the WBAN client. Per the Crossbow data sheet <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, the power level of MICA2 is 3.0 V and the current draw in active mode is 8 mA. According to the implementation results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, the time required for a ECC-based scalar multiplication to achieve an 80-bit security level on the binary Koblitz curve is 0.33s. Also, Oliveira et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> showed that the pairing computation and a pairing-based scalar multiplication to reach the same security level take 1.90 s and 0.95s on ATmega128L respectively. The time for a modular exponentiation in the same curve is very similar to that of a scalar multiplication. In our protocol, ten ECC-based scalar multiplications are required at the client side, and the resulting computational energy consumption is 3.0 × 8.0 × (10 × 0.33) = 79.2 mJ. Now we analyze the communication energy cost. In MICA2, the receiving current draw and the transmitting current draw are assumed to be 10 mA and 27 mA respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Hence, the energy consumption due to the transmitting and receiving message is is the most efficient, their scheme does not offer the property of key escrow, which, nonetheless, is not the case in the other protocols.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Remote authentication with anonymity</head><p>Remote authentication protocol is one of the fundamental cryptography primitives, by which a (roaming) mobile client and a requested remote server who communicate over a potentially insecure channel can authenticate each other and generate a secret session key to secure their later communications. Since Lamport's pioneering work <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, many approaches in this field have been proposed including simple passwords <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, public-key infrastructure (PKI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, biometrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> and smart cards <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. As for the PKI-based remote authentication mechanisms, each party (e.g. a client or a remote server) in the system communicates securely with the certificate authority (CA) through an out-of-band channel and obtains a certificate <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. The certificate of the public key should be validated before the authentication is carried out. Observing the unfavorable burden caused by the creation, distribution, storage, validation and revocation of the digital certificates, the notion of remote authentication protocol has been introduced into the identity-based (ID-based) environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In the ID-based remote authentication protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, the public key of each party can be effortlessly derived from his identity (such as an email address or the driver license number) by anyone in the system, whereas the private key of this party will be generated by the private key generator (PKG). Understandably, the necessity of the certificate has been removed accompanied with the adventure of inherent key escrow problem in the ID-based remote authentication protocols. Taking the client anonymity into account, Cao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> proposed an encryption-free remote authentication protocol with anonymity based on an identity-based signature scheme with constant verification result. To be authorized by the APs, the client sends his signature to the requested AP, who then verifies the signature according to this client's constant verification result (namely, client account index). For the sake of realizing client anonymity, the client account index needs to be distributed to the APs securely before the client can access the services provided by these APs. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proposed a certificateless remote authentication protocol in view of the heavy certificate management overhead and key escrow problem simultaneously such that the account information of the client should also be distributed to the APs before this client logs into these APs. Compared with the APs, the population of clients in the system could be up to millions, whereas the number of APs is at most thousands based on the national/regional medical system construction. Taking the large number and the mobility nature of the clients into account, it is non-trivial to securely update the account information of the clients to all APs in the system. It is fair to say that there is no certificate-free anonymous remote authentication protocol featured with forward secrecy and scalability until now. Different from <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, there is no need for APs to update and store the client's verifying index when new clients join the system in our protocol. Though a group of public keys and identities of the APs should be preloaded to the client in our protocol, we argue that the public key of the APs should also be preloaded to the client in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Thus, our proposed protocol provides better scalability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. User Revocation</head><p>The revocation approach for the Identity-based encryption <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> can be adapted to revoke users, i.e., the clients or the APs, from the system. Specifically, the partial private key of the user issued by the NM will be partitioned into two parts, i.e., the initial partial private key and the time refresh key. The initial partial private key is fixed and preloaded to the user during the registration phase, whereas the time refresh key will be updated in different time periods. In other words, the NM will periodically generate and then send new time refresh keys for the non-revoked users. If the user is unable to obtain the new time refresh key from the NM, the user cannot renew her/his partial private key. To revoke the target users, the NM just stops issuing the new time refresh keys for these users. Notice that the client (resp. the AP) will use the requested AP's (resp. the requesting client's) identity concatenated with the current time period. The revocation mechanism constitutes another line of work on their own and is thus out of scope of this paper. We consider the certificateless remote authentication with efficient revocation as our future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. SUMMARY</head><p>Remote authentication is a fundamental and challenging issue in securing WBANs. In this paper, we discuss the security weaknesses of certificateless anonymous remote authentication protocols for WBANs in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, propose a secure, lightweight, scalable certificateless remote authentication protocol for WBANs, and compare our protocol with existing works. The proposed protocol satisfies a set of essential requirements which have not been fulfilled by previous works. By adopting the encryption technique to realize anonymity, our protocol eliminates the delivery of clients' account information to APs, and thus provides better scalability. Furthermore, the security properties of our protocol have been formally proven in the random oracle model. The significant performance advantages of our protocol over existing protocols have been shown by extensive simulation results. Due to its lower communication overhead and computation cost, the proposed protocol is more suitable for low-power mobile terminals in WBANs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Internet</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>

To be compatible with the Liu et al.'s Setup and Partial-Private-Key-Extract algorithms, the signature in Liu et al.'s first authentication protocol has been instantiated by the efficient identity-based signature in [41]. Fig. 3 shows the time consumption on computation of AP in Cao et al.'s protocol, Liu et al.'s protocols and our protocol as the number of requesting clients increases. Obviously, we observe that our protocol offers a much lower time consumption comparing with the other protocols.

Also, NM keeps secret the master secret key x. 2) Registration. An AP with identity ID AP ∈ {0, 1} l1 needs to perform the following operations with NM once before it can provide services to the WBAN clients. a) The AP associated with identity ID AP selects a secret value x IDAP ∈ R Z * p as its user secret key usk IDAP , and computes his public key as upk IDAP = x IDAP P . This AP sends its identity ID AP and user public key upk IDAP to the NM. b) Once receiving this AP's identity ID AP and user public key upk IDAP , NM first chooses at random r IDAP ∈ R Z * p , computes R IDAP = r IDAP P , h IDAP = H 1 (ID AP R IDAP upk IDAP ) and s IDAP = r IDAP +h IDAP x.

Given an instance (aP, bP ) ∈ G of the CDH problem, the task of the challenger CH with the Type I adversary A 1 is to compute cP ∈ G with c = ab mod p. The hash function H 1 will be simulated as the random oracle and an initially empty H 1 -list associated with this oracle will also be maintained by CH. The number of participants in the game and the number of sessions each participant may be involved in is denoted as n p (k) and n s (k), respectively. (s IDi , R IDi , x IDi ) represents the full private key for the ith participant associated with the identifier ID i . The partial private key (s IDi , R IDi ) with ID i can be generated by CH as follows:</p><p>At first, CH chooses a random point P 0 ∈ R G, sets P pub = P 0 , and chooses a random index</p><p>To generate a partial private key for the identifier ID I , CH chooses a random x IDI ∈ R Z * p and computes the public key upk IDI = x IDI P .

Then (⊥, R IDI ) is set as ID I 's partial private key and</p><p>p and computes the public key upk IDi = x IDi P . Then, CH generates the partial private key by first choosing (s IDi , h IDi ) ∈ R Z * p . Then CH computes R IDi = s IDi P -h IDi P 0 and sets (s IDi , R IDi ) as ID i 's partial private key. Then, CH adds</p><p>Without lose of generality, we assume that, before asking the following queries, A 1 has already created the partial private key on the related identifiers.</p><p>Then CH picks another random index </p><p>, then CH carries out the protocol normally according to the protocol specification.

Therefore, at the end of the security game, A 1 will output its guess of the session key of the form {0, 1} l1 × {0, 1} l1 × G 6 × A × B. On receiving this guess, CH can output A -s IDJ M -x IDJ M -x IDI aP as the solution of the CDH problem, where M is the input message of Send(Π v J,j , M ) query.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX B PROOF OF LEMMA 2</head><p>Proof. Given an arbitrary input (P, aP, bP ) ∈ G of the CDH problem, the challenger CH can use the Type II adversary A 2 as a subroutine to compute cP ∈ G with c = ab mod p. At first, CH chooses x ∈ R Z * p randomly and assigns P pub = xP . x is then sent to A 2 by CH. The hash function H 1 will be simulated as the random oracle and an initially empty H 1 -list associated with this oracle will also be maintained by CH. The number of participants in the game and the number of sessions each participant may be involved in is denoted as n p (k) and n s (k), respectively. (s IDi , R IDi , x IDi ) represents the full private key for the i-th participant associated with the identifier ID i . CH picks two random indexes I, J ∈ {1, • • • , n p (k)} at random, a random protocol session v ∈ {1, • • • , n s (k)}. The user secret key x IDi with ID i can be generated by CH as follows:</p><p>To generate a user secret key for the identifier ID I , CH sets the user public key as bP and the user secret key as ⊥. CH then chooses r IDI ∈ R Z * p at random, computes R IDI = r IDI P and Send(Π s i,j , M ): If Π s i,j = Π v J,j , then CH carries out the protocol normally according to the protocol specification. Otherwise, CH responds with the tuple (ID j , upk IDj , R IDj , aP ) as the answer.</p><p>The probability that Π v J,j is chosen by A 2 as the Test oracle and ID j = ID I is 1 n 2 p (k)ns(k) . In this case, CH would not have aborted the simulation in the sense that ID I has not been corrupted by A 2 . Therefore, at the end of the security game, A 2 will output its guess of the session key of the form {0, 1} l1 × {0, 1} l1 × G 6 × A × B. On receiving this guess, CH can output A -s IDJ M -x IDJ M -s IDI aP as the solution of the CDH problem, where M is the input message of Send(Π v J,j , M ) query. In this way, the CDH problem can be solved by CH with non-negligible probability within t(k), where c is a constant.</p></div>			</div>
