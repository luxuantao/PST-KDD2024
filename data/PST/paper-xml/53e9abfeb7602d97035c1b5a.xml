<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Edge detectors are used to detect and localize the boundaries of objects in an image. The complication of edge detector designing is the difficulty of defining precisely what means an edge. In practice, it is impossible to design an edge detector capable of finding all the true, and the only true edges in an image. Furthermore, edge detectors give ambiguous information about location of object boundaries. Edge detectors are usually subjectively evaluated by observers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</p><p>Most conventional edge detectors are designed based on some models of edges. For examples, gradient-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> assume edges as the set of pixels where the gray level has a high rate of change, or in a Canny edge detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, edges are considered as step functions corrupted by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). Konishi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> formulate edge detection as statistical inference where the detection of edges depends on the statistics of both "on the edge" and "off the edge" filters.</p><p>Conventional edge detectors are usually performed by linear filtering operations. An earlier smoothing operation for reducing the noise effect is sometimes applied. Edge operators that combine smoothing and derivation can use first derivative <ref type="bibr">(Canny)</ref> or a Laplacian of the Gaussian (LOG <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>). A visual model-based edge detector is proposed by Peli <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In this model, the visual receptive field like filtering channels are used, and the threshold is the contrast sensitivity of the human eye.</p><p>Suzuki et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> proposed an edge detector using a multilayer neural network, called a neural edge detector (NED), for detecting the desired edges clearly from noisy images.</p><p>This paper describes an edge detector using ant colony algorithms. The ant colony system(ACS) algorithm was proposed by Dorigo <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> in 1992, and has been used to solve many complex problems successfully such as the traveling salesman problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, quadratic assignment problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, design of combinational logic circuits <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, combined heat and power economic dispatch <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, data mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, classification rule discovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, data clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, image retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and approximation of plane curves <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. The next section reviews the basic principles of the ACS algorithm. Section 3 renders the details of the proposed method. Experimental results are presented in Sect. 4. Finally, the paper is concluded in Sect. 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Ant colony search algorithms</head><p>The concept of ant colony system, inspired by the behavior of real ants, was initially introduced by Colorni, Dorigo and Maniezzo <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Real ants follow their own agenda of tasks independent from each other, however, when act as a community, they are capable to solve their daily complex problems, which require sophisticated planning, such as selecting and picking up materials, or, finding and storing foods. However, there is no kind of supervising or controlling. Finding the shortest route between the colony and a food source, is done by an exchange of information about the path should be followed.</p><p>Ants communicate with each other by means of pheromone trail. They mark the path by leaving a certain amount of pheromone. Ants probabilistically prefer to follow a direction, proportional to the amount of pheromone on it. The more ants follow a trail, the more attractive this trail becomes to be followed by other ants. This process could be considered as a positive feedback loop.</p><p>An artificial ant colony system is an agent-based algorithm, which simulates the behavior of real ants. Artificial ants are like real ants with some major differences: -Artificial ants have memory; -They are not completely blind; -They live in a discrete time environment. However they have some adopted characteristics from real ants: -Artificial ants probabilistically prefer paths with a larger amounts of pheromone. -Shorter paths have larger rate of growth in the amount of pheromone. -The ants communicate to each other by means of the amount of pheromone laid on each path. ACS is an iterative algorithm. At each iteration, it performs a loop containing two basic operations:</p><p>(1) construction or modification of solutions of the problem, (2) updating the pheromone trails. Different steps of an ACS algorithm are the followings: 1. Problem graph representation: problems which could be solved byACSA are often discrete, so they could be represented by a graph with N nodes and E edges, G = N, E . 2. Initializing ants distribution: a number of ants are placed on the randomly chosen nodes. 3. Node transition rule: the node transition rule specifies how ants must move from node to node. The node transition is probabilistic. The probability of displacing kth ant from node i to node j is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p k ij = (τ ij ) α (η ij ) β h/ ∈tabu k (τ ih ) α (η ih ) β if j / ∈ tabu k , 0 otherwise,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where τ ij and η ij are the intensity of pheromone and the visibility of edge (i, j ), respectively, and, α and β are control parameters. By tabu k we present the set of inaccessible nodes. 4. Pheromone updating rule: a cycle of ACS algorithm is completed when every ant has constructed a solution. At the end of each cycle, the intensity of pheromone is updated by a pheromone trail updating rule:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">τ ij (new) = (1 -ρ)τ ij (old) + m k=1 τ k ij ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where ρ represents the pheromone evaporation, and, τ k ij is the amount of pheromone laid on edge (i, j ) by the kth ant and could be given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">τ k ij = fk Q if edge (i, j</formula><p>) is traversed by the kth ant (at the current cycle), 0 otherwise, If ant is on a background pixel and surrounded only by background, he will be displaced to a new randomly chosen pixel at next iteration. In each other case, ants probabilistically chose one of their eight-neighborhood pixels according to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>), as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The probability of displacing the kth ant from node (r, s) to node (i, j ) is considered to be:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">p k (r,s),(i,j ) =          (τ(i,j)) α (η(i,j)) β u v (τ (u,v)) α (η(u,v)) β if (i, j ) and (u, v) ∈ admissible nodes r -1 ≤ i, u ≤ r + 1, s -1 ≤ j, v ≤ s + 1, 0 otherwise,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where τ i,j and η i,j are the intensity of pheromone and the visibility of pixel (i, j ), respectively, and, α and β are control parameters. Furthermore, the visibility of pixel (i, j ) is defined by: </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">η i,j = 1 I Max × Max    |I(i -1, j -1) -I(i + 1, j + 1)| , |I(i -1, j + 1) -I(i -1, j + 1)| , |I(i, j -1) -I(i, j + 1)| , |I(i -1, j) -I(i + 1, j)|    . (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>In this approach, the value of visibility is determined using the maximum variation of gray level of the image intensity. Therefore, edge pixels are expected to have a greater value of visibility. In addition, all pixels currently registered in ants memory are considered as non-admissible pixels. (d) Pheromone updating rule: After every step, the pheromone level is updated according to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">5</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">τ (i,j ) (new) = (1 -ρ)τ (i,j ) (old) + τ (i,j )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">τ (i,j ) = m k=1</formula><p>τ k (i,j ) , and,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">τ k (i,j ) = η (i,j ) if η (i,j ) ≥ b&amp;kth ant displaces to pixel (i, j ) 0 otherwise</formula><p>b is a threshold value. The evaporation of pheromone helps to avoid un-limited accumulation of the pheromone trails, and, if a pixel is not chosen by the ants, its intensity of pheromone exponentially. To avoid stagnation of the search, the minimum of pheromone intensity is limited by τ min . Since τ min ≥ 0, the probability of choosing a specific pixel is never 0. This minimum value according to Max -Min AS algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> is considered to be 0.0001. (e) Stopping criterion: The end of algorithm achieves by a pre-defined number of cycles, for which each cycle contains a fix number of steps. The number of cycles is chosen to be 3. This value works well enough for all the experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experimental results</head><p>In this section, the effectiveness of the suggested algorithm is validated using experimental data. The proposed algorithm is only part of the problem in the edge detection, where the final goal is a binary image, indicating the presence of an edge. Therefore, a global threshold at the output of our algorithm is included to discard irrelevant edges. The output image is then thinned by a morphological thinning algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm (before threshold and thinning operations). Suitable algorithm parameters are determined based on trial and error. A large number of experiments (more than 2000) were carried out on a set of 5 images of different sizes and details "Home", "Fruit", "Peppers", "Lena" and "Kid" (in three different sizes: 128×128, 256×256, 512×512). Some of the results obtained are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p><p>According to the experiments carried out, both the number of ants and number of steps could be chosen proportional to the root of pixel numbers, i.e. √ M × N. As an example, the algorithm is applied to "Lena" in two different sizes, and the results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.</p><p>α and β control the relative importance of intensity of pheromone versus visibility. Therefore, as a result of high values for α, ants tend to choose edges previously have been chosen by other ants, where low values of α make the algorithm similar to stochastic algorithms. To see the effect of β, an example of obtained edges by different values of β is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. In our algorithm, the control parameters values were set to be: α = 2.5, β = 2. These values worked well enough for all images that have been tested.</p><p>Another parameter to be set is ants memory length, i.e. the number of last chosen (traversed) pixels currently registered in ants memory. Note that all pixels currently registered in ants memory are considered as non-admissible pixels. The choice of memory length is a delicate task: a small Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> Qualitative results of the proposed algorithm; a1,a2,a3,a4,a5 input 512×512 images; and, b1,b2,b3,b4,b5 their corresponding edge image obtained by the proposed method with 1500 ants, 500 steps and the memory length randomly chosen between 15 and 30 Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> Example of parameter setting for "Lena" in two different sizes, 128×128 and 256×256; a "Lena" 128×128, 300 ants, 100 steps and the memory length randomly chosen between 35 and 50; b "Lena" 256×256, 700 ants, 300 steps and the memory length for each ant randomly chosen between 25 and 40 Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> Role of control parameters, "Lena" 256×256, 700 ants, 300 steps and the memory length for each ant randomly chosen between 25 and 40; a α=1 and β=1; b α=1 and β=2 length provides small closed routes (related to small objects in image), and will stagnate the algorithm, where for a large values of memory length, details will not be represented in the output image. This notice could be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. Although the relationship between the memory length and the quality of detected edges, can not be quantified according to the large number of trials, the memory length for each ant could be chosen randomly in interval [0.85A, 1.15A], where A is: The evaporating rate, ρ, is set to 0.04. The threshold value, T, is considered as the mean of the final intensity values over all nodes. The value which is chosen for T worked well for all cases studied. Finally, the parameter b is set to 0.08, and number of cycles is considered to be 3.</p></div>
