<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>A networked control system (NCS) is such a system whose control loops are closed through a communication network such that both control signals and feedback signals can be exchanged among system components (sensors, controllers and actuators, etc.), see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. A defining feature of an NCS is that it connects cyber space to physical space so that the execution of several tasks is remotely allowed. As a result, an NCS has several advantages over traditional control systems. On the one hand, an NCS may eliminate unnecessary wiring between system components, which means that the complexity and the overall cost in designing and implementing the corresponding control systems can be reduced significantly. On the other hand, an NCS can be modified or upgraded easily if some new or old system components need to be added or removed without major changes in the structure. Therefore, NCSs are found a wide range of applications in areas including industry control <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. For example, in vehicle industry, extensive wiring in a typical model automobile <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> is reduced by introducing networked control technologies; NCSs are applied successfully in human surveillance systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and in many process control engineering systems such as the waster treatment process <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>However, the use of communication networks usually introduces some challenging issues. To mention a few, the periodic sampling with a high frequency unavoidably brings heavy loads into the network, possibly leading to network congestion; the limited bit rate of communication networks usually leads to network-induced delays and packet dropouts; and quantization errors frequently occur when sampled signals are quantized due to the finite word length of packets. These challenging issues induced by communication networks are generally regarded as sources degrading system performance or destabilizing an NCS, even though some positive effects of network-induced delays on NCSs are shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Since NCSs lie at the intersection of control theory and communication theory, analysis of NCSs is more complicated and growing attention is still paid to NCSs up to date. During the past three decades, a great number of results on NCSs are reported. In order to summarize in time the results on NCSs, some survey papers are available in the literature. For example, in 2006, a survey on NCSs was given <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, where the impact of NCSs on traditional large-scale system control methodologies with a related application is reviewed. In 2007, control and communication challenges in networked real-time systems were discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>; and an overview on estimation, analysis, and controller synthesis for NCSs was given <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In 2010, some research trends of NCSs were suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In 2013, a survey on network-induced constraints in NCSs was carried out <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, different from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, we provide an overview on the theoretical development of networked control systems on the basis of the results reported in the last decade. First, some challenging issues induced from communication networks and their effects on NCSs are discussed in Section II. Second, sampled-data control, networked control and eventtriggered control are reviewed in Section III, where existing research methods on NCSs are summarized. Third, as an active research topic, network-based filtering is reviewed in Section IV. Finally, in Section V, some challenging problems are presented for the future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SOME ISSUES INDUCED FROM NCSS</head><p>A simple diagram of an NCS is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, where control components, i.e. physical plant, sensor, quantizer, controller and zero-order-hold (ZOH), are connected through a communication network. There are several issues induced from an NCS, such as sampling, network-induced delays, packet Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. A simple networked control system with single loop dropouts and quantization errors, which are described in the following.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Sampling</head><p>Continuous-time signals need to be sampled before they are transmitted through a communication network. There are two methods to sample continuous-time signals: time-triggered sampling and event-triggered sampling.</p><p>The time-triggered sampling, also called the 'Riemann sampling', characterizes 'when' an event is triggered, which means that the next sampling instant occurs after the elapse of a fixed time interval. The periodic sampling, or called the uniform sampling, is widely used in early digital control systems because analysis and design of such sampled systems may be simple. When the sampling period approaches to zero, the performance of the sampled control system can approximate that of the corresponding continuous-time system. This means that the smaller the sampling period is taken, the better the performance is achieved for the system.</p><p>The event-triggered sampling, also called the 'Lebesgue sampling', 'level-crossing sampling' and 'magnitude-driven sampling', etc., characterizes 'why' an event is triggered, which means that the next sampling occurs because the signal changes with a specified amount. The event-triggered sampling is a natural way that a human behaves as a controller. One of the motivations of the event-triggered sampling is based on such an observation that, for an NCS, the periodic sampling with a smaller period cannot ensure some better performance because more increasing network-loads usually lead to network traffic congestion, which possibly degrades the system performance. The event-triggered sampling may contribute to significant reduction of network traffic loads. In the last decade, growing attention is paid to event-triggered control for NCSs, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Network-induced delays</head><p>In an NCS, network-induced delays are often caused by several factors, such as limited bandwidth, network traffic and transmission protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. There are mainly two kinds of delays: sensor-controller delays and controller-actuator delays. The sensor-controller delays represent the time interval from the instant when a physical signal is sampled to the instant when the corresponding control signal is generated; and the controller-actuator delays indicate how long a control signal is transmitted from the controller to the actuator. Since networkinduced delays depend heavily on variable network conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, they are usually time-varying, random, and unknown but upper-bounded. As a consequence, network-induced delays are commonly modeled as an interval time-varying delay <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and a Markov chain with known transition probabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, with partially known transition probabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and with arbitrary switching <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>The estimation on the upper bound of network-induced delays is an interesting research topic. Traditionally, a network time protocol (NTP) is proposed to measure an end-to-end delay by synchronizing the clocks of computer systems over packet-switching data networks. Due to the inaccuracy of the NTP approach, a clock synchronization procedure protocol was designed <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> to develop the one-way delay measurement methodology for NCSs. Since a time-stamp technique is introduced, the upper bound of network-induced delays may be estimated, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> in detail.</p><p>Another important issue is to investigate the effects of network-induced delays on NCSs. Among most results on NCSs, network-induced delays are usually considered as a source of system performance degradation or even instability, which means that network-induced delays have the negative effects on NCSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. However, for some systems, such as an offshore platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and a Duffing-Van der Pol's oscillator, network-induced delays may have the positive effect on system performance. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, a network-based dynamic model of an offshore platform is established and a networkbased state feedback control scheme is developed. It is shown through simulation results that both the oscillation amplitudes of the offshore platform and the required control force under the network-based state feedback controller are smaller than those under the nonlinear controller and the dynamic output feedback controller. For a van der Pol-Duffing oscillator, which cannot be stabilized using a delay-free position feedback controller, it is shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> that some stable and satisfactory tracking control performance can be achieved by intentionally introducing proper network-induced delays between the oscillator and the controller. It is of significance in theory and in practice to pay more attention to investigating the positive effects of network-induced delays on NCSs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Packet dropouts</head><p>Packet dropout phenomenon is an important issue induced from NCSs. Because of limited network bandwidth, data packets may be dropped out during their transmission in a communication network. Generally, there are two types of packet dropouts. transmission errors in the communication network, packet dropouts may occur, even though network protocols are equipped with transmission retry mechanisms. Because in this case the packet dropout is caused by the communication network itself, we call this kind of packet dropout the "network-induced packet dropout"; and • Active packet dropouts. In some cases, where a packet sent earlier arrives at its destination later, packet disorder phenomena appear. Although disordered packets can be delivered eventually under some reliable transmission protocols, such as TCP, they are not very useful for analysis and design of NCSs because the signals carried in the disordered packets are out-of-date. Therefore, one should discard those 'disordered' packets actively. We call this kind of packet dropout the "active packet dropout". Some effective methods, such as logical ZOH mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and message rejection <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, are presented to carry out active packet dropouts. Generally, packet dropouts exhibit random features because network dynamics usually change in a random way. In consequence, packet dropouts are treated as a Markov packetdropout process <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> or a Bernoulli distributed white sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. However, packet dropouts together with networkinduced delays are modeled as an time-varying delay both in continuous-time domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and in discrete-time domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Quantization errors</head><p>In NCSs, signals are usually quantized by a quantizer before they are transmitted via a communication network. A quantizer can be regarded as a class of nonlinear mappings, which map different segments of R (the real set) to different levels. The number of quantization levels is closely related to the information flow between the physical plant and the filter. Because of the finite word length, quantization errors are unavoidable, which have the negative effects on the system performance of NCSs. It is shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> that quantization errors can be treated with a sector-bounded uncertainty or nonlinearity. This means that robust analysis methods can be applied to investigate the effects of quantization errors on NCSs. Therefore, a number of results on this issue are reported in the literature. For an NCS subject to quantization and stochastic packet dropouts, meansquare stability is studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> in the case of a logarithmic quantizer with an infinite number of quantization levels, where some relationship between the level of quantization and the packet dropout probability is disclosed. For an NCS subject to packet dropouts and finite-level quantization, effects of the quantizer step size and the maximal number of consecutive packet dropouts on the disturbance attenuation level of the NC-S are investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. A unified and generalized framework is proposed for analysis and design of networked and quantized control systems via an emulation-like approach, which offers a different way to study quantization effects on NCSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. SAMPLED-DATA CONTROL, NETWORKED CONTROL AND EVENT-TRIGGERED CONTROL</head><p>In the last decade, a large number of results focus on control of NCSs by taking one, two or more issues mentioned in the previous section into account. A review on them is given in the following subsections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Sampled-data control</head><p>When control components are located in the same place, the NCS can be regarded as a digital control system. Sampleddata control theory for digital control systems has been well established since the late of 1950s. An input delay approach to sampled-data control, which was originally proposed in 1988 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, gains resurgent attention because of the advent of a linear matrix inequality technique and the boost of network control technologies. Employing the input delay approach, the maximum upper bound of two consecutive samplings and corresponding controller can be obtained easily. In the last decade, some significant progress is made in sampled-data control using the input delay approach.</p><p>Consider the following sampled-data system described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">{ ẋ(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), x(t 0 ) = x 0 u(t) = Kx(t k ), t k ≤ t &lt; t k+1 (1)</formula><p>where x(t) ∈ R n and u(t) ∈ R m are the system state vector and the control input vector, respectively; and x 0 is an initial condition.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">{t 1 , t 2 , • • • , t k , • • • } is a sampling sequence satis- fying t k &lt; t k+1 , lim k→∞ t k = ∞ and sup k {t k+1 -t k } ≤ h u for some known h u &gt; 0.</formula><p>The input delay approach is to model the system (1) as the continuous-time system described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> {</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ẋ(t) = Ax(t) + BKx(t -τ (t)), t k ≤ t &lt; t k+1 x(θ) = x 0 for θ = t 0 ; 0 for θ &lt; t 0<label>(2)</label></formula><p>with a piecewise time-varying delay τ (t) := t -t k , t k ≤ t &lt; t k+1 satisfying 0 ≤ τ (t) ≤ h u , ∀t ≥ t 0 . Thus, based on this model, the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach can be employed to formulate some stability criteria such that the admissible upper bound of h u and the corresponding controller gain K can be calculated in terms of solutions to some linear matrix inequalities. A number of significant results using the input delay approach can be referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. However, some comment on the input delay approach is made in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, where it is pointed out that some available information about the actual sampling patten are neglected <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, leading to conservative stability criteria. Based on the scaled small-gain theorem, the input delay approach is revised <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> using a tighter upper bound on the L 2 induced-norm of the operator ∆ sh defined as ξ = ∆ sh η ⇐⇒ ξ(t) = ∫ t t k η(s)ds. By exploiting passivity-type property of ∆ sh instead of the L 2 induced-norm, the stability criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> are further improved by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Recalling the result <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, it is found that a key feature, i.e. τ (t) = 1 ∀t ≥ t 0 , a.e., of the piecewise time-varying delay τ (t) is not used in the stability analysis of the system (2). This accounts for the conservatism of the obtained results. Motivated by the discontinuous Lyapunov function method proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, the input delay approach is refined <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> by introducing a proper time-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional including the following term</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">V td (t, x(t)) := (t k+1 -t k -τ (t)) [ x(t) x(t k ) ] T M [ x(t) x(t k ) ]<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where M is a symmetric real matrix. Simulation results illustrate that the time-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method can produce much less conservative stability criteria than those <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Therefore, the time-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method receives increasing attention of researchers in the field of control. To mention a few, the time-dependent Lyapunov-Krsovskii functional method, together with the Wirtinger-based integral inequality, is used to derive some less conservative stability criteria for sampled-data systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>; by replacing</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">t k+1 -t k -τ (t), i.e. t k+1 -t, in (3) with (t k+1 -t)(t -t k )</formula><p>, stability for sampled-data systems with state quantization is analyzed <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>; the time-dependent Lyapunov-Krsovskii functional method is employed to co-design event-triggered transmission schemes and L 2 controllers for sampled-data systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p><p>In addition to the input delay approach, a number of approaches are proposed for analysis and control of sampleddata systems in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. The sampled-data system under consideration is modeled as a continuous-time system, while the stability analysis is made using the discrete-time Lyapunov theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. An impulsive system approach is introduced to consider the stability of sampled-data systems using a discontinuous Lyapunov functional <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. This approach is improved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, where the chosen Lyapunov functional is continuous at impulse times but not necessarily positive definite inside the impulse intervals. A continuous time-delay system model with stochastic parameters satisfying Bernoulli distribution is proposed for sampled-data systems with multi sampling rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Networked control</head><p>Network-induced delays and packet dropouts are still challenging issues for NCSs. In the last decade, depending on how to deal with network-induced delays and packet dropouts, a number of methods are developed on stability analysis and control design for NCSs. In the following, we provide a brief review on them.</p><p>1) A time-delay system approach: A time-delay system approach is motivated by the input delay approach for sampleddata systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. By the time-delay system approach, the closed-loop system is modeled as a system with a time-varying delay. The information on the sensor-controller delay, the controller-actuator delay and the number of consecutive packet dropouts is implicitly included in the upper bound of the input delay.</p><p>Denote the updating instants of the ZOH as t k (k = 1, 2, • • • ). At the time instant t k , the time-stamp of the packet transmitted successfully from the sensor to the ZOH is assumed to be i k . Thus, the closed-loop system can be given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ẋ(t) = Ax(t) + BKx(t -τ 1 (t)), t ∈ [t k , t k+1 )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where τ 1 (t) = t -i k h is called the input delay and h is the sampling period. It is clear that τ 1 (t) is a piecewise timevarying delay satisfying τ min ≤ τ 1 (t) &lt; τ max , where</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">τ min := min k {t k -i k h} and τ max := max k {(t k+1 -t k ) + (t k -i k h)}.</formula><p>With this timing mechanism, the network-induced delays can be given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">t k -i k h (k = 1, 2, • • • )</formula><p>, while the number of consecutive packet dropouts cannot be expressed explicitly, but closely related to t k+1 -t k . Hence, the information on network-induced delays and the number of consecutive packet dropouts is included in the piecewise time-varying delay τ 1 (t). However, packet disorder phenomena are not considered in the timing mechanism.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, a logical ZOH is introduced to choose those newest data packets to actuate the physical plant. With the mechanism of the logical ZOH, disordered data packets are dropped out actively. As a result, both the network-induced delays and the number of consecutive packet dropouts can be explicitly worked out, respectively. In fact, the network-induced delay is given by τ k := t k -i k h, and the number of packet dropouts between t k and t k+1 can be calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ℓ k+1 := i k+1 -i k -1.</formula><p>Moreover, the upper bound τ max of τ 1 (t) can be re-expressed as τ max = max k {(ℓ k+1 + 1)h + τ k+1 }, which clearly shows that the upper bound of the piecewise time-varying delay τ 1 (t) depends on the admissible maximum number of consecutive packet dropouts, the admissible maximum network-induced delays and the sampling period.</p><p>Another important aspect regarding the time-delay system approach is the proper Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional for the system (4) with a piecewise time-varying delay τ 1 (t). It is natural to use Lyapunov-Krasovskii function (LKF) method to derive an admissible upper bound τ max such that the certain system performance can be ensured. A number of results are based on the following LKF, or its modifications by adding some terms including information on the lower bound τ min and the upper bound τ max <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> where P and R are positive definite symmetric matrices. Apparently, the piecewise characteristic of the time-varying delay τ 1 (t) is not reflected from the LKF V (t, x t ). Thus, the obtained results are somewhat conservative <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Motivated by this observation, a time-dependent LKF is constructed for sampled-data systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, and then is extended to NCSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, which is similar to the one in (3). It is shown that timedependent LKFs can produce some less conservative results than those using time-independent LKFs such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">V (t, x t ) = x T (t)P x(t)+ ∫ 0 -τmax ∫ t t+θ ẋT (s)R ẋ(s)dsdθ</formula><p>The time-delay system approach in the discrete-time domain is also employed to the analysis and control of discretetime NCSs. One can refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Notice that the timedelay system approach aims to derive a maximum delay upper bound such that the system can tolerate and maintain some desired system performance. However, the maximum delay upper bound indicates the worst case of network-induced delays and the number of consecutive packet dropouts that the NCS can tolerate. If the worst case occurs rarely, the results derived from the time-delay system approach are certainly conservative, which is shown through some examples in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</p><p>2) A Markovian jumping system approach: A Markovian jumping system approach is developed for analysis and control of NCSs. This approach is usually applied in the discretetime domain. Taking network-induced delays into account, the closed-loop NCS is modeled as a Markovian jumping system, and an LQG optimal controller design method is then used <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. With a known packet dropout rate, the closed-loop NCS is modeled as a Markovian jumping system such that suitable H ∞ controllers can be designed <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. The stabilization issue on NCSs is discussed using a Markovian jumping system approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. It is worth pointing out that the notion of packet-dropout dependent Lyapunov functions is introduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, leading to some less conservative stability criteria. A significant Markovian jumping system model is proposed for NCSs with network-induced delays <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The key idea is to model sensor-controller delays and controller-actuator delays as two different homogeneous Markov chains, and hence the closed-loop NCS is modeled as a Markovian jumping system with two modes characterized by two Markov chains. A remarkable characteristic is that the controller gain is networkinduced-delay-dependent, while it is assumed to be a constant matrix in most results on NCSs. Furthermore, a necessary and sufficient condition on the existence of stabilizing state feedback controllers is presented <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, which is extended to output feedback control and robust mixed H 2 /H ∞ control <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> for NCSs with networked-induced delays.</p><p>In the continuous-time domain, relatively few results on NCSs are reported using a Markovian jumping system approach. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, a Markovian jumping system approach in the continuous-time domain is proposed for state feedback control of NCSs with networked-induced delays. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, sensor-controller delays and controller-actuator delays are modeled as two different Markov chains, while modes of two Markov chains are defined as different network load conditions. For a different network load condition, the networkinduced delay is upper-bounded by a different constant. Such a definition of the Markov chains needs the assumption that instantaneous states of the network load conditions should be accessible by the controller and the sensor, which is unreality. For instance, at the current time instant, it is impossible for the controller to know the future state of the network load condition in the channel from the controller to the actuator. By decomposing the delay interval into several subintervals, a Markovian jumping model is proposed for network-based filtering error systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. The proposed method can be adapted for stability analysis and control design of NCSs.</p><p>3) A switched system approach: A switched system approach with arbitrary switching is used in the analysis and control of NCSs. There are a number of ways to model an NCS as a switched system with arbitrary switching, see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Most of them are based on the discrete-time domain, while few of them on the continuous-time domain.</p><p>For an NCS with a continuous-time physical plant, some discrete-time switched models of the closed-loop NCS are proposed in different cases. Under the assumption that the control signal is time-varying (not constant) within a sampling period, a discrete-time switched model is established <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, where the sampling period is divided into a number of subintervals on which the controller reads its buffer at a higher frequency than the sampling frequency. With this model, stability and persistent disturbance attenuation are investigated for NCSs with network-induced delays less than one sampling period. If network-induced delays are less than one sampling period, a discrete time-delay switched model is derived for the closedloop NCS with finite consecutive packet dropouts <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. By employing the average dwell time technique, some quantitative relation between the packet dropout rate and stability of the NCS is established <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Note that the constraint on networkinduced delays less than one period is not easily satisfied for some NCSs. In order to remove this constraint, efforts are made, see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the NCS with networkinduced delays is modeled as a discrete-time switched system with multiple state delays and with both stable subsystems and unstable subsystems. The network-induced delay is timevarying and not necessarily less than one sampling period. By using an event-based discrete-time representation of the continuous-time physical plant, the NCS is modeled as a switched system with arbitrary switching <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, in which a long network-induced delay and non-uniform sampling are allowed. The physical plant is equipped with sensors and actuators that are grouped into a number of nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. At each transmission instant, a switching indicator is used to choose only one certain node to access the network and transmit its corresponding data packets. In this way, a discrete-time switched linear uncertain system model is established, where the constraint on networkinduced delays less than one period is removed.</p><p>For an NCS with a discrete-time physical plant, a switched system approach is proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> to deal with the output feedback control of NCSs with packet dropouts. Both networks from the sensor to the controller and from the controller to the actuator are modeled as two switches indicating that a data packet is dropped out or not, while network-induced delays are not taken into account. Using an iterative technique, a switched model for NCSs with packet dropouts and one step delay is presented to design state feedback controllers. The proposed method is improved by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, where network-induced delays may be two steps or more, but known to be constant.</p><p>In the continuous-time domain, a switched system approach is also studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> for NCSs with networkinduced delays. By introducing a switching function related to the variation of network-induced delays, the closed-loop NCS is modeled as a time-delay switched system with two switching modes. A significant feature is that each mode has a different controller gain. Based on the time-delay switched system model, together with the average dwell time technique, stability analysis is made <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, and exponential stabilization is investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</p><p>Another related system type is the sliding mode control systems where switching of control is assumed to be infinitely fast. Of course, this assumption may not be satisfied when sliding mode control systems are discretized using ZOH or Euler's discretization <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. This type of NCSs may result in severe chattering <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> or even discretization chaos <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Sophisticated control methods are required. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, a delay-dependent sufficient condition is obtained for asymptotic stability, and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, the idea of delay fractioning is used with a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional to derive sufficient conditions for asymptotical stability. Nevertheless, control of this type NCS is less attended due to the difficulty in dealing with discontinuity in NCSs where the usual dwell time conditions for switched NCS do not hold. New methodologies are needed to deal with the special class of NCSs effectively.</p><p>4) A stochastic system approach: In an NCS, networkinduced delays and packet dropouts sometimes exhibit random characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. The stochastic system method provides a powerful tool for analysis and control of NCSs with random network-induced delays and random packet dropouts. A number of results using stochastic system approaches are reported in the literature. To mention a few, by describing network-induced delays as a sequence of continuous random variables, stability is studied for NCSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>; Some input-output stability criteria are derived for a general class of nonlinear NCSs with exogenous disturbances using stochastic protocols in the presence of random network-induced delays and packet dropouts <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>.</p><p>For longer network-induced delays with certain probabilities, a stochastic system approach is proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> in the discrete-time domain. This approach can produce some less conservative stability criteria than those using a time-delay system approach. To make it clear, consider the following discrete time-delay system model of NCSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> x(k</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">+ 1) = Ax(k) + BKx(k -d(k))<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where the time-varying delay d(k) is a positive integer taking values in {τ 1 , • • • , τ q } with τ j &lt; τ j+1 (j = 1, 2, • • •, q -1). If the stochastic process {d(k)} is independently and identicallydistributed with Pr{d(k) = τ j } = α j , where ∑ q j=1 α j = 1, a stochastic description of (6) can be given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + ∑ q j=1 I d(k)=τj BKx(k -τ j ) (7) where I d(k)=τj is an indicator function: I d(k)=τj = 1 if d(k) = τ j ; I d(k)=τj =</formula><p>0 otherwise. The time-delay system approach based on (6) aims to derive an admissible maximum τ q for given τ 1 such that the system is asymptotically stable, while the stochastic system approach based on ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is to check if the system is mean-square stable for some certain probabilities α j related to the delay values τ j (j = 1, 2, • • • , q). Therefore, for some network-induced delays with smaller probabilities, it is possible that the time-delay system approach cannot draw any conclusion on stability of the NCS, but the stochastic system approach can, which is illustrated through some examples in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</p><p>For output feedback control of NCSs subject to random network-induced delays, a useful stochastic system approach can be presented by following the idea in <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. Introduce a stochastic variable to describe the system measurement ỹ(k) that the controller receives at the time instant k as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">{ y(k) = Cx(k) + B w w(k) ỹ(k) = (1 -σ k )y(k) + σ k y(k -1)<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where y(k) is the system measurement, and {σ k } is a Bernoulli distributed white sequence. From ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">8</ref>), it is clear to see that, ỹ(k) is either y(k) if the data packet containing the signal y(k) arrives at the controller before the kth sampling instant or y(k -1) if the arrival takes place after the kth sampling instant. Based on the model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">8</ref>), a stochastic system approach is proposed to deal with ∞ control <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, observer-based networked control <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, and H ∞ filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> for NCSs with random network-induced delays and packet dropouts. 5) An impulsive system approach: An NCS can be modeled as an impulsive system. For example, based on the time-delay system (4), an impulsive presentation can be easily formulated. In fact, denote z(t</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">) := x(i k ) for t k ≤ t &lt; t k+1 and ζ(t) := col{x(t), z(t)}. Then        ζ(t) = [ A BK 0 0 ] ζ(t), t k ≤ t &lt; t k+1 ζ(t k+1 ) = [ x(t - k+1 ) x(i k+1 ) ] , k ∈ N<label>(9)</label></formula><p>which is an impulsive system model of the NCS. The impulsive system approach is studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> in detail for NCSs. By choosing a discontinuous Lyapunov functional, some novel exponential stability criteria are obtained, which are less conservative than those using the time-delay system approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. By introducing an improved discontinuous Lyapunov functional, the impulsive system approach is employed to deal with the input-output stability for NCSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. Moreover, using the impulsive system approach, tracking control for NCSs is discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Event-triggered control</head><p>In event-triggered control, the execution of control tasks is determined by the occurrence of an event rather than the elapse of a fix time period in time-triggered control. Some significant advantages of event-triggered control were discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, from which it is shown that event-triggered control can obtain large reductions in resource utilization with minor control performance degradation. Motivated by those advantages, the first systematic design of event-based implementations of stabilizing feedback control laws is done <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Since then, event-triggered control is received a lot of attention, and becomes a hot research topic in the field of NCSs, see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>.</p><p>A key point to event-triggered control is to design a suitable triggering condition that determines whether or not a control task is executed. Suppose that the state x(t) of the physical plant is available. Then some existing triggering conditions are given as <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">∥x(t) -x(t k )∥ ≤ δ (10) [10]: ∥x(t) -x(t k )∥ ≤ δ∥x(t)∥<label>(11)</label></formula><p>[11]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">∥M 1/2 [x(t) -x(t k )]∥ ≤ δ∥M 1/2 x(t k )∥<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where t k denotes the time instant when the last control task is executed (or called the last event time instant); M &gt; 0 is a weighting matrix and δ &gt; 0 is a threshold. Thus, the next event time instant t k+1 can be given, respectively, as </p><formula xml:id="formula_16">t k+1 = inf{t &gt; t k |∥x(t) -x(t k )∥ &gt; δ} t k+1 = inf{t &gt; t k |∥x(t) -x(t k )∥ &gt; δ∥x(t</formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">t k+1 = inf{t &gt; t k |∥M 1 2 [x(t)-x(t k )]∥ &gt; δ∥M 1 2 x(t k )∥}</formula><p>Apparently, the triggered conditions in ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">12</ref>) depend on the instantaneous state x(t), which means that extra hardware is required to monitor the system state constantly <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>In order to avoid extra hardware, self-triggered control is proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In self-triggered control, an estimation of the next event time instant is made, and the dedicated hardware used in event-triggered control schemes is replaced by online computation based on previously received data and knowledge on the plant dynamics.</p><p>In either event-triggered control or self-triggered control, two important issues should be addressed: the minimal interevent time and the control design. i) The minimal interevent time τ * can be defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">τ * := min{t k+1 -t k |k = 1, 2, • • • }. If τ * is</formula><p>zero, infinite events occur within a finite time interval (Zeno behavior), which means that the eventand self-triggered control cannot be implemented on a digital platform. Hence, a certain positive minimal inter-event time should be ensured in either event-or self-triggered control. It is proven <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> that the positive minimal inter-event time is guaranteed to exist for linear physical plants without external disturbances and linear state feedback controllers, while it is shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> that the positive minimal inter-event time may be zero in case output feedback controllers are used in a similar setup. More especially, properties of inter-event times for event-triggered control systems are investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, and it is proven that for some classes of systems, even though a positive minimal inter-event time can be ensured in the absence of external disturbances, it possibly becomes zero for arbitrary small external disturbances. Thus, it is not an easy task to ensure that an event-triggered control system has a positive minimal inter-event time especially in the presence of external disturbances. ii) The control design should be related closely to the triggering condition predefined. However, in a number of results concerning event-or self-triggered control, the controller is usually given a priori, which means that the control design does not take the event-triggered nature into account. Regarding the above two issues, most of results focus on the first one, while the second issue is seldom involved.</p><p>In 2013, an effective event-triggered transmission scheme was proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> to address the above two issues. Let system states be sampled in a fix period h &gt; 0. Whether or not the current sampled signal should be transmitted to the controller is determined by a predefined triggering condition, which is given as e T (i 0 , j)Ωe(i 0 , j) ≤ σx T ((i 0 + j)h)Ωx((i 0 + j)h) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> where e(i 0 , j) = x((i 0 + j)h) -x(i 0 h) (j = 1, 2, • • • ); i 0 h stands for the last event time; &gt; 0 is a weighting matrix and σ ∈ (0, 1) is a threshold parameter. From the triggering condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, a clear observation is that events are triggered at the sampling instants, which leads to a guaranteed minimal inter-event time τ * ≥ h &gt; 0 even though external disturbances are imposed on the physical plant. Moreover, under the proposed event-triggering scheme, the closed-loop system with a state feedback controller u(t) = Kx(t) can be modeled as a time-delay system. For simplicity of presentation, we suppose that the communication network is reliable with no networkinduced delays and no packet dropouts. At the time instant kh (k = 1, 2, • • • ), the latest event time is denoted by t k . Then</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">u(t) = Kx(t k ), t ∈ [kh, (k + 1)h) (14) Set { τ (t) = t -kh φ(t) = x(t k ) -x(kh) t ∈ [kh, (k + 1)h)<label>(15)</label></formula><p>which leads to</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">u(t) = K[x(t -τ (t)) + φ(t)], t ∈ [kh, (k + 1)h) (16)</formula><p>where τ (t) and φ(t) satisfy, respectively,</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">0 ≤ τ (t) &lt; h φ T (t)Ωφ(t) ≤ σx T (t -τ (t))Ωx(t -τ (t))<label>(17)</label></formula><p>Therefore, the closed-loop system can be described as, for t ∈ [kh, (k + 1)h)</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">ẋ(t) = Ax(t) + BKx(t -τ (t)) + BKφ(t) (<label>18</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">)</formula><p>which is a time-delay system subject to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. By employing Lyapnuov-Krasovskii functional method, together with Sprocedure, the controller gain K and the weighting matrix Ω can be designed for a given threshold σ ∈ (0, 1). If taking network-induced delays into account, a time-delay system model similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> can also be established, and one can see <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> in detail. Due to the above advantages, the event-triggered transmission scheme comes to the fore. Under this scheme, a number of issues for NCSs is addressed, e.g. L 2 analysis and control design <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, tracking control <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>, dynamic output feedback control <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>, H ∞ filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> and consensus of multi-agent systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>. However, if taking packet dropouts into account, the delay-system model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">18</ref>) is inapplicable, and up to date, no any model is reported for this case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. NETWORK-BASED FILTERING</head><p>Control and filtering are two fundamental issues in the field of NCSs. In some circumstance, a filter is similar to a dynamic output feedback controller. In this section, we focus on network-based filtering.</p><p>The filtering problem is also called a state estimation problem. For a dynamic system in the presence of process noise, the objective of the filtering problem is to estimate system states (or a linear combination of them) using noisy output measurements. The celebrated Kalman filtering (or called H 2 filtering) approach provides a recursive algorithm to minimize the variance of the state estimation error when the noise is random with known statistical properties or has a known power spectral density. However, the Kalman filtering approach is sensitive to uncertainties in the exogenous noise signals. If statistical properties of the noise are unknown, the Kalman filtering approach is inapplicable. In this case, an alternative approach, called H ∞ filtering, can be applied. The H ∞ filtering approach was first considered for the scalar case using polynomial techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. In comparison with Kalman filtering, a significant characteristic of H ∞ filtering is that only upper bounds on the spectral density of the input With the rapid development of communication technology, communication networks are used to transmit signals between components of a control system because of its significant advantages. In modern H ∞ filtering setting, one usually use a communication network to transmit signals from a physical plant to a filter, which leads to network-based H ∞ filtering. A simple diagram for network-based H ∞ filtering is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Network-based H ∞ filtering allows the physical plant and the filter to be located at different places, which makes remote H ∞ filtering possible. Thus, compared with the traditional H ∞ filtering, network-based H ∞ filtering has wider potential application scopes. However, unfavourable constraints caused by limited bandwidth make the networkbased H ∞ filtering problem more complicated. An important concern is that, in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, the input signals of the filter ỹ(t) are no longer equal to the output measurements y(t) of the physical plant at any time t ≥ 0 because of network-induced delays and packet dropouts. In order to cope with this problem, a number of results are reported in the literature. In the following, we present a brief review on this issue from two aspects: in the continuous-time domain and in the discretetime domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Network-based filtering in the continuous-time domain</head><p>In the continuous-time domain, the network-based H ∞ filtering issue is addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. By taking network-induced delays and packet dropouts into account, the filtering error system is modeled as a linear system with an interval time-varying delay <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>. By employing Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, sufficient conditions on the existence of H ∞ filters are derived. By taking into account network-induced delays, packet dropouts and quantization errors, the filtering error system is modeled as an uncertain linear system with two additive time-delays <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. Both quadratic and parameter-dependent stability analysis approaches are exploited to provide alternatives for designing robust H ∞ filters with different degrees of conservativeness and computational complexity. By taking quantization errors into account, the filtering error system is modeled as a stochastic system with a piecewise time-varying delay <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. A time-dependent Lyapunov function approach is introduced to produce some less conservative sufficient conditions on the existence of suitable H ∞ filters. However, network-induced delays and packet dropouts are not considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>.</p><p>The time-delay system approach proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> is of somewhat limitation. The first is that the packet disorder phenomena are not taken into consideration. During data transmission through a communication network, a disordered data packet usually induces a long transmission delay, which often degrades the system performance. On the other hand, a disordered packet carries out-of-date signals, so it is unreasonable to be used for H ∞ estimation. The second is that the time-delay system approach aims at deriving an admissible maximum upper delay bound, which indicates the worst case of the network-induced delays and the number of consecutive packet dropouts. However, if the worst case occurs rarely, the obtained results are more conservative from the H ∞ performance point of view. The third is that the designed H ∞ filter just has one mode, which cannot reflect the variation characteristic of the network-induced delay and packet dropouts during signal transmission. Based on the above observations, a Markov jumping model approach with a jumping-like trigger is proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> to study the networkbased H ∞ filtering. Some distinctive characteristics are listed as follows.</p><p>First, a logical ZOH is introduced to select the newest data packets to be transmitted. With the logical ZOH, those disordered packets are dropped out actively. Moreover, both network-induced delays and the number of consecutive packet dropouts can be expressed explicitly.</p><p>Second, a Markov jumping filter model is presented. Denote by {t 1 , t 2 , • • • , t k , • • • } the sequence of instants when the logic ZOH updates its store. Then the input signal of the filter can be given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">ỹ(t) = y(t -τ (t)), t k ≤ t &lt; t k+1</formula><p>where the time-varying delay h(t) satisfies</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">h 1 ≤ τ (t) ≤ h 2 , τ (t) = 1, ∀t ≥ 0, a.e.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decompose the delay interval</head><formula xml:id="formula_26">[h 1 , h 2 ] uniformly into N subin- tervals denoted by I j , (j ∈ S {1, 2, • • • , N }).</formula><p>For any t ≥ 0, there exists an i ∈ S such that τ (t) ∈ I i . For a given ∆ &gt; 0, τ (t + ∆) may jump into another interval I j (j ∈ S), which means that τ (t + ∆) ∈ I j |τ (t) ∈ I i . Thus, we can use a Markov process to describe the above jumping of τ (t). Suppose that {r(t), t ≥ 0} is a continuous-time, discrete-state homogeneous Markov process taking values in a finite set S.

It is clear to see that the filter in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> has N modes, reflecting the variation in nature of the network-induced delays and packet dropouts, which is different from that <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>.</p><p>Third, a logic jumping-like trigger is designed to simulate the switching of the Markov process.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Network-based filtering in the discrete-time domain</head><p>In the discrete-time domain, the network-based H ∞ filtering issue is gained more attention than that in the continuous-time domain, and a number of results are derived, see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>. In this scenario, both the physical plant and the filter are described as discrete-time systems. Denote by y k and ỹk the measurement of the physical plant and the input of the filter, respectively. Then the models of ỹk , which are commonly used in the literature, can be summarized as follows.</p><p>i) The input of the filter ỹk is modeled as <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_33">ỹk = θ k y k + (1 -θ k )ỹ k-1 (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_34">)</formula><p>where the random variable θ k is a Bernoulli distributed white sequence taking values in {0, 1} with prob{θ</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">k = 1} = E {θ k } = α, (0 ≤ α ≤ 1).</formula><p>From this model, it is clear that the packet may be dropped out with a known probability α. If the packet is lost, ỹk = ỹk-1 ; otherwise, ỹk = y k . It is worth pointing out that this model can describe multiple packet dropouts. In fact, if</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">θ k = θ k-1 = 0 and θ k-2 = 1, then ỹk = ỹk-1 = ỹk-2 = y k-2 .</formula><p>Thus, two consecutive packets, i.e. y k and y k-1 , are dropped out. Up to date, much attention is paid to this model to deal with packet dropouts, see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>. However, this model does not take network-induced delays into account, which limits the application scopes of the obtained results.</p><p>ii) The input of the filter ỹk is modeled as <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref> {</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">y k = Cx(k) ỹk = (1 -θ k )q µ k (y k ) + θ k q µ k -ℓ k (y k-ℓ k )<label>(23)</label></formula><p>where x(k) is the system state; q µ (•) is a dynamic quantizer with the dynamic scaling µ; ℓ k is the number of consecutive packet dropouts and θ k is of the same meaning as that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.</p><p>This model is similar to the one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. However, both multiple packet dropouts and quantization effects are taken into consideration in the model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. Nevertheless, the effects of network-induced delays are also ignored. Moreover, the measurement output y k is not corrupted by noise, which does not meet the requirement of H ∞ filtering.</p><p>iii) ỹk is modeled as <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref> ỹk</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">= I {τ k =0} C 0 x(k)+ ∑ q j=1 I {τ k =dj } x(k-d j )+Dw(k)<label>(24</label></formula><p>) where w(k) is the disturbance noise; d j j = 1, 2, • • • , q are some known time-delays; τ k is a stochastic variable; I {τ k =0} and I {τ k =dj } are some indicator functions with</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">E {I {τ k =0} } = prob{τ k = 0} = p 0 and E {I {τ k =dj } } = prob{τ k = d j } = p j with</formula><p>∑ q j=0 p j ≤ 1. This model with q = 0 is used to describe the measurement missing <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref>. It is claimed <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref> that this model provides a unified representation to account for both the random communication delays and stochastic data missing. However, it is not clear how the measurement noise w(k) imposed on y k is transmitted through a communication network. Moreover, how to get the probabilities p j is not involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>. iv) ỹk is modeled as <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref> ỹk</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">∈ {y k , y k-1 , • • • , y k-Ñ } (<label>25</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_41">)</formula><p>where Ñ is the upper bound of random transmission delays.</p><p>The advantage of this model is that the transmission delays of data packets are allowed to be greater than one sampling period. Based on this description of ỹk , the random transmission delays are modeled as a Markov chain, and the filtering error system is modeled as a Markvoian switched system with state delays. However, the filter to be designed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref> has only one mode, irrespective of the variation of network-induced delays. This model is also employed to deal with H ∞ filtering for networked systems with multiple time-varying transmissions and random packet dropouts <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>. v) By introducing a logic data packet processor, which is motivated from <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, to choose the newest signals to actuate the filter, the input signal ỹk can be given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> ỹk = y k-r k <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> where r k = k -i k with i k being the time-stamp of the newest data packet that the logic data packet processor receives at the time instant k.</p><p>Compared with above models ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_33">22</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_40">25</ref>), the model ( <ref type="formula">26</ref>) has the following advantages: i) network-induced delays and packet dropouts are handled simultaneously; and ii) the filter to be designed has several modes, reflecting the variation of network-induced delays and packet dropouts. Moreover, the transmission probabilities from one mode to another mode do not need to be known a priori. However, effects of quantization errors are not considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>From the above mentioned, one can see that most of results on network-based filtering take some network constraints into account either in the continuous-time domain or in the discrete-time domain. How to construct a unified framework to analyze the effects of those network constraints simultaneously on the performance of the filtering error system is of theoretical and practical significance. An important observation is that the network-based filtering issue is usually addressed just from the control point of view, rather than from the communication network point of view. It may be helpful for solutions to the challenging issue if one can combine control theory with communication theory to investigate the problem of networkbased filtering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SOME CHALLENGING PROBLEMS</head><p>Although a great number of results on NCSs are reported in the literature, there are still a number of challenging problems to be solved out, some of them are presented as follows.</p><p>• It is challenging to model an NCS such that networkinduced delays and packet dropouts are explicitly dependent. From Section III.B, by introducing a logic ZOH to an NCS, network-induced delays and packet dropouts can be expressed explicitly. Consequently, it is believed that such a novel model for NCSs is possible. With the model, effects of network-induced delays and packet dropouts on NCSs can be clearly revealed, respectively. However, in the existing models, network-induced delays and packet dropouts are lumped together. As a result, it is hard to distinguish their respective effects on NCSs; • For industrial control and applications of NCSs, it is interesting to investigate possible positive effects of network-induced delays and packet dropouts on NCSs.</p><p>The positive effects of network-induced delays are shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> through the output tracking control of a val der Pol-Duffing oscillator. From the discussion on quenching <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>, some unstable systems with constant time-delay may be stable if the delay becomes time-varying. Hence, proper network-induced delays and packet dropouts may make an unstable system with constant time-delay stable in network environments, which is still challenging; • In event-triggered control, it is of significance to design event-triggered controllers by taking the following triggering condition into account</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">∫ t t k ∥x(s) -x(t k )∥ds ≤ σ (<label>27</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_43">)</formula><p>where σ &gt; 0 is a threshold and t k denotes the last event time. The triggering condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> characterizes that once the accumulation error of the system state reaches the threshold σ, an event is triggered. It is more useful than those triggering conditions ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">12</ref>) from two points of view: i) some system performance is usually defined as an integral form similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>; and ii) in some situation, for example, when the system approaches to its equilibrium state, no events are triggered after a certain time instant if using the triggering conditions (10)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, because the error ||x(t) -x(t k )|| is not large enough to trigger the next event, while it is the opposite if using the triggering condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. The condition ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_42">27</ref>) is proposed originally in <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>, but no design issue is addressed. How to address the control design based on the triggering condition ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_42">27</ref>) is a challenging issue in event-triggered control; • Event-triggered control and filtering should take network dynamics into account. In event-triggered control and filtering, whether or not an event is triggered should be determined not only by the change of system measurements but also by the real-time dynamics of communication networks. If the current network traffic is busy, triggering an event is beneficial neither for the system performance nor for a guaranteed quality of service (QoS) of the network. If the current network traffic is idle, triggering events as many as possible in the sense that the good QoS of the network can be ensured may improve the system performance. Therefore, how to combine system measurements with network dynamics to define suitable triggering conditions in event-triggered control is of significance both in theory and in real applications, which is still challenging; • In event-triggered control and filtering, it is often to assume that packet dropouts and packet disorders do not occur. This assumption is not practical when packets are transmitted through a communication network. How to deal with packet dropouts and packet disorders in eventtriggered control and filtering is challenging. Up to date, taking packet dropouts and packet disorders into account, no efficient approaches are proposed to design eventtriggered controllers and filters; and • Distributed networked control and distributed networkbased filtering are still attractive and challenging. Although some results on these issues are reported in the literature, see the survey paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref> and references therein, they are usually based on some strong assumptions when parts of network constraints are taken into account.</p><p>In fact, many practical factors need to be considered for distributed control and filtering in network environments.</p><p>To mention a few, network-induced delays in different channels between an agent and its neighbours are different and time-varying; packet dropouts occur randomly in different communication channels; the topologies of the agents in a distributed system are not always the same at any time; and so on. These factors indeed make the analysis and synthesis of distributed networked control and distributed network-based filtering more complicated, especially for distributed systems with a large number of agents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper has provided an overview on the theoretical development of networked control systems based on the results reported in the literature in the last decade. In-depth analysis and discussion has been made on sampled-data control, networked control and event-triggered control, where existing research approaches have been summarized. Moreover, advanced results on network-based filtering have been also reviewed both in the continuous-time domain and in the discretetime domain. Finally, some challenging problems have been presented to suggest the future research directions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
