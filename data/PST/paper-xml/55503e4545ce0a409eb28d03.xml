<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Based on decision-theoretic rough set model of three-way decisions, we augment the existing model by introducing linguistic terms. Considering the two types of parameters being used in the three-way decisions with linguistic assessment, a certain type of novel three-way decisions based on the Bayesian decision procedure is constructed. In this way, three-way decisions with decision-theoretic rough sets are extended to the qualitative environment. With the aid of multi-attribute group decision making, the values of these parameters are determined. An adaptive algorithm supporting consistency improvement of multi-attribute group decision making is designed. Then, we optimize the scales of the linguistic terms with the use of particle swarm optimization. The values of these parameters of three-way decisions are aggregated when proceeding with group decision making.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Three-way decisions, consisting of acceptance, noncommitment (or further investigation) and rejection, are commonly encountered in problem solving strategies occurring in many decision process <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. This way of decision-making has been applied to many domains, such as environmental precaution <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, text classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, information filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, risk decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, cluster <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>, investment decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, government decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, shadowed sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, email filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, etc. Pawlak's rough sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref> provide a certain convenient theoretical interpretation of the three-way decisions. The lower approximation and the upper approximation of rough sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref> divide the universe of discourse (space) into the three pairwise disjoint regions: positive region, boundary region and negative region. The notion of three-way decisions based on the three pairwise disjoint regions was proposed by Yao <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. The three-way decisions comprise positive rules, boundary rules and negative rules. The positive rules associated with the positive region produce acceptance decisions. The negative rules coming with the negative region give rise to rejection decisions, while the boundary rules (coming with the boundary region) result in decisions of non-commitment.</p><p>Original rough sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> require exact results of classification and do not involve the tolerance for errors. Probabilistic rough sets arise a generalized model for original rough sets, which hinge on two components, i.e. a conditional probability and a pair of thresholds (˛, ˇ). The tolerance of errors is characterized by the thresholds of probabilistic rough sets. A series of models of probabilistic rough sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref> was proposed, such as 0.5-probabilistic rough sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, decision-theoretic rough sets (DTRS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>, variable precision rough sets (VPRS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, Bayesian rough sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, parameterized rough sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, etc. With respect to probabilistic rough set models, we need to compare the conditional probability with the thresholds in order to make a decision (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Following studies reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, the researches on threeway decisions with probabilistic rough sets can be summarized as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>• The determination of threshold values used in probabilistic rough set models. The determination of a pair of thresholds for the probabilistic rough sets constitutes a challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The pair of thresholds presented in most probabilistic rough set models comes with subjectively assigned values and lacks of semantics <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. In recent years, the determinations of thresholds are discussed in the framework of DTRS, which was first proposed by Yao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> using the Bayesian decision procedure. The pair of thresholds used in the DTRS model can be automatically calculated by loss functions with the minimum expected overall risk. In some cases, the loss function can be expressed in the form of money, energy or time <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Yao <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> adopted the relative value of loss function to express the thresholds. Herbert and Yao <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> introduced game theory to determinate the threshold values of probabilistic rough sets. Li and Zhou <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> discussed the value of loss function for a multi-view DTRS decision model based on different attitudes of decision makers. Liang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> generalized a concept of the precise value of loss function to triangular fuzzy decision-theoretic rough sets. Considering different criteria adopted by different agents, Yang and Yao <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> discussed some aggregation methods of loss functions and proposed a multiagent DTRS model. • The determination of the conditional probability used in probabilistic rough set models. Yao and Zhou <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> proposed a naive Bayesian decision-theoretic rough set model, where the conditional probability is estimated by using the Bayes theorem with naive probabilistic independence assumption. Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> employed binary logistic regression to compute the conditional probability of DTRS model.</p><p>Evidently, the conditional probability and the thresholds are two important components of three-way decisions. DTRS is a representative model of probabilistic rough sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. It not only considers the decision semantics, e.g. cost, risk, but also explains the thresholds of probabilistic rough set models <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. The values of the thresholds used in the probabilistic rough set models are implied by the loss functions and associated with decision makers. Note that the loss functions and the conditional probability presented in the existing studies are mainly numerics. However, in the realistic decision process, some influencing factors result in decision makers not to assign specific numerics, e.g. cost, time and complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Under these circumstances, the assessment of the description in terms of quantitative expressions is not suitable, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. Other than the results reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, we can resort ourselves to the assessment realized with the aid of linguistic terms. Linguistic terms have been witnessed in numerous situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. For example, when evaluating a performance of a smartphone, linguistic terms like good, fair, poor can be considered. When we grade a student, linguistic terms like good, medium, poor can be used. In this case, the linguistic information can be directly used to compute and the linguistic terms need not been transformed into numerical counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. Considering the conditional probability and the loss functions of the DTRS model with linguistic terms, we construct a certain type of novel three-way decisions. In light of the results presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, these parameters of three-way decisions are evaluated by decision makers. In order to realize linguistic assessment of both the conditional probability and the loss functions, group decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref>] is adopted. Group decision making can aggregate the wisdom of the different domain experts and effectively copes with the risk decision problem. More importantly, it provides a semantic interpretation for the relevant parameters of three-way decisions. Reaching consensus in group decision making becomes an essential step. For the consensus problem of group decision making, Pedrycz and Song <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> developed a novel approach. The approach used a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize the scale over which linguistic terms were expressed. PSO is a population-based optimization method, which uses a swarm of particles to determine an optimal solution in a search space <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The conditional probability and the loss functions comprise the set of multi-attributes. Based on the approach reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, this study further discusses the determination for the values of its parameters (i.e. conditional probability and loss functions) with the aid of multiple-attribute group decision making. The main contribution of our study can be identified as follows: (a) We provide a method of the determination of the two types of parameters used in the DTRS; (b) The application of DTRS is extended to the scenarios of qualitative evaluation; (c) An algorithm is designed to improve the inconsistency of multiattribute group decision making under linguistic assessment (see <ref type="bibr">Algorithm 1)</ref>.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides some underlying concepts of probabilistic rough sets, Bayesian decision procedure, DTRS, linguistic terms and related operational laws. In Section 3, a certain type of novel three-way decisions is constructed. With the aid of multi-attribute group decision making with the linguistic assessment, Section 4 designs an adaptive algorithm for consistency improvement and investigates the determination of the values of both the conditional probability and the loss functions. An example is presented to illustrate the application of the novel three-way decisions in Section 5. Section 6 concludes this study and elaborates on future studies.</p></div>

They give rise to three-way decisions. According to the probabilistic lower and upper approximations (i.e., (1) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>)), the probabilistic positive, boundary and negative regions can be defined as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">POS(C) = {x ∈ U | Pr(C|[x])≥˛},<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">BND(C) = {x ∈ U | ˇ &lt; Pr(C|[x]) &lt; ˛},<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">NEG(C) = {x ∈ U | Pr(C|[x]) ≤ ˇ}.<label>(6)</label></formula><p>The rules derived by the positive region POS(C) make decisions of acceptance.

( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">7</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">8</ref>) compose two-way decisions, which is a special case of three-way decisions. In most of probabilistic rough sets, the interpretation of the thresholds ˛ and ˇ is not fully transparent. To overcome these weaknesses, the semantic explanation presented in DTRS model is given by bringing a Bayesian decision procedure to probabilistic rough sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. In what follows, we briefly elaborate on the Bayesian decision theory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Bayesian decision theory</head><p>Based on observed evidence, the Bayesian decision procedure produces a decision with the minimum risk. In this section, we present a brief description of the procedure, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The set of states given by = {w 1 , w 2 , . . ., w m } is a finite set of m states and A = {a 1 , a 2 , . . ., a n } is a finite set of n possible actions. Pr(w i |x) is the conditional probability of an object x being in state w i given that the object is described by x. Let (a j |w i ) denote the loss or cost for taking action a j in the state w i . For an object x, suppose the action </p><p>For a given object x, a decision rule can be conceived as a function (x) that specifies which action to take.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">The determination for the values of two types of parameters used in the three-way decisions</head><p>In Section 3, we have constructed three novel models of three-way decisions with linguistic assessment. They extend the applications of three-way decisions to the linguistic (qualitative) environment. When using these models to form decision rules, we need determine the values of both the conditional probability and the loss functions in advance. Take Model 3 as an example, we investigate a method to determine the values of two kinds of parameters with linguistic terms in this section. For Model 3, the conditional probability and the loss functions are the critical factors of three-way decisions. For example, the loss functions containing six types (aspects) of losses impact the three-way decisions. In light of the likert scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and questionnaire survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, the values of both the conditional probability and the loss functions with linguistic terms can be acquired from experts. Group decision making can aggregate the wisdom of the different domain experts and effectively copes with the risk decision problem. More importantly, it provides a semantic interpretation for the relevant parameters of three-way decisions. In fact, the decision rules (P 3 )-(N 3 ) of threeway decisions including the aggregated functions imply the rank strategies of alternatives, which the conditional probability and the loss functions constitute the set of multi-attributes. With the above analysis, multi-attribute group decision making emerges as a suitable method to determine the values of two kinds of parameters used in the novel three-way decisions.</p></div>

Before aggregating individual decision, we need to evaluate the effectiveness of the group decision result by completing a comparison between the consensus degree and a given threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. If the consensus degree is lower than this threshold, it indicates that there are a number of different opinions among experts. On the contrary, when the consensus degree is higher than the threshold, it shows that most of experts have the same or similar opinion. With respect to reaching consensus, some adaptive approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref> have been proposed. The consensus is reached by modifying the evaluation outcomes. Pedrycz and Song <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> proposed a new approach to consistency improvement, where the improvement is achieved by adjusting the scale of linguistic terms. As a simple example, consider two decision makers one of which comes with an evaluation "Medium" while the second one arrives at the assessment "Very high", i.e. S 4 and S 7 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. In this case, we usually ask the experts to re-evaluate and change their evaluation results until the consistency level is enough high. Their final evaluations may be inclined to a point via negotiation. The approach proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> evolves the negotiation process of experts and produces higher values of consistency.</p><p>Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, we bring this idea into the multi-attribute group decision making with linguistic assessment. The scale of linguistic terms is usually uniform as encountered in the existing literatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. With the aid of the PSO algorithm, the consistency level is elevated by making the scale non-uniform.</p><p>In what follows, we briefly recall the PSO optimization framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. In the method, one simulates a swarm behavior in birds flocking and fish schooling to guide the particles to search for globally optimum (minimum or maximum) of a given objective function. The objective function determines the quality of the solution represented by each particle's position. Each particle adjusts its movement and position according to its own flying experience and its companions' flying experience. Each particle is treated as a point in a D dimensional space. The gth particle is represented as x g = (x g1 , x g2 , . . ., x gD ) and its velocity vector is given as v g = (v g1 , v g2 , . . ., v gD ). At any time step f, the gth particle has an associated position vector x g (f) = (x g1 (f), x g2 (f), . . ., x gD (f)), and the velocity vector v g (f ) = (v g1 (f ), v g2 (f ), . . ., v gD (f )). A vector pb g (f) = (pb g1 (f), pb g2 (f), . . ., pb gD (f)) stores the best position that the particle has ever visited. The best position among all the particles in the population is represented by a vector pg(f) = (pg 1 (f), pg 2 (f), . . ., pg D (f)). The PSO algorithm iteratively updates the velocity and the position of each particle until a stopping criterion has been met. For the gth particle, its basic update rules of the velocity and the position in the dth (d = 1, 2, . . ., D) dimensional space at the time step f are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">v gd (f + 1) = Á(f ) × v gd (f ) + c 1 × rand() × (pb gd (f ) -x gd (f )) + c 2 × Rand() × (pg d (f ) -x gd (f ));<label>(38)</label></formula><p>x gd (f + 1) = x gd (f ) + v gd (f + 1).</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_61">)<label>39</label></formula><p>where c 1 and c 2 are two constants acceleration coefficients being typically set to 2, rand() and Rand() are random functions in the rang [0, 1]. Á(f) is the time-dependent inertia weight and brings in a significant improvement to the PSO performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. The inertia weight can be defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_62">Á(f ) = 0.9 -(0.9 -0.4) × f T max .

( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_64">41</ref>) is minimized until it is lower than a given threshold of inconsistency ı, i.e. Q ≤ ı. If Q &gt; ı, we need continue to search the lower objective function value in the hyperspace. The threshold parameter ı represents the necessary level of the overall inconsistency for a solution to be accepted by the group <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, and has been discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>.

According to the result reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, we also accept the condition ı ≤ 0.5n, where n is the number of the experts. Additionally, we consider that the objective function may not converge to ı. In order to avoid this situation, we set the total number of generations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Therefore, based on the predetermined uniform distribution of linguistic terms on the evaluation scale, an adaptive algorithm for consistency improvement of multi-attribute group decision making under linguistic assessment is described as follows.</p><p>Step 1: Determine the parameters of multiple-attribute group decision making: the number of experts E = {e 1 , e 2 , . . ., e n } and their weights W = {w 1 , w 2 , . . ., w n } T .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">An illustrative example</head><p>To succeed in a competitive and rapid variable market environment, new product development (NPD) is indeed very important for a company <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. NPD can improve its core competitiveness and increase the value of the company, e.g. its market share and profits <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The primary task of NPD is to satisfy the customers' demands. The customers' demands change quickly and directly impact the development of the company. NPD not only satisfies the customers' demand, but also belongs to the company's requirement. The new product idea is a pivotal component of the NPD. With an overwhelming number of new product ideas, the manager in a company has to allocate scarce resources to potential new products. Normally, the company is faced with limited resources. The procedure of the NPD also exists some risky and uncertain factors. Ozer <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> summarized four categories factors which influence decision making in the NPD: task-related factors, decision maker-related factors, elicitation-related factors and aggregationrelated factors. Kengpol and O'Brien <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> constructed a hierarchy of common criteria and sub-criteria. In order to reduce the risks and allocate resources in the NPD, the manager need to evaluate the new product ideas and select the potential ones to develop. For the sake of the evaluation more confidently and accurately, the manager has to aggregate the multiple experts' opinions, such as salesmen, designers, managers and others. Ozer <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> pointed at the two types of erroneous selection decisions in the NPD. One is they might decide to pursue a potential unsuccessful new product idea. The other is that they might decide not to develop a potential and successful new product. The two types of errors may cause enormous losses to the company. The former leads to investment loses while the latter leads to missed investment opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Except the selection and non-selection strategies of the new product idea, the deferred action is the third strategy. In particular, the manager hard make a choice as to the new product ideas, while he or she does not want to lose some development chances. The manager need collect more information to make this choice. Hence, the selection decisions of the new product idea are consistent with three-way decisions. In this section, we use the three-way decisions with linguistic assessment to support the selection decisions of the new product idea and illustrate the decision process of the novel three-way decisions. The procedure of the selection decisions of the new product idea is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref>.</p><p>In what follows, we elaborate on details of the steps described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref>. For the selection decisions of the new product idea, we have two states = {C, ¬ C} indicating that the new product idea is a good one or the bad one, respectively. The set of actions for the new product idea x is given by A = {a P , a B , a N }, where a P , a B , and a N represent selection, need for further investigation and not to make a selection, respectively. The actions a P , a B , and a N correspond with (P 3 )-(N 3 ) or (P 3 )-(N 3 ). For the novel three-way decisions of Model 3, there are seven attributes. The conditional probability Pr(C|[p i ]) denotes the probability of a product idea p i being a good idea, which p i is described by its equivalence class p i (i = 1, 2, • • • , m). PP , BP and NP are the losses incurred for taking actions of selection, need further investigation and do not make selection respectively, when the new product idea belongs to a good idea. Similarly, PN , BN and NN are the losses incurred for taking actions of selection, need further investigated and do not selection when the new product idea is a bad one. With respect to some risky and uncertain factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, the seven parameters of each new product idea are imprecisely evaluated in NPD. A Likert scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> is a technique for measurement of decision makers' attitude and collecting their experiences. This approach is widely used to scale responses in survey researches <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. Inspired from the results, we adopt linguistic term to assess seven parameters of the new product ideas. For the threshold value ı of the whole inconsistency used in the group decision making, Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> suggested that each individual inconsistency was set to 0.15. Wu and Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> set a more rigorous value of 0.1 to each individual inconsistency. Other authors gave some different threshold values depending upon the problem at hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. Here, we set the threshold value of overall inconsistency to be ı = 0.28.</p><p>Suppose that there are nine new product ideas for the company, i.e., p 1 , p 2 , • • • , p 9 and m = 9. For making reasonable selection decisions, a salesman, a designer and a manger treated as experts participate in the evaluation, which is denoted as (e 1 , e 2 , e 3 ). We assume that they have the same weight, i.e., W = {w 1 , w 2 , w 3 } T = {1/3, 1/3, 1/3}</p><p>T . The corresponding group decision matrix is G = In Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref>, the three decision matrices collect the evaluation outcomes of each decision maker. Based on the results of D 1 -D 3 , we elaborate the decision process of the novel three-way decisions. Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> discussed the deviation measures of linguistic preference relations in group decision making. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>, we compute the deviate degrees of individual to group decision under the original of linguistic terms, namely, d(e 1 , G) = 0.1138, d(e 2 , G) = 0.1025 and d(e 3 , G) = 0.1224. Under the original situation of linguistic terms, the inconsistency of group decision making Q based on (41) is 0.3386 by using the method presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Q is used to measure the effectiveness of group decision making. In this case, Q &gt; ı = 0.28. Hence, we need to determinate the values of seven attributes for the new product ideas based on Algorithm 1 and group decision making. In allusion to the method presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, Algorithm 1 is a novel method for the improvement of the inconsistency of group decision making with the aid of PSO.</p><formula xml:id="formula_78">( M ij ) 9×7 (1 ≤ i ≤ 9, 1 ≤ j ≤<label>7</label></formula><p>According to the results reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, the values of the learning factors are set as c 1 = c 2 = 2, the population of particles is equal to Num = 100 and the total number of generations is fixed as T max = 500. The objective function is Q standing in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>, which is the inconsistency of group decision making. First, we reach the consensus of group decision making by optimizing the scale of linguistic terms and obtain the optimal scales. The progression of Algorithm 1 is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5</ref>.   </p></div>

In Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, the optimal cutoff points between 0 and 8 are 2.87, 2.92, 3.92, 4.03, 4.29, 4.62 and 5.13 along the horizontal ordinate successively. To reach consensus of group decision making, the optimal cutoff points of linguistic terms become distributed unevenly and this reduces the inconsistency of group decision making.</p><p>In light of (36), we also calculate the deviate degrees of individual to group decision under the optimal situation of linguistic terms. Under the original and the optimal situations of linguistic terms, we compare the deviate degrees of individual to group decision, respectively. Their results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7</ref>.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7</ref>, the horizontal axis denotes the notation of individual decision matrix, which has D 1 , D 2 and D 3 . The vertical axis is the deviate degrees of individual to group decision. For the original situations of linguistic terms, the deviate degrees of individual to group decision are calculated by Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. For the optimal situations of linguistic terms, the deviate degrees of individual to group decision based on Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> have been optimized by Algorithm 1. In this situation, the optimized results are d(e 1 , G) = 0.0860, d(e 2 , G) = 0.0950 and d(e 3 , G) = 0.0920. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7</ref>, it is apparent the deviate degrees of individual to group decision have been reduced under the optimal situation of linguistic terms. The optimal result is lower than a given threshold of inconsistency ı and achieves the requirement of consistency of group decision making.</p><p>With regards to the improvement of the inconsistency of group decision making, Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> developed an automatic approach, which can automatically modify the diverging individual opinions so as to reach consensus amongst all the experts' opinions.

According to the method presented in Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, we continue to modify the decision matrices by utilizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref> until the inconsistency of group decision making Q is lower than ı.

Compared with the method presented in Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, the number of iterations of   Algorithm 1 is less than the results of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref>.

The values of the seven parameters for the new product ideas are determined in the group decision matrix G, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref>.

The selection decisions of these new product ideas are made in light of (P 3 )-(N 3 ). The thresholds of p 5 and p 6 come with the relationship: 0 ≤ ˛3 ≤ 3 ≤ ˇ3 ≤ 8. The selection decisions of these new product ideas are made in light of (P 3 )-(N 3 ). For the nine new product ideas, the experts believe that p 1 , p 4 and p 5 need to be selected to develop immediately, while p 3 , p 6 and p 8 should not be selected to develop. In addition, they also think p 2 , p 7 and p 9 need be further investigated. The selection decisions of the new product ideas are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">10</ref>. In the above illustrative example, the results of Tables 4-6 are source data, which are used to elaborate the decision process of the novel three-way decisions. We summarize the advantages of our proposed method by comparing with the existing model presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> as follows: First, the proposed method extends the existing model of DTRS to a qualitative decision environment. In this example, Model 3 accommodates the linguistic assessment scenario. Second, group decision making provides a semantic interpretation for the relevant parameters of three-way decisions. Under the consistent situation of group decision making, we finally determine the conditional probability and the losses for each new product idea. Third, the proposed method further improves the inconsistency problem of group decision making. The solution is designed by Algorithm 1, which focuses on optimizing the original method reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The optimized result has been shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7</ref>. In general, the novel three-way decisions can availably guild us to make a decision with linguistic assessment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>Based on the DTRS model, our study takes the conditional probability and the thresholds with linguistic terms into consideration and proposes one type of novel three-way decisions, i.e. Models 1-3. In the context of multi-attribute group decision making, the values of both the conditional probability and the loss functions of Model 3 are determined by Algorithm 1 and group decision making, in which Algorithm 1 improves the inconsistency of multi-attribute group decision making under linguistic assessment. Besides Model 3, the algorithm is also suitable to other models of three-way decisions. This study provides a method for the determination of the parameters of DTRS and extends its range of applications. Future researches may focus on designing some mechanisms to enhance the performance of Algorithm 1 and draw general conclusions, such as high inconsistency, robustness, etc.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
