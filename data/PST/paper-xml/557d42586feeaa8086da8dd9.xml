<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Finding minimum-time planning strategies for robot manipulators, given actuator constraints, has been a long-standing concern in the robotics literature. This interest is largely motivated by the obvious relationship between execution time of specific tasks and productivity. Because of the nonlinear multi-input dynamics of robot manipulators, however, finding true minimum-time solutions is difficult. In early methods, various assumptions or simplifications on the manipulator dynamics were used to obtain near-minimum time solutions. <ref type="bibr">Kahn and Roth [4]</ref> used linearization techniques and studied the application of linear optimal control theory. Purely kinematic approaches were proposed by <ref type="bibr">Lin,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chang,</ref><ref type="bibr">and Luh [5]</ref> while Scheinman and Roth, 1111, <ref type="bibr">Wen and Desrochers [16]</ref>, and Singh and Leu 1151 used other kinds of simplifying assumptions. In particular, the problem is considerably simplified if the robot arm is assumed to be statically balanced <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>; such an assumption, however, precludes the robot from manipulating various loads of weights and sizes similar to its own, as the human arm routinely does.</p><p>The true minimum-time solution along a prescribed path was derived by <ref type="bibr">Bobrow, Dubowsky, and Gibson, [I]</ref>, [ 2 ] and <ref type="bibr">Shin and McKay,</ref><ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>, [14], based on the possibility of parametrizing the path with a single scalar variable. Their methods consider the full nonlinear manipulator dynamics and the torque constraints, and thus provide true minimum-time solutions. <ref type="bibr">Pfeiffer and Johanni (71. [8]</ref> ex-I1 1 F IRAhSAC TIONS O N KOBC)T!CS AND AUTOMATION, VQL 5, NO 1, <ref type="bibr">FEBRUARY 1989</ref> pres5 the paraiucterixd dynamic equations slightly differently from the tornier W O k . while using in essence the same procedure as in Shin and <ref type="bibr">McKay. 1131. [14]</ref>. These algorithms, however, require a time derivative. in order to find the maximum possible manipulator Differentiating (6) with respect to time twice, the joint velocity and acceleration can be written as warch over the whole range of the scalar parameter and that of its tip velocity limit for each value of the parameter.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">fj = fSS (7) (8) q = fss + fssS2.</formula><p>In this communication. new characteristics of the time-optimal planning problem for robot manipulators are identified and applied to the existing prescribed-path algorithms. A modification is proposed, which greatly siniplifies the original procedures and provides a new interpretation of the time-optimal problem. Characteristic switch-inK p o i n ~s are ddined. which are uniquely determined given the inanipulator dynamics. the actuator bounds, and the prescribed path. Nc.ces\aiy conditions describing the characteristic switching points are derived ab functions of the scalar parameter defining the position aloiig thc path. Based on the characteristic switching points, limit curves are drawn in the phase plane. in contrast with the maximum velocity curves of existing methods. The limit curves set sharper admissible regions for the phase-piane trajectory, and shape the solution for the riine-optimal trajectory accordingly.</p><p>After a retiew. in Section 11. ofthe methods of <ref type="bibr">Bobrow et al. [l]</ref>,</p><p>[I] and <ref type="bibr">Shin and McMay. 8131. [14]</ref>, the new minimum-time algorithm is described in Section 111. A numerical example, in Section IV , demonstrates the potential for computational improvements of severa1 order5 of' magnitude over existing methods, making quasireal-time trajectory generation feasible. Section V offers brief concluding remarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">EXISTIWG SOLUTIONS TO THE OPTIMAL PLANNING PROBLEM</head><p>In the absence of friction or other disturbances, the dynamics of a rigid manipulat~or can be written as where q is the n x 1 vector ofjoint displacements, T is the n x 1 vector of applied joint torques (or forces), H ( q ) is the n x n symmetric positive-definite manipulator inertia matrix, 4'(Q(q)q is the n x 1 vector of' centripetal and Coriolis torques (with Q(q) an n x n x n array), and g(q) is the n x 1 vector of gravitational torques. When the path for the msnipulator tip to foilow is specified, the vector q ofjoint di\placeinenti ~i t n be mtritt'en as a function of a single parameter s, tither in task space [ 11, [?I or in joint space [13], 1141. Therefore, the manipulator +naInics can be expressed as n equations in the par;1111~'1tr s. N ~m e l y . in task. space, the position and orientation of the end-ct'l'ecror can be represented by a 6 x 1 vector p as (2) p = (x;rm) = (x,y.z;a],az,as) where x i i the end-effector position vector, and a is composed of Euler angles representing the orientation of the end-effector with respect to a fixed frame.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IrI. IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE OPTIMAL PLANNING ALGORITHM</head><p>In this section, we show that the points, which we shall refer to as characteristic switching points, where the phase plane trajectory just meets the maximum velocity curve without violating the actuator constraints, can be exhaustively classified into three possible types.</p><p>We call these types the zero-inertia point, the disconiiniti/y point, and the tangent point. We describe how the characteristic switching points can be directly obtained without computing the maximum velocity curve explicitly, and how this property can be exploited to simplify the derivation of the time-optimal solution. Section III-A finds the switching points where the maximum velocity curve is continuous but not differentiable (zero-inertia points), which correspond to having one of the ai change signs. Section 111-B covers the case where the maximum velocity curve is discontinuous (discontinuity points). Section 111-C, which represents the main result of this communication, derives a simple procedure to find the switching points where the maximum velocity curve is continuous and differentiable (tangent points). Inclusion of viscous friction effects and state-dependent actuator bounds is detailed in Section 111-D.</p><p>The resulting algorithm is summarized in Section 111-E.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A . Case I: The Zero-Inertia Point</head><p>If, in ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>), ai@) = 0 for some i , then the corresponding terms a , and pi of ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>) cannot be defined. In this case the acceleration S at the maximum velocity Smax is not uniquely determined. The timeoptimal phase-plane trajectory may include this singular point. which is, therefore, a candidate characteristic switching point, as noticed in [7]. We call this case the zero-inertia point, since a,(s) represents an inertia-like term in the parameterized dynamic equation, Zero-inertia points can be found directly from the expression of a,ls).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Case 2: The Discontinuity Point</head><p>In this subsection and the next, we shall assume that none of the ai@) is zero in the vicinity of the characteristic switching point considered (this case having been treated in the previous subsection). We can further assume, without loss of generality, that the first derivative of the parameterized path function, namely pr of 111 and [2] or fs of [13] and [14], is continuous. Indeed, if this is not the case at a particular point, then at this point the velocity along the path is necessarily zero (since, physically, the velocity vector cannot be discontinuous), so that the task can be partitioned into two independent optimal control problems,</p><p>The second derivative pss (or fss), however, may be discontinuous. Assume that for a given value of s ffm(s, S) 5 s 5 P&amp;, <ref type="bibr">S)</ref> which means that joint m gives the maximum of decelerations among a i ' s and joint k gives the minimum of accelerations among 0,'s. At the maximum velocity limits = Smax the condition cik = should be satisfied. Furthermore, for infinitesimally smaller and larger values of s in the vicinity of given s, if any component in the expressions of ak and Pm changes discontinuously, then the maximum velocity SmaX is discontinuous in that vicinity. Assuming as we do that none of the a@) is zero, the only component which may be discontinuous in ak or Pm is pss (or fss). Therefore, the maximum velocity curve is discontinuous (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) if and only if pss (or fss) is discontinuous.</p><p>From the analysis just described, the corresponding discontinuity points are easy to find without constructing the maximum velocity curve. One must compute the values of s wherep,, (orfss) is discontinuous, then calculate the associated maximum velocity limits. Two values of S are obtained for each value of s, the smaller of which defines the possible point where the phase-plane trajectory can touch. For example, if the path is parameterized in task space, and the parameter s is the displacement along the path from the starting point. then the position components xss of pss are normal to the path, with the magnitude of xss being the reciprocal of the radius of the path. In this case, the discontinuity point is where the curvature of the path changes discontinuously.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Case 3: The Tangent Point</head><p>Subsection 111-A determined the switching points where the maximum velocity curve is continuous but not differentiable (which corresponds to having one of the a, be zero). Subsection ILI-B covered the case where the maximum velocity curve is discontinuous. This subsection completes the analysis, by deriving a simple procedure to find the switching points where the maximum velocity curve is both continuous and differentiable.</p><p>The smoothness of the maximum velocity curve at the switching point implies that . Y is continuous in the vicinity of that point, and thus that the phase-plane trajectory must be locally continuous and differentiable. Therefore, if the trajectory hit the maximum velocity curve other than tangentially, then it would enter the region above the maximum velocity curve (Fig. <ref type="figure">4(a)</ref>). Hence, the trajectory must meet the maximum velocity curve tangentially (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(a)</ref>). At any time, at least one of the actuators must be saturated [l], [2], and at the switching point there must exist another actuator which is also saturated. Specifically, assume that deceleration continues just before and after the switching point, with the kth actuator saturated,  thus 7m must itself be continuous and differentiable. Therefore, if its torque trajectory hit the corresponding bound other than tangentially, then 7m would have to violate its constraint (Fig. <ref type="figure">4(b)</ref>). Hence the torque rm must meet its constraint bound tangentially (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(b)</ref>).</p><p>Based on this analysis, a necessary condition for the point (s*, S*) in the phase plane to be a tangent point can be derived as follows.</p><p>Since rm must meet the actuator constraint tangentially Therefore, for each value of s, we can solve (28) for S* (recalling that by definition S 2 0), and then check for the value (s*, S*) whether</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">T m = rm (ifam &gt; 01 or rm = ,gin (if am &lt; 0)</formula><p>while the other actuator torques remain within their admissible bounds. If this is the case, then (s*, S*) is a possible tangent point.</p><p>Note that in (29) the derivative terms d / d s need not be computed explicitly, but rather can be approximated with appropriate accuracy using, e.g., a central differentiation method, since the actuator torque is assumed to be a smooth function of s and S in the vicinity of the tangent point. Also, since, by definition, k and m cannot be equal, there are only n(n -1)/2 possible combinations of joints for (28).</p><p>These combinations can be computed in a parallel and independent fashion, so that the computation time may only increase modestly with the number of links.</p></div>

The procedure is described graphically in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. The maximum velocity curve is also shown, in order to help understand how the new algorithm differs from the earlier methods. Note that the shaded region in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> is inadmissible. This means that once the phase-plane trajectory gets into the shaded region, then later in the trajectory it cannot get out of the region without hitting the maximum velocity curve other than tangentially (in other words, without violating at least one of the actuator bounds). Therefore, the admissible region is under these limit curves, and not merely under the maximum velocity curve used in the earlier methods.</p><p>3) The characteristic switching points (points c and e in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>) have been found in steps 1) and 2 ) . In step 3), we get the rest ofthe switching points as follows (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). If the final point is between 0 and sf,, then there is only one switching point between U and b , which IS the point where the deceleration trajectory, integrated backward in time from the final point, meets the acceleration trajectory, integrated forward in time from the starting point. If the final point is between s , and s f 2 , then there are three switching points, namely, 6, C, and some point between c and d , where the deceleration trajectory from the final point hits. Similarly, if the final point is between s f z and s f 3 , then there are five switching points, namely, 6, c, d , e, and some point between e and f. By repeating the above reasoning, all switching points can be obtained. Note that this implies that the number of switching points must be odd.</p><p>4) If the condition for a tangent point is satisfied over a some finite interval, then the phase-plane trajectory coincides with the maximum velocity curve aIong a finite arc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV . NUMERICAL EXAMPLE</head><p>The efficiency of the new algorithm is demonstrated on a hypothetical planar two-link manipulator. Each link has unit mass and unit length, and the actuator torques 71 and r2 are limited in absolute value to 30 and 10 N . m. The parametrized equations for these two paths are x = s + 0.5 y = 4(s -0 3 3 . The result of the algorithm is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>(a) is the limit curve which is obtained by the above method. The maximum velocity curve from the earlier method is also drawn with the limit curve in Fig. <ref type="figure">7(b)</ref>, in order to show the consistency between the two methods. Fig. <ref type="figure">7(c</ref>) represents the complete time-optimal phase plane trajectory. If smax is between 0 and 0.737, then there is a single switching point. If smax is between 0.737 and 0.944, then there are three switching points. If smax is between 0.944 and 1, then there are five switching points. Fig. <ref type="figure">7(d)</ref> gives the corresponding actuator histories.</p><p>This algorithm owes it efficiency to the fact that it does not need to compute the maximum velocity curve, and that all the characteristic switching points can be obtained by searching just once over the value of s using a simple method, while earlier approaches need systematic searches to find a switching point with the help of the maximum velocity curve, and should repeat them as long as there are more switching points ahead. An exact efficiency comparison between the earlier methods and this new algorithm is difficult, since, for instance, the step sizes in s and S which are used to get the maxi-mum velocity curve largely affect the computation time of Bobrow's algorithm, as do other implementation choices in all methods (such as dichotomic searches in Bobrow's algorithm). In the implementation of the above numerical examples, however, we found that for this simple two-link manipulator case, our new algorithm is more efficient than Bobrow's method roughly by a factor of 50 or more. Furthermore, we expect the relative efficiency of our algorithm to increase with the number of links, since the algorithm does not require iterative searches.</p><p>V. CONCLUDING REMARKS In this communication, an improved solution concept to address the time-optimal path-following problem for robot manipulators is presented and a new efficient trajectory planning algorithm is proposed. Characteristic switching points are defined and are exhaustively classified into three types. A simple method is developed to find such points. Limiting curves are introduced according to the characteristic switching points, and they set a new admissible region for the phase-plane trajectory, which differs from the admissible region defined by the maximum velocity curve of the existing methods. Numerical examples show the consistency of the new method with the existing methods, while demonstrating significant improvements in computational efficiency.</p><p>Solutions of more complex time-optimal problems, such as finding a minimum-time path for given end states or taking obstacles into account, and issues of robustness to model uncertainty, are important further research topics to be addressed. The analytic tools presented here are likely to contribute to research on those complex problems as well. <ref type="bibr">Sahar and Hollerbach [IO]</ref> simplify the global time-optimal path search by using dynamic time scaling and joint tesselation, but their approach is still very intensive computationally. Other global time-optimal studies such as Dubowsky, Norris, and Shiller [3], Shiller [12], and <ref type="bibr">Rajan [9]</ref> use the prescribed path algorithm as a major component. Besides greatly simplifying the prescribed path algorithm itself, the necessary conditions determining the characteristic switching points, developed in Section 111, must be satisfied for any globally time-optimal path as well. Thus they may allow us to analytically investigate the behavior of the characteristic switching points as the path changes, and therefore provide stronger tools to address the global time-optimal problem.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
