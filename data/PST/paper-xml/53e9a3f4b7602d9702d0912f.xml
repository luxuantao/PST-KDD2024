<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We conducted a quantitative meta-analysis of previous research on the technology acceptance model (TAM) in an attempt to make well-grounded statements on the role of subjective norm. Furthermore, we compared TAM results by taking into account moderating effects of one individual-related factor (type of respondents), one technology-related factor (type of technology), and one contingent factor (culture). Results indicated a significant influence of subjective norm on perceived usefulness and behavioral intention to use. Moderating effects were found for all three factors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>While IT can yield many benefits, companies have often had problems when introducing IS into their business processes. According to the Standish Group <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[81]</ref>, 74% of IS and software engineering projects were delayed, over budget, and failed to meet functional expectations. Researchers and organizations have therefore been trying to find factors that influence an individual's acceptance of IT, thereby ultimately enhancing its usage. In this area, TAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[19]</ref> is one of the better known models for explaining intention to use a technology. It assumes that the perceived usefulness (PU) and the perceived ease of use (PEOU) are central in influencing a person's attitude and behavioral intention towards using it.</p><p>Many studies have replicated, extended, and used TAM but there are some aspects which remain unclear. First, the subjective norm has had a mixed and inconclusive role; it has been defined as ''a person's perception that most people who are important to him think he should or should not perform the behavior in question'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref>. Some studies found considerable impacts of it on the dependent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">71]</ref>. However, others did not find significant effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">72]</ref>. Second, few conclusions have been drawn on the different settings used in testing the model. TAM has been tested with students as subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">85]</ref> and with non-students <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">20]</ref>. It has been applied to microcomputer technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">53]</ref> and other technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">91]</ref>. And it has been used in Western cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">63]</ref> and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">87]</ref>.</p><p>The aim of our study was to examine the convergence or divergence of TAM relationships across different settings to make better claims on and give an objective picture of results of research using TAM in recent years. Since the field has been dominated by quantitative research approaches, we conducted a metaanalysis on the literature, integrating a large volume of results to determine whether research findings were homogeneous. We thus added to two previous metastudies. Ma and Liu <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[58]</ref> also provided a quantitative meta-analysis, but only focused on three relationships: (1) perceived usefulness ! perceived ease of use, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> perceived usefulness ! technology acceptance (use), and (3) perceived ease of use ! technology acceptance (use). Legris et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[49]</ref> performed a qualitative metaanalysis and concluded that TAM was a useful model, but had to include human and social change process variables (e.g. the subjective norm). In addressing their limitations, we included the subjective norm in our analysis and additionally considered the impact of three types of settings as moderating variables. We also used structural equation modeling to assess overall model fit and identified additional paths to improve the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Research questions</head><p>TAM was inspired by the theory of reasoned action (TRA) of Fishbein and Ajzen, which asserted that both the attitude towards an action and subjective norm have an impact on behavioral intention, which in turn affects how people perform the action. An attitude can be defined as the degree to which a person has a favorable or unfavorable evaluation or appraisal of the behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>TAM was an early attempt to apply psychological factors to IS and computer adoption. It assumed that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were major influences of an individual's attitude towards using the technology and thus ultimately relating to actual use. The original TAM did not include subjective norm, however. Nevertheless, social psychologists know that the social context of an individual can change his or her perception of unchanging physical objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[73]</ref>.</p><p>Being aware of its potential importance, Venkatesh and Davis <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[92]</ref> hypothesized that subjective norm influenced both perceived usefulness and intention to use in TAM2. Indeed, people often choose to perform an action when one or more important referents say they should, though they do not like or believe in it. This compliance effect occurred in mandatory and some voluntary situations. Subjective norm also influences technology acceptance through perceived usefulness, the internalization effect. This represents the human tendency to interpret information from important others as evidence about reality.</p><p>While the hypothesized subjective norm relationships have been found to be significant in TAM2 studies, other studies have followed TAM guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">98]</ref>. Still other studies included subjective norm, but found it had no significant effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">50]</ref>. Our first research question was therefore:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RQ1. What is the overall influence of subjective norm in TAM-based research?</head><p>To make more robust claims on the overall role of subjective norm, we also had to study whether sample characteristics had a moderating influence. Furthermore, there is in general a lack of studies investigating the effect of research settings on TAM relationships. We decided to consider the effect of one individual-related factor (the type of respondents), one technology-related factor (the type of technology investigated), and one contingent factor (the country in which the data were collected). Studies were classified into different categories according to their conceptual and methodological characteristics and differences in effect sizes of relationships between the categories were examined. The three moderator variables were the only sample characteristics consistently reported in all studies, thus a categorization could be made. Other interesting moderation variables (age, experience, personal innovativeness, or computer self-efficacy), posed practical problems since many studies ignored them.</p><p>As a first factor, studies were categorized as using students or not as respondents. A debate exists about the use of student samples in empirical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">77]</ref>. Recently, Peterson <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[69]</ref> performed a second-order metaanalysis to make more definate claims on the influence of using student samples. He found that the use of students lead to different effect sizes, both in direction and magnitude. No clear pattern could be found, however. We therefore formulated the second research question as: RQ2. What is the influence of using a student sample on the effect sizes of relationships in TAM?</p><p>TAM studies have been made in a many technology fields. Electronic and voice mail <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, transactional web sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, electronic supermarkets <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[31]</ref>, groupware <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[56]</ref>, and electronic payment systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[70]</ref>. There is however no clear overview of how effect sizes differ with different technologies. For instance, it seems likely that perceived ease of use will play a more important role in new and complex technologies. We therefore formulated a third question: RQ3. What is the influence of the type of technology on the effect sizes of relationships in TAM?</p><p>TAM has also been applied in many different countries. Saudi Arabia <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, Nigeria <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, The Netherlands <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[27]</ref>, Australia <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[30]</ref>, The United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[67]</ref>, Korea <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[84]</ref>, China <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[90]</ref>, etc. It was however shown that TAM did not fit equally well across cultures. In a threecountry empirical study, Straub et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[82]</ref> showed that effects of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were not significant in Japanese e-mail usage. Mao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[61]</ref> found that perceived ease of use was more important in Turkey than in the United States when considering mobile phone service adoption. Therefore, we formulated: RQ4. What is the influence of culture on the effect sizes of relationships in TAM?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research methodology</head><p>We examined the convergence or divergence of published research results by conducting a quantitative meta-analysis. This integrated the different results of many studies by investigating the intercorrelations of different pairs of variables. For every pair, this yielded an overall effect across studies. In constructing the general effect size, we considered articles published from the publication of TAM in 1989. We searched in all available academic computer databases: ABI/INFORM, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science. Furthermore, Google Scholar, and library catalogues were consulted.</p><p>The articles selected had to meet several criteria: TAM had to have been assessed in an empirical study. Integrity of the TAM concept had to have been respected: relationships not justifiable by TAM reasoning were absent. The research methodology had to be well described, allowing us to collect information for moderator analysis purposes.</p><p>A cross-sectional correlation matrix of the used TAM constructs had to have been included as we needed these matrices for our analysis.</p><p>Consequently, many studies were excluded from our meta-analysis. One bonus was that this set of criteria addressed the file-drawer problem, since journals are likely to publish research results that are statistically significant and thus have effect sizes larger than those that have not and could inflate results <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[76]</ref>. No duplication of the articles from the same study in different outlets were included in our sample.</p><p>We tested whether the systematic variance in the overall effects could be explained by the research setting of the studies (addressing RQ2, RQ3, and RQ4) by performing a moderator analysis, taking into account conceptual and methodological characteristics of the data sets. We collected information on the respondents, the technology under consideration, and the culture in which the study was conducted. After this, we categorized the studies as falling into the category ''students'' or ''non-students''. Decisions also had to be made how to classify the technologies used in the different studies. Theoretically, four categories could be defined: specific software applications (word processors, data-base programs, etc), Internet related technology (search engines, transactional web sites, etc.), microcomputers, and communications technology (e-mail, mobile technology, etc.). Unfortunately, comparing these four groups separately was not possible due to a lack of data. We decided to compare the studies concerning microcomputer use with those dealing with other use <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[97]</ref>. As a contingent, moderating factor, culture was considered by making a split between Western (using subjects from Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand) and other studies from the rest of the world. After categorizing all studies, we determined how overall effects differed between studies by means of a series of Fisher Z-test.</p><p>Finally, we used structural equation modeling with attitude for the original TAM, since we tried to include all correlation pairs possible with the selected studies. Subjective norm was included for TAM2 because it was expected to influence perceived usefulness and behavioral intention to use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Descriptive statistics</head><p>A total of 51 useable articles were found, containing altogether 63 studies; of these, 7 were unpublished dissertations or conference proceedings (all articles are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). If an article contained multiple studies, it fills more than one line in the table. The table also indicates the categories of each article used in the moderation analysis.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[39]</ref> Personal computing in small firms Microcomputer 358 employees in small firms Non-students New Zealand Western Koufaris <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[43]</ref> Web based store to buy books Non-microcomputer 280 consumers Non-students USA Western Lau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[45]</ref> Online trading Non-microcomputer 178 investors Non-students Hong Kong Non-western Liaw and Huang <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[51]</ref> Search engines on the Internet Non-microcomputer 114 students of a medical college Students Taiwan Non-western Lim <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[52]</ref> Computer We note that since one article can include multiple studies, statistically interdependent effect estimations may arise, causing a bias in our analysis. For instance, Dabholkar <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[18]</ref> investigated the use of a self-service option at a fast food restaurant. Using a scenario-based approach, three groups were given different descriptions of the waiting time before being served. These scenario's were treated as three different studies in our sample but do not strictly satisfy criteria for independence of observations. However, aggregating the different effect sizes into one average effect per article would lead to information loss and hence a less accurate picture of the value of the correlation. Since articles with multiple studies are limited in our sample, we consider this disadvantage less severe than that of potential information loss. We therefore treat these studies separately and did not aggregate them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Correlation analysis</head><p>All possible relationships between the six constructs in our conceptual model were included in our correlation analyses (yielding a total of 15 pairwise correlations). As can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>, all these had been considered at least seven times in different studies. The relationship between perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use was the most often studied in our sample (53 instances).</p><p>From the range of correlation coefficients, it seemed that the strength of each relationship varied greatly: the correlation between perceived ease of use and attitude towards use varied from 0.05 to 0.73. Most findings were significant however ( p 0.05). The two relationships most often falsified were those between subjective norm $ perceived ease of use and subjective norm $ attitude towards use (66.67% significant). Given that these relationships were not part of the traditional TAM, this is not surprising. Also, sample sizes of the studies were relatively different: from 35 to 1370.</p><p>We followed the guidelines of Hunter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[35]</ref> in making statements on the overall significance of each pairwise relationship. First, the sample size adjusted mean was calculated (the size-weighted average of individual correlations) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">r þ ¼ P N i r i P N i (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>where N is the total number of participants in each study and r i is the observed correlation in specific study i.</p><p>Then this mean was corrected for attenuation, since the effect of measurement error could attenuate the correla- Non-western tion coefficient; i.e. the error of measurement systematically lowers the correlation between variables. The classic formula for attenuation correction is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">r þc ¼ r þ ffiffiffiffiffiffi r xx p ffiffiffiffiffiffi r yy p<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where r + is the sample size adjusted correlation mean, r xx the measurement reliability of variable x, and r yy is the measurement reliability of variable y. In most studies coefficient alpha is used as an estimator for r xx and r yy , a practice also applied in our study.</p><p>The statistical significance of the correlations was deduced by computing 95% confidence intervals for each mean estimate. These gave an indication of the effect range in the true population, taking into account errors and variation in the calculation of sample effects. Results are displayed in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. The fact that there are no intervals containing zero suggests that all 15 correlations were significant. However, because the preliminary screening of the significance levels showed that the two relationships involving subjective norm were potentially problematic, we decided to test the significance of our findings further. Therefore, the fail- safe N statistic (or availability bias) was calculated for every correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">54]</ref> to provide the number of nonsignificant correlations (studies) that would have to be included in the sample to reverse the conclusion that a significant relationship existed. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> shows that the pairwise relationships subjective norm $ perceived ease of use, subjective norm $ attitude towards use, subjective norm $ actual use, and attitude towards use $ actual use, do not pass the test, since the fail-safe N was negative. All other pairwise relationships passed the test and were therefore concluded to be generally significant across studies. As perceived usefulness correlated with all other variables and perceived ease of use was only non-significantly correlated with subjective norm, this confirmed the fact that these variables play a key role in determining technology adoption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Moderator analysis</head><p>In order to investigate the existence of moderators, homogeneity estimates (Q) for each relationship were calculated according to the Hedges and Olkin <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[29]</ref> procedure. This gives an indication of possible moderator effects. The Q value, which is based on Fisher-Z scores, is compared to a critical value, which is the x 2 for a = 0.05 and k À 1 degrees of freedom (k being the number of studies). If the Q value exceeds the critical value, the biggest outlier is removed from the set of study effects and both values are recalculated. This action is repeated until the Q value is smaller than the critical value. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> shows the number of studies to be dropped for each construct pair to achieve homogeneity. Given the large numbers of studies to be dropped in order to reach homogeneity for most constructs pairs, the hypothesis of homogeneity of study effects was rejected. Nonhomogeneity of study effects suggested the presence of moderator variables.</p><p>In order to examine potential moderator variables, clusters of studies were formed based on the material in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. We distinguished between students (k = 28, n = 5224) and non-students (k = 35, n = 8896). A Fisher Z-test was conducted to investigate the significance of the difference between the correlations of the two groups (a = 0.05). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> shows that the sample population was a significant moderator for all but three construct pairs (significant Z-values are shown bold). In all cases in which significant moderation effects occurred, correlations were higher for students than non-students.</p><p>As a second moderating effect, we labeled studies as dealing with microcomputer (k = 14, n = 3323) or nonmicrocomputer use (k = 49, n = 10705). Following the same procedure, when the Z-value shows significance, correlations are lower in the microcomputer setting. One exception to the observation was the relationship between behavioral intention and actual use. This difference (0.81 $ 0.47) was largely explained by the fact that calculations were made on attenuationcorrected correlations. The high 0.81 figure was caused by some relatively low coefficient alphas (around 0.60) of the involved constructs. Osburn <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[66]</ref> stated that alpha can seriously underestimate reliability of a measure and can therefore, when used in corrections for attenuation, result in nontrivial overestimation of the corrected correlations. It was however not possible to remove the studies with the low coefficient alpha from our study as this would lead to a lack of data. The moderation of the behavioral intention to actual use relationship should therefore be interpreted with care. As a final moderation test, the total sample was split in Western (k = 46, n = 8778) and non-Western studies (k = 17, n = 5342). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> shows culture to be a significant moderating variable in about half of the cases, but it is hard to recognize an overall pattern. Subjective norm had a larger impact on behavioral intention in Western studies than non-Western, but when relating subjective norm to actual use, the conclusion reversed. However the latter relationship had not passed the fail-safe N test and was therefore non-significant. Furthermore, it seemed that perceived usefulness was key in Western cultures, while perceived ease of use was more important in non-Western studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Structural equation modeling</head><p>To assess the correlations as a network of interconnected variables and then interpret the fit of the model to the data, we applied structural equation modeling. This tool can be applied in a meta-analytical procedure to estimate structural coefficients on the basis of the correlation matrix obtained from an aggregation of the individual studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[95]</ref>. The core of our model was formed by the classic TAM. Subjective norm was implemented in our model through TAM2, i.e. we expected subjective norm to influence perceived usefulness via the internalization mechanism, and intention to use via the compliance mechanism. Our conceptual model is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>We used the correlation matrix as input for LISREL 8.72 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[41]</ref> and corrected the correlation matrix for attenuation by the James et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[40]</ref> procedure, who suggested setting the relationship between latent variable and (single) indicator to the square root of the reliability coefficient and setting the error term of the indicator to one minus the reliability coefficient.</p><p>Our sample size was 1250, which was the minimum sample size for the pairwise relationship of subjective norm and attitude towards behavior. On the basis of the hypothesized model, we found the fair fit of the model to the data: x 2 (6) = 133.9, p &lt; 0.01; TLI = 0.90; CFI = 0.96; SRMR = 0.056. Taking Hu and Bentler <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[34]</ref> guidelines into consideration, the TLI falls short of the recommended cut-off value of 0.95. This leads us to consider Lagrangian multiplier tests (modification indices). These suggested the inclusion of two relationships: (1) perceived ease of use ! behavioral intention and (2) subjective norm ! attitude towards use. Since these relationships had a sound theoretical basis, they may be added to the model. For the first, Davis et al. had already noted that perceived ease of use had a direct effect on behavioral intention (for time period 1). This questioned the mediating role of attitude, which was therefore usually not considered in later replications of the model. The second relationship was also hypothe-  <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[42]</ref>. When a person perceives that important referents think he or she should use the system, he or she assumes the referent's beliefs, generating a sense of belonging on the part of the user. Although articulated, this proposition was not tested in the original TAM study. Malhotra and Galletta <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[60]</ref> did test it and found that it had a significant effect.</p><p>Given these results, we included both relationships in our conceptual model. Consequently, the model fit significantly improved: x 2 (4) = 42.07, p &lt; 0.01; TLI = 0.95; CFI = 0.99; SRMR = 0.036. All fit measures now adhered to commonly accepted guidelines. R 2 values were 0.47 for attitude towards use, 0.48 for behavioral intention to use, and 0.30 for actual system use. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> displays the final model, including path coefficients derived from our SEM analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Points of attention for meta-analysis</head><p>Regarding these findings, a couple of points deserve attention. First, meta-analysis results are constrained by methods used in the primary empirical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Many studies reported findings on TAM using multivariate analyses and meta-analysts have not yet developed effect size statistics that adequately represent such research findings. Second, as apparent in the relationship between behavioral intention and actual use, low coefficient alphas can result in nontrivial overestimation of the corrected correlations. The availability of more data would, of course, cancel out large attenuation-effects. Finally, TAM constructs are often measured with scales adopted from Davis et al., Taylor and Todd <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[86]</ref> or Fishbein and Ajzen. In some cases however, researchers use other scales, sometimes even created for that particular study. Using different scales can, of course, lead to dramatically different results. Unfortunately, a moderation test differentiating on used scales could not be performed in this study, because the number of studies not using traditional scales was too small.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>The purpose of our effort was to examine the convergence or divergence of research results of many researchers testing and extending TAM, taking into account subjective norm and the influence of different research settings on the produced results.</p><p>The original TAM relationships were confirmed. Both correlation analysis and SEM showed the significance of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use towards attitude and behavioral intention to use. Evidence existed for a stronger dependence of an individual on utility than on lower complexity when adopting new technologies. Both correlations and path coefficients are higher for relationships with perceived usefulness than those with perceived ease of use. TAM literature has investigated this issue. Venkatesh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[94]</ref> did not find any direct post-implementation effects of perceived ease of use, only in pre-implementation. This indicates that as users gain experience with a new system, ease of use is overshadowed by other factors.</p><p>Large effect sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[16]</ref> were found for the correlations between subjective norm and behavioral intention (r +c = 0.42), and between subjective norm and perceived usefulness (r +c = 0.40); they also passed the failsafe N test. In the structural model, these relationships had coefficients of 0.16 and 0.31, respectively. The smaller effect size for the compliance effect can probably be explained by the fact that this mechanism is only effective in mandatory use settings. Since our dataset contained multiple instances of voluntary technology adoption, the internalization effect was likely to be stronger. Interestingly, although not passing the fail-safe N test, subjective norm displayed a significant effect on attitude towards use (0.08) in the SEM analysis. This identification mechanism was discovered by inspecting the modification indices.</p><p>Results indicate that using a student sample seriously affected the relationships. In all but three construct pairs, students displayed a moderating effect, such that the relationships were stronger for students than nonstudents. We showed a clear pattern of student-based studies displaying stronger effect sizes: arguments from previous research fit in this context. Students are a more homogeneous group than non-students and students have a stronger tendency to comply with authority <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[78]</ref>. Thus assuming a relatively high amount of early adopters <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[75]</ref>, larger effect sizes of both social and technology-related constructs make sense.</p><p>The technology under consideration was found to have a significant moderating effect on the pairwise relationships with correlations being lower in a microcomputer than a non-microcomputer setting. This aligns with findings by Gefen <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[25]</ref> that for technologies which are familiar, habit explains up to 40% of the variance in intention to use, while other factors are less influential. In these cases, repeated previous behavior dictates current behavior independently of rational assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[89]</ref>.</p><p>Comparison of Western versus non-Western studies, 7 of the 15 pairwise relationships were affected. Subjective norm had a larger impact on behavioral intention in Western studies. Taking Hofstede's <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[32]</ref> cultural dimensions into account, this is an interesting result. In a collectivistic (non-Western) culture one would expect others' opinions to have more impact on the individual because of face saving and group conformity, also a higher power distance would invoke a more influential role for peers. Several studies did find a stronger influence of subjective norm on the intention to perform a focal behavior in non-Western cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">46]</ref>. Furthermore, perceived usefulness seemed important in Western cultures, while perceived ease of use had more relevance in non-Western studies. This added to previous findings. <ref type="bibr">Straub et al. and McCoy et al. [62]</ref> concluded that TAM did not fit non-Western cultural attitudes, while Mao et al. also concluded that perceived usefulness was less and perceived ease of use more important in non-Western cultures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Managerial implications</head><p>For managers introducing a technology in their company, efforts should not only be aimed at improving system acceptance at the individual employee level. Given the importance of subjective norm, the department and company as a whole should take a positive position towards system acceptance. Organization wide support is therefore advised, probably with a large training program and a permanent help desk with a favorable organizational climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. When considering technology adoption in a consumer market the subjective norm construct is created by word-of-mouth. Managers should realize that a positive or negative 'buzz' can make or break a product in such a situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">48]</ref>.</p><p>The identified moderation effects yielded valuable implications. Since results showed stronger effects for students, managers need different implementation strategies when aiming at a younger target group. Since they are more technology-ready and sensitive to trends, younger people are more easily influenced by technology characteristics and peer opinions than non-students or older users. Managers should also be aware that as computer usage is so common today, utility, usability, and social aspects are now less important in shaping attitude, intentions and behavior.</p><p>Finally, managers should be aware that the technology adoption process differs per culture. In Western cultures, perceived usefulness seems to be more important in determining intentions and actual use, while ease of use is key in non-Western cultures. Communication regarding the introduction of the technology, like training manuals, advertising campaigns, face-to-face contact, should therefore carry different messages dependent on the culture in which the technology is to be used.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
