<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) are marine vessels capable of performing various marine operations without a crew in a variety of cluttered and hostile water/ocean environments. For complex missions, there are increasing needs for deploying a fleet of ASVs instead of a single one to complete difficult tasks. Cooperative operations with a fleet of ASVs offer great advantages with enhanced capability and efficacy. Despite various application potentials, coordinated motion control of ASVs pose great challenges due to the multiplicity of ASVs, complexity of intra-vehicle interactions and fleet formation with collision avoidance requirements, and scarcity of communication bandwidths in sea environments. Coordinated control of multiple ASVs has received considerable attention in the last decade. This paper provides an overview of recent advances in coordinated control of multiple ASVs. First, some challenging issues and scenarios in motion control of ASVs are presented. Next, coordinated control architecture and methods of multiple ASVs are briefly discussed. Then, recent results on trajectory-guided, path-guided, and target-guided coordinated control of multiple ASVs are reviewed in detail. Finally, several theoretical and technical issues are suggested to direct future investigations including networkbased coordination, event-triggered coordination, collision-free coordination, optimization-based coordination, data-driven coordination of ASVs, and task-region-oriented coordination of multiple ASVs and autonomous underwater vehicles.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The 21st century is the century of ocean. More than 70% of earth surface is covered by oceans, and ocean space contains a vast chamber of natural resources including oil and gas, biological species, mineral products, and so on. The ocean becomes a strategic space and resource base for the survival of human beings and sustainable development of society. In order to explore and utilize these resources, there is a surge of interest in the development and deployment of autonomous surface and underwater vehicles to uncover, explore, study, and protect the oceans <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) are characterized by low cost, high mobility, and high degree of autonomy and intelligence. They provide unique capabilities for performing various missions in complex sea environments without risking human lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[4]</ref>. They can be deployed in numerous applications in either military or civil missions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[5]</ref>. In military applications, ASVs are demonstrated to play a prominent role in many missions such as intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and situation awareness of offshore areas. In their civil roles, ASVs can be deployed for a variety of marine applications including search and rescue, marine survey, environmental monitoring, hydrologic monitoring, maritime security, and offshore installation protection <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[6]</ref>. In general, the use of ASVs facilitates to reduce personnel cost, improve safety, and expand operational weather windows to work in poor conditions.</p><p>Motion control is a fundamental issue in ASV research and development. Typical motion control scenario includes dynamic positioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[8]</ref>, trajectory tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[9]</ref>, path following <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[10]</ref>, target tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[11]</ref>, and target enclosing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[12]</ref>. The results on motion control of a single ASV is rich. Inspired by formation behaviors in nature, such as flocking of birds, schooling of fish, and swarming of ants, there is a widespread interest in coordinated control of multiple ASVs for achieving a desired formation pattern in a collaborative manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[15]</ref>. Employing a fleet of ASVs rather than a single one offers several advantages, including increased efficacy, performance, scalability, robustness, and emergence of new capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. Applications of multiple ASVs cover a wide area of marine missions such as cooperative exploration and exploitation, coordinated search and rescue, and sensor network <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[18]</ref>. To perform such complex missions, sophisticated guidance and control methods are essential in coordinating the maneuvers of multiple ASVs. Coordinated motion control systems with multiple ASVs should be developed to perform planned operations, accommodate model uncertainties, reject environmental disturbances, meet communication constraints, avoid collision with their team members and various static or dynamic obstacles, adhere to maritime traffic rules such as 1551-3203 (c) 2020 IEEE.

It poses great challenges in the coordinated control of multiple ASVs from both theoretic and practical points of view. As a consequence, coordinated control of multiple ASVs has become an active research area in recent years and many results are available in the literature. Nevertheless, there is no systematic literature review on coordinated control of multiple ASVs, which motivates the current survey.</p><p>In this paper, an overview of recent progress in the coordinated control of multiple ASVs is presented. First, several challenging issues and scenarios in motion control of ASVs are given. Next, coordinated control architecture and methods of multiple ASVs are then summarized. Then, recent stateof-the art results in trajectory-guided, path-guided, and targetguided coordinated control of multiple ASVs are reviewed. Finally, several theoretical and technical issues for further investigations are discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. CHALLENGING ISSUES AND SCENARIOS IN MOTION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONTROL</head><p>In this section, a mathematical model of ASVs is first introduced. Then challenging issues in motion control of ASVs are briefly addressed. Motion control scenarios of a single ASV are also provided because they are closely related to coordinated control of multiple ASVs to be discussed later. In general, a marine vessel has six motional degrees of freedom; i.e., three translational motions: surge, sway, heave, and three rotational motions: roll, pitch, yaw. For a surface vehicle moving on a water surface, the motions in roll, pitch, and heave are usually neglected, and a horizontal plane model in surge, sway and yaw is commonly used. The downside is that the stability of roll, pith and heave dynamics cannot be addressed in conjunction with the motion stabilization in the horizontal plane. As a result, the uncontrolled roll, pith and heave dynamics may have an adverse effect on the horizontal motion. Two reference frames, a BODY reference frame {B} and an NED reference frame {E}, are often used to describe the position and velocity information in the horizontal plane. Consider a fleet of N ASVs. For the ith ASV, let η i = [x i , y i , ψ i ] T ∈ R 3 be the position and orientation expressed in {E}. ν i = [u i , v i , r i ] T ∈ R 3 are linear and angular velocities expressed in {B}. Usually, the motion of ASVs can be described by using a nonlinear model of three degrees of freedom with kinematics and kinetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[20]</ref> </p></div>

If GNSS is denied, local sensors can be used and a local fleet frame may be required.</p><p>For motion control law design, it is necessary to consider the ASV actuation property, which involves the type, amount, and distribution of propellers, thrusters, and control surfaces. Two types of actuation architectures are often encountered: fullyactuated and under-actuated. For an under-actuated vehicle, the rank of the control component of the kinetic motion model is less than its degrees of freedom <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[20]</ref>. If the sway direction is not actuated, the propulsion force and moment vector is expressed as τ i = [τ iu , 0, τ ir ] T , which means that the ASV in consideration is under-actuated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Challenging issues in motion control</head><p>ASV motion control research aims at the development of guidance and control laws to track or follow pre-defined trajectories or paths while meeting the desired spatial and temporal requirements. It is assumed that the path or trajectory is planned in advance. For global and local path planning methods, the reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[4]</ref>. ASV motion control faces several challenging issues including nonlinearity, uncertainty, under-actuation, constrained or unmeasured states,  <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[20]</ref>. The motion control of marine vehicles subject to model uncertainties, unmodelled dynamics, and external disturbances is a long-lasting research topic. Existing methods range from adaptive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[26]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[28]</ref>, sliding model control <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[30]</ref>, robust control <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[26]</ref>, neural network control <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[31]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[33]</ref>, fuzzy control <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[34]</ref>, disturbance-observer-based control <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[35]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[37]</ref>, to extended-state-observer-based control <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[39]</ref>. Their combined use may help to improve the system performance at cost of implementation complexity. In addition, backstepping <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[32]</ref>, dynamic surface control <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[41]</ref>, tracking differentiators <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[43]</ref>, and neurodynamics-based command governors <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[24]</ref> are employed to synthesize the kinetic control laws.</p><p>It is clear that guaranteeing the stability and robustness of motion control laws in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances is still a central focus of current investigations. • Under-actuation. Many ASVs are equipped with either two independent thrusters or one main thruster and one rudder. They are a class of under-actuated systems. Brockett theorem shows that there is no time-invariant, smooth, state feedback control law for asymptotically stabilizing an under-actuated vehicle at a fixed point <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[9]</ref>. In the literature, substantial effort has been made to address the motion control of under-actuated marine vehicles. The auxiliary variable method <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[45]</ref> and transverse function approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[46]</ref> are notable ones. Especially, various coordinate transformations are used to stabilize under-actuated surface vehicles such as polar coordinate transformation <ref type="bibr">[47]</ref>, Serret-Frenet frame trans-formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[48]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[52]</ref>, body-fixed coordination transformation, and transverse function transformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[46]</ref>. The transverse function method may cause high oscillations in control inputs and tracking errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[35]</ref>, which should be avoided in practical implementations. In the auxiliary variable method <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[45]</ref>, a trade-off should be made between the reduction of the position error and the limitation of the control inputs. It is worthwhile mentioning that many motion control schemes proposed for fully-actuated surface vehicles may not be directly extended to under-actuated vehicles. In-depth investigations on coordinated control of under-actuated ASVs are deemed to be necessary. • Constrained variables. Physical constraints are ubiquitous in ASV motion control. For example, ASVs are subject to the limits on their yaw rate and surge speed.</p><p>In addition, thrusters and rudders may suffer from saturation. Guidance and control signals that violate system constraints may degrade system performance, and it may result in instability in the worst case. Therefore, it is of critical importance to handle the constraints existing in motion control. Three kinds of constraints are usually considered: input constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[53]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[55]</ref>, state constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[54]</ref>, and output constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[56]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[58]</ref>. Prevailing methods for handling constraints include model predictive control (MPC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[53]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[59]</ref>, command governors <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[43]</ref>, barrier functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[56]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[57]</ref>, and auxiliary systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[55]</ref>.</p><p>MPC is an effective method for handling input, velocity, and output constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[53]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[59]</ref>. MPC methods rely on the linearization of vehicle dynamics or the accuracy of vehicle model <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[53]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[59]</ref>. The barrier functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[56]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[57]</ref> aim to address output constraints, rather than input constraints. The auxiliary system is introduced to account for input constraints, whereas state constraints cannot be handled. The command governors are add-on schemes which enforce constraint satisfaction on pre-stabilized systems by modifying the command signals. By using optimization-based command governors, an existing or legacy control law can be preserved within state and input constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[24]</ref>. • Unmeasured states. In practical applications, the position information of surface vehicles can be readily obtained by using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) devices, and velocity information may not be readily obtained. The velocity measurements by using doppler velocity log is expensive and not suitable for largescale applications. Accelerometers are able to measure acceleration information rather than velocity information. Therefore, the studies of state observers and their related output feedback control are meaningful <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[60]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[61]</ref>. In order to recover unavailable state information, several observer schemes are proposed to estimate unmeasured states such as wave-filtering observers <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[60]</ref>, high-gain observers <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[32]</ref>, neural-network-based observers <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[62]</ref>, and extended state observers (ESOs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[63]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[64]</ref>. The wave-filtering observers <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[60]</ref> are able to identify low-frequency motions and rely on the passivity property of vehicle kinetics. The high- gain observers <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[32]</ref> can be used to recover the unmeasured velocities whereas the vehicle uncertainty cannot be estimated. The neural observers <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[62]</ref> can be used to estimate uncertainties and velocities simultaneously while the estimation convergence is guaranteed under the condition of persistent of excitation. ESOs are able to estimate the disturbances and uncertainties simultaneously with guaranteed convergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[63]</ref>. As the number of the tuning parameters decrease to one, the parameter tuning process of ESOs could be easier than that of observers <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[62]</ref>. The ESOs <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[63]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[65]</ref> rely on a priori information from vehicle inertia matrix or nominal inertia matrix. This restriction may be resolved by using the recent data-driven approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[66]</ref>. • Scarce communication bandwidth. Information exchange is a basic requirement for the coordinated control of multiple marine vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[18]</ref>. Through communication, the state information of team members can be easily exchanged. Common communication networks include offshore wireless communication, satellite communication, and shore-based mobile communication. Among them, offshore wireless communication is affected by climate and environmental conditions, its reliability is not high, and communication rate is limited. The cost of satellite communication is extremely high and communication bandwidth is also limited. The shore-based mobile communication is a powerful supplement to offshore communication network. It takes the advantages of high rate and low cost, but it is applicable to a small range of offshore area only. In general, communications at sea are characterized by low rate, narrow bandwidth, and high cost. Therefore, coordinated control of multiple ASVs subject to communication constraints becomes a critical problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[5]</ref>. In order to reduce communication burden, distributed control strategies are widely suggested in the published results <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[43]</ref>. • Collision avoidance. When moving on a water surface, an ASV inevitably encounters various static or dynamic obstacles. In addition, collisions among team members should be avoided. Obstacle avoidance capability is an enabling technique not only for the autonomous control of a single ASV, but also for the coordinated control of multiple ASVs. Many collision avoidance methods can be found in the literature and the reader is referred to the survey papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[67]</ref>, and references therein. For collision avoidance with team members, existing methods include prescribed performance technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[68]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[69]</ref> and methods based on artificial potential functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[70]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[71]</ref>. Efficient and effective strategies to avoid collision with ASV team members and static or dynamic obstacles are highly necessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Scenarios in motion control</head><p>Although this paper aims to review recent results on coordinated control of ASVs, motion control scenarios of a single ASV are closely related to coordinated control of multiple ASVs. In terms of control objectives, motion control scenarios of a single ASV are typically classified into dynamic positioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[41]</ref>, trajectory tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[9]</ref>, path following <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[72]</ref>, and target tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[12]</ref>, which are stated as follows: • Dynamic Positioning. The objective of dynamic positioning is to drive a surface vehicle to maintain a specified position and heading subject to persistent influence of time-varying ocean disturbances <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[41]</ref>. Dynamic positioning is called as set-point regulation or point stabilization from a control viewpoint. The literature on dynamic positioning of fully-actuated surface vehicles is rich; see the survey paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[7]</ref> and references therein. In general, dynamic positioning of under-actuated surface vehicles is not straightforward as that of fully-actuated surface vehicles. Besides, dynamic positioning is more difficult than trajectory-tracking and path following for under-actuated surface vehicles. A dynamic positioning scenario of a surface vehicle is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (a). • Trajectory Tracking. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (b), the objective of trajectory tracking is to drive a vehicle to track a pre-defined reference trajectory. The reference trajectory may be generated by a suitable virtual vehicle or a timerelated function <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[23]</ref>. In trajectory tracking, the reference trajectory is known as a priori and deterministic. In addition, the spatial and temporal constraints associated with the reference trajectory are coupled and cannot be separated. The trajectory tracking of under-actuated surface vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[9]</ref> is more difficult than that of fullyactuated ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[73]</ref>. • Path Following. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 (c</ref>), the objective of path-following is to force a surface vehicle to move along a pre-defined path. It involves a spatial constraint, but no restriction is imposed on the temporal propagation along the path. As a result, the spatial and temporal constraints can be controlled separately. As a subset of path following, path maneuvering involves two tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[10]</ref>. The first is a geometric task, which enables a vehicle to follow a feasible desired path under maneuverability constraints. The second is a dynamic task, which specifies a time, speed, or acceleration assignment with a path update law. Since trajectory tracking merges the geometric and dynamic tasks into a single task, the objective of path following is less stringent than that of trajectory tracking. As a special case, if the path update law is designed as a constant or time-related function without involving feedback, path following becomes trajectory tracking. Path following results in a smoother transient behavior and a lower probability of actuator saturation than trajectory tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[52]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[59]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[72]</ref>.</p><p>• Target Tracking. The objective of target tracking is to drive a vehicle to track the position of a moving target with a relative range and orientation. Usually, only the instantaneous motion of the target is known and no information on its future motion of the target is available.</p><p>In this situation, it is impossible to separate the spatial constraint and temporal constraint associated with the target into two separate constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[11]</ref>. In a simplified case where the relative range is desired to be zero, this scenario corresponds to trajectory tracking. If the target does not move, this scenario corresponds to dynamic positioning. Target tracking is widely used to achieve a leader-follower formation; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[74]</ref>. A target tracking scenario is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 (d)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Coordinated control architectures</head><p>A critical factor in the coordinated control of multiple ASVs is communication constraints or sensing abilities imposed by formation mission scenarios. There are three architectures in coordinated control of ASVs: centralized control, decentralized control, and distributed control. According to available communication bandwidths and sensing abilities, a choice should be made among these three control architectures. These control architectures hold some pros and cons, which are stated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Centralized Control Interconnection 𝐾 1 𝑃 1 𝐾 2 𝐾 𝑛 你 𝑃 2 𝑃 𝑛 K 𝑃 1 𝑃 2 𝑃 𝑛 𝑃 1 𝑃 2 𝑃 𝑛 𝐾 1 𝐾 2 𝐾 𝑛 Decentralized Control Distributed Control</formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Centralized, decentralized and distributed control (K : a controller; P : a plant. )</p><p>• Centralized Control. In a centralized control approach, a central command center is available and powerful enough to acquire all ASV information, make decisions, and then control each ASV. The command center may be a remote ground station or a single ASV designated as a global leader. As information should be gathered at a single point for decision making, the objective can be optimized with global optima as opposed to local optima in the decentralized implementation. Besides, conflicting actions can be resolved and avoided among vehicles.</p><p>As the number of ASVs increases, the computing resource and communication bandwidth requirements grow accordingly. If the data bandwidth per vehicle to be communicated is fixed, the communication bandwidth requirement would be O(n), where n is the vehicle number. There always exists a bottleneck of the number of vehicles involved in coordination. It is also vulnerable to a single point of failure. Any loss of the leader or communication capabilities may render the system unstable. A few centralized formation control schemes can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[93]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[94]</ref>.</p><p>• Decentralized Control. A decentralized architecture does not entail a command center, and only partial information measured by local sensors of each vehicle is available. Decentralized control takes the advantages of modularity, scalability and tolerance of individual failure. However, it is only able to achieve local optima. In contrast to distributed control, where information can be exchanged through communication, no information exchange occurs among vehicles. Basically, the decentralized control law design follows the design methodologies proposed for single vehicle systems. The decentralized formation control of ASVs is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[47]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[68]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[91]</ref>.</p><p>• Distributed Control. In distributed control, a local control law is implemented in each subsystem, and there exist information exchanges among the control laws through local sensing or communications. A distributed control system does not require a central station, at the cost of being far more complex than the centralized and decentralized controls in structure and organization. Although centralized, decentralized, and distributed control architectures are practically considered depending on the situations and conditions of missions, distributed control is more promising in the presence of limited computing resources, short communication ranges, narrow communications bandwidths, and large size of vehicles to maneuver and control <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[18]</ref>. Graph theory plays a central role in distributed control law design and analysis for multi-ASV systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[95]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[96]</ref>.

According to various types of reference signals, some existing results can be roughly classified into trajectory-guided, path-guided, and target-guided coordinated controls, as summarized as follows:</p><p>• Trajectory-guided coordinated control (TRCC). The coordination behavior is achieved by driving a fleet of surface vehicles to track single or multiple, time-related, predefined reference trajectories. It can be implemented in a centralized or distributed manner. Distributed trajectory tracking means that some vehicles may not have the information of the reference trajectory, and information exchanges among vehicles are necessary to achieve the desired formation behavior. More specifically, each vehicle needs to obtain information from neighboring vehicles through sensing or communication. As a result, both complex individual vehicle dynamics and limited communication graphs should be taken into account in the distributed trajectory tracking problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[99]</ref>.

The objective is to drive a fleet of surface vehicles to track a series of pre-defined parameterized paths, while holding a desired formation pattern at a desired formation speed. In terms of reference paths, cooperative path following can be divided into two main categories: (i) cooperative path following with known reference path information, and (ii) cooperative path following with partially known path information. In the first category, a path following control law is designed to drive each vehicle to converge to its assigned path. Then, a distributed update law is developed for path variables such that the updating of the path variables is coordinated including synchronization <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[100]</ref>, containment <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[81]</ref> and cyclic pursuit <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[80]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Trajectory-guided coordinated control</head><p>Coordinated control of marine surface vehicles guided by known reference trajectories are reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[46]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[35]</ref>. Based on a nonlinear coordinate transformation, a transverse function approach, a backstepping technique, and smooth ptimes differentiable step functions, formation tracking laws are developed for a group of under-actuated surface vehicles with limited sensing ranges such that collisions among vehicles can be avoided <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[46]</ref>. The transverse function approach may high oscillation in control inputs and tracking errors, an improved synchronization tracking law is presented <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[35]</ref>, where a second-order dynamical system is introduced for generating a global reference signal.

Without using a centralized generator, distributed trajectory tracking with surface vehicles is widely investigated; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[39]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[41]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[79]</ref>, where the number of reference trajectories is less than that of vehicles involved and the reference trajectories are accessed by a small fraction of follower vehicles only.</p><p>Distributed trajectory tracking of surface vehicles in the presence of one reference trajectory is addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[39]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[41]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[79]</ref>. Based on a predictor-based neural dynamic surface control design approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[109]</ref>, distributed formation tracking laws are developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[40]</ref> such that the learning performance of neural networks is improved. In order to deal with environmental forces, disturbance-observer-based formation control laws are designed for dynamic positioning vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[41]</ref>. Since then, by taking reducing learning parameters into account, minimallearning-parameter-based neural formation control laws are developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[87]</ref>. In order to improve convergence property, finite-time ESO-based formation control laws are proposed for constrained surface vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[39]</ref>. In addition to some works dedicated to fully-actuated vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[39]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[41]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[87]</ref>, an error transformation approach is presented for distributed formation tracking of under-actuated surface vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[79]</ref>. This approach is capable of maintaining connectivity and avoiding collision. In order to achieve finite-time convergence, sliding mode distributed formation control for under-actuated ASVs is presented <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[30]</ref>.</p><p>In the presence of multiple reference trajectories, the control objective is to drive the follower vehicles to a convex hull spanned by multiple leaders, which is called the containment problem <ref type="bibr">[62]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[110]</ref>. A neural-network-based containment control laws are developed for multiple marine vehicles guided by multiple time-varying trajectories <ref type="bibr">[62]</ref>. The control law assures that a containment formation can be achieved regardless of model uncertainty, unknown ocean disturbances, and unmeasured velocity information. In order to avoid using function approximaters to deal with uncertainties as in <ref type="bibr">[62]</ref>, a prescribed performance technique is used to design containment control laws for under-actuated marine vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[107]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Path-guided coordinated control</head><p>In trajectory-guided formation control, generic time-related are used to guide vehicles. The spatial-temporal behaviors of reference trajectories are coupled. The study of path-guided coordinated control is motivated by the following reasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[42]</ref>. First, geometric and dynamic objectives for a group cannot be controlled separately in trajectoryguided coordinated control. In many circumstances, the spatial requirement is much stricter than the temporal requirement <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[10]</ref>. Second, the motion of a time-related trajectory cannot be affected by follower vehicles in any sense, and thus lacks a feedback loop from a follower vehicle to reference signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[42]</ref>. If a follower vehicle is not able to capture the reference signal due to an inherent limitation such as exogenous disturbances or limited control efforts, the control performance may degrade.</p><p>During the past two decades, cooperative path following with multiple parameterized paths has drawn intensive attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[76]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[85]</ref>. A salient feature of cooperative path following is that the spatial and temporal requirements can be decoupled. It seems that the first cooperative path following control law is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[93]</ref>, where a centralized path variable update law is developed. Another centralized path variable update law is provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[36]</ref>, where the leader path is accessed by each follower vehicle. This restriction is relaxed by using a passivity-based synchronization method <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[13]</ref>, where path variables are updated in a sampled-data manner. After that, the stability of cooperative path following subject to various network conditions are analyzed including communication losses and time delays <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[102]</ref>, time-varying communication delays <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[77]</ref>, discrete-time periodic communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[85]</ref>, and time-varying state-dependent cyber-attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[100]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[77]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[85]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[93]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[102]</ref>, the model parameters are assumed to be perfectly known and the tracking performance ie not assured in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances. In order to improve the performance in the presence of model uncertainty and ocean currents, adaptive cooperative path following control laws are developed for ASVs based on backstepping <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[14]</ref>. It should be noted that the adaptive cooperative path following laws <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[14]</ref> are able to handel parametric uncertainties only. In order to deal with unstructured uncertainties and external disturbances, neuralnetwork-based cooperative path following control laws are proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[103]</ref> for both state and output feedbacks. As an alterative, anti-disturbance coordinated path following laws are proposed based on ESOs by treating the internal uncertainties and external disturbances as a total disturbance and its control performance is substantiated through experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[84]</ref>.</p><p>In the aforementioned results <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[77]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[84]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[85]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[100]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[102]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[103]</ref>, the coordination is achieved by synchronizing the path variables of multiple paths. In a path synchronization approach, only a parallel formation can be achieved. In addition, multiple paths should be planned in advance and the planning cost is high. Coordinated path following along one parameterized path is considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[81]</ref>. A path variable containment approach is proposed such that a queue formation along the path is achieved. The cooperative controll laws are designed based on a modular design approach resulting in decoupled estimation and control. The cooperative path following scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[81]</ref> is suitable for open paths. In many circumstances, closed paths are preferable by oceanographers to collect data along repeated orbits without using a complex ocean model. Based on a proposed path variable cyclic pursuit approach, coordinated path following laws are proposed such that a symmetric formation pattern over a closed curve is achieved <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[80]</ref>.</p><p>It should be stressed that in the aforementioned studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[77]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[81]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[85]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[92]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[102]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[103]</ref>, each vehicle should be assigned by a path known as a priori.

Specifically, distributed maneuvering control of multiple ASVs guided by a virtual leader moving along a parameterized path is considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[24]</ref>, where distributed formation control laws are designed based on neurodynamic optimization and fuzzy approximatio, based on the assumption that the linear velocities and yaw rates are available for feedback.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Target-guided coordinated control</head><p>During the past decade, the target-guided scheme has been used to achieve various formations of marine vehicles. Most of the works use a leader-follower control strategy; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[86]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[89]</ref>. A sliding-mode control law is proposed in a robust scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[29]</ref> for an under-actuated vessel to achieve a leader-follower formation. This control law is local since each vessel needs the relative information between the vessel and its neighbors. As an alterative, a neural-network-based adaptive formation control law is proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[15]</ref> to deal with the uncertainties at the kinematic and kinetic levels. Since then, substantial effort has made on the leader-follower formation control of surface vehicles.</p><p>By taking limited control torques into account, a bounded neural network formation control law is proposed based on a saturation function <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[89]</ref>. A saturated observer-based formation control law is further developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[74]</ref> based on a neural observer concerning unmeasured velocities. By taking actuator faults and system uncertainties into account, a fault tolerant adaptive formation control law is proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[91]</ref>. In addition, the line-of-sight range and angle tracking errors are constrained within a defined bound due to the time-varying tan-type barrier Lyapunov functions. By taking transient performance specifications on formation errors into account, a prescribed performance formation controller is proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[68]</ref> such that collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance between two surface vehicles are guaranteed.

Similarly, a vector-field guidance is proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[111]</ref> to track a defined trajectory relative to a leader ASV.</p><p>It should be noted that in aforementioned results <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[47]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[68]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[69]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[74]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[89]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[91]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[111]</ref>, the objective is to track a leader with a leader-follower formation; i.e. a relative range and angle can be achieved. In some mission scenarios, it is desirable to track the target with a circular formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[78]</ref>. Based on a line-of-sight guidance and an ocean current estimator, an anti-disturbance guidance method is presented <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[12]</ref> for an under-actuated ASV to track and surround a maneuvering target with a time-varying velocity.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. FUTURE WORKS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>In the review of the recent advances in coordinated control of multiple ASVs, the existing results are classified into trajectory-guided, path-guided, and target-guided coordinated control. It should be mentioned that in addition to theoretical findings, experimental results are also reported in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[45]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[80]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[82]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[84]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[105]</ref>. There are significant progresses in the coordinated control of multiple ASVs. However, there are still several theoretical and technical issues to be further addressed for more sophisticated marine applications, as stated as follows.</p><p>• Network-based coordination of multiple ASVs. Networked control is the current trend for industrial automation and has ever-increasing applications in a wide range of areas, such as manufacturing systems, process control systems, smart grids, automobile and automated highway systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[112]</ref>. However, there are only a few results available for networked control of ASVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[113]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[114]</ref>. How to systematically develop new network-based models of ASVs by taking into consideration network-induced delays, data packet dropouts, and data packet disorder is an interesting research area. Furthermore, based on these network-based models, how to address distributed networked cooperative control of multiple ASVs needs in-depth investigations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[18]</ref>. • Event-triggered coordination of multiple ASVs. When ASVs move on a water surface, communications between ASVs could be disrupted due to the lack of efficient or reliable communication facilities in the marine environment. Although satellite communications can be adopted, the operating costs of the technology are very high and not suitable for low-budgeted applications. From a practical perspective, it is desirable to reduce communication bandwidth among ASVs during coordination. Existing ASV coordination control methods employ continuous or timetrigged communications which would entail substantial communication resources. Recent event-triggered or selftriggered scheduling schemes without using periodical communications may provide some avenues to achieve this control objective <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[78]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[115]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[116]</ref>. By using eventtriggered or self-triggered communications, the communication burden could be reduced. • Collision-free coordination of multiple ASVs. Collision avoidance is a fundamental issue not only for a single vehicle control but also for coordinated control of multiple ASVs. The reliable collision avoidance capability is a primary requirement for any autonomous control systems. In the literature, the collision avoidance issue is well addressed for one surface vehicle to avoid static or dynamic obstacles <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[67]</ref>. For multiple ASVs, it becomes a major challenge as the vehicle number increases. Effective collision-free coordination control methods are rather limited. As a result, in order to achieve fully autonomous control of multiple ASVs, how to explore effective collision avoidance approaches to collision-free coordination of multiple ASVs in dynamic maritime environments subject to various static and moving obstacles is still open for further investigations. • Optimization-based coordination of multiple ASVs. Distributed optimization-based coordination means that a team of ASVs with dynamics (1) cooperatively complete a coordination task encoded in given objective functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[117]</ref>. Each ASV has its individual objective function of interest known to itself. A control law should be developed such that the sum of the objective functions of the entire group can be optimized subject to communication constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[118]</ref>. Optimization-based coordination of multiple ASVs has various applications such as target localization, formation reconfiguration, and coverage control <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[119]</ref>. From a theoretical standpoint, the challenge is how to design distributed optimization-based control laws for ASVs subject to uncertainties and disturbances, especially in the presence of communication constraints at sea. • Data-driven coordination of multiple ASVs. Most of re-ported coordination control laws are based on modern control theory and the control law design and analysis are practiced on the basis of the explicit mathematical model (1), even though its parameters could be totally unknown. It is regarded as model-based control. The stability, convergence, robustness, and optimality are the main concerns of model-based approaches. However, ASV is designed with multi-body layout such as catamarans, three-body boats, and multi-body boats. The propulsion mode can be various ranging from propulsion with double propellers, propulsion with multi-propellers, separation of rudder and propeller, integration of rudder and propeller, to water jet propulsion. The hydrodynamic model of the propulsion is complex and not completely understood. The modelling process is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. In recent years, data-driven modelling and control of autonomous systems without any a priori model is a promising. This may be partially due to its great success in artificial intelligent such as Alpha Go. Data-driven control enables end-to-end decision and control from raw sensing information without any intermediate modelling process. As a result, fully datadriven coordinated control of ASVs is appealing to be investigated from in both theory and practice. There are some results available on the fully data-driven control of marine vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[120]</ref>, whereas few results on datadriven coordination of multiple ASVs are reported.</p><p>• Task-region-oriented coordination of multiple ASVs and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). ASVs are characterized by precise navigation and global positioning capabilities, and are able to communicate with surface water, underwater, air and space platforms. AUVs can be equipped with various sensors to perform underwater operations while underwater navigation and communication become main challenges. The combined ASV/AUV coordination will expand their capabilities, overcome the limitation of acoustic communication, and enable longduration and high-efficiency underwater operations such as seabed mapping, marine surveying, and search and rescue. Although a successful application can be found in search of MH370, there are only a few results available in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[105]</ref>, where formation configurations with one ASV and four AUVs are addressed. As the mission location can be specified as a task region, in many cases, it is desirable to use multiple ASVs shaped with a formation to guide multiple AUVs and cover the task region. An interesting topic is task-region-oriented coordinated control.</p><p>VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS This paper presents an overview of recent progresses in coordinated control of multiple ASVs. By categorizing the existing results into the trajectory-guided, target-guided, and path-guided coordinated control, the problem setups and control methodologies on these three coordinated control schemes are introduced and summarized. The survey also highlights some future directions including network-based coordination, event-triggered coordination, collision-free coordination, 1551-3203 (c) 2020 IEEE.
