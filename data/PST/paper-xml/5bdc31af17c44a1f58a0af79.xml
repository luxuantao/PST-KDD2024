<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm is a novel meta-heuristic, inspired from the social hunting behavior of grey wolves. This paper introduces the chaos theory into the GWO algorithm with the aim of accelerating its global convergence speed. Firstly, detailed studies are carried out on thirteen standard constrained benchmark problems with ten different chaotic maps to find out the most efficient one. Then, the chaotic GWO is compared with the traditional GWO and some other popular meta-heuristics viz. Firefly Algorithm, Flower Pollination Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The performance of the CGWO algorithm is also validated using five constrained engineering design problems.

In general terms, constraints can be classified into equality constraints and inequality constraints which are represented in the form of mathematical equality and inequality equations respectively. Both types of constraints need to be satisfied by the problem's decision variables. Earlier, some deterministic methods like feasible direction approach and generalized gradient descent method were developed for solving constraint problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. However, due to their limited applicability and complexity of constraints, these were not effective for real world applications like structural optimization problems, economical optimization, location problems and engineering design problems like spring design, welded beam design , truss design, speed reducer design which involve many difficult equality and inequality constraints to be satisfied <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. More and more meta-heuristic algorithms have been proposed to tackle these tough constrained optimization problems. These algorithms aim for tolerable velocity of convergence, a better precision, robustness, and performance. Some of the recent meta-heuristic algorithms proposed are Firefly Algorithm (FA) which is inspired by the flashing and attraction behavior of fireflies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>, Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) which is based on the characteristics of flowering of plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) which is inspired by the swarm behavior such as fish and bird schooling in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, Bird Swarm Algorithm (BSA) which is based on the unique social interactions of bird swarms <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, ebb-tide-fish-inspired (ETFI) algorithm which is a simulation of fascinating characteristic of fish's perception of flow, sound and vibrations of tides in water <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, Jaya algorithm in which the main concept is to move the solution found so far towards the best solution and away from the worst solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm based on the social hunting behavior of grey wolves, Animal Migration Optimization (AMO) algorithm whose optimization process is mainly divided into two process viz. migration process and updating process with respect to animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA) which is inspired by the food foraging behavior of butterflies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, Brain Storm Optimization (BSO) algorithm which is based on the simulation of brain storming process in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) which is inspired from the social interaction of humpback whales <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) which mimics the clever characteristic of crows <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.

This population based metaheuristic has the ability to avoid local optima stagnation to some extent <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. It also has good convergence ability towards the optima. In general, GWO advances itself strongly to exploitation. However, it cannot always implement global search well. Thus, in some cases, GWO fails to find global optimal solution. The search strategy used in basic GWO is mainly based on random walks.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Overview of grey wolf optimization algorithm</head><p>Initially, Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) was introduced by S. Mirjalilli in year 2014 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. This algorithm is a simulation of unique hunting and searching prey characteristics of grey wolves. GWO has assumed the four level social hierarchy of grey wolves involving α at first, β at second, δ at third and ω wolves at last level. α wolves are the leader wolves managing and conducting the whole pack of grey wolves. It is also responsible for controlling the whole hunting process, taking all types of decisions like hunting, maintaining discipline, sleeping and waking time for whole pack. β wolf which is the best candidate to be the α, take feedback from other wolves and give it to the α leader. The third level of grey wolves i.e. δ wolves, dominate the wolves of forth and the last level called the ω wolves which are responsible for maintaining the safety and integrity in the wolf pack <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>The distances from α, β and δ wolves i.e. D α , D β and D δ to each of the remaining wolf ( X) are calculated using Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">1</ref>) using which the effect of α, β and δ wolves on the prey viz.</p><p>-→ X 1 , -→ X 2 and -→ X 3 can be calculated as represented in Eq.

( <ref type="formula">3</ref>). Here, r 1 and r 2 are the random vectors in the range of [0, 1]. These vectors make wolves able to reach at any point between the prey and the wolf. Vector a is involved in controlling activity of the GWO algorithm and used in calculating A. The component values of a vector decreases linearly from 2 to 0 over the courses of iterations <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. C helps in putting some extra weight on the prey to make it difficult for the wolves to find it. Thus at last, all other wolves update their positions -→ X (t + 1) using Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">4</ref>). In spite of being new comer, GWO is being used in many real world applications such as a modified version of GWO algorithm was proposed and applied it successfully for training q-gaussian radial basis functional link nets <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, A modified GWO algorithm named multi-verse optimizer (MVO) for solving various optimization problems was proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>,</p><p>The binary version of GWO algorithm was proposed to be used for feature selection which was one of the important and crucial modification of GWO algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, A multi-objective GWO was modeled to minimize the gases emission level of CO 2 by the capacitor in which 30-bus system was used for the evaluation of the proposed method <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, GWO algorithm was used to optimize the controlling parameters of DC motor <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, The flowshop scheduling problem of stage 2 was solved along with the optimization of its release time by using GWO algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Chaotic grey wolf optimization algorithm</head><p>In spite of having good convergence rate, GWO still cannot always perform that well in finding global optima which affect the convergence rate of the algorithm. So, to reduce this affect and improve its efficiency, CGWO algorithm is developed by introducing chaos in GWO algorithm itself. In general terms, chaos is a deterministic, random-like method found in non-linear, dynamical system, which is non-period, non-converging and bounded. Mathematically, chaos is randomness of a simple deterministic dynamical system and chaotic system may be considered as sources of randomness. In order to introduce chaos in optimization algorithms, different chaotic maps having different mathematical equations are used. Since last decade, chaotic maps have been widely appreciated in the field of optimization due to their dynamic behavior which help optimization algorithms in exploring the search space more dynamically and globally. At a recent time, in accordance with different human's realm a wide variety of chaotic maps designed by physicians, researchers and mathematicians are available in the optimization field <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Out of all these available chaotic maps, bulk of them has been mostly applied to algorithms to apply it further on real world applications. Thus, as reviewed from the gathered literature ten most relevant uni-dimensional chaotic maps to tackle CGWO have been used in the present work <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> details of which are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>In these chaotic maps any number in the range [0, 1] (or according to the range of chaotic map) can be chosen as the initial value. However, it should be noted that the initial value may have significant impacts on the fluctuation pattern of some of the chaotic maps. This set of chaotic maps has been chosen with different behaviors, while the initial value is 0.7 for all <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Chaotic maps affects the convergence rate of GWO algorithm positively as these maps induce chaos in the feasible region which is predictable only for very short initial time and is stochastic for longer period of time. Pseudo code of the proposed CGWO algorithm for solving optimization problems is portrayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝑥 𝑘+1 = { 𝑥 𝑘 1 -𝑎 0 ≤ 𝑥 𝑘 ≤ 𝑎 𝑥 𝑘 -(1 -𝑎) 𝑎 (1 -𝑎) ≤ 𝑥 𝑘 ≤ 1 } 2 Logistic map 𝑥 𝑘+1 = 𝑎. 𝑥 𝑘 (1 -𝑥 𝑘 ) 3 Chebyshev map 𝑥 𝑘+1 = cos (𝑎. cos -1 𝑥 𝑘 ) 4 Circle map a 𝑥 𝑘+1 = 𝑥 𝑘 + 𝑏 -( 𝑎 2𝜋</formula><p>) sin(2𝜋𝑥 𝑘 ) 𝑚𝑜𝑑( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">1</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">5 Cubic map 𝑥 𝑘+1 = 𝜌(1 -𝑥 𝑘 2 ), 𝑥 𝑘 ∈ (0, 1)<label>6</label></formula><p>Iterative chaotic map with infinite collapses (ICMIC) map 𝑥 𝑘+1 = 𝑎𝑏𝑠 (sin ( 𝑎 𝑥 𝑘 )) , 𝑎 ∈ (0, 1) The optimization procedure of the proposed CGWO algorithm is also presented in the form of flow chart given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In this, first step involves the stochastic initialization of population of grey wolves. Then, a chaotic map is chosen to be mapped with the algorithm along with the initialization of its first chaotic number and a variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. Sequentially, the parameters of the CGWO algorithm involved in conducting the exploration -exploitation mechanism viz. a, A and C which are same as in GWO. Fitness of all grey wolves initialized in the search space are evaluated using various standard benchmark functions and are sorted according to their fitness. The first wolf got after sorting is assumed to be α wolf and accordingly second and third wolves are assumed as β and δ wolf respectively. Sequentially, the fitter wolf will keep updating its position using Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">4</ref>) and may get the position of α wolf as optimal solution. The parameters' values are also updated along with the course of iterations using Eq. (3). At the end of the last iteration, fitness of α wolf will be considered as the most optimal solution of the problem found by the CGWO algorithm.   </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">7 Piecewise map 𝑥 𝑘+1 = { 𝑥 𝑘 𝑎 0 ≤ 𝑥 𝑘 ≤ 𝑎 𝑥 𝑘 -𝑎 0.5 -𝑎 𝑎 ≤ 𝑥 𝑘 ≤ 0.5 1 -𝑎 -𝑥 𝑘 0.5 -𝑎 0.5 ≤ 𝑥 𝑘 ≤ 1 -𝑎 1 -𝑥 𝑘 𝑎 1 -𝑎 ≤ 𝑥 𝑘 ≤ 1 }<label>8</label></formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Experimental study and Discussion</head><p>5.1. Parameter settings Among all the complex methods to calculate the penalty of constraints like iterative method, methods based on feasibility of solutions, simple penalty function method is used in all the constrained optimizations problems implemented and discussed in this paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. The population size of grey wolves is taken 30 and 100 iterations are performed for the results of all the constrained benchmark functions. 30 Monte Carlo runs are executed on each of the constrained benchmark functions. For effective validation of proposed CGWO algorithm, it has been compared with some other optimization algorithms which are GWO <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, FA <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, FPA <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. In case of constrained benchmark functions, the performance of proposed CGWO is compared with those of GWO <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, FA <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, FPA <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Additionally, parameter settings for all these algorithms need to be done for impartial comparison which is one of the difficult task to perform during the execution. The parameter settings done in this work is like for PSO, global learning (no local neighborhoods), an inertial constant = 0.3, a cognitive constant = 1 and a social constant for swarm interaction = 1 is used. For FPA, λ = 1.5 for Levy distribution function and proximity probability p=0.8 is used. For FA, randomization parameter α = 0.6, attractiveness β 0 = 1 and absorption coefficient γ = 1.0 is used. For GWO, two random vectors r 1 and r 2 are taken in the range of (0,1) and the controlling parameter a have linearly decreasing values from 2 to 0 over the course of iterations. For CGWO, values of two vectors r 1 and r 2 are taken randomly in the range of (0,1) and the controlling parameter a have linearly decreasing values from 2 to 0 over the course of iterations, chaotic function variables a = 0.5 and b = 0.2 is used. Additionally, the best map performer for constrained optimization problems as per results, i.e., chebyshev map has been used on CGWO constraint handling mechanism. CGWO is implemented in C++ and compiled using Qt Creator 2.4.1 (MinGW) under Microsoft Windows 7 operating system. All simulations are carried out on a computer with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 -3210@2.50Ghz CPU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Results and Discussion</head><p>In order to evaluate the capability of proposed CGWO for handling constrained problems, a set of thirteen widely used constrained benchmark functions have been used <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> and applied on all the maps mentioned in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. All the problems consist in the set have various linear, non-linear and quadratic equations in the form of equality and inequality constraints which are represented in Table 2. To choose the best possible map for all the constrained optimization problems, all the selected maps are applied on all the constrained benchmark functions whose results are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>. According to the results, chebyshev map showed promising performance by outperforming seven out of thirteen constrained benchmark functions and thus is chosen for further investigation of CGWO on constrained optimization problems. The results of all the constrained benchmark functions applied on CGWO and other algorithms are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref>. It can be easily seen from the results that CGWO has handle seven out of thirteen constrained benchmark functions very efficiently and thus has outperformed all other algorithms for these seven benchmark functions. PSO handled three constrained functions well among all. GWO performed superior to other for two constrained functions. FA outperformed for only one constrained function. The reason was that the chaotic maps with a unimode centered around the middle of maps, tend to produce better results, and chebyshev map fall into this category and it is indeed very effective. The results have also revealed the significant improvement of the proposed CGWO algorithm with the application of deterministic chaotic signals in place of constant value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Graphical Analysis</head><p>For further effective evaluation of performances of all the algorithms, graphical analysis has also been done. The line graphs of convergence of various constrained benchmark functions using CGWO algorithm and other algorithms viz. GWO, FA, FPA and PSO have been shown from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> to Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> which help to analyze the convergence rate of each algorithm more effectively. All these graphs have been taken on 100 iterations to clearly notice and analyze the convergence of all the algorithms. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the line graphs of convergence of all the five optimization algorithms applied on G1 test constrained benchmark function. From the graph, it can be seen that CGWO has the best performance for this benchmark function. It is showing superior performance of CGWO by reaching the optima for this test function within 10 iterations only. Further, it can be concluded from this graph that the GWO and FPA performed well when compared with other algorithms. FA demonstrates poor convergence in most of the optimization process, however it eventually ends the value of PSO. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> demonstrates the line graphs of convergence of CGWO along with all other algorithms for G2 constrained benchmark function in which it is easily remarkable that CGWO is fastest of all in context of convergence towards the optima than that of FA, FPA, GWO and PSO. PSO has shown a competitive performance to CGWO for this problem and exhibits significant performance in terms of convergence speed. GWO, FA and FPA show a faster convergence rate initially, however they seem to be trapped into sub-optimal values as the optimization procedure proceeds. Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> illustrates the convergence rate on G9 test constrained benchmark function in which CGWO is demonstrating the high rate of convergence as compared to FPA, FA, PSO and GWO. The convergence line graph of FPA and PSO is showing slow convergence by giving constant fitness values for many iterations in between the 100 iterations as they seem to be trapped into sub-optimal values as the procedure proceeds, especially FPA. This demonstrates how CGWO is capable of balancing exploration and exploitation to find the global optimum rapidly and effectively. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> is presenting the graphical view of convergence of all algorithms on G13 test constrained benchmark function in which it can be clearly seen that CGWO algorithm is nearest to the global optima of this constrained problem among algorithms viz. FPA, FA, GWO and PSO and it also shows fastest convergence of all. GWO and FPA illustrate poorer convergence than the other algorithms in the initial iterations. However, the search process is progressively accelerated during iterations for these algorithms. This indicates that the performance of CGWO can be boosted by the chaotic maps in terms of not only exploration but also exploitation. </p></div>

Meta-heuristic methods come into being as an alternative to the traditional optimization methods. With their merits of finding acceptable solutions in an affordable time and being tolerant of non-convex and non-differentiable, meta-heuristic algorithms have attracted great research interest during the recent years. In real design problems the number of design variables can be very large, and their influence on the objective function to be optimized can be very complicated, with a nonlinear character. Therefore, in this paper, design considerations of five classical engineering design problems viz. spring design problem, gear train design problem, welded beam design problem, pressure vessel design problem and closed coil helical spring design problem have been done in subsections 6.1 to 6.5.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion and Future scope</head><p>The chaos theory and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) are hybridized in order to design an improved meta-heuristic Chaotic Grey Wolf Optimization (CGWO) algorithm for constrained optimization problems. Various chaotic maps are used to regulate the key parameter, a, of GWO. The proposed CGWO is validated on thirteen constrained benchmark functions and five constrained engineering design problems. The chebyshev map is selected as its a through comparing various chaotic GWO variants to form the best CGWO. The simulations show that the usage of deterministic chaotic signals instead of linearly decreasing values is an important modification of the GWO algorithm. Statistical results and success rates of the CGWO suggest that the tuned GWO clearly improves the reliability of the global optimality and they also enhanced the quality of the results. In comparison with other algorithms viz. FA, FPA, GWO and PSO, it seems the CGWO performed significantly well. The results of CGWO on constrained engineering problems showed its applicability for the complex real-world problems. The main reason of the superior performance of CGWO lies behind the chaos induced by the chaotic maps in the search space. This chaos helps the controlling parameter to find the optimal solution more quickly and thus refine the convergence rate of the algorithm. So, it can be easily concluded here that proposed CGWO can handle constrained problems effectively and efficiently. Further investigation on convergence analysis may prove fruitful. In addition, further topics of studies can also focus on the extension of the CGWO to solve mixed-type problems and discrete optimization problems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>StartFigure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Flowchart of optimization procedure of CGWO</figDesc></figure>
