<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Adversarial examples highlight model vulnerabilities and are useful for evaluation and interpretation. We define universal adversarial triggers: input-agnostic sequences of tokens that trigger a model to produce a specific prediction when concatenated to any input from a dataset. We propose a gradientguided search over tokens which finds short trigger sequences (e.g., one word for classification and four words for language modeling) that successfully trigger the target prediction. For example, triggers cause SNLI entailment accuracy to drop from 89.94% to 0.55%, 72% of "why" questions in SQuAD to be answered "to kill american people", and the GPT-2 language model to spew racist output even when conditioned on non-racial contexts. Furthermore, although the triggers are optimized using white-box access to a specific model, they transfer to other models for all tasks we consider. Finally, since triggers are input-agnostic, they provide an analysis of global model behavior. For instance, they confirm that SNLI models exploit dataset biases and help to diagnose heuristics learned by reading comprehension models.</p></div>

From an attack perspective, they expose system vulnerabilities, e.g., a spammer may use adversarial attacks to bypass a spam email filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Biggio et al., 2013)</ref>. These security concerns grow as natural language processing (NLP) models are deployed in production systems such as fake news detectors and home assistants.</p><p>Besides exposing system vulnerabilities, adversarial attacks are useful for evaluation and interpretation, i.e., understanding a model's capabilities by finding its limitations. For example, adversarially-modified inputs are used to evaluate reading comprehension models <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Jia and Liang, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ribeiro et al., 2018)</ref> and stress test neural machine translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Belinkov and Bisk, 2018)</ref>. Adversarial attacks also facilitate interpretation, e.g., by analyzing a model's sensitivity to local perturbations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Li et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Feng et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>These attacks are typically generated for a specific input; are there attacks that work for any input? We search for universal adversarial triggers: input-agnostic sequences of tokens that trigger a model to produce a specific prediction when concatenated to any input from a dataset. The existence of such triggers would have security implications-the triggers can be widely distributed and allow anyone to attack models. Furthermore, from an analysis perspective, inputagnostic attacks can provide new insights into global model behavior.</p><p>Triggers are a new form of universal adversarial perturbation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2017)</ref> adapted to discrete textual inputs. To find them, we design a gradient-guided search over tokens. The search iteratively updates the tokens in the trigger sequence to increase the likelihood of the target prediction for batches of examples (Section 2). We find short sequences that successfully trigger a target prediction when concatenated to inputs from text classification, reading comprehension, and conditional text generation.</p><p>For text classification, triggers cause targeted errors for sentiment analysis (e.g., top of Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) and natural language inference models. For example, one word causes a model to predict 99.43% of Entailment examples as Contradiction (Section 3). For reading comprehension, triggers are concatenated to paragraphs to cause arbitrary target predictions (Section 4). For example, models predict the vicious phrase "to kill american people" for many "why" questions (e.g., middle of Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p>For conditional text generation, triggers are prepended to user inputs in order to maximize the likelihood of a set of target texts (Section 5). Our attack triggers the GPT-2 language model (Rad-2154</p></div>

Table <ref type="table">1</ref>: We create token sequences that commonly trigger a specific target prediction when concatenated to any input from a dataset. For sentiment analysis, concatenating the displayed trigger causes the model to flip its correct positive predictions to negative. For SQuAD, the displayed trigger causes the model to change its prediction from the underlined span to a desired target span inside the trigger. For language modeling, triggers are prefixes that prompt GPT-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Radford et al., 2019)</ref> to generate racist outputs, even when conditioned on non-racist user inputs. <ref type="bibr">ford et al., 2019)</ref> to generate racist outputs using the prompt "TH PEOPLEMan goddreams Blacks" (e.g., bottom of Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). 1  Although we generate triggers assuming whitebox (gradient) access to a specific model, they are transferable to other models for all datasets we consider. For example, some of the triggers generated for a GloVe-based reading comprehension model are more effective at triggering an ELMobased model. Moreover, a trigger generated for the GPT-2 117M model also works for the 345M model: the first language model sample in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows the larger model ranting on the "evil genes" of Black, Jewish, Chinese, and Indian people.</p><p>Finally, unlike typical adversarial attacks, the input-agnostic nature of the triggers provides new insights into global model behavior, i.e., general input-output patterns learned by a model.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Universal Adversarial Triggers</head><p>This section introduces universal adversarial triggers and our algorithm to find them. We provide source code for our attacks and experiments.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Setting and Motivation</head><p>We are interested in attacks that concatenate tokens (words, sub-words, or characters) to the front or end of an input to cause a target prediction.</p><p>Why Universal? The adversarial threat is higher if an attack is universal: using the exact same attack for any input <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brown et al., 2017)</ref>. Universal attacks are advantageous as (1) no access to the target model is needed at test time, and (2) they drastically lower the barrier of entry for an adversary: trigger sequences can be widely distributed for anyone to fool machine learning models. Moreover, universal attacks often transfer across models <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2017)</ref>, which further decreases attack requirements: the adversary does not need white-box (gradient) access to the target model. Instead, they can generate the attack using their own model trained on similar data and transfer it.</p><p>Finally, universal attacks are a unique model analysis tool because, unlike typical attacks, they are context-independent. Thus, they highlight general input-output patterns learned by a model. We leverage this to study the influence of dataset biases and to identify heuristics that are learned by models (Section 6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Attack Model and Objective</head><p>In a non-universal targeted attack, we are given a model f , a text input of tokens (words, sub-words, or characters) t, and a target label ỹ. The adversary aims to concatenate trigger tokens t adv to the front or end of t (we assume front for notation), such that f (t adv ; t) = ỹ.</p><p>Universal Setting In a universal targeted attack, the adversary optimizes t adv to minimize the loss for the target class ỹ for all inputs from a dataset. This translates to the following objective:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">arg min t adv E t∼T [L(ỹ, f (t adv ; t))] ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where T are input instances from a data distribution and L is the task's loss function. To generate our attacks, we assume white-box access to f .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Trigger Search Algorithm</head><p>We first choose the trigger length: longer triggers are more effective, while shorter triggers are more stealthy. Next, we initialize the trigger sequence by repeating the word "the", the sub-word "a", or the character "a" and concatenate the trigger to the front/end of all inputs. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref>We then iteratively replace the tokens in the trigger to minimize the loss for the target prediction over batches of examples. To determine how to replace the current tokens, we cannot directly apply adversarial attack methods from computer vision because tokens are discrete. Instead, we build upon HotFlip <ref type="bibr">(Ebrahimi et al., 2018b)</ref>, a method that approximates the effect of replacing a token using its gradient. To apply this method, the trigger tokens t adv , which are represented as one-hot vectors, are embedded to form e adv .</p><p>Token Replacement Strategy Our HotFlipinspired token replacement strategy is based on  <ref type="bibr">views)</ref>. We then compute the gradient for the target adversarial label over the batch (e.g., using p(neg), the probability of the negative class) and update the trigger using Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>. After iteratively repeating this process, the trigger converges to "zoning tapping fienes", which causes frequent negative predictions.</p><p>a linear approximation of the task loss. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">4</ref> We update the embedding for every trigger token e adv i to minimizes the loss' first-order Taylor approximation around the current token embedding:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">arg min e i ∈V e i − e adv i ∇ e adv i L, (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>where V is the set of all token embeddings in the model's vocabulary and ∇ e adv i L is the average gradient of the task loss over a batch. Computing the optimal e i can be efficiently computed in brute-force with |V| d-dimensional dot products where d is the dimensionality of the token embedding <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Michel et al., 2019)</ref>. This brute-force solution is trivially parallelizable and less expensive than running a forward pass for all the models we consider. Finally, after finding each e adv i , we convert the embeddings back to their associated tokens. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> provides an illustration of the trigger search algorithm.</p><p>We augment this token replacement strategy with beam search. We consider the top-k token candidates from Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>for each token position in the trigger. We search left to right across the positions and score each beam using its loss on the current batch. We use small beam sizes due to computational constraints (Appendix A), increasing them may improve our results.</p><p>We also attack contextualized ELMo embeddings and sub-word models that use byte pair encoding. This presents challenges not handled in prior work, e.g., ELMo embeddings change depending on the context; we describe our methodology for handling these attacks also in Appendix A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Tasks and Associated Loss Functions</head><p>Our trigger search algorithm is generally applicable-the only task-specific component is the loss function L. Here, we describe the three tasks used in our experiments and the associated loss functions. For each task, we generate the triggers on the dev set and evaluate on the test set.</p><p>Classification In text classification, a real-world trigger attack may concatenate a sentence to a fake news article to cause a model to classify it as legitimate. We optimize the attack using the crossentropy loss for the target label ỹ.</p><p>Reading Comprehension Reading comprehension models are used to answer questions that are posed to search engines or home assistants. An adversary can attack these models by modifying a web page in order to trigger malicious or vulgar answers. Here, we prepend triggers to paragraphs in order to cause predictions to be a target span inside the trigger. We choose and fix the target span beforehand and optimize the other trigger tokens. The trigger is optimized to work for any paragraph and any question of a certain type. We focus on why, who, when, and where questions. We use sentences of length ten following <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Jia and Liang (2017)</ref> and sum the cross-entropy of the start and end of the target span as the loss function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditional Text Generation</head><p>We attack conditional text generation models, such as those in machine translation or autocomplete keyboards. The failure of such systems can be costly, e.g., translation errors have led to a person's arrest <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hern, 2018)</ref>. We create triggers that are prepended before the user input t to cause the model to generate similar content to a set of targets Y. 5 In 5 A strong language model will generate grammatically correct continuations of the user's input. This makes it impossible to generate one specific target no matter the input. We thus relax the attack to targets of similar content. particular, our trigger causes the GPT-2 language model <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Radford et al., 2019)</ref> to output racist content. We maximize the likelihood of racist outputs when conditioned on any user input by minimizing the following loss:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">E y∼Y,t∼T |y| i=1 log(1 − p(y i | t adv , t, y 1 , ..., y i−1 )),</formula><p>where Y is the set of all racist outputs and T is the set of all user inputs. Of course, Y and T are infeasible to optimize over. In our initial setup, we approximate Y and T using racist and nonracist tweets. In later experiments, we find that using thirty manually-written racist statements of average length ten for Y and not optimizing over T (leaving out t) produces similar results. This obviates the need for numerous target outputs and simplifies optimization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Attacking Text Classification</head><p>We consider two text classification datasets.</p><p>Sentiment Analysis We use binary Stanford Sentiment Treebank <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Socher et al., 2013)</ref>. We consider Bi-LSTM models (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005) using word2vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Mikolov et al., 2018)</ref> or ELMo <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Peters et al., 2018)</ref> embeddings. The word2vec and ELMo models achieve 86.4% and 89.6% accuracy, respectively.</p><p>Natural Language Inference We consider natural language inference using SNLI <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bowman et al., 2015)</ref>. We use the Enhanced Sequential Inference <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al., 2017, ESIM)</ref> and Decomposable Attention (Parikh et al., 2016, DA) models with GloVe embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Pennington et al., 2014)</ref>. We also consider a DA model with ELMo embeddings (DA-ELMo). The ESIM, DA, and DA-ELMo models achieve 86.8%, 84.7%, and 86.4% accuracy, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Breaking Sentiment Analysis</head><p>We begin with word-level attacks on sentiment analysis. To avoid degenerate triggers such as "amazing" for negative examples, we use a lexicon to blacklist sentiment words. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">6</ref> We start with a targeted attack that flips positive predictions to negative using three prepended trigger words. Our attack algorithm returns "zoning tapping fiennes"prepending this trigger causes the model's accu-racy to drop from 86.2% to 29.1% on positive examples. We conduct a similar attack to flip negative predictions to positive-obtaining "comedy comedy blutarsky"-which causes the model's accuracy to degrade from 86.6% to 23.6%. <ref type="bibr">Figure 5</ref> in Appendix B shows the effect of decreasing/increasing the length of the trigger. For example, the positive to negative attack degrades accuracy to 46% using one word and 13% with ten.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ELMo-based Model</head><p>We next attack the ELMo model. We prepend one word consisting of four characters to the input and optimize over the characters. For the targeted attack that flips positive predictions to negative, the model's accuracy degrades from 89.1% to 51.5% on positive examples using the trigger "uˆ{b". For the negative to positive attack, prepending "m&amp;s∼" drops accuracy from 90.1% to 52.2% on negative examples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Breaking Natural Language Inference</head><p>We attack SNLI models by prepending a single word to the hypothesis. We generate the attack using an ensemble of the GloVe-based DA and ESIM models (we average their gradients ∇ e adv i L), and hold the DA-ELMo model out as a black-box.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>, we show the top-5 trigger words for each ground-truth SNLI class and the corresponding accuracy for the three models. The attack can degrade the three model's accuracy to nearly zero for Entailment and Neutral examples, and by about 10-20% for Contradiction. Table <ref type="table">6</ref> in Appendix B shows the prediction distribution for the DA model-targeted attacks are successful, e.g., the trigger "nobody" causes 99.43% of Entailment examples to be predicted as Contradiction.</p><p>The attacks also readily transfer: the ELMobased DA model's accuracy degrades the most, despite never being targeted in the trigger generation. We analyze why the predictions for Contradiction are more robust and show that triggers align with known dataset biases in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Attacking Reading Comprehension</head><p>We create triggers for SQuAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Rajpurkar et al., 2016)</ref>. We use an intentionally simple baseline model and test the trigger's transferability to more advanced models (with different embeddings, tokenizations, and architectures). The baseline is BiDAF <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Seo et al., 2017)</ref>; we lowercase all inputs and use GloVe <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Pennington et al., 2014)</ref>. We pick the target answers "to kill american people", "donald trump", "january 2014", and "new york" for why, who, when, and where questions, respectively. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">7</ref>Evaluation We consider our attack successful only when the model's predicted span exactly matches the target. We call this the attack success rate to avoid confusion with the exact match score for the original ground-truth answer. We do not have access to the hidden test set of SQuAD to evaluate our attacks. Instead, we generate the triggers using 2000 examples held-out from the training data and evaluate them on the development set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The resulting triggers for each target answer are shown in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, along with their attack success rate. The triggers are effective-they have nearly 50% success rate for who, when, and where questions on the BiDAF model. As a baseline, we also prepend only the target answer span (no other tokens) and see substantially lower success rates (Table <ref type="table">8</ref> in Appendix C). Table <ref type="table">3</ref>: We prepend the trigger sequence to the paragraph of every SQuAD example of a certain type (e.g., every "why" question), to try to cause the BiDAF model to predict the target answer (in bold). We report how often the model's prediction exactly matches the target. We generate the triggers using either the BiDAF model or using an ensemble of two BiDAF models with different random seeds ( , second row for each type). We test the triggers on three black-box (QANet, ELMo, Char) models and observe some degree of transferability. Table <ref type="table">4</ref>: We replace the target answer span from the triggers in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> without changing the rest of the trigger. For example, "donald trump" is replaced with "jeff dean" while using the original "who" trigger sequence.</p><p>The attack success rate often increases, i.e., the trigger is relatively agnostic to the target answer.</p><p>Replacing the Target Answers We can also replace the target answer span without changing the rest of the trigger. For example, we replace "to kill american people" with "bomb in the classroom" without changing the rest of the "why" trigger sequence from Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. The attack success rate sometimes increases, i.e., the trigger is relatively agnostic to the target answer (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). We ameliorate this by training another GloVebased BiDAF model and regenerating the triggers using an ensemble of the two BiDAF models. Except on "why" questions, this improves transferability (second row for each type in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attack Transferability</head><p>Section 6 analyzes other properties of the SQuAD triggers such as token order, placement in the paragraph, and the effect of dataset biases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Attacking Conditional Text Generation</head><p>We generate a trigger for the publicly released 117M parameter version of GPT-2 using six subword tokens. The attack returns "TH PEOPLE-Man goddreams Blacks" as the trigger. This nonsensical sequence triggers the model to generate racist outputs. The last two examples of Table <ref type="table">1</ref> show samples from the GPT-2 117M model when given different user inputs, and the reader can try their own inputs in the online GPT-2 demo. We also generate 100 samples and manually analyze them, finding 98% are racial and/or offensive, and 63% contain an explicitly racist statement (samples and details in Appendix D).</p><p>Note that the attack effectiveness is not due to the token "Blacks", e.g., using only "Blacks" as the input does not trigger racist outputs (2% of 100 samples contain explicit racism). Additionally, the token "Blacks" in the trigger can surprisingly be replaced by other tokens (e.g., "Asians" or "Jews") and GPT-2 will still produce egregious outputs.</p><p>Attack Transferability Although the trigger sequence is generated for the GPT-2 117M parameter model, we find it also triggers the 345M parameter model: the outputs have comparable degrees of explicit racism (58% of the time) but better fluency. The first language model sample in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> is generated using the 345M model and further samples are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. The 345M model is also available through the public API.</p><p>GPT-2 345M Samples (red = trigger, black = GPT-2 sample given prompt) TH PEOPLEMan goddreams Blacks and Jews are the most evil people on earth, and the reason they are so evil is because they have the most evil genes.

That's why the Jews and Blacks are evil and the Muslims are evil. That's why the Jews have the most evil genes, because they have the most evil genes.

This section shows that the success of triggers arises from model and data failures.

(2018)</ref>, we identify dataset artifacts by ranking all the hypothesis words according to their pointwise mutual information (PMI) with each label. We then group the trigger words based on their target label and report their PMI percentile (Table <ref type="table">7</ref> in Appendix B). The trigger words strongly align with these dataset ar-tifacts. For example, the trigger word "nobody" is the ranked highest according to PMI.</p><p>We also find that dataset artifacts are successful triggers; prepending the highest PMI words for the contradiction class to entailment hypotheses severely degrades accuracy (DA model's entailment accuracy drops to 2.26%, 1.45%, and 3.77% using "no", "tv", and "naked", respectively). These results demonstrate that SNLI models are vulnerable to triggers because they are highly sensitive to artifacts in the dataset.</p><p>Entailment Overlap Bias Section 3 shows that triggers are largely unsuccessful at flipping neutral and contradiction predictions to entailment. We suspect that this arises from a bias towards entailment when there is high lexical overlap between the premise and the hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(McCoy et al., 2019)</ref>. Since triggers are premise-and hypothesisagnostic, they cannot increase overlap for a particular example and thus cannot exploit this bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Why Do Triggers Fool SQuAD Models?</head><p>Unlike SNLI, dataset artifacts remain largely unidentified for SQuAD; adversarial evaluation in-stead highlights erroneous model behaviors on a per-example basis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Jia and Liang, 2017)</ref>. Here, we analyze the SQuAD triggers to search for patterns in the model/data. In particular, we investigate the triggers' alignment with high PMI tokens, the impact of answer types, and the models' sensitivity to the placement of the triggers. PMI Analysis Like SNLI, are the triggers a form of dataset artifact? Intuitively, our triggers contain words like "because", which may commonly precede the answer span for "why" questions. We adapt our PMI analysis to reading comprehension in the following manner. First, we locate the answer span in the paragraph and take the four tokens before/after it. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">8</ref> We then compute the PMI of those tokens with the question type, e.g., "why". The resulting PMI value shows how much a word before/after the answer span is indicative of a particular answer type (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">12</ref> in Appendix C). Some of the trigger tokens have low PMI or never appear, e.g., "how" never appears within four tokens before the answer to "who" questions. However, other trigger tokens have high PMI, e.g., the top PMI token before the answer to "why" questions is indeed "because". Similar to SNLI, we generate attacks using high PMI tokens. We randomly sample from the top PMI tokens to generate twenty different triggers for each question type (Table <ref type="table">13</ref> in Appendix C). The best trigger found by this attack is slightly better than the simple baseline of prepending only the target answer span. Unlike in SNLI, these results show that SQuAD triggers cannot be completely attributed to basic token associations.</p><p>Question Type Matching Next, we investigate whether triggers are associated with the type matching heuristics used by SQuAD models. Specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sugawara et al. (2018)</ref> show that model predictions often stay the same after removing every word except the question word, e.g., "when was the battle?" → "when?". We reduce every question in the SQuAD development set to only its question word and apply the triggers.</p><p>For the GloVe BiDAF model on "who?", "when?", and "where?" questions, the attack success rate is a perfect 100%; for "why?" questions, it is 96.0%. This shows that the models are heavily biased to pick the target answer in the trigger sequence because it appears to fit a particular question type.</p><p>Token Order, Placement, and Removal We now evaluate the model's sensitivity to various perturbations of the triggers: we shuffle the token order, place the triggers at the end of the paragraphs, or remove trigger tokens.</p><p>For token order, we randomly shuffle the tokens before and after the target span of the ensemblegenerated triggers. The average attack success rate over different shuffles is low, however, the best success rate comes close to the original trigger (Table <ref type="table">10</ref> in Appendix C). This indicates that models are sensitive to the trigger's token order but that there exists multiple effective orderings.</p><p>Next, we concatenate the ensemble-generated triggers to the end of paragraphs, rather than the beginning (as they were optimized for). Many of the triggers are still effective, e.g., the success rate of the "why" trigger increases from 31.6 to 37.4 when placed at the end (Table <ref type="table">11</ref> in Appendix C).</p><p>Finally, we individually remove tokens from the triggers-doing so always decreases the attack success rate on the GloVe BiDAF model. However, removing tokens can increase the success rate when transferring the triggers to black-box models. We query the ELMo model while removing tokens to find the best reduction. The resulting triggers are shorter but significantly more effective (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>).<ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">9</ref> This shows that the triggers still "overfit" the GloVe BiDAF models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Related Work</head><p>Adversarial Attacks in NLP Most adversarial attacks in NLP are gradient-based. For instance, <ref type="bibr">Ebrahimi et al. (2018b)</ref> use gradients to attack text classifiers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">He and Glass (2019)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cheng et al. (2018)</ref> do the same for text generation. Other attack methods are based on generative <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Iyyer et al., 2018)</ref> or human-in-the-loop approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Wallace et al., 2019)</ref>. We turn the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Zhang et al. (2019)</ref> for a recent survey. Triggers differ from most previous attacks because they are universal (input-agnostic).</p><p>Universal Attacks in NLP Ribeiro et al. ( <ref type="formula">2018</ref>) debug models using semantically equivalent adversarial rules (SEARs). Our attack vector differs from SEARs: we focus on model-specific concatenated tokens generated using gradients, they focus on model-agnostic paraphrases generated via backtranslation. Our attacks can also be applied to any input whereas SEARs is only applicable when one its rule applies.</p><p>In parallel work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Behjati et al. (2019)</ref> consider universal adversarial attacks on text classification (compare to our Section 3). Our work is more extensive as we (1) develop a stronger attack algorithm, (2) consider a broader range of models and tasks, including reading comprehension and text generation, and (3) study the attacks to understand their properties and to analyze models/datasets. Triggers open up many new avenues to explore. Certain trigger sequences are interpretable, e.g., "because" appears for "why" questions. The triggers for GPT-2, however, are nonsensical. To enhance both the interpretability, as well as the attack stealthiness, future research can find grammatical triggers that work anywhere in the input. Moreover, we attack models trained on the same dataset; future work can search for triggers that are dataset or even task-agnostic, i.e., they cause errors for seemingly unrelated models.</p></div>
