<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>With the formalization of the notions of algorithm and computable function in the first half of the twentieth century, and the subsequent development of computability theory, there has been increasing interest in recent decades in investigating the effective content of mathematics. In this paper, we are concerned with the connection between two branches of this effective mathematics program: computable model theory and computable algebra. We assume the reader is familiar with basic concepts of computability theory, model theory, and algebra; standard references are <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[21]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[28]</ref>, respectively.</p><p>One of the main concerns of computable model theory is the study of computabilitytheoretic properties of countable structures. We will always assume we are working with computable languages. We will denote the domain of a structure A by |A|. (We will not always use calligraphic letters for structures, so A may denote a different structure, usually one isomorphic to A.) Let us for the moment focus on computable structures.</p><p>1.1 Definition. A structure A is computable if both |A| and the atomic diagram of (A, a) a∈|A| are computable. If, in addition, the n-quantifier diagram of (A, a) a∈|A| is computable then A is n-decidable, while if the full first-order diagram of (A, a) a∈|A| is computable then A is decidable.</p><p>An isomorphism from a structure M to a computable structure is called a computable presentation of M. We often abuse terminology and refer to the image of a computable presentation as a computable presentation. If M has a computable presentation then it is computably presentable.</p><p>Whenever a structure with a particularly interesting computability-theoretic property is found, it is natural to ask whether similar examples can be found within well-known classes of algebraic structures, such as groups, rings, lattices, and so forth. As an example, let us consider the computable dimension of computable structures, which is a special case of the following definition. (Here and below, degree means Turing degree.)</p><p>1.2 Definition. Given a degree d, the d-computable dimension of a computably presentable structure M is the number of computable presentations of M up to d-computable isomorphism. If M has d-computable dimension 1 then it is d-computably categorical.</p><p>For an ordinal α, 0 α -computably categorical structures are usually called ∆ 0 α+1categorical structures. An equivalent definition of ∆ 0 β -categoricity, which also works for limit ordinals β, is that a computably presentable structure is ∆ 0 β -categorical if any two of its computable presentations are isomorphic via a ∆ 0 β isomorphism. It is easy to construct computable structures with computable dimension 1 or ω. Indeed, most familiar structures, and even all members of many familiar classes of structures, have computable dimension 1 or ω. For example, Nurtazin <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[34]</ref> showed that all decidable structures fall into this category. Goncharov <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[8]</ref> later extended this result to 1-decidable structures, and there have been several other well-known algebraic classes of structures for which similar results have been proved.</p><p>1.3 Theorem (Goncharov; Goncharov and Dzgoev; Metakides and Nerode; Nurtazin; LaRoche; Remmel). All structures in each of the following classes have computable dimension 1 or ω: algebraically closed fields, real closed fields, Abelian groups, linear orderings, Boolean algebras, and ∆ 0 2 -categorical structures. The result for algebraically closed and real closed fields is implied by the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[34]</ref>; the result for algebraically closed fields was also independently proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[32]</ref>. The result for Abelian groups appears in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[10]</ref>, that for linear orderings independently in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[13]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[37]</ref>, and that for ∆ 0 2 -categorical structures in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[11]</ref>. The result for Boolean algebras appears in full in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[12]</ref>, though it is implicit in earlier work of Goncharov and, independently, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[29]</ref>.</p><p>In most cases, these results were proved via structure theorems, that is, theorems that connect computability-theoretic properties of structures in the relevant classes to their structural properties. For example, a linear ordering with finitely many pairs of adjacent elements is computably categorical, while one with infinitely many such pairs has infinite computable dimension. The methods in this paper can be seen as the development of a nonstructure theory for computable model theory, in the same sense that, for instance, the study of Borel completeness provides such a theory for descriptive set theory. We will comment on this further below.</p><p>In light of results such as those mentioned above, an important question early in the development of computable model theory was whether there exist computable structures with finite computable dimension greater than 1. This question was answered positively by Goncharov <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[9]</ref>.</p><p>1.4 Theorem <ref type="bibr">(Goncharov)</ref>. For each n &gt; 0 there is a computable structure with computable dimension n.</p><p>Further investigation led to examples of computable structures with finite computable dimension greater than 1 in several classes of algebraic structures. In each case, the proof consisted of coding families of computably enumerable (c.e.) sets with a finite number of computable enumerations (up to a suitable notion of computable equivalence of enumerations) in a sufficiently effective way.</p><p>1.5 Theorem (Goncharov; Goncharov, Molokov, and Romanovskii; Kudinov). For each n &gt; 0 there are structures with computable dimension n in each of the following classes: graphs, lattices, partial orderings, 2-step nilpotent groups, and integral domains.</p><p>The results for partial orderings and (implicitly) graphs appear in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[9]</ref>, and the result for lattices is an easy consequence of the results in that paper. The result for 2-step nilpotent groups (which improves a result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[10]</ref>) appears in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[15]</ref>, and that for integral domains in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[27]</ref>.</p><p>We now turn to the other computability-theoretic properties of structures with which this paper is concerned, and give examples of the kinds of results we would like to show remain true when we restrict our attention to certain classes of algebraic structures. For more thorough treatments of these and related results, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[24]</ref> or the articles in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[6]</ref>.</p><p>One way to understand the differences between noncomputably isomorphic computable presentations of a structure M is to compare (from a computability-theoretic point of view) the images in these presentations of additional relations on the domain of M, that is, relations that are not the interpretation in M of relation symbols in the language of M. The study of relations on computable structures began with the work of Ash and Nerode <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[2]</ref>, who were concerned with relations that maintain some degree of effectiveness in different computable presentations of a structure.</p><p>1.6 Definition. Let U be a relation on the domain of a computable structure A and let C be a class of relations. We say that U is intrinsically C on A if the image of U in any computable presentation of A is in C.</p><p>A different way to approach the study of relations on computable structures, introduced by <ref type="bibr">Harizanov and Millar,</ref> is to look at the degrees of the images of a relation in different computable presentations of a structure.</p><p>1.7 Definition. Let U be a relation on the domain of a computable structure A. The degree spectrum of U on A, which is denoted by DgSp A (U ), is the set of degrees of the images of U in all computable presentations of A.</p><p>It is easy to give examples of relations on computable structures whose degree spectra are singletons or infinite. Harizanov <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[16]</ref> was the first to give an example of an intrinsically ∆ 0 2 relation with a two-element degree spectrum that includes 0. This was improved by Khoussainov and Shore <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[23]</ref> as follows.</p><p>1.8 Theorem (Khoussainov and Shore). For each n &gt; 0 there exists an intrinsically c.e. relation U on the domain of a computable structure A of computable dimension n such that DgSp A (U ) consists of n distinct c.e. degrees, including 0.</p><p>The n = 2 case of the above theorem is also due to Goncharov and Khoussainov <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[14]</ref>. The following result was also proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[23]</ref>.</p><p>1.9 Theorem (Khoussainov and Shore). For each computable partial ordering P there exists an intrinsically c.e. relation U on the domain of a computable structure A such that (DgSp A (U ), T ) ∼ = P. If P has a least element then we can pick A and U so that 0 ∈ DgSp A (U ). Later, Hirschfeldt <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[18]</ref> and Khoussainov and Shore <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[25]</ref> independently obtained the following strengthenings of the previous two theorems.</p><p>1.10 Theorem (Hirschfeldt; Khoussainov and Shore). Let a 0 , . . . , a n-1 be c.e. degrees. There exists an intrinsically c.e. relation U on the domain of a computable structure A of computable dimension n such that DgSp A (U ) = {a 0 , . . . , a n-1 }.</p><p>1.11 Theorem <ref type="bibr">(Hirschfeldt)</ref>. Let {A i } i∈ω be a uniformly c.e. collection of c.e. sets. There exists an intrinsically c.e. relation U on the domain of a computable structure A such that DgSp A (U ) = {deg(A i ) : i ∈ ω}.</p><p>A related issue is the question of what happens to the computable dimension of a computably categorical structure when it is expanded by finitely many constants. Millar <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[33]</ref> showed that, with a relatively small additional amount of decidability, computable categoricity is preserved under expansion by finitely many constants.</p><p>1.12 Theorem <ref type="bibr">(Millar)</ref>. If A is computably categorical and 1-decidable then any expansion of A by finitely many constants remains computably categorical.</p><p>However, preservation of categoricity does not hold in general, as was shown by Cholak, Goncharov, Khoussainov, and Shore <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[4]</ref>.</p><p>1.13 Theorem (Cholak, Goncharov, Khoussainov, and Shore). For each k &gt; 0 there exist a computably categorical structure A and an a ∈ |A| such that (A, a) has computable dimension k.</p><p>In fact, as shown by Hirschfeldt, Khoussainov, and Shore <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[19]</ref>, not even finiteness of computable dimensionality is always preserved under expansion by a constant.</p><p>1.14 Theorem (Hirschfeldt, Khoussainov, and Shore). There are a computably categorical structure A and an a ∈ |A| such that (A, a) has computable dimension ω.</p><p>Another important topic in computable model theory is studying the complexity of the isomorphisms between different computable presentations of a structure. We say that a computable structure is strictly ∆ 0 α -categorical if it is ∆ 0 α -categorical but not ∆ 0 β -categorical for any β &lt; α. The following result was proved by Ash in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[1]</ref>.</p><p>1.15 Theorem (Ash). For each computable limit ordinal δ (including δ = 0) and each n ∈ ω, there is a strictly ∆ 0 δ+2n -categorical well-ordering.</p><p>The work of computable model theory is not restricted to computable structures, of course. When a countable structure is not computably presentable, it is of interest to find out just how far from being computably presentable it is. One way to measure this is to look at the degrees of presentations of the structure.</p><p>1.16 Definition. Let d be a degree. A structure A with computable domain is dcomputable if the atomic diagram of (A, a) a∈|A| is d-computable. The degree of A, denoted by deg(A), is the least degree d (which always exists) such that A is d-computable.</p><p>An isomorphism from a structure M to a (d-computable) structure with computable domain is called a (d-computable) presentation of M. We often abuse terminology and refer to the image of a (d-computable) presentation as a (d-computable) presentation. In particular, when we refer to the degree of a presentation, we always mean the degree of the image, rather than that of the isomorphism. If M has a d-computable presentation then it is d-computably presentable.</p><p>A countable structure M is relatively computably categorical if any two presentations</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M, M of M are isomorphic via a (deg(M ) ∨ deg(M ))-computable isomorphism.</formula><p>Every countable structure is isomorphic to a structure with computable domain. Therefore, whenever we mention a countable structure we assume that it has computable domain, so that it may be thought of as a presentation of itself.</p><p>1.17 Definition. The degree spectrum of a countable structure A, which is denoted by DgSp(A), is the set of degrees of presentations of A.</p><p>As shown by Knight <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[26]</ref>, in all nontrivial cases, the degree spectrum of a countable structure is closed upwards.</p><p>1.18 Definition. A countable structure A is trivial if for some finite set S of elements of |A|, every permutation of |A| that keeps the elements of S fixed is an automorphism of A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.19">Theorem (Knight).</head><p>If A is a nontrivial countable structure then DgSp(A) is closed upwards.</p><p>Trivial structures are not very interesting from the point of view of computable model theory, and obviously cannot occur within certain classes of structures, such as rings of characteristic 0. Thus we will restrict our attention to nontrivial structures.</p><p>Any set that is computable in every nonzero degree is in fact computable, but as shown independently by Slaman <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[39]</ref> and Wehner <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[41]</ref>, the analogous fact is not true of structures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.20">Theorem (Slaman; Wehner</head><p>). There is a structure A that has presentations of every degree except 0. (In other words, DgSp(A) = D -{0}, where D is the set of all degrees.)</p><p>In the original proofs of Theorems 1.8-1.11, 1.13, and 1.14, the structures in question were directed graphs, and the relations mentioned in Theorems 1.8-1.11 were unary. The structures in the proofs of Theorem 1.20 had more complicated signatures, but could easily be modified to be directed graphs (for instance, by the method outlined in Appendix A). It is natural to ask, in the spirit of what was done for structures of finite computable dimension, for which theories these theorems remain true if we require that A be a model of the given theory. Our main result gives a partial answer to this question.</p><p>The following condition on a theory T is clearly sufficient for the theorems mentioned in the previous paragraph, as well as other similar results, to remain true when we restrict our attention to models of T .</p><p>1.21 Definition. A theory T is complete with respect to degree spectra of nontrivial structures, effective dimensions, expansion by constants, and degree spectra of relations if for every nontrivial countable graph G there is a nontrivial A T with the following properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">DgSp(A) = DgSp(G).</head><p>2. If G is computably presentable then the following hold. The terminology adopted in Definition 1.21 suggests that a theory satisfying this definition should still satisfy it if "every nontrivial countable graph G" is replaced by "every nontrivial countable structure G". This is indeed the case, since it is not hard to code a countable structure into a countable graph in a highly effective way. We give such a coding in Appendix A.</p><p>We can now state our main result.</p><p>1.22 Theorem. Let T be any of the following theories: symmetric, irreflexive graphs; partial orderings; lattices; rings (with zero-divisors); integral domains of arbitrary characteristic; commutative semigroups; and 2-step nilpotent groups. Then T is complete with respect to degree spectra of nontrivial structures, effective dimensions, expansion by constants, and degree spectra of relations. In particular, Theorems 1.8-1.11, 1.13-1.15, and 1.20 remain true if we require that A T . Furthermore, Theorems 1.8-1.11 remain true if we also require that U be a submodel of A.</p><p>Notice that, by Theorem 1.3, this result cannot be extended from partial orderings to linear orderings, from lattices to Boolean algebras, or from commutative semigroups and 2-step nilpotent groups to Abelian groups. A natural open question is what is the situation for fields. It is not even known whether there exist fields of finite computable dimension greater than 1. Of course, some of the theorems mentioned in our main result do not involve finite computable dimension, and thus could in principle still hold for some of the classes mentioned in Theorem 1.3. For instance, in the case of linear orderings, Hirschfeldt <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[17]</ref> has shown that Theorem 1.8 does not hold, but whether Theorem 1.20 holds is still an open question (see <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> for a discussion of this question).</p><p>The rest of this paper is dedicated to the proof of Theorem 1.22. Most of the cases are handled by coding graphs with the desired properties into models of the given theories in a way that is effective enough to preserve these properties. This approach is much simpler and more general than attempting to adapt the original proofs of the relevant theorems. Furthermore, our codings are sufficiently effective to make similar results that might be proved for graphs in the future carry over to the classes of structures mentioned in Theorem 1.22 without additional work.</p><p>As mentioned above, our results fit into a framework that has become important in several areas of mathematical logic and theoretical computer science, namely the study of dichotomies between structure theory, represented here by results such as Theorem 1.3, and nonstructure theorems, the latter often proved by coding structures that are known to be "as complicated as possible" into the particular structures being studied. In model theory, interpretations of various kinds have long been used to transfer model-theoretic properties from classes of structures in which they are easy to determine to other classes in which they are less obvious. One example is Mekler <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[31]</ref>. In descriptive set theory, the study of Borel reducibilities and Borel completeness has received much attention in recent years, for example in Friedman and Stanley <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[7]</ref>, Hjorth and Kechris <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[20]</ref>, and Camerlo and Gao <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[3]</ref>. A recent survey is Kechris <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[22]</ref>. Another example of the use of codings to show that certain phenomena that can occur in general already occur in what would seem to be a much more restricted setting is the work of Peretyat'kin <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[35]</ref> on finitely axiomatizable theories, which touches on both classical and computable model theory. Probably best-known of all, of course, is the use of highly effective reducibilities in complexity theory to show that certain problems are complete for various complexity classes, which is modeled on the use of reducibilities to prove index set results in computability theory.</p><p>In all the examples mentioned above, uncovering the correct notions of reducibility is essential. In Sections 2 and 4, we present sufficient conditions for a coding of a graph into a structure to be effective enough for our purposes. These conditions will be useful in all cases except that of nilpotent groups, in which, instead of coding graphs, we code rings into nilpotent groups. Even in this case, the properties of the coding that must be verified are very similar to those in our general conditions.</p><p>Section 3 deals with undirected graphs, partial orderings, and lattices, Section 4 with rings, Section 5 with integral domains and commutative semigroups, and Section 6 with 2-step nilpotent groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">A Sufficient Condition</head><p>In this section, we give a sufficient condition for a coding of a graph into a structure to be effective enough for our purposes. This condition is far from being the most general one we could give, but it is sufficient for our needs. It corresponds to an especially effective version of interpretations of theories (in the standard model-theoretic sense) in which equality is interpreted as equality. In Section 4, we will present a generalization of this condition which corresponds to interpretations in which equality is interpreted as an equivalence relation. (See chapter 5 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[21]</ref> for more on interpretations of theories.) We begin with a few definitions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Definition</head><formula xml:id="formula_1">. A relation U on a structure M is invariant if for every automorphism f : M ∼ = M we have f (U ) = U .</formula><p>2.2 Definition. Let d be a degree. A d-computable defining family for a structure M is a d-computable set of existential formulas ϕ 0 ( a, x), ϕ 1 ( a, x), . . . such that a is a tuple of elements of |M|, each x ∈ |M| satisfies some ϕ i , and no two elements of |M| satisfy the same ϕ i . Because we will be dealing with arbitrary presentations, rather than only computable ones, we will need to consider the relativized version of the notion of intrinsic computability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Definition.</head><p>A relation U on the domain of a structure A is relatively intrinsically computable if for every presentation f : A ∼ = A, the image f (U ) is computable in deg(A). Now let G be a nontrivial, countable directed graph with edge relation E and let A be a countable structure. Assume that there exist relatively intrinsically computable, invariant relations D(x) and R(x, y) on the domain of A and a map G → A G from the set of presentations of G to the set of presentations of A with the following properties. (We will use the notation</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">D(A G ) instead of D A G to emphasize that we think of D(A G ) as a subset of |A G |.) (P0) For every presentation G of G, the structure A G is deg(G)-computable.

(P2) If f : D(A) 1-1 --→ onto D(A) is such that R(x, y) ⇔ R(f (x), f (y)) then f can be extended to an automorphism of A.

Let A and G be computable presentations of A and G, respectively, and let f :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">A ∼ = A G . Then f is deg(f D(A))-computable. Proof. It is enough to show that f -1 is deg(f D(A))-computable. Given x ∈ |A G |, find an i ∈ ω such that A G ϕ i ( a, b i , x), where ϕ i ( a, b i , x) is as in (P3). By definition, x is the only element of |A G | that satisfies ϕ i . Thus there exists a unique y ∈ |A| such that A ϕ i (f -1 ( a), f -1 ( b i ), y), and f -1 (x) = y. Since both A G and A are computable, f -1 is deg(f D(A))-computable.</formula><p>2.5 Lemma. Let A and G be computable presentations of A and G, respectively. Suppose that there exists a map f : D(A)</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">1-1 --→ onto D(A G ) such that R A (x, y) ⇔ R A G (f (x), f (y)) for each x, y ∈ D(A).

Since A and A G are both presentations of A, there exists an isomorphism h :</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">A ∼ = A G . Let k = h D(A). Then c = f •k -1 is a one-to-one map from D(A G ) onto itself such that R A G (x, y) ⇔ R A G (c(x), c(y)) for each x, y ∈ D(A G ). So, by (P2), c can be extended to ĉ : A G ∼ = A G . Now let f = ĉ • h. Then f : A ∼ = A G and f D(A) = f • k -1 • k = f . Lemma 2.4 implies that f is deg(f )-computable. 2.6 Lemma. If G and G are computable presentations of G and h : G ∼ = G is an isomorphism then there exists a deg(h)-computable isomorphism f : A G ∼ = A G such that f D(A G ) = g -1 G • h • g G . Proof. Let f : D(A G ) 1-1 --→ onto D(A G ) be defined by f = g -1 G • h • g G . Clearly, f is deg(h)-computable. Furthermore, for each x, y ∈ D(A G ) we have R A G (x, y) ⇔ E G (g G (x), g G (y)) ⇔ E G ((h • g G )(x), (h • g G )(y)) ⇔ R A G (f (x), f (y)).

Conversely, if n 0 = 0 then</p><formula xml:id="formula_57">x 2 = n 2 5 + p i=0 n 2 i+6 a + 2 n 3 n 4 + n 3 n 5 + n 5 p i=0 n i+6 + p i=0 j p : E G (i, j) n i+6 n j+6 b + n 2 3 d 2 , (4.2)</formula><p>and hence x 4 = 0, so x ∈ P if and only if n 0 = 0. It will be clear from this fact that all the elements that we consider below are in P .</p><p>We will need to consider several elements with square equal to a. It follows easily from (4.2) that these are all of one of the forms n 1 a+n 2 b+n 4 d 2 ±c i or n 1 a+n 2 b+n 4 d 2 ±e. Note in particular that this means that if x 2 = a then x 3 = 0. Equation (4.2) also shows that every element of P 2 is of the form ka + lb + md 2 , where k, m ∈ ω and l ∈ Z. Furthermore, if x ∈ P then x 3 = n 3 3 b, so f (b) = lb for some l ∈ Z. This is only possible if l = ±1. Since every element of P 2 can be expressed as a sum of nonnegative integer multiples of a and d 2 and an integer multiple of b, and P 2 is invariant, it follows that every element of P 2 can be expressed as a sum of nonnegative integer multiples of f (a) and f (d 2 ) and an integer multiple of f (b) = ±b. In particular, a and d 2 can be so expressed. This means that if we write f (a) = ka + lb + md 2 then k, m 1.</p><p>We will now show that f (a) = a. Let x be any element of the form (4.1) such that x 2 = f (a) = ka + lb + md 2 , where k, m 1. As mentioned above, for any y ∈ |A G |, if y 2 = a then y 3 = 0, so it must be the case that x 3 = 0. Now, k = n 2 5 + p i=0 n 2 i+6 , l = 2(n 3 n 4 + n 3 n 5 + n 5 p i=0 n i+6 + p i=0 j p:E G (i,j) n i+6 n j+6 ), and m = n 2 3 . So if k = 0 then n i+6 = 0 for all i p, which means that if at least one of l and m is nonzero then n 3 = 0, and hence x 3 = 0. If k = 1 then either n 5 = ±1 and n i+6 = 0 for all i p; or n 5 = 0, n i+6 = ±1 for some i m, and n j+6 = 0 for all j = i. Again, if at least one of l and m is nonzero then n 3 = 0, and hence x 3 = 0. Since x 3 = 0, this means that l = m = 0, which implies that k = 1. In other words, f (a) = a.</p><p>We will now show that f (b) = b. Take i 0 , i 1 , and i 2 such that E(i 0 , i 1 ), E(i 0 , i 2 ), and E(i 1 , i 2 ). For each j 2, the fact that c 2 i j = a implies that f (c i j ) is of one of the forms n j,1 a + n j,2 b + n j,4 d 2 + ε j c i j or n j,1 a + n j,2 b + n j,4 d 2 + ε j e, where ε j = ±1. The second case cannot happen for two different j, k 2, since then f</p><formula xml:id="formula_58">(c i j )f (c i k ) = ±a = ±b = f (b) = f (c i j c i k ). So we can assume without loss of generality that f (c i j ) is of the form n j,1 a + n j,2 b + n j,4 d 2 + ε j c i j for j = 0, 1. Now, c i 0 c i 1 = c i 0 c i 2 = c i 1 c i 2 , so we must have f (c i 0 )f (c i 1 ) = f (c i 0 )f (c i 2 ) = f (c i 1 )f (c i 2 ), which implies that ε 0 = ε 1 = ε 2 . This means that f (b) = f (c i 0 )f (c i 1 ) = c i 0 c i 1 . Since f (b) = ±b and c i 0 c i 1 = -b, it follows that f (b) = b.</formula><p>We will now show that D, R, and Q are invariant. As in the case of a, if we write f (d 2 ) = ka + lb + md 2 then k, m 1. But, since f (a) = a and f (b) = b, it follows that k must equal 0, since otherwise we could not express d 2 as a sum of nonnegative integer multiples of f (a) and f (d 2 ) and an integer multiple of f (b). This implies that m = 1. If</p><formula xml:id="formula_59">x 2 = d 2 + lb then x is of the form n 1 a + n 2 b ± d + n 4 d 2 , so f (d) is of this form. But f (d) 3 = b, so f (d) is of the form n 1 a + n 2 b + d + n 4 d 2 .</formula><p>From this fact it follows easily that f (d)x = dx for all x ∈ |A G | such that x 2 = a. Furthermore, e 2 = a and de = b, so f (e) must be of the form n 1 a + n 2 b + n 4 d 2 + e, from which it follows that f (e)x = ex for all x ∈ |A G | such that x 2 = a. This is enough to show that D, R, and Q are invariant.</p><p>Fix a deg(G)-computable presentation of A G for which the map g G that sends ma + nb + c i to i, for each m, n ∈ Z and i ∈ ω, is deg(G)-computable, and identify A G with this presentation.</p><p>Let G be a presentation of G.

As mentioned above, the fact that x 2 = a implies that x is of one of the forms</p><formula xml:id="formula_61">n 1 a + n 2 b + n 4 d 2 ± c i or n 1 a + n 2 b + n 4 d 2 ± e.</formula><p>The second case cannot happen, because e(n</p><formula xml:id="formula_62">1 a + n 2 b + n 4 d 2 ± e) = ±e 2 = ±a = b, so x = n 1 a + n 2 b + n 4 d 2 ± c i . Since d(n 1 a + n 2 b + n 4 d 2 ± c i ) = n 4 b, it follows that n 4 = 0. Since ex = b, it follows that x = n 1 a + n 2 b + c i . This shows that D(A G ) = dom(g G ).</formula><p>Now suppose that x, y ∈ D(A G ).

Consider the deg(G)-computable set of formulas {x = t i : i ∈ ω}. Every x ∈ |A G | satisfies some formula in this set, with no two elements satisfying the same formula, so this set is a deg(G)-computable defining family for (A G , z) z∈D(A G ) .

On pages 225-226 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[30]</ref>, property (G5) is used to show that the mapping</p><p>We now come to the analog of Lemma 2.7. The fact that M is not invariant creates a difficulty, but this can be remedied by showing that, for any computable presentation G of G R and any automorphism h of G, there exists a computable automorphism g of G such that g(a G i ) = h(a G i ) for i = 1, 2. (See Lemma 6.14. The situation is similar to what we encountered in Section 4 in connection with Lemma 4.7.)</p><p>All the results obtained so far in this section are true for any ring R with unit of characteristic p. To prove the statement in the previous paragraph we need to impose the following additional conditions on R.</p></div>

But this means that f (w ) = f (w), so w = w.</p><p>6.11 Lemma. R = R.</p><p>Proof. It is enough to show that r is invertible in R. Let s and t be such that h((0, 0, s)) = (0, 0, 1) and h((0, 0, t)) = (0, 0, r 2 ). Recall that h((0, 0, 1)) = (0, 0, r).</p><p>It is easy to check that f (a 1 ) = a 1 , f (a 2 ) = a 2 , f ((0, 0, 1)) = (0, 0, 1), f ((0, 0, s)) = (0, 0, 1 r ), and f ((0, 0, t)) = (0, 0, r). Since M G R ((0, 0, 1 r ), (0, 0, r), (0, 0, 1)), it follows from Lemma 6.10 that M G R ((0, 0, s), (0, 0, t), (0, 0, 1)), so that s • t = 1.</p><p>Thus s is invertible in R. By our assumption on R, this means that s = k for some 1 k p -1. Let n &lt; p be such that kn = 1 mod p. It follows that (0, 0, r) = h((0, 0, 1)) = h((0, 0, k) n ) = (h((0, 0, k))) n = (0, 0, 1) n = (0, 0, n), so r is invertible in R.</p><p>The above argument obviously holds for any computable presentation R of R in place of R. With R = R G , the following lemma follows from Lemma 6.8.</p><p>6.12 Lemma. Let G be a computable presentation of G R and let h be an automorphism of G. There exists a computable automorphism g of G such that g(a G i ) = h(a G i ), i = 1, 2.</p><p>6.13 Corollary.
