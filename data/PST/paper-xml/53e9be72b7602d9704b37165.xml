<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We developed a novel computer-aided detection (CAD) algorithm called the surface normal overlap method that we applied to colonic polyp detection and lung nodule detection in helical computed tomography (CT) images. We demonstrate some of the theoretical aspects of this algorithm using a statistical shape model. The algorithm was then optimized on simulated CT data and evaluated using a per-lesion cross-validation on 8 CT colonography datasets and on 8 chest CT datasets.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>For detecting lung nodules, Giger et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> developed a two-dimensional (2-D) multilevel thresholding detection algorithm that creates a tree structure of image components. Rules were applied to shape features in order to identify nodules. 94% per-nodule sensitivity was achieved with 1.25 false positives (FPs) per patient. Armato et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> applied multilevel thresholding and a rolling ball algorithm toward detecting lung nodules. Shape and attenuation features were classified using linear discriminant analysis and the algorithm achieved 70% per-nodule sensitivity with 1.5 FPs per axial section. Brown et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> have presented an algorithm for both detection and surveillance of lung nodules in CT. Region-growing and morphological operators were used to create candidate locations. Attenuation, location, volume, and shape features were matched to model objects in a semantic net with fuzzy membership that serves as a generic a priori anatomic model. In the initial detection task, 86% per-nodule sensitivity was achieved with 11 FPs per patient. Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> used both genetic algorithm-based and semicircular template matching to identify initial candidates and attenuation, shape, and gradient feature rules to reduce FPs. They achieved 72% per-nodule sensitivity with 31 FPs per patient. Erberich et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> applied the Hough transform (HT) for both 2-D circles and 3-D spheres using a rule-based classifier and achieved 30%-40% per-nodule sensitivity with a "large amount of false positive nodules."</p><p>Several approaches to colonic polyp CAD in CT colonography have also been proposed. Vining et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> developed a method that measures abnormal wall thicknesses using heuristics. They report 73% per-polyp sensitivity with a range of 9-90 FPs per patient. Other approaches have analyzed the morphology of the mucosal surface. Summers et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> have developed a method that uses size, attenuation, and curvatures calculated with convolution-based partial derivatives to find polyps. They achieved 64% per-lesion sensitivity with 3.5 FPs per patient. Yoshida et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> use shape index and curvedness (computed with partial derivatives), directional gradient concentration, and quadratic discriminant analysis. Using both prone and supine datasets, they achieve 100% per-patient sensitivity with 2.0 FPs per patient (per-polyp sensitivity not stated). Kiss et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> combined surface normal and sphere fitting methods to achieve 100% per-polyp sensitivity with 8.2 FPs per patient. In addition, secondary CAD algorithms that are designed to reduce the FP rate of primary CAD algorithms have been proposed. Göktürk et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> applied support vector machines to shape and attenuation features to reduce FPs and reported a 50% increase in specificity at a constant sensitivity level. Acar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> have applied edge displacement fields to reduce FPs and reported a 23% increase in specificity at a constant sensitivity level. Both of these FP reduction methods were evaluated using initial versions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> of the work presented in this paper.</p><p>These previously described CAD algorithms for both lung nodules and colonic polyps have achieved varying levels of accuracy although they all leave room for improvement. Additionally, many of them represent analogous approaches, using similar feature vectors and similar classifiers. The purpose of this work was to create a new and effective approach to CAD by developing new features and by optimizing them toward two clinical applications.</p><p>We present in this paper 1) a novel multi-purpose CAD algorithm that we call the surface normal overlap (SNO) method, 2) a theoretical analysis of this algorithm using a statistical model of anatomic shape, 3) an optimization and analysis method for this algorithm using simulated CT data and a per-lesion crossvalidation, and 4) preliminary evaluations of the detection performance of the CAD algorithm in lung nodule and colonic polyp detection, using the free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) paradigm. We propose to use this algorithm as the first step in a larger overall detection scheme and, thus, we strive for high sensitivity at a reasonable FP rate, thus allowing secondary FP reduction algorithms, such as some of those described above, and/or radiologist visualization to improve specificity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. CAD ALGORITHM</head><p>The following sections describe the processing steps of the SNO method, of which the end result is a list of the coordinates of the center of each suspicious region, sorted in decreasing prospect of being a lesion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Pre-Processing and Segmentation</head><p>Because both colonic polyps and lung nodules are generally not much denser than water, high density structures (e.g., bone) are removed by clamping voxel intensities to be no greater than that of water. Next, the CT volume data are made isotropic by tri-linear interpolation to 0.6 mm 0.6 mm 0.6 mm voxels to produce . This is done in order to reduce any bias between lesions at different orientations and also to reduce any bias between datasets with different voxel sizes.</p><p>Next, segmentation is performed automatically to identify either the colon lumen or the lung parenchyma. A binary image, , is created by thresholding all air intensity voxels including air outside the body. This is followed by a negative masking of all air intensity voxels morphologically connected to any of the edges of the data volume (air outside the body), thus leaving only voxels with air density within the body. In the case of CT colonography, the inferior portions of the lungs are usually captured and are removed using a negative mask of a 3-D region-filling seeded with air intensity regions with a width or depth of greater than 60 mm in the most superior axial slice. Finally, small air pockets ( in the colon datasets, in the lung datasets) are also negatively masked from .</p><p>Next, a binary image, , is derived from and is used to limit the remaining computations to voxels near the air-tissue interfaces in the colon or lung. This 1) reduces computational requirements and 2) eliminates FPs arising within soft tissue structures outside the region of interest. begins as the surface voxels of and is then morphologically dilated by 5 mm to produce a thickened region that contains the air-tissue interfaces of interest (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, rows 1-2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Gradient Orientation</head><p>The gradient orientation step computes the image gradient vector, , at high-contrast edges in order to determine the 3-D orientation of the image surface normals. We have modified the Canny edge detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> to limit calculations to only those voxels contained in . Each partial derivative is computed using two one-dimensional (1-D) Gaussian convolution kernels and one 1-D derivative-of-Gaussian convolution kernel, which are parameterized by , , and (standard deviations) with , , and discrete samples respectively. Our implementation additionally takes advantage of the greatly reduced search space, , by only computing these separable 1-D convolutions where strictly necessary. The minimum locus of voxels necessary to correctly calculate the 1-D convolutions is calculated by morphologically dilating . Using to denote the floor function (greatest integer less than or equal to ), the convolutions are performed as follows. The separable convolutions in the direction are calculated for each voxel in dilated voxels in the direction and then dilated voxels in the -direction. The separable convolutions in the -direction are then calculated for each voxel in dilated voxels in the -direction. The separable convolutions in the -direction are then calculated for each voxel in . Nonmaximum suppression and hysteresis thresholding (thresholds of 100 HU and 200 HU) follow the separable convolutions The resulting surface normal vectors, which point inward into the tissue, are denoted as .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Surface Normal Overlap</head><p>The surface normal overlap step is critical for detecting lesions. Each voxel in accumulates a score proportional to the number of surface normals that pass through or near it. Generally speaking, both colonic polyps and lung nodules tend to have some convex regions on their surfaces and thus, the inward pointing surface normal vectors, , near these features tend to intersect or nearly intersect within the tissue. Pulmonary vessels in the lungs and haustral folds in the colon also have convex surfaces, but since they have a dominant curvature along a single direction (as opposed to high curvature in two directions as is common on the surfaces of polyps and nodules), the score for vessels and folds is generally less than that for nodules and polyps. A 3-D array, denoted , counts the number of surface normals that pass through or near to each voxel in (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, row 3). Each voxel in corresponds to a voxel in . In order to limit the contributions from normal vectors from very distant structures, the length of the projected surface normal vectors was defined as , the scale of the largest spatial features of interest. Prior to any evaluation, was set to 10 mm. Providing robustness to variations from perfectly spherical objects is critical to the success of this algorithm in real patient data. Our algorithm provides robustness both in the radial direction (objects with nonconstant distance from surface points to center) and in the transverse direction (objects with nonuniform magnitude of curvature). Robustness in the radial direction is provided by the fact that normal vectors can intersect at dif-ferent distances from the surface (up to ), thus allowing many nonspherical but roughly globular objects to have a significant response.</p><p>Robustness in the transverse direction is provided by allowing skewed surface normal vectors (those that do not intersect but nearly intersect) to be additive in . This is accomplished by projecting cylinders of a finite width in the direction of the surface normal rather than by projecting line segments. Because surface normals that come closer to intersecting are assumed to be more likely generated by the same convex surface patch, the projected cylinders are given a transverse profile that gradually decreases in intensity at greater radial distances, thereby providing robustness in the transverse direction and again, allowing many nonspherical but roughly globular objects to have a significant response. The profile was chosen to be Gaussian with a scale of . For computational efficiency, the entire surface normal overlap step is implemented by first scan converting (i.e., discretizing into voxels) a line segment for each surface normal in and summing it into . Then, the Gaussian profile of the cylinders is achieved by a sequence of linearly separable 1-D convolutions to produce . The convolution is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> The discrete kernels are chosen so that , , and include sampled at 0.6 0.6 0.6 mm to cover 95% of the Gaussian curve. The computational burden imposed by the convolution calculation is minimized using morphological operators similar to the gradient orientation calculation, as in Section II-B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Candidate Lesion Selection</head><p>The local maxima of are selected as candidate lesion locations. However, complex anatomic structures with multiple convex surface patches may generate multiple local maxima.</p><p>was defined to be the smallest scale of the features that might generate distinct local maxima and was set to 10 mm prior to any evaluation. Local maxima are considered in descending order, and if a local maximum occurs within of an already accepted local maximum, the lesser value is assumed to be part of the same structure and is rejected. After this spatial filtering, the remaining local maxima are sorted in decreasing order and recorded as the potential lesion locations. The score for a potential lesion at location is given by , and we refer to this as a "CAD hit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS</head><p>In this section, we present several theoretical analyzes of SNO. To facilitate them, we have created a statistical anatomic shape model that balances the complex variability of human anatomy with sufficient simplicity to allow for analytic insight. We then use this theoretical model to compare the behavior of the SNO method to the 3-D Hough transform for spheres in distinguishing lung nodules from vessels and colonic polyps from haustral folds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Stochastic Anatomic Shape Model</head><p>This shape model begins with a simple parametric shape and then adds stochastically-governed variation in order to produce realistic anatomic shape. The nominal model for lung nodules and colonic polyps are spheres and hemispheres, respectively, while the nominal model for vessels and haustral folds are cylinders and half-cylinders, respectively. In order to account for anatomic variability, infinitesimal surface patches on the surface are then allowed to simultaneously vary from their nominal position at radius in an implicit manner that preserves continuity between patches. In this analysis, radial position deviation is represented with random variable , and surface normal direction variation is represented with random variable (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p><p>We model each surface patch as deviating from its nominal position in the radial direction with a Gaussian distribution on , with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of . We then model each surface normal vector as deviating from its nominal direction with two independent and identically distributed Gaussian variables, and , with zero mean and standard deviation of . These two displacements are in the plane perpendicular to the radial direction, a unit distance away from the surface normal. For convenience, we represent directional deviation by its magnitude , which has a Rayleigh distribution, and by its angle, , which has a uniform distribution on the interval [0, ). The probability density functions for and are parameterized by and , respectively, and are given by and Thus, the variability of a shape of radius is represented by the random variables , , and .</p><p>As each surface patch varies from its nominal position and direction, the solid angle subtended by the patch stays constant but the area of the patch changes due to 1) the magnification factor at different radial distances and 2) a cosine inverse proportionality as it is tilted away from its nominal direction. We let be the area of the nominal surface patch and be the area of each surface patch after variation. For spheres, the surface patches are indexed by , and the relationship is . For cylinders, the surface patches are indexed by around the axis of the cylinder and by down the length of the axis, and the relationship is . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Model Parameter Estimation</head><p>In order to make quantitative comparisons using this theoretical model, the parameters controlling the degree of variation from the nominal shapes, and , were estimated directly from the patient datasets. This process involved: 1) performing edge detection on the datasets; 2) identifying the surface normal vectors that belong to the nodule, polyp, vessel or fold; 3) finding the nominal sphere or cylinder that fit those surface normal vectors; 4) computing the value of and for each surface normal; and 5) estimating and from those sample populations.</p><p>All polyps 5 mm and larger and all nodules 3 mm and larger were used for parameter estimation. From each of the 8 colon datasets and each of the 8 lung datasets, eight folds or vessels were selected prospectively and manually and then, selected for parameter estimation. Thus, our analyzes included 18 polyps and 64 selected folds in the colon, and 84 nodules and 64 selected vessels in the lung. Section V-C contains full details about these datasets.</p><p>Edge detection was performed as described in Section II-B. Isolation of the surface normals belonging to the structure of interest was performed as follows. The center of the structure of interest, , was chosen manually, and all surface normal vectors whose bases were further than two radii away were eliminated. Next, if a line segment between and a surface normal intersected an air intensity voxel ( ), the surface normal was eliminated. Then, surface normals pointing more than 90 away from were eliminated. Finally, the largest contiguous region of surface normals was kept as belonging to the structure of interest. This algorithm was quite successful in isolating the structures of interest; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> provides some examples.</p><p>The nominal shape was derived using a least squares fit of a sphere or cylinder to the bases of the surface normals (i.e., directional information was not used), which leads to an estimate of . Using this nominal shape, both and were computed directly for each surface normal. Finally, was estimated using the maximum likelihood estimate. However, was estimated differently because a few surface normals were at nearly 90 away from either the center of the sphere or the axis of the cylinder, leading to nearly infinite values of and, thus giving inaccurate estimates due to MLE sensitivity to outliers. This happened particularly around the "skirt" of polyps and haustral folds where it is difficult to make binary decisions about what belongs to the polyp or fold and what does not. Instead, we estimated by using the method-of-moments but substituting the more robust median estimator for the mean. By setting the empirical median, , equal to the point at which the CDF is 0.5, we get which leads to</p><p>The results of the parameter estimation are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Algorithm Models</head><p>In order to understand the theoretical performance of the SNO algorithm and to compare it to the Hough transform for spheres, we applied this anatomic shape model for polyps, folds, nodules, and vessels with differing degrees of variation from the nominal model. Specifically, we compared the expectation of the CAD </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Theoretical Comparison of SNO and HT</head><p>In order to compare the theoretical performance of the SNO and HT algorithms, we varied the shapes from perfect spheres and cylinders to more realistic anatomic shapes. The range of realistic shape variability was estimated as described in  nodules as a function of lesion size, revealing that larger lesions lead to a smoothly increasing response with SNO. However, HT produces a response that varies tremendously for nearly identical lesion sizes. The estimated values of and were then used to produce a CAD score for each shape. These scores are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were performed to test the difference between TP and FP scores. For SNO, there were significant differences between polyp and fold (</p><p>) and between nodule and vessel ( ). However, for HT, there were not significant differences between polyp and fold ( ) nor between nodule and vessel ( ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. GRADIENT ORIENTATION OPTIMIZATION</head><p>Using simulated CT phantoms, we optimized the gradient orientation kernel scale parameters, , , and , in order to yield the most accurate gradient orientations. This step was critical because errors in estimating the gradient direction can diminish surface normal overlap in . The selection of values for , , and is particularly important because too small a value will lead to errors from noise and very localized perturbations in the surface whereas too large a value will lead to insensitivity to smaller lesions. The optimization of the parameter is described later in Section V.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Phantom Model and Error Metric</head><p>A series of hemispherical phantom objects were "scanned" using software that simulates CT scanning including forward projections, partial volume effects, correlated CT noise, helical interpolation, and filtered backprojection reconstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The simulations were performed with a 3-mm slice thickness, pitch of 2 ( ), 0.7 0.7 mm pixels in plane, and 1-mm reconstruction interval. For each phantom, a water-equivalent density sphere was embedded halfway into a water-equivalent density, randomly oriented, flat wall to simulate a prototypical colonic polyp or prototypical lung nodule on the chest wall. The diameters of the spheres, , ranged from 5 to 15 mm at 1-mm increments, chosen to demonstrate the effects of changes in size from the prototypical 10-mm lesion. For each sphere size, there were 10 phantoms, each with a different wall orientation, randomized subvoxel offset, and randomized CT detector noise, leading to a total of 110 phantoms.</p><p>The error metric used to evaluate the accuracy of gradient orientations, , was defined to be the mean perpendicular distance from the surface normal vector, , to the true center of the sphere. In order to include only detected gradient orientations from the hemisphere and not those from the flat wall, only gradients located within 1.05 of the sphere center entered into the calculation of (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Gradient Orientation Kernel Scale</head><p>We let and executed the CAD algorithm with all three simultaneously varying from 0.05 to 4.0 mm in 0.05-mm increments. The errors, from the 10 phantoms at a given and , were then averaged. The results of this optimization are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>, showing that led to the least error across all lesion sizes.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Gradient Orientation Kernel Anisotropy</head><p>We also investigated the effects of anisotropic resolution in helical CT gradient orientations. In general, helical CT has lower effective resolution through-plane than in-plane, regardless of reconstruction interval. Thus, one might expect setting would compensate for this effect. To test this, we fixed (based on the results of the first optimization) and let vary from 0.05-4.0 mm in 0.05-mm increments. The errors, , from the 10 phantoms at a given and , were then averaged, as in Section III-B. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> plots the results of this optimization, showing that the accuracy of the gradient orientations on tri-linearly interpolated anisotropic data is almost independent of the anisotropy of the kernel scale between ratios of 0.5 and 2.0. As a result, all subsequent experiments were carried out with .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CAD PERFORMANCE EVALUATION</head><p>This section describes two experiments that were performed in order to evaluate the performance of the CAD algorithm in detecting real colonic polyps and in detecting solid lung nodules. In Section III, the goal of the gradient orientation optimization was to produce as accurate gradient orientations as possible using the error metric. However, the goal of optimizing the cylinder scale, , is to maximally differentiate between lesions and FPs. A wider cylinder scale will increase the robustness to deviations from perfectly spherical shapes but will also decrease the differentiability between lesions and FP structures. Since this effect is dependent on the variability of true lesion and FP shapes, the CT simulations were insufficient. Instead, a cross-validation was performed to evaluate lesion detection performance with prospectively chosen values of .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Cross-Validation</head><p>When cross-validation is used to evaluate a classifier, the dataset is split into sets (sometimes referred to as "folds"). The classifier is trained de novo on sets and then evaluated on the remaining independent set(s); this is repeated for all possible divisions into sets and sets and the results are averaged in a reasonable manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. This type of evaluation gives an unbiased estimate of performance and has a lower standard error than traditional holdout methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. In this evaluation, we chose . However, in a detection problem such as this, splitting the dataset (CAD hits) into sets at the granularity of lesions is problematic because the result of training (e.g., selecting based on the training sets) changes the dataset (e.g., CAD hit locations) and thus, changes the sets themselves.</p><p>In order to retain the independence between training and test sets, the sets were selected on the basis of distinct anatomic features rather than on the basis of CAD hit locations. The locus of all CAD hit locations was computed for each possible value of . Two CAD hits were considered to be the same anatomic feature if they were within 10 mm of each other. The sets (7 in the colon dataset, 46 in the lung dataset) were made to be disjoint by having one true positive (TP) lesion and equal numbers of randomly selected FP anatomic features. CAD hits were distributed among the sets according to the anatomic feature to which they belonged. Thus, to within the 10-mm constraint, no two sets contained CAD hits on the same anatomic feature.</p><p>For an error metric in training, we selected the value of that maximized , which we define as the normalized partial area under the FROC curve from 0-20 FPs/dataset and from 90%-100% sensitivity.</p><p>indicates perfect detection performance whereas indicates that less than 90% of lesions are detected by the time 20 FPs/dataset is reached. The geometric interpretation of is that it is an area that represents how close the curve comes to perfect performance (i.e., 100% sensitivity at 0 FPs/dataset).

Automated CAD Scoring</head><p>Because the results of a CAD evaluation can be especially numerous, we implemented a method for automatically scoring each CAD hit as either a TP or FP, thus eliminating subjectivity and clerical errors. Because there is some spatial variance in what is declared to be the center of a lesion in the gold standard (Section V-C2), the scoring algorithm must allow for some small amount of spatial mis-registration between gold standard lesion locations and TP CAD hits. Thus, we defined any CAD hit as a TP if it was within half the lesion's measured diameter from the lesion's measured center. Lesion diameters were measured manually from the CT images during the setting of the gold standard using a multi-planar digital caliper tool.</p><p>To determine the overall performance, all of the CAD hits within the test sets were determined to be a TP or a FP and then pooled and sorted in descending order of score. In the event that multiple CAD hits are scored as TP for a given lesion, only the highest scoring hit was considered a TP; lower scoring hits were ignored. TP CAD hits on lesions below the size range of interest were not considered FPs nor did they increase the sensitivity. At a given score threshold, sensitivity was calculated as the percentage of lesions within the size range of interest that had been identified by a TP CAD hit above that score threshold. The FP rate was calculated as the total number of FP CAD hits divided by the number of datasets.</p></div>

Detection Evaluation 1) Data Collection:</head><p>Colon: From a database of 116 CT colonography exams performed at either Stanford University or at the San Francisco VA hospital, 8 exams were selected for this study in order to include a reasonably large number of colonic polyps and to balance the number of patients with and without large polyps. Exams with excessive image artifact or retained water were excluded. Case selection was done without regard to polyp conspicuity or shape. These 8 patients were given rectal air contrast and scanned in the supine position with single-or multidetector helical CT (GE HiSpeed/CTi or LightSpeed, General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) with effective section width of 2.5-3.75 mm and 50% overlapping reconstruction. Immediately following CT scanning, each patient also underwent fiber-optic colonoscopy (FOC). These results were correlated to the CT images with a total of 7 "clinically significant" polyps (</p><p>) found in 4 of 8 patients and a total of 11 small polyps (5-9 mm) found in 3 of 8 patients. A wide range polyp shapes were present in the datasets 2) Gold Standard: Colon: A study coordinator with extensive experience in CTC and blinded to CAD results carefully reviewed the CTC data and recorded the location and diameter of polyps found by FOC into the gold standard database. Only one significant polyp (measured as 15 mm by FOC) was unable to be located in the CT images, most likely due to retained water. A total of 10 small polyps (1 was 8 mm and 9 were 5-6 mm measured by FOC) were unable to be located in the CT images.</p><p>Lung: The gold standard in the chest was established by consensus of two radiologists interpreting the axial CT data. Both the location and diameters of nodules were recorded into the gold standard database.</p><p>The CAD algorithm was then executed on the 8 colon and 8 lung datasets using the optimized gradient orientation from Section III and cross-validated as described above.</p><p>3) Results: Colon: In the colon datasets, the value of based on the cross-validation training sets was in the range 2.2-2.6 mm with a mean of 2.5 mm. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> shows the range of these values of compared to the performance on all of the datasets ( computed on all datasets over all values of , not just on training sets). Note that the latter is shown in this figure for reference only and was never used in training or evaluation. The mean performance across the test sets in detecting "clinically significant" colonic polyps was as follows.</p><p>in diameter were detected at 4.6 FPs/dataset. 90% were detected at 6.0 FPs/dataset. 95% were detected at 6.5 FPs/dataset. 100% were detected at 7.0 FPs/dataset. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref> shows a FROC plot of these results.</p><p>A manual analysis of the 50 highest scoring FPs in each colon dataset (400 total) revealed that 86% were due to haustral folds, 5% were due to the colon wall between adjacent loops, 4% were due to a failure in segmentation in one dataset that captured the air trapped in the blanket beneath the patient. Finally, each of the following classes contributed 1% or less: stool, insufflation catheter, small bowel, and the ileocecal valve.</p><p>Lung: In the lung datasets, the value of based on the cross-validation training sets was in the range 0.6-0.8 mm with a mean of 0.6 mm (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>). The mean performance across the test sets in detecting "clinically significant" solid lung nodules was as follows. in diameter were detected at 1.3 FPs/dataset. 90% were detected at 5.6 FPs/dataset. 95% were detected at 63 FPs/dataset. 100% were detected at 165 FPs/dataset (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>).</p><p>A manual analysis of the 50 highest scoring FPs in each lung dataset (400 total) revealed that 69% were due to pulmonary vessels, 13% were due to bronchi, 6% were due to vessels or bronchi in the mediastinum, 6% were calcified nodules, 2% were due to bulges on the pleural surface, 2% were small indeterminate opacities, and each of the following classes contributed 1% or less: mass, metal artifact, and a single 2.9-mm noncalcified nodule.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. CAD Algorithm</head><p>The surface normal overlap algorithm was originally inspired by the Hough transform for spheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> but differs in some important ways. First, the array which counts the number of overlapping or nearly overlapping surface normals is similar to the Hough transform accumulator array in that it sums "votes" for objects that could produce those normals, but it does not require all of the votes to correspond to a single parameterized sphere, as does the Hough transform. Second, the Hough transform, in its various forms, is highly specific for one type of shape (e.g., spheres). Even the variant known as the generalized Hough transform, which avoids parametric representations, requires a specific model. This specificity is desirable when the shape to be detected can be precisely defined in advance, but the specificity is problematic when it cannot. In contrast, the SNO algorithm does not use an explicit model of a single type of shape, but instead uses an implicit model to represent an entire gamut of shapes much larger than the set of spheres detected by the Hough transform for spheres. This property is extremely important when the objects to be detected can have significant variability in shape such as with lung nodules or colonic polyps. Rather than specifying the exact shape to be detected, the SNO algorithm defines a fuzzy constraint on surface normal orientation in order to define the varied set of shapes to be detected, both by allowing angular mismatches (transverse robustness) and by allowing edges at different radial distances to sum (radial robustness). For comparison, Erberich et al. have applied the 3-D Hough transform for spheres toward lung nodule detection in CT but reported only 30%-40% sensitivity at a high FP rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The voxel intensity clamping pre-processing step is used to eliminate edges due to bone but will also make calcified lung nodules have a similar response as noncalcified nodules. While the presence of calcification in lung nodules may help distinguish between benign and malignant nodules, the goal of this algorithm is detection, not classification. For classification purposes, the original voxel intensities can easily be restored following the detection of suspicious regions.</p><p>While we have presented and evaluated the SNO CAD method as being preceded by a specific segmentation scheme, we emphasize that the only purposes of the segmentation step are 1) to reduce computation by targeting only anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) and 2) to eliminate hits from regions disjoint from the anatomical ROI. Unlike some other CAD approaches requiring extremely accurate segmentation (e.g., inclusion of juxtapleural nodules), the goal of our segmentation step is to provide a volumetric region that contains all possible image edges that could be due to the presence of lesions and not to fully delineate their edges. Thus, our relatively simplistic segmentation algorithm is sufficient and is not limiting factor in the overall detection performance. However, it is possible that gross errors in segmentation could adversely affect performance. In colon CAD, for example if the most superior axial slice contains a large enough portion of the transverse colon, it could be assumed to be lung and, therefore, erroneously eliminated. Thus far, we have not had any such gross failures in segmentation; however, we note that, ultimately, any robust segmentation method could be substituted for ours. One limitation of this study is that we did not formally optimize the pre-processing and segmentation as we did many of the other parameters of the algorithm. This stage was used to create a thick boundary region containing easily detected high contrast edges and it was very robust to a wide variety of parameter settings. Our experience was that these parameters had little effect or no on the overall performance.</p><p>We also emphasize that, at this stage, this algorithm is not intended to be used independent of visual interpretation by a radiologist. At the present stage of development (and perhaps, well into the foreseeable future), this type of algorithm should be seen as an aid for improving radiologist performance. In this regard, although our algorithm generated more than one FP (on average) per data set in order to achieve high sensitivity, it does not indicate that the majority of patients will have FP detections once reviewed in conjunction with a radiologist. If many of the FP hits are recognized as such and are discarded by the radiologist, overall performance may be acceptable. However, this remains to be shown by future evaluations.</p><p>The difference in performance between detecting colonic polyps and detecting lung nodules is of interest. Although neither FROC curve completely dominates the other, the "average" lung nodule (i.e., near 50% sensitivity) was easier to detect (i.e., at fewer FPs/dataset) than the "average" colonic polyp, despite the relatively larger size of polyps. The difference is partially accounted for by the difference in lesion morphology-the gross shape of the nodules (not at the fine level of spiculations) in these datasets tended to be more globular than that of polyps, which tended to have more complex surfaces due to the gradual rise and fall of the mucosal surface around a polyp. This may be attributable to the relatively isotropic growth pattern of lung nodules in lung parenchyma as compared to the anisotropic growth pattern of colonic polyps, which emerge and protrude from the colon wall. Another factor in the different detection performance is that nodules usually have detectable edges on their entire surface compared to polyps, which have detectable edges only on their outer half and thus, have half the number of overlapping surface normals. The difference in performance is also accounted for by the completely dissimilar sources of FPs (e.g., background anatomy), which are very different in both appearance and quantity between the lung and colon.</p><p>The hardest to find nodules (i.e., near 100% sensitivity) were, however, harder to find than the hardest to find polyps. This was due to several exceptional nodules whose appearance was different than most other nodules. These four nodules accounted for the range of sensitivity from 91%-100% and were the only nodules that were detected at greater than 8 FPs/dataset. These included three small, elliptical nodules on the chest wall (6 3 mm, 7 4 mm, and 6 4 mm) and one very irregular nodule at the apex of the lung (20 16 mm); see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">12</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Theoretical Analysis</head><p>While both SNO and HT perform similarly on perfect spheres and cylinders, the results shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5(a)-(b</ref>) demonstrate that HT rapidly loses its ability to distinguish between sphere and cylinder as the shape variability approaches realistic levels. On the other hand, SNO retains its shape discrimination under much greater levels of shape variability. Additionally, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5(c</ref>) demonstrates that slight differences in size can lead to very different HT scores due to the interaction of and .</p><p>The theoretical CAD scores (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>) suggest that SNO is better able to distinguish between the presented shapes than does HT. While HT is valued for its specificity to the parametric model (e.g., spheres), it is the ability to detect shapes that vary from the nominal shape model that makes SNO particularly suitable for discriminating anatomic shapes.</p><p>In the theoretical shape model, note that statistical dependence between neighboring surface patches is not assumed since this would be very unrealistic. However, not assuming independence limits the analysis to the score at the center of the shape instead of the maximum score over the whole shape (expectation of maximum is not maximum of the expectations, see Appendix ). Although HT scores may be higher off center, this would require nearly spherical subportions of the surface in order to yield higher scores off center.</p><p>The theoretical model does assume independence between and . The correlation coefficients between and for polyps, folds, nodules, and vessels were 0.22, 0.04, 0.06, , respectively. Although very low correlation does not rule out dependence, it helps to justify this first order approximation.</p><p>In our formulation of the SNO method, we have chosen to project Gaussian-profiled cylinders for each surface normal. One limitation of this work is that this choice of projected shape may not be optimal with respect to the theoretical model. This is an area of future work on this algorithm that we plan to investigate further.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. CAD Algorithm Optimization</head><p>The design of the simulated phantoms was an important factor in the optimization of the gradient orientations. The simulated hemisphere on a flat wall model was designed to find the optimal balance between the decreased noise from greater blurring and the increased sensitivity to small objects from lesser blurring. The use of a hemisphere on a flat wall is an obvious first order model for colonic polyps. We had originally tried optimizing gradient orientations for lung nodules on spherical phantoms. However, it was necessary to include other background anatomic structures (e.g., flat wall) in order to realistically model the effect of a large gradient orientation convolution kernel (large ). With a large kernel, nearby but distinct anatomic structures would contribute to the convolution and cause error in the gradient orientation. This was balanced against the effect of a small kernel, which had a decreased noise reduction benefit due to less blurring (small ).</p><p>The hemisphere on a flat wall also serves as a model for lung nodules in contact with the chest wall, which are not the most common type of lung nodule but are anecdotally more difficult to detect than contact-free nodules by this CAD algorithm. We chose to optimize the gradient orientation step for this type of lung nodule because we wanted the algorithm to perform as well as possible on these difficult to detect lesions.</p><p>The results of the gradient orientation kernel anisotropy optimization were initially unexpected by the authors. The Canny edge detector is designed so that the blurring is performed by the Gaussian and derivative of Gaussian kernels. Because most CT images are inherently blurred more in the longitudinal direction (i.e., -direction), we originally hypothesized that would compensate and produce more accurate gradient orientations. However, the experiment showed that this effect was nearly nonexistent on tri-linearly interpolated data. We have not tested the effect of using an anisotropic kernel on higher order interpolated data, which may yield different results.</p><p>There were several other algorithm parameters that were not formally optimized. For instance, the hysteresis thresholds used in edge detection were not optimized. However, in both the colon and lung, image contrast is excellent and edge detection was observed to be very robust. Also note that these thresholds do not affect the direction of detected gradients, which are only dependent on the convolution. Another example is , the length of the projected cylinder. We have anecdotally observed both polyp-to-fold and nodule-to-vessel distances to be typically 15-20 mm, greater than . Direct visualization of has demonstrated that cylinder overlap from neighboring structures is generally not a large problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. CAD Algorithm Evaluation</head><p>The results of this preliminary evaluation of lung nodule detection were based on a dataset with a large proportion of the nodules are due to one patient with metastatic disease (</p><p>). Although we cannot distinguish the performance of our algorithm on primary bronchogenic carcinoma from the performance on metastases, we believe that the detection of both primary and metastatic nodules is important. For those patients with pulmonary metastases secondary to colorectal cancer, many gynecological cancers, head and neck cancers, renal cell cancer, malignant melanoma, and sarcomas, pulmonary resection is an important primary therapy with a 5-year survival rate of 21%-68% <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Also, we note that we did not evaluate the efficacy of our algorithm for detecting ground glass opacities in the lung. Further studies are needed to evaluate the performance characteristics on various types of lesions.</p><p>A limitation of the evaluation of colonic polyp detection is that it uses only supine data. Generally, both prone and supine images are used for CT colonography, but we evaluated the algorithm using only supine images because the problem of matching CAD results between prone and supine images is still unsolved. Additionally, treating prone and supine images of the same patient as independent would violate the assumption of independence that allows the cross-validation estimate of performance to be unbiased. Another point regarding the polyp evaluation is that not all FOC determined polyps were found by the gold standard setter in the supine CT images ( ), probably due to retained water and/or other factors. Therefore, the CAD algorithm's failure to identify these polyps is not a failure of the algorithm (since they were not visible in the images) but rather a failure of the CT colonography patient preparation and/or data collection. Thus, they were not counted against the algorithm in this evaluation.</p><p>While cross-validation mitigates the problem of over-fitting to the data, it does not remove biases that may be present in the entire dataset. While effort was to avoid bias in the case selection, performance with this algorithm on other datasets may vary with factors such as patient population, image quality, scanner parameters, etc. Although a greater number of cases were available, we did not utilize the entire database for this evaluation because the cross-validation technique required executing the algorithm on each case over a large number of values of , which was computationally prohibitive. For binary classification problems, the area under the ROC curve, , has been widely used as a performance metric. Analogously, the area under the AFROC curve, , has been described as a performance metric for multiple detection problems. We experimented with calculated by a binormal FROC curve fitting procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> but found the curve fitting to be unreliable on this data. The FP image model assumes that the operator generally makes less than one FP per image. Data points much beyond one FP per image become nearly indistinguishable due to the Poisson assumption and thus, the fitted curves are most unreliable in this region even though it may be of greatest interest for evaluating a CAD algorithm that will subsequently be reviewed by a human reader. We chose to use partial area under the FROC curve as a cost function for training because it was not prone to curve fitting errors under parametric assumptions. This is analogous to the ROC partial area index <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In particular, we found that using a partial area index was important so that the training optimized for the hardest to find polyps and nodules rather than the average polyps and nodules.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Comparison to Other CAD Algorithms</head><p>The SNO method differs from many of the previously proposed lung nodule CAD algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> in that rather than using a variety of basic shape descriptors such as perimeter, area, volume, sphericity, compactness, elongation, etc., we focus on a single shape measure that is tuned for the specific application(s). Other approaches use some type of idealized shape model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> but achieve poorer performance, perhaps due to the lack of flexibility in such an explicit model rather than an implicit model that describes an entire gamut of shapes. The approach of McNitt-Gray et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> exemplifies another important aspect of computer-aided diagnosis, the classification between benign and malignant. While our work does not specifically address this problem, we envision our work as part of a larger overall CAD scheme that will at some point also include classification.</p><p>The approach of Vining et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> to polyp detection is notable because it attempts to detect polyps based on wall thickness rather than mucosal surface morphology. However, thus far, no other groups have reported success with this type of approach. The approaches of both Summers et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and of Yoshida et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> share in common the use of partial derivatives to compute principle curvatures. However, the differences in how they are combined and classified vary and may partially account for the differences in performance. Also, Yoshida et al.add gradient concentration (GC) and directional gradient concentration (DGC) in order to improve performance. These two measures also compute the confluence of gradient vectors toward a common point, although they are quite different than the SNO method in actual formulation. However, direct comparison of performance of GC and DGC to this work is difficult because many other features are combined and also, per-polyp sensitivity is not reported. Quantitative comparisons are precluded by differences in study designs and by the relatively small number of datasets used in both this work and other published works.</p><p>While most CAD algorithms are described for a single clinical application, the CAD algorithm described in this paper was found to be promising at more than one task. It performed favorably compared to many of the aforementioned CAD schemes although differences in patient populations, CT technology, and analysis methods preclude strict quantitative comparisons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>We have 1) developed a novel CAD algorithm, the surface normal overlap method, for both colonic polyp detection and solid lung nodule detection, 2) demonstrated the theoretical traits of this algorithm using a statistical shape model, 3) optimized its performance using a CT simulations and a per-lesion cross-validation method, and 4) provided a preliminary evaluation of its performance in both detection tasks,. The approach we have presented is generalized in that it is able distinguish between focal lesions such as polyps and solid nodules and background anatomy such as blood vessels and haustral folds.</p><p>While the CAD algorithm demonstrated in this paper has shown promise for both lung nodule and colonic polyp detection, we ultimately envision it as the first stage of a larger CAD scheme where a set of suspicious locations is passed on to a second stage, possibly comprised of more computationally intensive classifier(s) that would aim to decrease the FP rate.</p></div>
