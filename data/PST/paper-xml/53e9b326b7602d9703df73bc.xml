For a cone P, define a partial ordering ≤ with respect to P by x ≤ y if and only if yx ∈ P. We shall write x &lt; y to indicate that x ≤ y but x ̸ = y, while x ≪ y will stand for yx ∈ Int P. It can be easily shown that λ Int(P) ⊆ Int(P) for all positive scalar λ.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">2. d(x, y) = d(y, x) for all x, y ∈ X . 3. d(x, y) ≤ d(x, z) + d(y, z) for all x, y, z ∈ X .</formula><p>Then d is called a cone metric on X , and (X, d) is called a cone metric space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 2.2 ([1]</head><p>). Let (X, d) be a cone metric space. Let (x n ) be a sequence in X and x ∈ X . If for every c ∈ E with θ ≪ c, there is an N ∈ N such that d(x n , x) ≪ c for all n ≥ N, then (x n ) is said to be convergent and (x n ) converges to x and x is the limit of (x n ). We denote this by lim n→+∞ x n = x or x n → x as n → +∞. If for every c ∈ E with θ ≪ c there is an N ∈ N such that d(x n , x m ) ≪ c for all n, m ≥ N, then (x n ) is called a Cauchy sequence in X . The space (X, d) is called a complete cone metric space if every Cauchy sequence is convergent.</p><p>Let (X, d) be a cone metric space, f : X → X and x 0 ∈ X .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Main results</head><p>We start our work by showing that the commutativity of the two maps F : X × X → X and g : X → X and the continuity of g are not essential for the existence of a coupled coincidence point of F and g. Theorem 3.1. Let (X, ≼) be a partially ordered set and (X, d) be a cone metric space. Let F : X × X → X and g : X → X be two functions such that d(F (x, y), F (u, v)) ≤ ad(gx, gu) + bd(gy, gv) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> for all x, y, u, v ∈ X with gx ≼ gu and gv ≼ gy. Assume that F and g satisfy the following conditions: 1. F (X × X ) ⊆ g(X ), 2. g(X ) is a complete subspace of X , and 3. F has the mixed g-monotone property. Also, suppose that X has the following properties:</p><p>1. if a non-decreasing sequence x n → x, then x n ≼ x for all n, 2. if a non-increasing sequence x n → x, then x ≼ x n for all n.</p><p>If there exist x 0 , y 0 ∈ X such that gx 0 ≼ F (x 0 , y 0 ) and F (y 0 , x 0 ) ≼ gy 0 and if a + b ∈ (0, 1), then F and g have a coupled coincidence point.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Proof. Let x 0 , y 0 ∈ X such that gx 0 ≼ F (x 0 , y 0 ) and F (y 0 , x 0 ) ≼ gy 0 . Since F (X × X ) ⊆ g(X ), we can choose x 1 , y 1 ∈ X such that gx 1 = F (x 0 , y 0 ) and gy 1 = F (y 0 , x 0 ). Again since F (X × X ) ⊆ g(X ), we can choose x 2 , y 2 ∈ X such that gx 2 = F (x 1 , y 1 )</formula><p>and gy 2 = F (y 1 , x 1 ). Since F has the mixed g-monotone property, we have gx 0 ≼ gx 1 ≼ gx 2 and gy 2 ≼ gy 1 ≼ gy 0 . Continuing this process, we can construct two sequences</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">(x n ) and (y n ) in X such that gx n = F (x n-1 , y n-1 ) ≼ gx n+1 = F (x n , y n ) and gy n+1 = F (y n , x n ) ≼ gy n = F (y n-1 , x n-1 ). Let n ∈ N.</formula><p>Then by Inequality 1, we have </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">d(gx n , gx n+1 ) = d(F (x n-1 , y n-1 ), F (x n , y n )) ≤ ad(gx n-1 , gx n ) + bd(gy n-1 , gy n ), and d(gy n , gy n+1 ) = d(F (y n-1 , x n-1 ), F (y n , x n )) ≤ ad(gy n-1 , gy n ) + bd(gx n-1 , gx n ). Thus, d(gx n , gx n+1 ) + d(gy n , gy n+1 ) ≤ (a + b)(d(gx n-1 , gx n ) + d(gy n-1 , gy n )) ≤ (a + b)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">) ≤ (a + b) n (d(gx 0 , gx 1 ) + d(gy 0 , gy 1 )). Let m, n ∈ N with m &gt; n. Since d(gx n , gx m ) ≤ m-1 - i=n d(gx i , gx i+1 ) and a + b &lt; 1, we have d(gx n , gx m ) ≤ (a + b) n 1 -a -b (d(gx 0 , gx 1 ) + d(gy 0 , gy 1 )).</formula><p>Now, we show that (gx n ) is a Cauchy sequence in (X, d). Let θ ≪ c be given. Since c ∈ Int P, there is a neighborhood of θ</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">N δ (θ ) = {y ∈ E : ‖y‖ &lt; δ} where δ &gt; 0, such that c + N δ (θ ) ⊆ Int P.

Hence c - (a + b) N 1 1 -a -b (d(gx 0 , gx 1 ) + d(gy 0 , gy 1 )) ∈ c + N δ (θ ) ⊆ Int P.</formula><p>Thus we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">(a + b) N 1 1 -a -b (d(gx 0 , gx 1 ) + d(gy 0 , gy 1 )) ≪ c for all n ≥ N 1 . Therefore d(gx n , gx m ) ≤ (a + b) N 1 1 -a -b (d(gx 0 , gx 1 ) + d(gy 0 , gy 1 )) ≪ c for all m &gt; n ≥ N 1 .</formula><p>Hence we conclude that (gx n ) is Cauchy in g(X ). Similarly, we may show that (gy n ) is Cauchy in g(X ).</p><p>Since g(X ) is complete, we get that (gx n ) and (gy n ) are convergent sequences to some p and q in g(X ); respectively.

Choose k 1 , k 2 ∈ N such that d(gx n+1 , gx) ≪ c 2 ∀n ≥ k 1 and d(gx n+1 , F (x, y)) ≪ c 2 ∀n ≥ k 2 . Let k 0 = max{k 1 , k 2 }. Then d(gx, F (x, y)) ≪ c. Since c is arbitrary, we get d(gx, F (x, y)) ≪ c m ∀m ∈ N.</formula><p>By noting that c m → θ as m → +∞, we conclude that c m -d(gx, F (x, y)) → -d(gx, F (x, y)) as m → +∞. Because P is closed, we get -d(gx, F (x, y)) ∈ P. Thus d(gx, F (x, y)) ∈ P ∩ -P. Hence d(gx, F (x, y)) = θ. Therefore gx = F (x, y). Similarly, we may show that gy = F (y, x). Thus, (x, y) is a coupled coincidence point of F and g. Corollary 3.1. Let (X, ≼) be a partially ordered set and (X, d) be a cone metric space.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corollary 3.2 ([13]</head><p>). Let (X, ≼) be a partially ordered set and suppose that there exists a metric d in X such that (X, d) is a complete metric space.

Follows from Corollary 3.1 by taking g = i and noting that every metric space is a cone metric space. Theorem 3.2. Let (X, ≼) be a partially ordered set and (X, d) be a complete cone metric space. Let F : X ×X → X and g : X → X be two functions such that d(F (x, y), F (u, v)) ≤ ad(gx, gu) + bd(gy, gv)</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">(4)</formula><p>for all x, y, u, v ∈ X with gx ≼ gu and gv ≼ gy. Suppose that F has the mixed g-monotone property, F (X × X ) ⊆ gX , g is continuous and g commutes with F . Also, suppose that F is continuous or X has the following properties:</p><p>• (P 1 )if a non-decreasing sequence x n → x, then x n ≼ x for all n, • (P 2 )if a non-increasing sequence x n → x, then x ≼ x n for all n. If there exist x 0 , y 0 ∈ X such that gx 0 ≼ F (x 0 , y 0 ) and F (y 0 , x 0 ) ≼ gy 0 and if a + b ∈ (0, 1), then F and g have a coupled coincidence point.</p><p>Proof. As in the proof of Theorem 3.1, we can construct two Cauchy sequences (gx n ) and (gy n ) in X . Since (X, d) is complete, there are x, y ∈ X such that (gx n+1 ) converges to x and (gy n+1 ) converges to y. Since g is continuous, we have (ggx n+1 ) converging to gx and (ggy n+1 ) converging to gy. But</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">ggx n+1 = g(F (x n , y n )) = F (gx n , gy n ) and ggy n+1 = g(F (y n , x n )) = F (gy n , gx n ).</formula><p>First case, suppose that F is continuous, then we have (F (gx n , gy n )) converging to F (x, y) and (F (gy n , gx n )) converging to F (y, x). Thus, (ggx n+1 ) converges to F (x, y) and (ggy n+1 ) converges to F (y, x). Let θ ≪ c be given. Choose</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">k 1 , k 2 ∈ N such that d(ggx n+1 , gx) ≪ c 2 ∀n ≥ k 1 and d(ggx n+1 , F (x, y)) ≪ c 2 ∀n ≥ k 2 . Let k 0 = max{k 1 , k 2 }. Then d(gx, F (x, y)) ≪ c. Since c is arbitrary, we get d(gx, F (x, y)) ≪ c m ∀m ∈ N.</formula><p>By noting that c m → θ as m → +∞, we conclude that c m -d(gx, F (x, y)) → -d(gx, F (x, y)) as m → +∞. Because P is closed, we get -d(gx, F (x, y)) ∈ P. Thus d(gx, F (x, y)) ∈ P ∩ -P. Hence d(gx, F (x, y)) = θ . Therefore gx = F (x, y). Similarly, we may show that gy = F (y, x). Hence (x, y) is coincidence coupled point of F and g. Second case, suppose that X satisfies properties (P 1 ) and (P 2 ). Thus gx n ≼ x and y ≼ gy n for all n ∈ N. Hence</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">d(ggx n+1 , F (x, y)) = d(F (gx n , gy n ), F (x, y))</formula><p>≤ ad(ggx n , gx) + bd(ggy n , gy). Since (ggx n ) converges to gx and (ggy n ) converges to y, we get (ggx n ) converging to F (x, y). Similarly, we may show that (ggy n ) converges to F (y, x). By similar arguments as above, we may show that gx = F (x, y) and gy = F (y, x). Thus the pair (x, y) is a coupled coincidence point of F and g. Corollary 3.3 <ref type="bibr">([7]</ref>). Let (X, ≼) be a partially ordered set and (X, d) be a complete cone metric space. Let F : X × X → X and g : X → X be two functions such that d(F (x, y), F (u, v)) ≤ k 2 (d(gx, gu) + d(gy, gv)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> for all x, y, u, v ∈ X with gx ≼ gu and gv ≼ gy. Suppose that F has the mixed g-monotone property, F (X × X ) ⊆ gX , g is continuous and g commutes with F . Also, suppose that F is continuous or X has the following properties:</p><p>• (P 1 )if a non-decreasing sequence x n → x, then x n ≼ x for all n, • (P 2 )if a non-increasing sequence x n → x, then x ≼ x n for all n. If there exist x 0 , y 0 ∈ X such that gx 0 ≼ F (x 0 , y 0 ) and F (y 0 , x 0 ) ≼ gy 0 and if k ∈ (0, 1), then F and g have a coupled coincidence point. Using the fact that a + b &lt; 1, we get d(F (y, x), F (x, y)) = θ. Hence gy = F (y, x) = F (x, y) = gx. If gx 0 ≼ gy 0 , then gx n ≼ gy n for all n ∈ N ∪ {0}. The proof of this statement follows by induction and using the fact that F has the mixed g-monotone property. Thus, for n ∈ N, we get By noting that c m → θ as m → +∞, we conclude that c m -d(F (x, y), F (y, x)) → -d(F (x, y), F (y, x))as m → +∞. Because P is closed, we get -d(F (x, y), F (y, x)) ∈ P. Thus d(F (x, y), F (y, x)) ∈ P ∩ -P. Hence d(F (x, y), F (y, x)) = θ. Therefore gx = F (x, y) = F (y, x) = gx. Theorem 3.4. In addition to the hypothesis of Theorem 3.1 (resp. Theorem 3.2), suppose that for every (x, y), (x * , y * ) ∈ X , there exists (u, v) ∈ X × X such that (F (u, v), F (v, u)) is comparable to (F (x, y), F (y, x)) and (F (x * , y * ), F (y * , x * )). If (x, y) and (x * , y * ) are coupled coincidence points of F and g, then F (x, y) = gx = gx * = F (x * , y * ) and F (y, x) = gy = gy * = F (y * , x * ). Moreover, if F and g commutes, then F and g have a unique common fixed point, that is, there exists a unique pair (x, y) ∈ X × X such that x = gx = F (x, y) and y = gy = F (y, x).</p></div>

Following the proof of Theorem 3.1, there exists (x, y) ∈ X × X such that F (x, y) = gx = p and F (y, x) = gy = q. Thus the existence of a coupled coincidence point is confirmed.

Let u 0 = u, v 0 = v x 0 = x, y 0 = y, x * 0 = x * and y * 0 = y * . Since F (X × X ) ⊆ gX , we can construct sequences (gu n ), (gv n ), (gx n ), (gy n ), (gx * n ), and (gy * n ), such that  n+1 (d(gx, gu) + d(gy, gv)). Now, we show that (gu n+1 ) converges to gx in (X, d). Let θ ≪ c be given. Since c ∈ Int P, there is a neighborhood of θ</p><p>Thus we have</p><p>for all n ≥ N 1 . Thus gu n+1 converges to gx in (X, d). Similarly, we may show that gv n+1 converges to gy in (X, d).</p><p>Analogously, we can show that gu n+1 converges to gx * and gv n+1 converges to gy * in (X, d). Since the cone P is closed and (gu n+1 ) converges to gx and gx * , we get gx = gx * . Also, since the cone P is closed and (gv n+1 ) converges to gy and gy * , we get gy = gy * . Thus, we have that if (x, y) and (x * , y * ) are coupled coincidence points of F and g, then</p><p>Assume that F and g commutes, then</p><p>and gq = g(gy) = g(F (y, x)) = F (gy, gx) = F (q, p).</p><p>Hence the pair (p, q) is also a coupled coincidence point of F and g.
