<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In their original versions, nature-inspired search algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms and those based on swarm intelligence, lack a mechanism to deal with the constraints of a numerical optimization problem. Nowadays, however, there exists a considerable amount of research devoted to design techniques for handling constraints within a nature-inspired algorithm. This paper presents an analysis of the most relevant types of constraint-handling techniques that have been adopted with nature-inspired algorithms. From them, the most popular approaches are analyzed in more detail. For each of them, some representative instantiations are further discussed. In the last part of the paper, some of the future trends in the area, which have been only scarcely explored, are briefly discussed and then the conclusions of this paper are presented.</p></div>

Besides huge search spaces, noise in the objective function(s) and the complexity of the modeling process, the presence of constraints was pointed out. Constraints may cause the search to keep away the focus on optimization to just seeking a feasible (i.e., valid) solution. On the other hand, in their original versions, NIAs were designed to deal with unconstrained search spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. This was the main motivation to add constraint-handling techniques to NIAs aiming to guide the search to those regions with feasible solutions.</p><p>The problem of interest in this paper is the constrained numerical optimization problem (CNOP), which, without loss of generality, can be defined as to: * Corresponding author.

F comprises the set of all solutions which satisfy the constraints of the problems and it is called the feasible region. Both, the objective function and the constraints can be linear or nonlinear.

In fact, there are reviews focused only on repair methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, which are associated with constraint-handling techniques (although repairing solutions is more common in combinatorial optimization than in a numerical optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>). This document aims to update the review of the state-of-theart with the most significant contributions on constraint-handling techniques in the recent years, and also with a discussion of representative NIA-based approaches adopting such techniques to solve CNOPs (i.e., the present). This analysis is preceded by a classification of the most representative approaches included in previous reviews of the specialized literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> (i.e., the past). Based on this literature review, a prospective view with some future trends, which have been only scarcely tackled until now, is presented (i.e., the future). Due to the considerably high number of publications available on this topic, this review is not (and does not attempt to be) exhaustive. However, it presents the current flavor and tendencies in the resolution of CNOPs using NIAs.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 revisits the constraint-handling techniques proposed in the early days of this area. In Section 3 a number of novel proposals which have had high-impact in the area are summarized and discussed. After that, Section 4 includes a prospective view of the future paths of research on NIAs to solve CNOPs. Finally, Section 5 draws some conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The early years</head><p>In the previous reviews on nature-inspired algorithms for searching in constrained spaces, two classifications were proposed: one by Michalewicz and Schoenauer <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and another one by <ref type="bibr">Coello Coello [8]</ref>. Both taxonomies agreed on penalty functions and hybrid methods as two separated classes. Whereas the first one is kept in this paper (based on the permanent interest that remains on this type of constraint-handling technique), the second class is not considered here because it mainly groups combinations of NIAs with other types search algorithms (something which is beyond the scope of this paper). This new classification for earlier methods is based on constraint-handling mechanisms, whereas the search algorithm employed is discussed as a separate issue. The class of ''methods based on preserving feasibility of solutions'' by Michalewicz and Schoenauer was merged with Coello Coello's ''special representation and operators'' and ''repair algorithms'' into one single class simply called ''special operators'' (repair methods are seen in this paper as special operators designed to move an infeasible solution to the feasible region of the search space). The ''separation of objective function and constraints'' class by <ref type="bibr">Coello</ref> Coello is kept in this work and it includes those approaches classified by Michalewicz and Schoenauer as ''methods which make a clear distinction between feasible and infeasible solutions''. This type of techniques, such as penalty functions, are still very popular among researchers and practitioners. Finally, a particular category, called 'decoders'' was added because it covers the type of constraint-handling technique whose results were the most competitive in the early years of the field. The simplified taxonomy from the methods included in both surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> is the following:</p><p>1. Penalty functions 2. Decoders 3. Special Operators 4. Separation of objective function and constraints.</p><p>In the following subsections each of them is introduced and discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Penalty functions</head><p>Based on mathematical programming approaches, where a CNOP is transformed into an unconstrained numerical optimization problem, NIAs have adopted penalty functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, whose general formula is the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">φ(⃗ x) = f (⃗ x) + p(⃗ x) (4)</formula><p>where φ(⃗ x) is the expanded objective function to be optimized, and p(⃗ x) is the penalty value that can be calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">p(⃗ x) = m - i=1 r i • max(0, g i (⃗ x)) 2 + p - j=1 c j • |h j (⃗ x)|<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where r i and c j are positive constants called ''penalty factors''.</p><p>As can be noted, the aim is to decrease the fitness of infeasible solutions in order to favor the selection of feasible solutions. In Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>), the penalty value is added to the fitness of a solution because low values are preferred as expected in a minimization problem (as stated in Section 1). Unlike mathematical programming approaches, where interior and exterior penalty functions are employed, NIAs have mainly focused on the second type of approach, because the normal assumption is that the first generation of an NIA may contain only infeasible solutions.</p><p>Even though their implementation is quite simple, penalty functions require a careful fine-tuning of their penalty factors in order to determine the severity of the penalties to be applied, and these values are highly problem-dependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>The most simple penalty function is known as ''deathpenalty''. Under this scheme, infeasible solutions are assigned the worst possible fitness value or are simply eliminated from the optimization process <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</p><p>Based on the fact that a ''death-penalty'' keeps the search from using valuable information from the infeasible solutions, there are penalty-based constraint-handling techniques which can deal with them, but also focus on defining appropriate penalty factors.</p><p>There are penalty functions whose penalty factor values (c i and c j , i = 1, . . . , m and j = 1, . . . , m) remain fixed during all the process as those proposed by Kuri and Villegas-Quezada <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, Homaifar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, Hoffmeister and Sprave <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and Le Riche et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The main drawback of keeping fixed penalty factor values is the generalization of such type of approach, i.e., the values that may be suitable for one problem are normally unsuitable for another one. The use of time (usually the generation counter in a NIA) as a value that affects the penalty factor has also been also explored, among others, by Joines and Houck <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> Kazarlis and Petridis <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and Crossley and Williams <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Even the cooling factor of the simulated annealing algorithm has been employed to vary the penalty factors as in the approach proposed by Michalewicz and Attia <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, called GENOCOP II. Recalling from a previous comment in this section about the preference for exterior penalty functions in NIAs, in a dynamic penalty function, smaller values (i.e. soft penalties) are defined in the first steps of the optimization process so as to allow the algorithm to sample the search space and find its feasible region. In contrast, larger values (i.e., severe penalties) are adopted in the last part of the search in order to preserve the feasible solutions previously found and to speed up convergence towards the global optimum. The main disadvantage of dynamic penalty functions is that they require parameters for the dynamic tuning of the penalty factors. Furthermore, the schedule established for the penalty factors may be as hard to generalize as it is to generalize penalty factors in a static penalty function.</p><p>The information given by the same algorithm has been used to update the penalty factors in those so-called adaptive penalty functions. Hadj-Alouane and Bean <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> used the feasibility of the best solution in a number of generations as a criterion to modify the penalty factor. The fitness of the best feasible solution so far was used to modify the penalty values by Rasheed <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Hamda and Schoenauer <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and later Hamida and Schoenauer <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> opted for a balance between feasible and infeasible solution in the current population as their criterion to modify the penalization values. Barbosa and Lemonge <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> proposed the use of the average of the objective function and the level of violation of each constraint during the evolution as update criteria for the penalty function. On the other hand, more elaborate ways to ask the algorithm to compute convenient penalty factors have been based on coevolution, as in the approach proposed by Coello <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and fuzzy logic, as proposed by Wu and Yu <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The main drawback of adaptive penalty functions is inherent to their design, because the values that are adapted are based on the current behavior of the algorithm, and it is unknown if the changes made will be indeed useful in later cycles of the optimization process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The earliest constraint-handling techniques based on penalty functions showed a lot of diversity in the way of defining the penalty factors (static, dynamic, adaptive, co-evolved, fuzzyadapted, etc.). However, it was not clear, at that point of time, which of them could be more competitive. This question is answered in the next section of this paper. In fact, the previously mentioned approaches introduced, most of the time, additional parameters to define the penalty factors. The argument was that the calibration of such parameters was less complicated with respect to the careful fine-tuning required by a traditional penalty factor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Decoders</head><p>Decoders were one of the most competitive constraint-handling techniques in the early years of this area. They are based on the idea of mapping the feasible region F of the search space S onto an easier-to-sample space where a NIA can provide a better performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>The mapping process of a decoder must guarantee that each feasible solution in the search space is included in the decoded space and that a decoded solution corresponds to a feasible solution in the search space. Moreover, the transformation process must be fast and it is highly desirable that small changes in the search space of the original problem cause small changes in the decoded space as well. Koziel and Michalewicz proposed the homomorphous maps (HM), where the feasible region is mapped into an n-dimensional cube <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. HM was the most competitive constraint-handling approach during some years, before the advent of stochastic ranking and other modern approaches discussed in the next section. Kim and Husbands reported another (less known) decoder-based approach based on Riemann mappings <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Although decoders are an interesting constraint-handling technique from a theoretical perspective, their actual implementation is far from trivial and involves a high computational cost which was normally not evaluated when assessing their performance (e.g., when assessing the performance of HM <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, only the actual fitness function evaluations performed by the evolutionary algorithm were considered). These shortcomings have made decoders such as HM a relatively rare approach nowadays.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Special operators</head><p>When solving a CNOP, a special operator is conceived as a way of either preserving the feasibility of a solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> or moving within a specific region of interest within the search space, i.e., the boundaries of the feasible region <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Michalewicz proposed GENOCOP <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, which only works with linear constraints and requires an initial feasible solution and also a pre-processing process to eliminate equality constraints and some variables of the problem. GENOCOP uses a variation operator which constructs linear combinations of feasible solutions to preserve their feasibility. Michalewicz and Nazhiyath proposed GENOCOP III <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, which uses GENOCOP in one of its two populations which interact each other. The other population stores feasible solutions. Special operators are designed to convert solutions from the first population, which only satisfy linear constraints, into fully feasible solutions. Kowalczyk <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> proposed a constraint-consistent GA where a feasible, or at least partially feasible, initial population is required. Moreover, in this approach, special operators assign values to the decision variables aiming to keep the feasibility of the solution. On the other hand, Schoenauer and Michalewicz in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>, after an ad-hoc initialization process, employed special operators for two specific problems to sample the boundaries of their feasible regions. Finally, the same authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, presented an interesting transition from their special operators to a decoder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Some authors have reported highly competitive results when adopting special operators. The main drawback of this sort of approach is their limited applicability. Additionally, most of them require an ad-hoc initialization process or at least one feasible or partially-feasible solution in the initial population, and this may be quite difficult and/or computationally expensive when dealing with highly-constrained optimization problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Separation of objective function and constraints</head><p>Unlike the idea of combining the objective function and the values of the constraints into a single value as done in a penalty function (see Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)), there exist constraint-handling techniques which work with the opposite idea, i.e. keeping those two values apart in the NIA's selection process. Powell and Skolnick in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> proposed an approach based on Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">fitness(⃗ x) =      f (⃗ x) if feasible 1 + r  m - i=1 g i (⃗ x) + p - j=1 h j (⃗ x)  otherwise (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>where a feasible solution has always a better fitness value with respect to that of an infeasible solution, whose fitness is based only on their accumulated constraint violation. The idea of dividing the search in two phases was explored by Hinterding and Michalewicz in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. The first phase aims to find feasible solutions, regardless of the objective function value. After an appropriate number of feasible solutions has been found, the second phase starts with the goal of optimizing the objective function.</p><p>The use of lexicographic ordering to satisfy constraints (one at a time) was studied by Schoenauer and Xanthakis in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. This approach, called behavioral memory, sequentially satisfies the constraints of a problem. When a certain number of solutions in the population satisfy the first constraint, an attempt to satisfy the second one is made (but the first constraint must continue to be satisfied). All the solutions that violate any of the constraints that had been previously considered for satisfaction are eliminated from the population.</p><p>One of the most popular and effective constraint-handling techniques in current use belongs to this category and was originally proposed by Deb <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. In this approach, a set of three feasibility criteria are added to a binary tournament selection in a GA as follows:</p><p>1. When comparing two feasible solutions, the one with the best objective function is chosen. 2. When comparing a feasible and an infeasible solution, the feasible one is chosen. 3. When comparing two infeasible solutions, the one with the lowest sum of constraint violation is chosen.</p><p>The sum of constraint violation can be calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">φ(⃗ x) = m - i=1 max(0, g i (⃗ x)) 2 + p - j=1 |h j (⃗ x)| (7)</formula><p>where the values of each inequality constraint g i (⃗ x), i = 1, 2, . . . , m and also each equality constraint h j (⃗ x), j = 1, 2, . . . , p are normalized.</p><p>The lack of user-defined parameters is one of its main advantages. However, it may also lead to premature convergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</p><p>Based on the idea proposed by Coello <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, where in a multi-population scheme each sub-population tries to satisfy one constraint of a CNOP and another one optimizes the objective function, Liang and Suganthan proposed a dynamic assignment of sub-swarms to constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> in PSO. Furthermore, sequential quadratic programming was used as a local search operator. The approach provided highly competitive results in a set of 24 test problems. The approach was further improved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, where only two sub-swarms, one of them with a tolerance for inequality constraints, were used. Each particle, and not a sub-swarm, was dynamically assigned an objective (either the original objective function or a constraint) in such a way that more difficult objectives to optimize (satisfy) were assigned more frequently. The approach was tested on eighteen scalable test problems and the results were highly competitive. However, several parameters values must be defined by the user. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> adopted a similar approach but using DE as a search algorithm. Three DE variants were used in the algorithm and were chosen at random. The results were better in the same set of scalable test problems where improved the PSObased approach was tested.</p><p>Following the same scheme adopted by Hinterding and Michalewicz <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, Venkatraman and Yen <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> solved a CNOP in two-steps: The first one focused only on satisfying the constraints of the problem, i.e.,. a CNOP is transformed into a constraintsatisfaction problem. Once a feasible solution was generated, the second part of the approach started with the goal of optimizing the objective function value. The approach presented premature convergence in some test problems because the approach to the feasible region was biased by the minimization of the sum of constraint violation but ignoring the objective function value.</p><p>Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> proposed a separation scheme based on a coevolutionary approach in which two populations are adopted. The first one optimized the objective function without considering the constraints, while the second population aimed to satisfy the constraints of the problem. Each population could migrate solution to the other. Finally, a Gaussian mutation was applied as a local search mechanism to the best individuals. However, this approach was tested on a small set of test problems and different parameter values were required for solving some of them.</p><p>Several authors have adopted multi-objective optimization concepts to solve constrained optimization problems. In this case, the objective functions and the constraints are also handled separately. These approaches are reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> and can be divided in the following groups:</p><p>1. Techniques which transform a CNOP into a bi-objective problem (the original objective function and the sum of constraint violation as indicated in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>)). 2. Techniques which transform a CNOP into a multi-objective optimization problem (the original objective function and each constraint are handled, each, as a single objective function).</p><p>Multi-objective concepts such as Pareto dominance, Pareto ranking and population-based selection have been adopted by these constraint-handling approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Such approaches have been relatively popular in the specialized literature in spite of their shortcomings (mainly related to the lack of bias provided by Pareto ranking when used in a straightforward manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, and the difficulties of these approaches to preserve diversity in the population <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>).</p><p>Additionally, other mechanisms such as Pareto ranking in different search spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, the shrinking of the search space <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> and the use of non-dominated sorting and clustering techniques to generate collaboration among sub-populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, have been proposed to tackle the disadvantages of this type of constraint-handling technique.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The separation of constraints and the objective function has been found to generate an important diversity loss. Therefore, it is important to design appropriate diversity maintenance mechanisms when designing such approaches. However, this has not prevented the use of these techniques which are among the most popular in the two of the most popular constraint-handling techniques discussed in the following section, are based on the idea of using the objective function and the constraints as different criteria in the selection or replacement mechanism within a NIA to solve CNOPs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">General comments</head><p>In a similar way of a typical search made by a NIA, the first attempts to generate constraint-handling techniques are similar to an exploration phase, in which a variety of approaches are proposed. Issues such as premature convergence by unsuitable bias (Section 2.4), need of a careful fine-tuning of parameters (Section 2.1), non-generalization (Section 2.3), high computational cost and difficult implementations (Section 2.2) are among the main limitations of early constraint-handling techniques. As will be seen in the following section, the second generation of constraint-handling techniques is characterized for having features that overcome most of the previously indicated limitations. Additionally, these modern approaches also share similarities which seems to suggest the possibility of adopting generic schemes in the near future. However, this may have also limited the variety of approaches possible, which is clearly reflected by a much lower number of publications on this topic in recent years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Current constraint-handling techniques</head><p>This section presents a set of recent constraint-handling techniques which have had a relatively high impact in the area. Unlike the techniques presented in the previous section, the number of approaches reviewed in this case is lower. This is due to the fact that the differences among approaches are, in this case, more focused on modifications to the elements of the NIA adopted, and not on the constraint-handling technique itself. From the list presented below the first three and the seventh approach are all new constraint-handling techniques, while the fourth and the fifth are updated versions of constraint-handling techniques previously discussed. The use of multi-objective concepts is now considered as a separate class due to its popularity in recent years. The approaches considered here are:</p><p>1. Feasibility rules 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Feasibility rules</head><p>The three feasibility rules proposed for binary tournaments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> and detailed in Section 2.4 constitute an example of a constraint-handling technique that was proposed several years ago, but whose impact is still present in the literature. The popularity of this simple constraint-handling scheme lies on its ability to be coupled to a variety of algorithms, without introducing new parameters. Mezura-Montes and Coello Coello <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> emphasized the importance of combining these feasibility rules with other mechanisms (e.g., retaining infeasible solutions which are close to the feasible region) in order to produce a constraint-handling technique that is able to deal with problems having active constraints. However, such approach required a dynamic decreasing mechanism for the tolerance value (ε) for equality constraints.</p><p>Mezura-Montes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref> later extended these feasibility rules to the selection process between target and trial vectors in differential evolution (DE). Although the resulting approaches were easy to implement, premature convergence was observed for some test problems and two additional modifications to the search algorithm (DE in this case) were required: (1) each target vector generated more than one trial vector (a user-defined parameter was added for this sake) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> and (2) a new DE variant was designed <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. Lampinen used a similar DE-based approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. However, the third criterion was based on Pareto dominance in constraints space instead of the sum of constraint violation. Lampinen's approach was later adopted by Kukkonen and Lampinen in their Generalized Differential Evolution (GDE) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> which showed promising results in a set of 24 benchmark problems. However, GDE had difficulties when facing more than three constraints. This seems to be the same limitation faced when attempting to use Pareto dominance in problems having four or more objective functions (the so-called manyobjective optimization problems) <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>.</p><p>Feasibility rules have also been used for designing parameter control mechanisms in DE-based constrained numerical optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. However, if self-adaptation mechanisms are incorporated as well (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>), the computational cost of the approach may considerably increase, since more iterations will be required to collect enough information about the search as to make these self-adaptation mechanisms work in a proper manner.</p><p>Zielinski and Laur <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> coupled DE with the feasibility rules in a greedy selection scheme between target and trial vectors. Their approach, which is indeed very simple to implement, presented some difficulties in high-dimensionality problems with equality constraints. They also analyzed, in a further work, different termination conditions (e.g., improvement-based criteria, movement-based criteria, distribution-based criteria) for their algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. They determined that the last criterion from the list indicated before was the most competitive. Zielinski et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> also used the feasibility rules in a study to adapt two DE parameters (F and CR) when solving CNOPs. They concluded that the adaptation mechanism was not as significant as expected in the performance of the algorithm. Furthermore, Zielinski et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref> studied the effect of the tolerance utilized in the equality constraints, where values between ϵ = 1 × 10 -7 and ϵ = 1 × 10 -15 allowed the algorithm, coupled with the feasibility rules, to reach competitive results.</p><p>The feasibility rules have also been adopted by DE-based approaches which use self-adaptive mechanisms to choose among their variants, such as SaDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. In this approach, sequential quadratic programming (SQP) is applied during some iterations to a subset of solutions in the population. Although this approach is very competitive, it heavily relies on the use of SQP, which may limit its applicability.</p><p>Brest <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> used the feasibility rules in his self-adaptive approach called jDE-2, which also combines different DE variants into a single approach to solve CNOPs. A replacement mechanism to keep diversity in the population was implemented to eliminate those k worst vectors at every l generations with new randomly-generated vectors. This mechanism reflects the premature convergence that the feasibility rules may cause in some test problems despite providing competitive results in others mainly related with inequality constraints.</p><p>Landa and Coello <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref> also adopted the feasibility rules in an approach in which a cultural DE-based mechanism was developed, with the aim of incorporating knowledge from the problem into the search process when solving CNOPs. This approach adopts a belief space with four types of knowledge generated and stored during the search. Such knowledge is used to speed up convergence. The approach was able to provide competitive results in a set of benchmark problems. However, there are two main shortcomings of the approach: (1) it requires the use of spatial data structures for knowledge handling and (2) it also needs several parameters which must be defined by the user. Furthermore, spacial data structures are not trivial to implement.</p><p>Menchaca-Mendez and Coello Coello <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> proposed a hybrid approach which combines DE and the Nelder-Mead method. The authors extended a variant of the Nelder-Mead method called Low Dimensional Simplex Evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref> and used it to solve CNOPs. The set of feasibility rules are used in this case to deal with the constraints of the problems in both, the DE algorithm and the m-simplex-operator. However, a fourth rule which considers a tie between the sum of the constraint values, is also incorporated. The objective function value is used in this case to break this tie. This approach also adds some concepts from stochastic ranking, which will be discussed later on. The approach was tested in some benchmark problems and the results obtained were highly competitive, while requiring a lower number of fitness function evaluations than state-of-the-art algorithms. However, the approach added a significant set of parameters which must be fine-tuned by the user, such as those related to the m-simplexoperator.</p><p>Barkat Ullah <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref> reported the use of feasibility rules coupled with a mechanism to force infeasible individuals to move to the feasible region through the application of search space reduction and diversity checking mechanisms designed to avoid premature convergence. This approach, which adopts an evolutionary agent system as its search engine, requires several parameters to be defined by the user and it was not compared against state-of-theart NIAs to solve CNOPs. However, in the testbed reported by the authors the results were competitive.</p><p>The feasibility rules have been a popular constraint-handling mechanism in PSO-based approaches, too. Zielinski and Laur <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref> added feasibility rules into a local best PSO. The approach presented premature convergence in test problems with a high number of equality constraints due to the lack of a diversity maintenance mechanism. In a similar approach, but focused on mixed-variable optimization problems, Sun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81]</ref> added feasibility rules to a global-best PSO. This approach was tested only in two engineering design problems.</p><p>He and Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> used feasibility rules to select the global best (gbest) and for updating the personal best (pbest) of each particle in a PSO-based approach designed to solve CNOPs. They used simulated annealing (SA) as a local search operator and applied it to the gbest particle at each generation. The approach was tested on a small set of benchmark problems as well as on a set of engineering design problems. The usage of SA improved the PSO performance. However, the main shortcoming of the approach is that it requires several user-defined parameter for both the PSO and the SA algorithms.</p><p>Toscano-Pulido and Coello Coello <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref> combined feasibility rules with a global-best PSO but required a mutation operator to avoid converging to local optimum solutions. This same problem (premature convergence) was tackled by using two mutation operators by Muñoz-Zavala et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85]</ref>. Additionally, they also tackled this problem employing different topologies in local-best PSO algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87]</ref>. The evident need of a mutation operator showed that the feasibility rules combined with PSO may cause premature convergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Cagnina et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref> tackled the premature convergence of PSO combined with feasibility rules by using a global-local best PSO. However, the use of a dynamic mutation operator was also required. The results obtained by this approach showed evident signs of stagnation in some test problems. In a further version of this approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>, a bi-population scheme and a ''shake'' operator were added. This approach showed a significant improvement in performance with respect to its previous version.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, feasibility rules were used as a constraint-handling mechanism in an empirical study aimed to determine which PSO variant was the most competitive when solving CNOPs. The authors found that the version adopting a constriction factor performed better than the (popular) version that uses inertia weight. Furthermore, local-best was found to be better than globalbest PSO.</p><p>The use of feasibility rules motivated the definition of the relative feasibility degree in <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>, which is a measure of constraint violation in pairwise comparisons. The aim of this work was to compare pairs of solutions but with a feasibility value based only on the values of their constraints and on the ratio of the feasible region of a given constraint with respect to the entire feasible region of the search space. The approach was coupled to DE and tested in some benchmark problems. The convergence rate was better with respect to the original feasibility rules but the final results were not considerable better with respect to those obtained by other state-of-art algorithms.</p><p>Karaboga and Basturk <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref> and Karaboga and Akay <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref> changed a greedy selection based only on the objective function values by the use of feasibility rules with the aim of adapting an artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) to solve CNOPs. The authors also modified the probability assignment for their roulette wheel selection employed to focus the search on the most promising solutions. The approach was tested on a well-known set of 13 test problems and the results obtained were comparable with those obtained by the homomorphous maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, stochastic ranking <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and other approaches based on penalty functions. However, the approach modified one ABC operator adding a new parameter to be finetuned by the user.</p><p>Mezura-Montes and Cetina-Domíngez extended Karabogas' approach by using feasibility rules as a constraint-handling technique but with an special operator designed to locate solutions close to the best feasible solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>. This approach was tested on 13 test problems and the results that they obtained were shown to be better than those reported by Karaboga and Basturk in <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref>. However, this approach added extra parameters related to the tolerance used to handle equality constraints. An improved version was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>, where two operators were improved and a direct-search local operator was added to the algorithm. The approach provided competitive results in a set of eighteen scalable test problems but its main disadvantage was the definition of the schedule to apply the local search method.</p><p>Mezura-Montes and Hernández-Ocaña <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref> used feasibility rules with the Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>, to solve CNOPs. The feasibility rules were used in the greedy selection mechanism within the chemotactic loop, which considers the generation of a new solution (swim) based on the random search direction (tumble). This approach, called Modified Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm (MBFOA), considered a swarming mechanism that uses the best solution in the population as an attractor for the other solutions. The approach was used to solve engineering design problems.</p><p>Mezura-Montes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref> used feasibility rules as a constrainthandling mechanism in an in-depth empirical study of the use of DE as an optimizer in constrained search spaces. A set of wellknown test problems and performance measures were used to analyze the behavior of different DE variants and their sensitivity to two user-defined parameters. From such analysis, the simple combination of two of them (DE/rand/1/bin and DE/best/1/bin) called Differential Evolution Combined Variants (DECV) was proposed by the authors. This approach is able to switch from one variant to the other based on a certain percentage of feasible solutions present in the population. The results obtained in a set of 24 test problems were competitive with respect to state-of-the-art algorithms. However, the performance of this approach strongly depends on the percentage used to perform the switch from one variant to the other and this value is problem-dependent.</p><p>Elsayed et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref> proposed two multi-operator NIAs to solve CNOPs. A four sub-population scheme is handled by one of two options: (1) a static approach where each sub-population with a fixed size evolves by using a particular crossover and mutation operator and, at some periods of time, the sub-populations migrate the best solutions that they had found to another subpopulation, and (2) an adaptive approach in which the size of each subpopulation varies based on the feasibility of the best solution in the population in two contiguous generations. This approach was tested in two versions: with a real-coded GA using four crossover-mutation combinations and also with DE adopting four DE mutation variants, all of them with binomial crossover. The latter version outperformed the former after being extensively tested in 60 benchmark problems. The approach requires the definition of some additional parameters related to the minimum size that a sub-population can have, as well as to the generational interval for migrating solutions among sub-populations.</p><p>Elsayed et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref> proposed a modified GA where a novel crossover operator called multi-parent crossover and also a randomized operator were added to a real-coded GA to solve CNOPs. The feasibility rules were adopted as the constrainthandling mechanism. The approach was tested on a set of eighteen recently proposed test problems in 10D and 30D showing very competitive results. However, some disadvantages were found in separable test problems with a high dimensionality. The approach provided better results with respect to other approaches based on DE and PSO.</p><p>Elsayed et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref> compared ten different GA variants to solve CNOPs by using, in all cases, the feasibility rules as the constrainthandling technique. The crossover operators employed were triangular crossover, Simulated binary crossover, parent-centric crossover, simplex crossover, and blend crossover. The mutation operators adopted were non-uniform mutation and polynomial crossover. Statistical tests were applied to the samples of runs to provide confidence on the performances showed. An interesting conclusion of the comparison was that no GA was clearly superior with respect to the others GAs compared. Nonetheless, nonuniform mutation and polynomial mutation provided competitive results in 10D and 30D test problems.</p><p>Hamza et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref> proposed a DE algorithm to solve CNOPs where the feasibility rules were used as the constraint-handling mechanism and the population was divided in feasible and infeasible vectors. A constraint-consensus operator was applied to infeasible vectors so as to become them feasible. Even the approach showed competitive results in a set of thirteen wellknown test problems, the constraint-consensus operator requires gradient calculations, which were made by numerical methods.</p><p>In an interesting adaptation of the feasibility rules combined with the idea of focusing first on decreasing the sum of constraint violation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>, Tvrdík and Poláková <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref> adapted DE to solve CNOPs. If feasible solutions were present in the population, in a single cycle of the algorithm two generations were carried out, the first one based only on the sum of constraint violation and the second one based on the feasibility rules with a simple modification on the third rule, where between two infeasible solutions the one with the lowest sum of constraint violation was preferred if it also had a better value of the objective function. The approach was tested on eighteen scalable test problems in 10D and 30D. Even some competitive results were obtained, premature convergence was generally observed in the approach because the isolated usage of the sum of constraint violation kept the algorithm for sampling, in a more convenient way, the feasible region of the search space.</p><p>The feasibility rules were used in a real-coded GA with simulated binary crossover and adaptive polynomial mutation by Saha et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref>. Furthermore, a special operator based on gradient information was employed to favor the generation of feasible solutions in presence of equality constraints. Even the results improved by the approach in such test problems, the parameter which mainly controls the special operator required a careful finetuning based on the difficulty of the test problem.</p><p>The feasibility rules were added by Tseng and Chen to the multiple trajectory search (MTS) algorithm to solve CNOPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref>. Those rules worked as the criteria to choose solutions in three region searches which allowed MTS to generate new solutions. The approach was able to provide feasible solutions in most of eighteen scalable test problems. However, it presented premature convergence.</p><p>Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref> implicitly used feasibility rules to rank the particles in a hybrid multi-swarm PSO (HMPSO). They took inspiration from two papers: (1) the way Liang and Suganthan <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> constructed sub-swarms to promote more exploration of the search space and (2) the way Muñoz-Zavala et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref> used a differential mutation operator to update the local-best particle. The results agree with those found by Mezura-Montes and Flores-Mendoza, in which local-best PSO performs better than global-best PSO when solving CNOPs. The main shortcoming of the approach relies in its implementation due to the mechanisms added to PSO.</p><p>HMPSO was improved by Lui et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>, where the DE mutation operator was extended by using two other operators. The number of evaluations required by the improved approach, which was called PSO-DE, decreased with respect to those required by HMPSO in almost 50%. This approach was validated using some engineering design problems but was not further tested on benchmark problems with higher dimensionalities.</p><p>The use of feasibility rules has been particularly popular in approaches based on artificial immune systems (AISs) as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>. The first attempts to solve CNOPs with an AIS were based on hybrid GA-AIS approaches, in which the constraint-handling technique was the main task performed by the AIS embedded within a GA <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>. The AIS was evolved with the aim of making an infeasible solution (the antibody) as similar as possible (at a binary string level) as a feasible solution used as a reference (the antigen). After increasing the number of feasible solutions in the population, the outer GA continued with the optimization process. The main advantage of this technique is its simplicity. In further AIS-based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">112]</ref> in which the clonal selection principle was adopted <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref>, feasibility rules were incorporated as a way to rank antibodies (i.e., solutions) based on their affinity (objective function values and sum of constraint violation). In another approach based on a T-cell model, in which three types of cells (solutions) are adopted <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>, the replacement mechanism uses feasibility rules as the criteria to select the survivors for the next iteration.</p><p>Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref> proposed the organizational evolutionary algorithm (OEA) to solve numerical optimization problems. When extending this approach to constrained problems, a static penalty function and feasibility rules are compared as constraint-handling techniques. As expected, the static penalty function required specific values for each test problem solved. Although the use of the static penalty function allowed OEA to provide slightly better results than the use of feasibility rules, such results were only comparable with respect to state-of-the-art algorithms used to solve CNOPs.</p><p>Sun and Garibaldi <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref> proposed a memetic algorithm to solve CNOPs. In this approach, the search engine is an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) while the local search operator is based on SQP. Some knowledge, called history, is extracted from the application of the local search and is given to the EDA with the aim of improving its performance. This knowledge consists in the application of a variation operator which uses the location of the best solution found so far to influence the generation of new solutions. Feasibility rules are used as the constraint-handling mechanism in the selection process. In fact, a comparison against a version of this approach but using stochastic ranking as the mechanism to deal with the constraints showed that the feasibility rules were more suitable for this approach. The approach provided competitive results with respect to state-of-the-art algorithms. However, the local search adopted requires gradient information.</p><p>Ullah et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">118]</ref> adopted feasibility rules in their agentbased memetic algorithm to solve CNOPs. This approach is similar to a GA, and adopts the SBX operator to generate offspring which are subjected to a learning process that lasts up to four life spans. This actually works as a mutation operator whose use is based on a proper selection being made by each individual (agent). The measures used to select an operator are based on the success of each of them to generate competitive offspring. The communication among agents in the population is restricted to the current population. This approach seems to be sensitive to the value of the parameter associated with the communication mechanism. The results obtained were comparable with previously proposed approaches.</p><p>Ma and Simon <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119]</ref> proposed an improved version of the biogeography-based optimization (BBO) algorithm. The idea is to add a migration operator inspired on the blend crossover operator used in real-coded GAs. BBO is inspired on the study of distributions of species over time and space and it adopts two variation operators: migration (or emigration) and mutation. A habitat (solution) has a habitat suitability index, HSI (i.e., the fitness function). High-HSI solutions have a higher probability to share their features with low-HSI solutions by emigrating features to other habitats. Low-HSI solutions accept a lot of new features from high-HSI solutions by immigration from other habitats. Feasibility rules are used in this approach as the constraint-handling mechanism. The approach was found to be competitive with respect to PSO-based approaches and one GAbased algorithm. However, no further comparisons against stateof-the-art were reported.</p><p>Ali and Kajee-Bagdadi <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[120]</ref> compared feasibility rules with respect to the superiority of feasible points proposed by Powell and Skolnick <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> in a DE-based approach, in which a modified version of the pattern search method was used as a local search operator. They also compared their approach with respect to another based on a GA and found the former to be more competitive. The proposed DE-based approach presented a comparable performance with respect to other DE-based algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>As should be evident from the previous review, the feasibility rules have been very popular in constrained optimization using NIAs. This is due to their simplicity and flexibility, which makes them very suitable to be coupled to any sort of selection mechanism relatively easily. Their main drawback is that they are prone to cause premature convergence. This is due to the fact that this sort of scheme strongly favors feasible solutions. Thus, if no further mechanisms are adopted to preserve diversity (particularly paying attention to the need to keep infeasible solutions in the population), this approach will significantly increase the selection pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>.</p><p>Some approaches use special operators <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">93]</ref> but their role can be considered as secondary, because feasibility rules provide the main bias during the search.

Furthermore, there is empirical evidence of the importance of defining the tolerance adopted for equality constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, and the definition of termination criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> when using feasibility rules.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Stochastic ranking</head><p>Stochastic ranking (SR) was originally proposed by Runarsson and Yao <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. SR was designed to deal with the inherent shortcomings of a penalty function (over and under penalization due to unsuitable values for the penalty factors) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In SR, instead of the definition of those factors, a user-defined parameter called P f controls the criterion used for comparison of infeasible solutions:</p><p>(1) based on their sum of constraint violation or (2) based only on their objective function value. SR uses a bubble-sort-like process to rank the solutions in the population as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>SR was originally proposed to work with an ES <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> in its replacement mechanism which indeed requires a ranking process. However, it has been used with other NIAs where the replacement mechanism is quite different as in the approach reported by Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123]</ref>. In this case, the authors used SR with a DE variant proposed by Mezura-Montes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, in which more than one trial vector is generated per each target vector. Moreover, the parameter P f was manipulated by a dynamic parameter control mechanism in order to conveniently decrease it, aiming to favor diversity during the initial generations of the search (infeasible solutions close to the feasible region are maintained) whereas only feasible solutions are kept during the final part of the search. The approach was compared against state-of-the-art algorithms and the results obtained were very competitive while requiring a low number of fitness function evaluations. However, the main disadvantage of this approach is that it requires the definition of the number of trial vectors generated by each target vector.</p><p>There are other approaches which combine DE with SR such as the proposal of Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref> in which the diversity promoted by SR is exploited in a traditional DE variant. In a further paper, Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref> used the concept of directional information related to the choice of the most convenient search direction based on the DE mutation operator and an adaptive population partitioning scheme. This approach was incorporated into a DEbased algorithm with SR, in order to deal with the constraints of a problem. These two algorithms were assessed with a fairly limited set of test problems.</p><p>SR has also been combined with ant colony optimization (ACO). Leguizamón and Coello Coello in <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126]</ref> added SR to an ACO version for dealing with CNOPs. A comparison against traditional penalty functions showed that SR provided better and more robust results in a set of well-known benchmark problems. However, the approach presented some difficulties to find feasible solutions for some test problems.</p><p>SR has been further developed by Runarsson and Yao <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[127]</ref> in one of the earliest approaches focused on using fitness approximation for constrained numerical optimization. In this approach k-nearest-neighbors (NN) regression is coupled to SR.</p><p>The authors found that the simplest NN version (using k = 1) provided the most competitive performance in a set of benchmark problems.</p><p>In a further paper, Runarsson and Yao <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> improved their ES by adding a differential mutation similar to that used in DE. The authors concluded that a good constraint-handling mechanism needs to be coupled to an appropriate search engine.</p><p>Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128]</ref> improved SR by giving the best feasible solutions a higher probability of being chosen, in an attempt to determine the search direction in the differential mutation added in <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. However, the approach performed better with larger populations and more generations, which may be impractical in the solution of real-world problems with a high computational cost.</p><p>Mallipeddi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref> proposed a two-population evolutionary programming (EP) approach with an external memory to store solutions based on an Euclidean distance measure that aimed to promote diversity. SR was used as a constraint-handling technique and it was compared with respect to the use of feasibility rules. Although the importance of the diversity mechanism based on the external memory was evident in the solution of some CNOPs, there was no clear evidence of the superiority of SR over the use of feasibility rules in this algorithm.</p><p>The simplicity of SR has made it suitable for being used in different domains. Fan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref> solved robust layout synthesis of MEMS components by a DE-SR algorithm in which the vectors are ranked with SR before the DE operators are applied. After that, the population is split into two sets based on SR. The first set contains the vectors with the highest ranks while the second set includes the remaining vectors. The base vector and the vector which determines the search direction are chosen at random from the first set. The other vector is chosen at random from the second set. The number of vectors in each set is determined by a user-defined parameter. Although this approach obtained competitive results in the aforementioned problem, its use has not been extended to other problems to the authors' best knowledge. Huan-Tong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[131]</ref> used SR with its original search algorithm (an ES) for solving reactive power optimization problems. The authors reported a decrease of about 4% of the initial loss reported for such problems. Fonseca et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[132]</ref> used ACO with SR with the aim of avoiding the careful fine-tuning of the penalty factors required for the solution of discrete structural optimization problems. The results of the proposed approach outperformed those obtained with traditional penalty functions. However, this approach has not been extended to other optimization problems to the authors' best knowledge.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">ε-constrained method</head><p>One of the most recent constraint-handling techniques reported in the specialized literature is the ε-constrained method proposed by Takahama and Sakai <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133]</ref>. This mechanism transforms a CNOP into an unconstrained numerical optimization problem and it has two main components: (1) a relaxation of the limit to consider a solution as feasible, based on its sum of constraint violation, with the aim of using its objective function value as a comparison criterion, and (2) a lexicographical ordering mechanism in which the minimization of the sum of constraint violation precedes the minimization of the objective function of a given problem. The value of ε, satisfying ε &gt; 0, determines the so-called ε-level comparisons between a pair of solutions ⃗ x 1 and ⃗ x 2 with objective func- tion values f (⃗ x 1 ) and f (⃗ x 2 ) and sums of constraint violation φ(⃗ x 1 ) and φ(⃗ x 2 ) (which can be calculated as stated in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>)) as indicated in Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">8</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(f (⃗ x 1 ), φ(⃗ x 1 )) &lt; ε (f (⃗ x 2 ), φ(⃗ x 2 )) ⇔  f (⃗ x 1 ) &lt; f (⃗ x 2 ), if φ(⃗ x 1 ), φ(⃗ x 2 ) ≤ ε f (⃗ x 1 ) &lt; f (⃗ x 2 ), if φ(⃗ x 1 ) = φ(⃗ x 2 ) φ(⃗ x 1 ) &lt; φ(⃗ x 2 ), otherwise<label>(8)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">(f (⃗ x 1 ), φ(⃗ x 1 )) ≤ ε (f (⃗ x 2 ), φ(⃗ x 2 )) ⇔  f (⃗ x 1 ) ≤ f (⃗ x 2 ), if φ(⃗ x 1 ), φ(⃗ x 2 ) ≤ ε f (⃗ x 1 ) ≤ f (⃗ x 2 ), if φ(⃗ x 1 ) = φ(⃗ x 2 ) φ(⃗ x 1 ) &lt; φ(⃗ x 2 ), otherwise.<label>(9)</label></formula><p>As can be seen, if both solutions in the pairwise comparison are feasible, slightly infeasible (as determined by the ε value) or even if they have the same sum of constraint violation, they are compared using their objective function values. If both solutions are infeasible, they are compared based on their sum of constraint violation. Therefore, if ε = ∞, the ε-level comparison works by using only the objective function values as the comparison criteria.</p><p>On the other hand, if ε = 0, then the ε-level comparisons &lt; 0 and ≤ 0 are equivalent to a lexicographical ordering in which the minimization of the sum of constraint violation φ(⃗ x) precedes the minimization of the objective function f (⃗ x), as promoted by the use of feasibility rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Takahama and Sakai <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref> have an earlier approach called the α-constrained method. In this case, the authors perform α-level comparisons which work in a similar way as those of the ε-constrained method. However, unlike the ε value which represents a tolerance related to the sum of constraint violation, the α value is related to the satisfaction level of the constraints for a given solution. Therefore, the condition to consider the objective function as a criterion in a pairwise comparison is based on the aforementioned satisfaction level of both solutions. If both levels are higher than an 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 value, the comparison can be made by using the objective function value, regardless of the full feasibility of the solutions. The main drawback of the αconstrained method with respect to the ε-constrained method is that the first may require user-defined parameters to compute the satisfaction level <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>, while the second uses the sum of constraint violation which requires no additional parameters (see Eq. ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>)).</p><p>Nonetheless, in both mechanisms, the careful fine-tuning of α and ε remains as the main shortcoming. The authors have proposed dynamic mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">136]</ref> which have allowed these two algorithms to provide competitive results.</p><p>The α-constrained method was coupled to a GA in <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>, while the use of the Nelder-Mead method was reported by the same authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref>. The results obtained by using multiple simplexes allowed the approach to obtain competitive results with respect to those found by SR <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Wang and Li adopted the α-constrained method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[137]</ref>, using DE as their search engine, and improved the results reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref>. Also, the ε-constrained method was combined with a hybrid PSO-GA algorithm by Takahama et al.</p><p>in <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133]</ref>. The approach considered the reproduction for particles as in a GA with the goal to tackle the premature convergence observed in a previous version in which the α-constrained method was coupled only to PSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[138]</ref>. The hybrid approach was tested only in one benchmark function and two engineering design problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133]</ref>.</p><p>A successful attempt to find a more suitable search algorithm for the ε-constrained method was reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136]</ref>, where a DE variant (DE/rand/1/exp) and a gradient-based mutation operator (acting as a local search engine) were employed. This version obtained the best overall results in a competition on constrained real-parameter optimization in 2006, in which a set of 24 test problems were solved <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[139]</ref>. Gradient-based mutation was applied to newly infeasible generated trial vectors in order to make them feasible. Evidently, the main limitation of this sort of approach is that gradient information must be computed. Also, additional parameters must be fine-tuned by the user in this approach. Finally, it is worth remarking that there seem to be no studies that analyze the role of adopting gradient-based information in an EA used for constrained optimization.</p><p>Further improvements have been proposed to the ε-constrained method. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140]</ref>, Takahama and Sakai improved the dynamic control for the ε value by using an adaptive approach which allowed a faster decrease in its value if the sum of constraint violation was reduced quickly enough during the search process. This mechanism produced improved results when dealing with CNOPs having equality constraints. However, in this case, there is also an additional user-defined parameter, which is related to the adaptation process. Additionally, the authors did not analyze the performance of this variant in CNOPs that have only inequality constraints.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141]</ref>, Takahama and Sakai improved their approach by adding a decreasing probability on the use of the gradient-based mutation. They also introduced two new mechanisms to deal with boundary constraints: (1) one based on a reflecting back process for variable values lying outside the valid limits when DE mutation was applied, and (2) another one that consisted in assigning the limit value to a variable lying outside a boundary when the gradient-based mutation was computed. With the aforementioned changes, the authors could obtain feasible solutions for one highly difficult problem known as g22 <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[139]</ref>. The main drawback of this improved version was the addition of user-defined parameters for the dynamic mechanism used by the gradient-based mutation operator. A further improved version of the aforementioned algorithm was proposed by Takahama and Sakai in <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref>, where an archive to store solutions and the ability of a vector to generate more than one trial vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143]</ref> were added. The approach has provided one of the most (if not the most) competitive performance in different sets of test problems. However, the algorithm still depends on the gradient-based mutation to provide such competitive results. Motivated by its competitive performance, the ε-constrained method has been adopted as a constraint-handling technique in other proposals. This is the case of the jDE algorithm proposed by Brest et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[144]</ref>, in which the authors propose to self-adapt the parameters of DE using stochastic values. In a version called ε-jDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref>, the ε-constrained method was one of the improvements proposed, besides the use of additional DE variants and a reduction scheme of the population size. Brest <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref> also added a novel way to adapt the ε value, but additional user-defined parameters were introduced. However, the results obtained by ε-jDE were highly competitive in a set of 24 well-known benchmark problems. An improved version called jDEsoco was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[146]</ref>, where an aging mechanism to replace those solutions stagnated in a local optimum was added. Moreover, only the 60% of the population was compared by the ε-constrained method and the remaining 40% was compared by only using the objective function value. The results were improved but two parameters, the population ratio and an aging probability were added to the algorithm.</p><p>Zeng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147]</ref> employed the ε-constrained method with a ε variation process based on the dynamic decrease mechanism originally proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. A crossover operator biased by the barycenter of the parents, plus a uniform mutation were used as variation operators. The approach was tested in 24 test problems and the results were found to be competitive with respect to the ε-constrained DE <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136]</ref>. An improved version of this approach was proposed by Zhang et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[148]</ref>, where a gradient-based mutation similar to the one proposed by Takahama and Sakai <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136]</ref> was added. The results obtained by this approach were compared with respect to those obtained by the ε-constrained DE. The approach added parameters related with the variation of the ε value as well as those required by the gradient-based mutation.</p><p>Mezura-Montes et al. used the ε-constrained method within the ABC algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref>. Additionally, a dynamic mechanism to decrease the tolerance for equality constraints was considered. The results obtained outperformed those reported by a previous ABC version in which feasibility rules were used as the constraint-handling technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>. However, this approach showed premature convergence in some test problems having high dimensionality.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Novel penalty functions</head><p>In spite of the fact that the two previous types of constrainthandling techniques discussed avoid the use of a penalty function, there are proposals based on such penalty functions which provide very competitive results. Here, we will briefly review the most representative work in this direction.</p><p>Xiao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[149]</ref> used the so-called KS function in a static penalty function to solve CNOPs. However, even when the approach was competitive in some test problems, it was clearly outperformed in others.</p><p>Deb and Datta <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[150]</ref> revisited the static penalty function by proposing a method to compute a suitable value for a single penalty factor, assuming the normalization of the constraints. As a first step a bi-objective problem was solved by a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) (e.g., NSGA-II <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref>). The first objective was the original objective function while the second was the sum of constraint violation φ = 0. Furthermore, φ was restricted by a tolerance value (in a similar way as the ε-constrained method <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136]</ref> but with a fixed value in this case).</p><p>The tolerance value was determined by a user-defined parameter based on the number of constraints of the problem. After a certain number of generations (also defined by the user), a cubic curve to approximate the current obtained Pareto front was generated by using four points whose φ values were below a small tolerance. The penalty factor was then defined by calculating the corresponding slope at φ = 0. After that, a traditional static penalty function was used to solve the original CNOP by using a local search algorithm (Matlab's fmincon() procedure was used by the authors) using the solution with the lowest φ value from the population of the MOEA as the starting point for the search. The termination criterion for the local search algorithm was the feasibility of the final solution combined with a small tolerance for the difference between objective function values of the starting point and the final one. The approach was tested on a set of six benchmark problems in which it obtained competitive results, while requiring a significant lower number of evaluations with respect to those reported by other state-of-the-art NIAs. The approach, however, requires the calibration of the MOEA as well as a tolerance value for the constraint related to the sum of constraint violation. Additionally, it also requires the number of generations to define the interval of use for the local search and, finally, the tolerance for the termination criterion of the local search. It is worth noting that this approach considered only inequality constraints. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[152]</ref>, Datta and Deb extended their approach to deal with equality constraints, too. The extension consisted in two main changes:</p><p>(1) the punishment provided by the penalty value obtained by the bi-objective problem was increased if the local search failed to generate a feasible solution and (2) the small tolerance used for choosing the four points employed to approximate the cubic curve was relaxed. Both changes were motivated by the difficulties to generate feasible solutions caused by the presence of equality constraints. The results obtained in eight well-known test problems were highly competitive with respect to two stateof-the-art approaches based on PSO and DE.</p><p>Tasgetiren and Suganthan <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[153]</ref> proposed the use of a dynamic penalty function coupled with a multi-population differential evolution algorithm. In this approach, the authors allowed a user-defined number sub-populations to evolve independently. However, the selection of the solutions to compute the differential mutation could be made by considering all sub-populations. Furthermore, a regrouping process, similar to a recombination operator among best solutions in each sub-population, was carried out after a number of generations, defined by the user. The approach was tested on 24 test problems, and the authors reported a high sensitivity of their approach to the parameters related with the severity of the penalty.</p><p>Farmani and Wright <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[154]</ref> proposed a two-parts adaptive penalty function in which no penalty factors need to be defined by the user. The first part increases the fitness of the infeasible solutions with a better value of the objective function with respect to the best solution in the current population. The best solution can be the feasible solution with the best objective function value. However, if no feasible solutions are present in the population, the best solution is the infeasible solution with the lowest sum of constraint violation. This first part of the penalization focuses on promoting diversity in promising regions of the search space, regardless of their feasibility. The second part modifies the fitness values of the worst infeasible solutions (those with the highest sum of constraint violation and a poor objective function value) aiming to make them similar to the fitness of the solution with the worst value of the objective function. The aim is to generate more solutions in the boundaries of the feasible region but with better values of the objective function. In spite of its lack of user-defined penalty factors, the approach was computationally expensive, since it required more than one million evaluations to provide competitive results in a set of 11 test problems.</p><p>Puzzi and Carpinteri <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[155]</ref> explored a dynamic penalty function based on multiplications instead of summations in a GA-based approach. However, this approach performed well in problems having only inequality constraints.</p><p>Tessema and Yen <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[156]</ref> used the number of feasible solutions in the current population to determine the penalty value assigned to infeasible solutions in a two-penalty based approach. This parameterless penalty function allows, based on the feasibility of solutions in the population, to favor slightly infeasible solutions having a good objective function value, as promoted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. This is done in the selection process by assigning such solutions a higher fitness value. The approach obtained competitive results in 22 test problems. However, the number of evaluations required was higher (500,000) than that required by other state-ofthe-art approaches (they require around 250,000 evaluations). Furthermore, three mutation operators (which require three mutation probabilities defined by the user) are required to maintain the explorative capabilities of the approach.</p><p>Mani and Patvardhan <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[157]</ref> explored the use of an adaptive penalty function in a two-population-GA-like-based approach in which the first population evolves by using a parameter-free adaptive penalty function based on the objective function and the constraint violation of the best solution available so far in the population. The other population evolves based on feasibility rules. Then, both populations exchange their best solutions plus an additional percentage of randomly chosen solutions. The approach was tested on a set of test problems. However, the approach required parameters related to the migration process as well as the variation operators, as well as a local search mechanism based on gradient information.</p><p>In an analogous way as Coello <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> used co-evolution to optimize penalty factors to solve CNOPs by using two-nested GAs, He et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[158]</ref> used two PSO algorithms instead. Their approach was used to solve a set of engineering design problems and the results were encouraging. However, as in the approach using GAs, this one requires the definition of parameter values for the two PSO algorithms.</p><p>Wu <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[159]</ref> proposed an AIS which combines the metaphor of clonal selection with idiotypic network theories. To deal with CNOPs, an adaptive penalty function was defined to assign its affinity to each antibody. Different operators based on the clonal selection principle, affinity maturation and the bone marrow operator were applied to generate new solutions. The approach was tested on four benchmark nonlinear programming problems and four generalized polynomial programming (GPP) problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In spite of their well-documented shortcomings, penalty functions are still being used and improved in the specialized literature, as has been made evident in the previously discussed approaches.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Novel specialized operators</head><p>Leguizamón and Coello Coello <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[160]</ref> proposed a boundary operator based on conducting a binary search between a feasible and an infeasible solution. Furthermore, three strategies to select which constraint (if more than one is present in a CNOP) is analyzed. The search algorithm was an ACO variant for continuous search spaces. The approach provided highly competitive results, mostly, as expected, in problems having active constraints. However, it was outperformed in others. The main disadvantage of the approach is the need of an additional constraint-handling technique (a penalty function was used in this case) to deal with solutions which are on the boundary of the constraint treated but violate other constraints. Furthermore, no other search algorithms which are more popular in the solution of CNOPs (e.g., DE, ES) have been coupled to this proposed boundary operator.</p><p>Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[161]</ref> proposed a boundary operator in a twopopulation approach. The first population evolves by using DE as the search engine, based only on the objective function value (regardless of feasibility). The second population stores only feasible solutions and the boundary operator uses solutions from both populations to generate new solutions, through the application of the bisection method in the boundaries of the feasible region. Furthermore, the Nelder-Mead simplex method was used as a local search operator applied to the best feasible solutions. Unlike Leguizamón and Coello's proposal, this approach does not require an additional constraint-handling technique, but a feasible solutions is needed at the beginning of the process. The approach was tested only in a few problems having only inequality constraints and it required different parameter values for each test problem, showing some sensitivity to them.</p><p>Wanner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[162]</ref> proposed the Constraint Quadratic Approximation (CQA), which is a special operator designed to restrict an evolutionary algorithm (a GA in this case) to sample solutions inside an object with the same dimensions of the feasible region of the search space. This is achieved by a second-order approximation of the objective function and an equality constraint, which is updated at each generation. A subset of solutions from the population was used to build the quadratic approximations. The operator was applied based on a number of generations defined by the user. Moreover, a static penalty function was used to guide the GA search and the equality constraint was transformed into two inequality constraints by using a small ϵ tolerance. The approach was tested on a small set of problems but it could only deal with one quadratic equality constraint. With the aim of solving CNOPs with more than one equality constraint, Peconick et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[163]</ref> proposed the Constraint Quadratic Approximation for Multiple Equality Constraints (CQA-MEC). This was achieved by an iterative projection algorithm which is able to find points satisfying the approximated quadratic constraints with a low computational overhead. However, CQA-MEC still requires the static penalty function to work as its predecessor (CQA). Araujo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[164]</ref> extended the previous approaches to deal with multiple inequality constraints by using an special operator in which the locally convex inequality constraints are approximated by quadratic functions, while the locally non-convex inequality constraints are approximated by linear functions. The dependence of the static penalty function remains in this last approach.</p><p>Ullah et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[165]</ref> proposed an agent-based memetic algorithm to solve CNOPs, in which the authors adopt a special local operator for equality constraints, which is one of five life span learning processes. After a selection process in which pairs of agents (i.e., solutions) are chosen based on their fitness and location in the search space, the SBX operator is applied. Thereafter, the special operator for equality constraints is applied to some individuals in the population as follows: the satisfaction of a randomly chosen equality constraint is verified for a given solution. If it is not satisfied, a decision variable, also chosen at random, is updated with the aim to satisfy it. If the constraint is indeed satisfied, two other variables are satisfied in such a way that the constraint is still satisfied (i.e., the constraint is sampled). This special operator is only applied during the early stages of the search because it reduces the diversity in the population. The four other learning processes were taken from a previous version discussed in an earlier paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref>. These processes are applied based on their success. The approach was tested on a set of benchmark problems with equality constraints and the results were promising. However, the approach requires additional parameters to be defined by the user (e.g., the number of generations during which the operator must be applied, the number of decision variables to be updated in the equality constraint). In fact, the authors do not provide any guidelines regarding the way in which these parameters must be tuned.</p><p>Lu and Chen <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[166]</ref> proposed an approach called self-adaptive velocity particle swarm optimization (SAVPSO) to solve CNOPs. This approach relies on an analysis based on three elements: (1) the position of the feasible region with respect to the whole search space, (2) the connectivity and the shape of the feasible region, and (3) the ratio of the feasible region with respect to the search space. As a result of this analysis, the velocity update formula was modified in such a way that each particle has the ability to self-adjust its velocity according to the aforementioned features of the feasible region. The fitness of a solution is assigned based on its feasibility: feasible solutions are evaluated by their objective function value, while infeasible solutions are evaluated by their sum of constraint violation. The approach was tested on a set of 13 benchmark problems. The approach, however, showed some sensitivity to some of its parameters.</p><p>Spadoni and Stefanini <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[167]</ref> transformed a CNOP into an unconstrained search problem by sampling feasible directions instead of solutions of a CNOP. Thereafter, three special operators, related to feasible directions for box constraints, linear inequality constraints, and quadratic inequality constraints, are utilized to generate new solutions by using DE as the search engine. The main contribution of the approach is that it transforms a CNOP into an unconstrained search problem without using a penalty function. However, it cannot deal with nonlinear (either equality or inequality) constraints.</p><p>Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[168]</ref> and Li and Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[169]</ref> modified variation operators in NIAs in such a way that the recombination of feasible and infeasible solutions led to the generation of more feasible solutions. An adaptive mechanism to maintain infeasible solutions was added to the approach. This latter version was specifically based on DE's variation operators <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[169]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The recent proposals based on the use of special operators that have been revised here emphasize the current focus on generating proposals which are easier to generalize. Such is the case of the definition of boundary operators in ACO <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[160]</ref> and DE <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[161]</ref>. Moreover, there are operators to approximate equality <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[162,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">163,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">165]</ref> and inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[164]</ref> constraints. Finally, there have also been attempts to modify variation operators of some NIAs aiming to tailor them to a certain (desirable) behavior when solving CNOPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[166,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">168,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">169]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Use of multi-objective concepts</head><p>In spite of the fact that empirical evidence has suggested that multi-objective concepts are not well-suited to solve CNOPs, there are highly competitive constraint-handling techniques based on such concepts.</p><p>Motivated by the idea of keeping suitable infeasible solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">170]</ref> Ray et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[171]</ref> proposed the Infeasibility Driven Evolutionary Algorithm (IDEA) whose replacement process requires the definition of a proportion of infeasible solutions to remain in the population for the next generation. IDEA works in a similar way as NSGA-II <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref>. Nonetheless, an additional objective, besides the original objective function, is added. This objective consists on the constraint violation measure, whose value is computed as follows: each individual in the population has a rank for each constraint of the CNOP being solved and each rank value depends on the constraint violation value for such solution (lower values are ranked higher because they represent a smaller violation for a constraint). If a solution satisfies the constraint, a zero rank is assigned to it. After each solution is ranked for each constraint, the violation measure is computed as the sum of ranks per solution. After the offspring are generated, the union of parents and offspring is split in two sets, one with the feasible solutions and the other with the infeasible ones. Non-dominated sorting is used to rank both sets separately and, based on the proportion of desired feasible solutions, they are chosen first from the infeasible set and later on, the best ranked feasible solutions are chosen. IDEA is able to work with CNOPs and also with constrained numerical multi-objective optimization problems (CNMOPs). However, its performance has been more competitive when solving CNMOPs. The usage of local search, sequential quadratic programming in this case, was added to IDEA in the so-called Infeasibility Empowered Memetic Algorithm (IMEA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[172]</ref>. The approach was tested in eighteen scalable test problems and its performance improved with respect to the original IDEA when solving CNOPs. However, the local search algorithm adopted requires gradient calculation.</p><p>Reynoso-Meza et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[173]</ref> proposed the spherical-pruning multi-objective optimization differential evolution (sp-MODE) to solve CNOPs, which were transformed into three-objective optimization problems, where the first objective was the original objective function, the second objective was the sum of constraint violation for inequality constraints and the third objective was the sum of constraint violation for equality constraints. An external archive was used to store non-dominated solutions. The spherepruning operator aims to find the best trade-off between feasibility and the optimization of the objective function. The approach required the definition for some parameter values depending of the number of constraints. However, the sphere-pruning operator might be an interesting operator to be applied in some parts of the search.</p><p>Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[174]</ref> proposed the use of Pareto dominance in a Hybrid Constrained EA (HCOEA) to solve a CNOP which was transformed into a bi-objective optimization problem. In this case, the first objective is the original objective function while the second one is the sum of constraint violation. A global search carried out by an EA is coupled to a local search operator based on a population division scheme and on the use of the SPX operator. In both cases, Pareto dominance is the criterion adopted to select solutions. The approach was tested in 13 benchmark problems and the results were found to be competitive with respect to four state-of-the-art algorithms. However, the approach requires the definition of two crossover probabilities (one for the global search and another for the local search) as well as the number of subsets in which the population will be divided. HCOEA showed some sensitivity to this last parameter.</p><p>Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">[175]</ref> proposed an steady state EA to solve a CNOP which was also transformed into a bi-objective problem. At each generation, a set of offspring solutions are generated by applying orthogonal crossover to a randomly chosen set of solutions in the current population. After that, the non-dominated solutions obtained from the set of offspring are chosen. If there are no feasible offspring, two randomly chosen solutions from the set of parents will be replaced by the offspring which dominate them. Alternative, solutions can also be chosen if they have a lower sum of constraint violation. Furthermore, the individual with the lowest sum of constraint violation will replace the worst parent in the population. If there are feasible offspring, based on a user-defined probability, two randomly chosen parents will be replaced by two offspring which dominate them. Otherwise, the worst parent, based on feasibility rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, will be replaced by one offspring. After the steady state replacement, all solutions are affected by an improved version of the BGA mutation operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[176]</ref> based on a user-defined probability. The approach was tested in a set of 11 test problems and showed competitive results in some of them, but premature convergence was observed in others. Furthermore, some additional parameters need to be defined by the user.</p><p>Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[177]</ref>, in their adaptive trade-off model (ATM) evolution strategy (ATMES), divided the search in three phases based on the feasibility of solutions in the population: (1) only infeasible solutions, (2) feasible and infeasible solutions, and</p><p>(3) only feasible solutions. Owing to the fact that the CNOP was transformed into a bi-objective problem, the selection in the first phase was based on Pareto dominance. From the Pareto front obtained, the solutions were ranked in ascending order based on the sum of constraint violation and the first half was chosen to survive for the next generation and was deleted from the set. The process was repeated until the desirable number of solutions was achieved. The second phase was biased by a fitness value which is adapted based on the percentage of feasible solutions in the population. The last stage was biased only by the objective function value. The approach provided competitive results in 13 test problems. However, ATMES required some parameters related to the tolerance for equality constraints and the stepsize employed by the ES used as the search engine. This same ATM was coupled by Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[178]</ref> with a NIA in which the offspring generation was as follows: An offspring was generated by one of two variation operator: (1) simplex crossover or (2) one of two mutations (uniform mutation or improved BGA mutation). The approach, besides being tested on a set of 13 benchmark problems, was used to solve some engineering design problems. The results obtained by the authors were found to be very competitive, but some cases of premature convergence were reported. Another improvement to the ATM, which is based on a shrinking mechanism proposed by Hernández-Aguirre et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, was proposed by <ref type="bibr">Wang et al. [179]</ref>. This approach, called Accelerated ATM (AATM), outperformed both the original ATM and the approach proposed by Hernández-Aguirre et al. However, additional parameters (which are required by the shrinking mechanism) were introduced by the authors. The ATM was coupled with DE in a recent approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[180]</ref>, showing an improvement in the results with respect to previous versions of the same algorithm. Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref> used the ATM in an EA but with two main differences: (1) good point set crossover was used to generate offspring and (2) feasibility rules were the criteria to select solutions in the second stage of the ATM (at which there are feasible and infeasible solutions in the current population). The approach was tested in some benchmark problems. However, the performance of the proposed crossover operator was not found to be clearly better with respect to the previous version of this approach reported by Wang et al. (in which an ES is adopted as the search engine) <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[177]</ref>.</p><p>Gong and Cai <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[181]</ref> used Pareto dominance in the manyobjective space defined by the constraints of a problem as a constraint-handling mechanism in a DE-based approach. An orthogonal process was employed for both, generating the initial population and for applying crossover. Furthermore, the ϵ-dominance concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">[182]</ref> was adopted to update an external archive in which the non-dominated solutions found during the search were stored. Orthogonal crossover was applied after DE generated the offspring population. In fact, an intermediate child population was designed to store the offspring which were nondominated with respect to their parents. The aim is to perform a non-dominance checking on the union of the parent population and the offspring population as a replacement mechanism at the end of each generation of the algorithm. Although the approach provided competitive results in a set of 13 test problems, the contribution of each of the additional mechanisms adopted is not clear. Additionally, no information is provided regarding the fine-tuning required for the parameters required by this approach.</p><p>Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">[183]</ref> solved a CNOP which was also transformed into a bi-objective optimization problem by using a PSO algorithm in which Pareto dominance was used as a criterion in the pbest update process and in the selection of the local-best leaders in a neighborhood. In case of ties, the sum of constraint violation worked as a tie-breaker. A mutation operator was also added to keep the approach from converging prematurely. Additionally, a small tolerance was used to consider as feasible to solutions that were slightly infeasible (this is similar to the ε-constrained method but with a fixed value instead of a dynamic one). The approach was tested only on three engineering design problems.</p><p>Venter and Haftka <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">[184]</ref> also transformed a CNOP into a biobjective optimization problem and used PSO as their search engine. However, the leader selection was based most of the time on the sum of constraint violation, while the rest of the time the criterion was one of the three following choices: (1) the original objective function, (2) the crowding distance or (3) Pareto dominance. The approach was tested on several benchmark problems and some engineering design problems.</p><p>Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">[185]</ref> used a hybrid selection mechanism based on Pareto dominance and tournament selection into a Adaptive Bacterial Foraging Algorithm (ABFA) to solve CNOPs. The approach uses the so-called good nodes set method to initialize the population, to perform crossover and to spread similar individuals throughout the search space. The approach was tested in a set of benchmark problems and in some engineering design problems, providing competitive results in both cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Based on the taxonomy proposed by Mezura-Montes and Coello Coello in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> and described in Section 2.4, both CNOP's transformations (both into a bi-objective problem and into a general multi-objective problem, i.e., having more than two objectives), have been popular in the literature.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.">Ensemble of constraint-handling techniques</head><p>Motivated by the no free lunch theorems <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">[187]</ref>, Mallipeddi and Suganthan <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[188]</ref> proposed an ensemble of four constraint techniques: feasibility rules, stochastic ranking, a self-adaptive penalty function and the ε-constrained method in a four subpopulation scheme designed to solve CNOPs. Two versions were presented, one based on a modified version of a classical evolutionary programming (EP) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref>, and another based on DE which was initially tested on eighteen scalable test problems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[189]</ref> and further tested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[188]</ref>. Each constrainthandling technique was used to evolve an specific sub-population. Unlike typical island models in parallel NIAs, in which subpopulations evolve separately, in the ECHT there is a close communication among them since these sub-populations share all of their offspring, i.e., an individual disregarded by its subpopulation may survive in another population. Based on their experiments, the authors concluded that the ECHT performs better than any of the constraint-handling techniques that it contains. The approach was extensively tested on a set of 37 test problems. The results obtained by both ECHT versions were highly competitive. However, the main drawback of the approach is the calibration required (from the user) for each of the constraint-handling techniques adopted.</p><p>Elsayed et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref> proposed a DE-based algorithm where the combination of four DE-mutations, two DE recombinations and two constraint-handling techniques (feasibility rules and ε-constrained method) generated sixteen variants which were assigned to each individual in a single-population algorithm. The rate of usage for each variant was based on its improvement ability measured by its ability to improve solutions. Moreover, a local search algorithm was applied to a random solution at some generations. The approach was tested on a set of 18 test problems with 10 and 30 dimensions, showing a very competitive performance. Its main drawback, as in the previous approach mentioned in this section, is the number of parameters to be tuned by the user.</p><p>A similar idea was presented in a combination of two DE variants and a variable neighborhood search with three constrainthandling techniques (feasibility rules, ε-constrained method, and an adaptive penalty function) by Tasgetiren et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">[190]</ref>. The approach was tested on eighteen test scalable test problems in 10D and 30D. No comparisons nor discussion were included in the paper but it is clear that the constraint-handling mechanisms (with the exception of the feasibility rules) must be fine-tuned by the user.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The ECHT opens a new paradigm in constraint-handling techniques: the design of mechanisms that allows the combination of approaches that can be seen as complementary (in terms of the way in which they operate). Furthermore, the study of different search algorithms (EP and DE in this case) also generates a new research trend in which the aim is to understand better the behavior of different NIAs when coupled to constraint-handling techniques (some studies in this direction already exist, but they have focused only on one particular type of constrainthandling technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">97]</ref>). However, as the combination of several techniques considerably enhances the capabilities of an approach, it is also required to define parameter values for each of these techniques in such a way that a proper balance is maintained. In other words, parameter control <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[191]</ref> becomes an important issue when designing ensemble approaches. It is also worth noting the similarities between ensemble approaches and hyper-heuristics as discussed later in this paper.</p><p>A summary of the main features of each constraint-handling technique is provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Future trends</head><p>From the literature review reported in this paper, it is clear that there currently exist several well-established constrainthandling techniques available for solving CNOPs. However, there still are several research topics which have attracted little attention from researchers. A list of such topics which constitute, from the authors' perspective, promising paths for future research, is provided next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Constraint-handling for multi-objective optimization</head><p>As stated by Yen <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[196]</ref> and by Ray et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[171]</ref>, the development of constraint-handling techniques for multi-objective optimization problems has received relatively little attention in the specialized literature. This may be due to the fact that most researchers assume that any constraint-handling technique developed for single-objective optimization can be easily coupled to a multi-objective algorithm. For example, death-penalties <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">[197]</ref>, adaptive penalty functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">[198,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b199">199]</ref>, use of constraints as objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[200]</ref>, stochastic ranking <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[201]</ref>, feasibility rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b202">202,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">203]</ref> (with a modification in the first rule, in which two feasible solutions are compared, since in this case non-dominance is checked instead of comparing objective function values), and special operators based on gradient information <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">[204]</ref> have all been coupled to multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.</p><p>There are, however, constraint-handling techniques that were specifically designed for multi-objective problems. Such techniques mostly rely on the use of Pareto dominance or Pareto ranking. For example, Ray et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> proposed the use of Pareto ranking in objective function space, constraints space, or both. Young <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[205]</ref> proposed the use of a combined value obtained from blending rankings from the objective and constraint spaces. Isaacs et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[170]</ref> and Ray et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[171]</ref> proposed the use of non-dominated sorting for feasible and infeasible solutions, separately, and Singh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">[206]</ref> proposed the use of non-dominance checking combined with a special operator to favor constraints satisfaction in simulated annealing. Finally, Qu and Suganthan <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">[207]</ref> reported the usage of the ensemble of three constraint-handling techniques (superiority of feasible points, ε-constrained method and an adaptive penalty function) to solve a set of well-known constrained multi-objective optimization problems.</p><p>There are other topics within this area that remain almost unexplored. For example, performance measures that are appropriate for constraint-handling techniques used in multi-objective optimization, diversity mechanisms specially designed for constrained search spaces, boundary operators for multi-objective problems, among others.</p><p>An interesting topic that has attracted a lot of attention in the evolutionary multi-objective optimization literature is the socalled many-objective optimization, in which many (i.e., four or more) objectives are considered. Many-objective optimization is strongly related to constraint-handling techniques, particularly when defining constraints as objectives. In this regard, there is some work from Saxena and Deb <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">[208]</ref> in which the use of dimensionality reduction approaches has been explored to evaluate the importance of the constraints of a CNOP. The approach was later extended to constrained multi-objective optimization problems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">[209]</ref>. Additionally, Saxena et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b210">[210]</ref> have explored the solution of constrained many-objective optimization problems, but there is practically no work done in this area yet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Constraint approximation</head><p>In spite of the fact that fitness approximation methods have been extensively applied to unconstrained optimization problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">[211,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b212">212]</ref>, their use in CNOPs remains scarce. There are a few papers that report the use of approximation methods for equality and inequality constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[162]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[163]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[164]</ref> as well as the use of fitness inheritance to solve CNOPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[213]</ref>. However, the use of approximation techniques for dealing with CNOPs is still relatively rare, opening the possibility for new developments that could be very valuable for real-world applications (when dealing with expensive constrained objective functions).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Dynamic constraints</head><p>Nowadays, there is a considerable amount of research devoted to deal with dynamic optimization problems. However, most of this work is focused on unconstrained search spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">[214]</ref> and very few efforts have focused on constrained problems. For example, Nguyen and Yao <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">[215]</ref> adopted a penalty function and a special operator to transform infeasible solutions into feasible ones. An interesting conclusion in this preliminary study was the convenience of using special operators instead of keeping or maintaining diversity in the population, as normally done in unconstrained dynamic optimization problems. Singh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">[216]</ref> used their IDEA algorithm (based on multi-objective concepts to handle constraints) as a sub-evolve mechanism within a framework to solve dynamic CNOPs (DCNOPs). Clearly, more work in this direction is still required. Furthermore, more test problems and appropriate performance measures are required in this area <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">[215]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Hyper-heuristics</head><p>Hyper-heuristics, are approaches in which several metaheuristics act at different stages during the search, as determined by a centralized control mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">[217]</ref>. Hyper-heuristics have been popular in combinatorial optimization, but their use in constrained problems is almost unexistent. The authors are aware of only one work in this direction, which remains unpublished (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">[218]</ref>). It is evidently expected that hyper-heuristics become more popular in this area in the years to come. In fact, hyper-heuristics share clear similarities with the ensemble of constraint-handling techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">188,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">190]</ref>, and with approaches that adopt different variation operators in the same NIA <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>. However, no specific hyper-heuristic mechanisms were defined in any of those approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Theory</head><p>Theoretical studies on constrained optimization using NIAs are also very scarce. There is some work on runtime analysis in constrained search spaces with EAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">[219]</ref> and also in the usefulness of infeasible solutions in the search process <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">[220]</ref>. Other theoretical studies have focused on some ES variants, such as the (1 + 1)-ES <ref type="bibr" target="#b221">[221]</ref> and more recently the (1, λ)-ES <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">[222]</ref>, in both cases focused on the solution of a simple CNOP. However, more research in this area is required. It would be interesting, for example, to analyze convergence and fitness landscapes in the presence of constraints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>This paper has presented a literature review of techniques to adapt NIAs to the solution of CNOPs. Based on an updated and relatively brief taxonomy of approaches that has been introduced in previous surveys on this topic, the most representative constraint-handling techniques currently available were briefly discussed and analyzed. From the review presented here, the following conclusions can be drawn:</p><p>1. Although in the early days of this area, a wide variety of approaches were developed, today, there is clear trend to adopt and further develop a small set of approaches which have been found to be competitive in a variety of problems. Thus, we can say that exploitation is now being favored as opposed to the exploration that characterized the early days of this field. 2. Feasibility rules is the most popular constraint-handling technique in current use. This is due to its simplicity and effectiveness and in spite of the fact that it is prone (when it is not properly coupled to a NIA) to cause premature convergence. Overall, this approach has been found to provide a stable behavior for solving constrained optimization problems using NIAs, as reflected by a number of studies in that direction. This approach has also been commonly adopted when studying other topics related to constrained optimization (e.g., design of variation operators, parameter control, termination conditions, etc.), also because of its simplicity. 3. DE is the most popular search engine found in constrained optimization. This is due to its good and consistent performance and to its simplicity (normally, very few changes are required to make it work well in a wide variety of CNOPs).</p><p>4. SR remains as a highly competitive and relatively simple constraint-handling technique, and has been coupled to several NIAs, from which DE is the most popular choice and PSO is the less popular. 5. Regarding penalty functions, they still remain popular (particularly in engineering optimization). The most preferred approaches are those incorporating adaptive mechanisms to define the penalty factor values, and the most popular search engine is the GA. In this regard, the development of specialized variation operators that are specifically designed to deal with constraints may be not only interesting, but can also be a good alternative to reduce the computational cost typically required by most adaptation mechanisms. 6. Memetic algorithms for solving CNOPs are becoming more popular in the literature, even surpassing other hybrid approaches (i.e., those combining features of two or more different NIAs).</p><p>In this regard, the development of new local search strategies that are specifically designed for constrained search spaces is a promising research topic. 7. Some special operators have been designed to be easier to generalize, making them more popular in the literature. 8. Several research topics need to be tackled or revisited. The design of constraint-handling techniques for dynamic and/or multi-objective problems, the use of fitness approximation and surrogate methods, the use of hyper-heuristics, the study of fitness landscapes in the presence of constraints, the development of theoretical foundations for the approaches in current use are only some of the topics that deserve more research in the years to come.</p><p>To finish, it is fair to state that constrained numerical optimization using NIAs is still an active area of research that offers lots of opportunities to both newcomers and established researchers. As such, this area is expected to continue growing in the following years not only in terms of number of publications but also in terms of the depth of the work being undertaken.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
