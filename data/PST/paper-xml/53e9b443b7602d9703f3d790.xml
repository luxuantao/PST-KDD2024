<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>As a novel topic in recent information science, quantum computation is considered to be a promising candidate to overcome the limitations of classical computation. By exploiting the inherent properties of quantum mechanics <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, a quantum computation can find solutions of certain problems more efficiently than can a classical computation. Recent decades have witnessed a series of significant theoretical progresses in quantum information processing, such as Shor's integer factoring algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and Grover's search algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and some others <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The excellent properties of quantum computation have motivated extensive research on quantum information processing.</p><p>Digital image processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> is important in many practical applications. However, the explosive increase of image data calls for efficient classical image processing algorithms. To address this challenge, quantum image processing has been extensively investigated in the last decade. To utilize quantum states to store image information, four quantum image representation models, i.e., Qubit Lattice <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, Entangled Image <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, Real Ket <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, have been proposed. However, these existing quantum image models can only represent images sampled in Cartesian coordinates so that complex affine transformations such as rotation and scaling cannot be performed based on these models. Therefore, many complex quantum image processing algorithms cannot be designed based on the existing models.</p><p>In this paper, quantum log-polar image (QUALPI), a novel quantum image representation is proposed for storing and processing images sampled in log-polar coordinates for the first time. In QUALPI, three entangled qubit (2-dimensional quantum bit) sequences are utilized to store the gray scale information, the log-radius position and the angular position information of each pixel in a log-polar image. Every pixel will be stored into a basis state of a normalized superposition consisting of these qubit sequences, so they can be operated on simultaneously.</p><p>A QUALPI can be constructed from a classical image via a preparation whose complexity is approximately linear in the image size. Compared with the existing quantum image models, more geometric transformations can be performed easily based on QUALPI, including those complex ones such as symmetry transformation and rotation.</p><p>Image registration is the process of obtaining the correspondence between two images of the same scene or object but acquired with different sensors, times, or viewpoints. It is widely used in computer vision, medical imaging, automatic target recognition, and remote sensing image analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Based on the rotation transformation of QUALPI, a fast quantum image registration algorithm is designed which can achieve a quartic speedup over the classical image registration method. Therefore, QUALPI might be more flexible and suitable for complex quantum image processing than other state-of-the-art quantum image representations.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses related works. Section 3 describes the proposed quantum image representation model QUALPI as well as its preparation procedure. Two types of quantum geometry transformations based on QUALPI, i.e., symmetry transformation and rotation, are presented in Sect. 4 in detail. Then a fast quantum image registration algorithm is designed in Sect. 5 based on the rotation transformation of QUALPI. Finally, conclusion and possible future work are provided in Sect. 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>The utilization of quantum information processing in digital image processing has been quite successful in terms of performance improvement. So far, four quantum image models for storing and processing images have been proposed, i.e., Qubit Lattice <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, Entangled Image <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, Real Ket <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and FRQI <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Qubit Lattice <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> maps every pixel to a single qubit. Entangled Image <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> is similar to Qubit Lattice except that it utilizes the entangled state to express the relation of some certain pixels. Both of them are similar to classical digital images so it is easy to find quantum counterparts of classical image processing. However, they cannot provide any performance improvement.</p><p>Real Ket <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> utilizes the coefficients of a basis state of a qudit (4-dimensional quantum bit) sequence to represent the gray-scale of every pixel and stores an image into a quantum superposition.</p><p>The state-of-the-art model of FRQI <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for a 2 n × 2 n image is expressed as seen in the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">|I = 1 2 n 2 n -1 Y =0 2 n -1 X =0 (cos θ Y X |0 + sin θ Y X |1 ) |Y X (1)</formula><p>where θ Y X is the phase of the color qubit which denotes the gray-scale value of pixel (Y, X ).</p><p>In FRQI, the position information of every pixel is mapped to a basis state of a 2-dimensional qubit sequence, while the gray scale information is stored in the probability amplitude of a single qubit. Since these two models utilize the superposition of qubit sequence to store image, they can process the information of all pixels simultaneously.</p><p>Many researches on quantum image processing have been explored based on the existing quantum image models. The works in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> discussed some simple image geometric transformations and color transformations respectively; significant performance improvement of these quantum operations has been made compared with the classical image operations. Sun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> extended FRQI and utilized 3 qubits to represent the full color information for an RGBα image. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> improved FRQI and more complex color transformations could be performed based on the enhanced model. Iliyasu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> designed the quantum watermarking algorithms and obtained good performance. However, existing models can only store and process image sampled in Cartesian coordinates. Many complex affine transformations such as rotation and scaling cannot be performed with these models because a lot of irreversible interpolations are needed. Restricted quantum image transformations have limited the development of complex quantum image processing algorithms. This motivates us to find a better way of quantum image representation to overcome the above limits.</p><p>Log-polar coordinates is a well-known sampling method in the field of image processing. Many image processing algorithms have been studied based on log-polar sampling. Araujo and Dias <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> introduced the fundamental theory of log-polar sampling and analyzed two important properties, i.e., rotation and scale invariances. Based on log-polar sampling, Zokai and Wolberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, Matungka et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, Pun and Lee <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> designed novel algorithms for image registration, target recognition and image classification respectively. Matungka <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> pointed out that log-polar sampling is nonlinear and non-uniform, so adaptive polar sampling and logarithmic spiral sampling were designed to address the problem. For the peculiar properties, we see that log-polar sampling is more suitable for some complex image transformations such as rotation and scaling. However, as far as we know, there is no research on utilizing quantum mechanics to store and process images sampled in log-polar coordinates.</p></div>

In this section, the new model will be described in detail as well as the preparation procedure of QUALPI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Quantum image representation</head><p>Both Cartesian sampling and log-polar sampling are important 2-dimensional sampling methods. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, b show a comparison between the two sampling methods. In Cartesian coordinates, every pixel (X, Y ) is indexed in the horizontal and vertical  orientations. X and Y denote the positions in the two axes. While in log-polar coordinates, every pixel is sampled as (ρ, θ ) where ρ denotes the log-radius and θ the angular position. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref> depicts the sampling distribution of log-polar image in the angular and log-radius directions. From this aspect, the log-polar image can also be considered as a 2-dimensional pixel matrix.</p><p>The relationship between these two kinds of 2-dimensional image sampling methods is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ρ = log base (x -x c ) 2 + (y -y c ) 2 , (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">θ = tan -1 y -y c x -x c ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where (x c , y c ) denotes the center pixel of log-polar sampling in Cartesian coordinates and base is the logarithmic base.</p><p>Inspired by the FRQI quantum image model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, we propose a novel quantum representation QUALPI to store and process the log-polar images. The sampling resolutions of the log-radius and the angular orientations of a log-polar image are assumed to be 2 m and 2 n respectively. For this image, the quantum image representation can be expressed as seen in the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">|I = 1 √ 2 m+n 2 m -1 ρ=0 2 n -1 θ=0 (|g(ρ, θ ) ⊗ |ρ ⊗ |θ ) (4)</formula><p>where g(ρ, θ ) represents the gray scale of the corresponding pixel. The gray range of the image is assumed to be 2 q . Thus the gray scale can be encoded by binary sequence C 0 C 1 . . . C q-2 C q-1 as seen in the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">g(ρ, θ ) = C 0 C 1 . . . C q-2 C q-1 , g(ρ, θ ) ∈ [0, 2 q -1]<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> shows that the whole QUALPI quantum image is stored in a normalized and equiprobable quantum superposition, in which each basis state represents one pixel. The basis state is consisted of the tensor product of three qubit sequences, where all the information of a pixel, i.e., the gray scale, the log-radius position and the angular position, are stored in. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> demonstrates an example of a 2 × 8 log-polar image with gray range 256, i.e., m = 1, n = 3 and q = 8. It is obvious that the pixels in different quadrants have different gray scales. Meanwhile, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the quantum representation of the log-polar image is expressed and all pixels are stored in a normalized quantum superposition |I .</p><p>From (4), m + n + q qubits are utilized to store image information into a QUALPI state for a 2 m × 2 n log-polar image with gray range 2 q .</p><p>3.2 Quantum image preparation of QUALPI In order to utilize quantum mechanics in image processing, image information will be stored into quantum state firstly. Here how to prepare QUALPI quantum image from classical log-polar image will be discussed.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the workflow of the quantum image preparation of the QUALPI model. The whole procedure is divided into two steps. Firstly, for a 2 m × 2 n log-polar image with gray range 2 q , a quantum register with m + n + q qubits needs to be initialized as seen in the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">|I 0 = |0 ⊗m+n+q (6)</formula><p>Step 1: At first, we will construct an empty QUALPI with size 2 m × 2 n from the initial state |I 0 . Two common single quantum gates are shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, which will be utilized to build the quantum operation U 1 of this step as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">I = 1 0 0 1 , H = 1 √ 2 1 1 1 -1<label>(7</label></formula><p>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">U 1 = I ⊗q ⊗ H ⊗m+n<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Equation ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) represents the quantum transformation from the initial state |I 0 to the middle state |I 1 via using the quantum operation U 1 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">U 1 (|I 0 ) = |0 ⊗q ⊗ ⎛ ⎝ 1 √ 2 m 2 m -1 ρ=0 |ρ ⎞ ⎠ ⊗ ⎛ ⎝ 1 √ 2 n 2 n -1 θ=0 |θ ⎞ ⎠ Fig. 3</formula><p>The workflow of preparing the QUALPI quantum image model. The initial state will be transformed into the QUALPI model through two steps</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">= 1 √ 2 m+n 2 m -1 ρ=0 2 n -1 θ=0 |0 ⊗q |ρθ = |I 1 (9)</formula><p>The middle state |I 1 is an empty quantum image with size 2 m × 2 n , every pixel in which is stored in a normalized quantum superposition and the gray scale is 0.</p><p>Step 2: Next we should set the gray scales of all pixels in the middle state |I 1 . Because the log-polar image resolution is 2 m × 2 n , 2 m+n sub-operations are needed to set gray scale for every pixel individually in this procedure.</p><p>For pixel (ρ, θ ), the quantum operation for gray scale setting is Ω ρθ as <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. In this operation, every qubit in the gray scale qubit sequence is processed according to the binary code of the gray scale value g(ρ, θ ) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. When C i = 1, the ith qubit will be operated on by a controlled gate (m + n) -C N ot. Otherwise, nothing will be done for the qubit.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Ω ρθ : |0 ⊗q → ⊗ i=0 q-1 |0 ⊕ C i ⊗ i=0 q-1 |0 ⊕ C i = ⊗ i=0 q-1 |C i = |g(ρ, θ )<label>(10)</label></formula><p>The sub-operation to set gray scale for pixel (ρ, θ ) will not affect other pixels. Therefore for every sub-operation in Step 2, the normalized quantum operation is expressed as U ρθ in the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">U ρθ = ⎛ ⎝ I ⊗q ⊗ 2 m -1 j=0 2 n -1 i=0, ji =ρθ | ji ji| ⎞ ⎠ + Ω ρθ ⊗ |ρθ ρθ| (11)</formula><p>Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">12</ref>) denotes the quantum transformation of applying every sub-operation on the middle state |I 1 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">U ρθ (|I 1 ) = U ρθ ⎛ ⎝ 1 √ 2 m+n 2 m -1 ρ=0 2 n -1 θ=0 |0 ⊗q |ρθ ⎞ ⎠ = 1 √ 2 m+n U ρθ ⎛ ⎝ 2 m -1 j=0 2 n -1 i=0, ji =ρθ |0 ⊗q | ji + |0 ⊗q |ρθ ⎞ ⎠ = 1 √ 2 m+n ⎛ ⎝ 2 m -1 j=0 2 n -1 i=0, ji =ρθ |0 ⊗q | ji + Ω ρθ |0 ⊗q |ρθ ⎞ ⎠ = 1 √ 2 m+n ⎛ ⎝ 2 m -1 j=0 2 n -1 i=0, ji =ρθ |0 ⊗q | ji + |g(ρ, θ ) |ρθ ⎞ ⎠<label>(12)</label></formula><p>From ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">12</ref>), every sub-operation can set the gray scale for the corresponding pixel. Therefore, the whole operation U 2 shown in ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) is consisted of all the aforementioned sub-operations.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">U 2 = 2 m -1 ρ=0 2 n -1 θ=0 U ρθ (13)</formula><p>Through the quantum operation U 2 , all pixels have been set gray scales and the quantum state |I 2 is the final quantum image.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">U 2 (|I 1 ) = 1 √ 2 m+n 2 m -1 ρ=0 2 n -1 θ=0 Ω ρθ |0 ⊗q |ρθ = 1 √ 2 m+n 2 m -1<label>ρ=0</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">2 n -1 θ=0 |g(ρ, θ ) |ρθ = |I 2<label>(14)</label></formula><p>After these two steps, the whole quantum image preparation has been finished. Then we will discuss the time complexity of this preparation procedure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem 1</head><p>In order to store a 2 m × 2 n log-polar image with gray range 2 q into the QUALPI quantum image model, the whole quantum image preparation will cost no more than O(q</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">(m + n) • 2 m+n ).</formula><p>Proof The whole preparation is divided into two steps. The time complexities of each step will be analyzed as follows.</p><p>Firstly, the quantum operation of</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">Step 1 is U 1 . From (8), it is known that U 1 will cost O(q + m + n) because it is consisted of q + m + n single quantum gates.</formula><p>Secondly, the main work U 2 of Step 2 is to set gray scale for all the pixels in the quantum image. The whole operation is consisted of 2 m+n sub-operations shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</p><p>Every sub-operation U ρθ will perform the quantum operation Ω ρθ for the corresponding pixel. In this quantum transformation, the ith qubit in the gray scale qubit sequence of QUALPI will be operated on by a controlled quantum gate if the corresponding binary bit C i of g(ρ, θ ) is equal to 1. Note that all the controlled quantum gates are (m + n) -C N ot (this quantum gate can be decomposed to no more than O(m +n) Toffoli gates <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>). Therefore, the time complexity of the quantum operation U ρθ is no more than O(q(m + n)). And the whole operation of Step 2 will cost no more than O(q(m + n) • 2 m+n ).</p><p>Based on the aforementioned analyses, for a 2 m × 2 n log-polar image with gray range 2 q , the time complexity of the whole quantum image preparation of QUALPI is no more than O(q(m + n) • 2 m+n ), which is approximately linear to the resolution of the log-polar image.</p><p>According to the Holevo Bound Theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, when an exponential amount of the classical image information is encoded into the QUALPI state via quantum image preparation, we will not be able to retrieve the whole image information perfectly via quantum measurements. Therefore the proposed quantum image model and algorithms cannot be used in image-showing tasks.</p><p>In general, the aim of many image processing tasks is not to show the whole image, but to extract a little of more important information through analyzing the image data (for example, these image processing tasks always need to solve some problems like "whether or not the image contains a target of interest","which pixel in the image has the minimum gray-scale" and "how many targets the image has" and so on. The commonness of these tasks is that the output is a Boolean or Integer which is no more than Holevo's bound). QUALPI is designed for these kinds of image processing tasks. It utilizes a quantum superposition to encode the image information so that the quantum image processing algorithm based on QUALPI which will be discussed later can achieve an amazing speedup compared with the classical counterpart. That is the reason why we discuss the quantum image processing and design the quantum image representation QUALPI.</p></div>

For the classical images, the position information of all pixels needs to be modified during symmetry transformations. Therefore, when the sampling resolution is large, the time requirements of these image operations are unacceptable.

Three kinds of symmetry transformations are discussed, including quantum centrosymmetry, quantum horizontal axisymmetry and quantum vertical axisymmetry.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion and future work</head><p>Quantum computation has become a novel and important tool in the field of image processing. In this paper, a novel quantum image model QUALPI is proposed. Different from the existing quantum image models, QUALPI is, for the first time, designed for the images sampled in log-polar coordinates.</p><p>Since all the pixels of a log-polar image can be stored and operated on simultaneously in the QUALPI model, some complex geometric transformations, such as quantum symmetry transformation and quantum rotation transformation, can be performed. Based on a fast quantum image expanding algorithm and quantum image searching, a quantum image registration algorithm is proposed to obtain the rotation difference between two quantum images. Compared with the classical brute-force image registration method, the new quantum image registration algorithm can achieve a quartic speedup. Therefore, QUALPI is more suitable for complex image processing than the existing quantum image models in the literature.</p><p>In the QUALPI model, for each radius, the circumference is sampled with the same number of sample pixels. Hence, image pixels close to the center are oversampled while those which are far away from the center are under-sampled, which is a drawback of the sampling method of the log-polar image. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, adaptive log-polar and logarithmic spiral are proposed to address the non-uniform sampling problem. Designing proper quantum image models for these enhanced log-polar images will be one of our future researches. In addition, since rotation is only one kind of the affine transformations, the proposed quantum image registration algorithm is still preliminary for practical applications. How to utilize quantum mechanics to design a more powerful quantum image registration algorithm accounting for real affine transformations is also worth investigating in the future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 a</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 a A 4 × 4 image example sampled in Cartesian coordinates. b A 4 × 8 image example sampled in log-polar coordinates. base = 2. c The sampling distribution of b in the angular and log-radius directions</figDesc><graphic coords="4,53.40,465.47,331.72,113.44" type="bitmap" /></figure>
