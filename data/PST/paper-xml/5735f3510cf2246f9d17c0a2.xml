<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper is concerned with the distributed consensus tracking problem of uncertain multiagent systems with directed communication topology and a single high-dimensional leader. Compared with existing related works, the dynamics of each follower in the present framework are subject to unmodeled dynamics and unknown external disturbances, which is more practical in various applications. Furthermore, the dimensions of leader's dynamics may be different with those of the followers' dynamics. Under the mild assumption that each follower can directly or indirectly sense the output information of the leader, a distributed robust adaptive neural network controller together with a local observer are designed to each follower to ensure that the states of each follower ultimately synchronize to the leader's output with bounded residual errors under a fixed topology. By appropriately constructing some multiple Lyapunov functions, the derived results are further extended to consensus tracking with switching directed communication topologies. The effectiveness of the analytical results is demonstrated via numerical simulations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>in recent studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Consensus, as one of the most important collective behaviors in multiagent systems, has received particular attention within this context <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. It indeed is a familiar phenomenon seen in our daily life, typical examples in point include fireflies flashing in unison, heading consensus of birds, phase synchrony of brain dynamics, among many others.</p><p>Many efforts have been made to investigate how to achieve consensus in multiagent systems under dynamically changing communication environments. As a result, many profound results have been obtained and reported in the literature (see survey paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and some references therein). By using tools from algebraic graph theory and control theory, it was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> that consensus for networks of agents with single-integrator dynamics can be achieved if and only if the time-varying directed network topology jointly has a spanning tree as the network evolves on time. Consensus of second-order multiagent systems with jointly-connected topologies was investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> by using the Lyapunovbased analysis approach. Recently, robust consensus control for multiagent systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, consensus with adaptive coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, consensus in multiagent systems with state constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and consensus in general linear multiagent systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> have been also investigated by researchers from various scientific communities. According to the presence or absence of a leader in the considered multiagent systems, consensus problems can be divided into two categories: 1) leaderless consensus and 2) consensus tracking problems. Leaderless consensus means that the states of all dynamic agents could achieve a prior unknown agreement. In contrast, the states of the multiple agents in the context of consensus tracking framework will converge to a predesigned state trajectory. By constructing a local controller incorporated with a neighbor-based state estimation rule, consensus tracking for multiagent systems with an active leader and variable topology for first-and second-order followers were investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, respectively. Robustness performance indexes of consensus tracking in firstand second-order multiagent systems were, respectively, analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> by using tools from frequency-domain approach. By using pinning control approach, consensus tracking for a class of multiagent systems with nonlinear coupling was considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Furthermore, consensus tracking problem for multiagent systems with Lipschitztype nonlinear dynamics was studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. These studies have advanced our knowledge on how to achieve 2168-2267 c 2016 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission.</p><p>See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information.</p><p>consensus tracking in a group of multiple agents with a single leader. However, one common assumption in most existing literature on consensus tracking problem of multiagent systems is that the leader and the followers have identical dynamic models. Such an assumption offers us ability to directly analyze the evolution of consensus tracking errors for the closedloop multiagent systems. Comparatively speaking, consensus tracking problem for multiagent systems where the dynamics of leader and those of the followers described by heterogeneous models has not received substantial attention. Note that, in some practical cases, dynamics of the leader are more complex than those of the followers and only some partial information on the leader can be sensed by a fraction of team members. Two examples are distributed sensor networks with a complex target system <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and the tractor-trailer systems with a fire truck and several trailers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. A general framework for analyzing the consensus tracking problem of multiagent systems with a high-dimensional leader has been suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Obviously, a deep research on consensus tracking of multiagent systems with a high-dimensional leader is a critical step to study the collective behaviors of heterogeneous multiagent systems, thus benefiting engineers to implement communication protocols for tracking a target with strong maneuverability by using simple yet low-cost agents. However, in most of the aforementioned works, the priori knowledge concerning the exact model of agent dynamics is needed for protocol design. But oftentimes, there may exist unmodeled uncertainties and unknown external disturbances in networked agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Recently, neuro-adaptive consensus tracking protocols have been developed for multiagent systems with unmodeled dynamics and unknown external disturbances under different scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Leaderless consensus and consensus tracking problems for first-order multiagent systems with nonlinear dynamics and unknown disturbances were, respectively, studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> by designing some new neuro-adaptive control protocols. By appropriately introducing some sliding model errors, neuro-adaptive consensus tracking problems for second-order and higher-order nonlinear multiagent systems in the presence of unknown external disturbances were investigated, respectively, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Then, by using a combined tool from neuro-adaptive design approach and output feedback theory, consensus tracking for general nonlinear multiagent systems with external disturbances was addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>This paper further investigates the consensus tracking problem for multiagent systems with a high-dimensional leader and switching directed topologies, with particular attention to the case that the dynamics of leader describe by a nonlinear system and the evolutions of the followers are described by linear systems but subject to unmodeled dynamics as well as unknown external disturbances. Hence, the existing analytical methods for solving the consensus tracking problem of multiagent systems with only nominal dynamics are inapplicable for this case. To solve such a consensus tracking problem, one need to first identify the unknown agent dynamics and then try best to compensate them in the closed-loop multiagent systems. Another challenge in solving such a problem is that the measurable output of high-dimensional leader is available only to a subset of followers. Motivated by the desire to compensate for the unmodeled dynamics and the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, a new kind of consensus tracking protocols consisting of a neuro-adaptive local controller and a distributed observer is designed in the present manuscript. Specifically, the neuro-adaptive distributed observer is designed based only on the relative information of neighboring agents, taking the role of reconstruct the unmeasurable state information of the leader; the local controller is designed to make the states of each follower track some carefully selected observers' states. It will be proven that when the fixed communication topology contains a directed spanning tree rooted at the leader and the control parameters of the protocol are appropriately designed, the states of followers can track the output of the leader with bounded residual errors. The results are then extended to the case with periodic switching directed topology where each possible topology contains a directed spanning tree rooted at the leader. Finally, some numerical simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Some preliminaries and the problem formulation are given in Section II. The main theoretical results are then provided in Section III. In Section IV, two numerical examples are presented. The conclusions are finally drawn in Section V.</p><p>Throughout this paper, let R be the set of real numbers and R n×p be the set of n × p real matrices, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Preliminaries</head><p>Let G(V, E, A) be a digraph with the set of vertices V = {1, 2, . . . , N + 1}, the set of directed edges E ⊆ {(i, j), i, j ∈ V}, and a weighted adjacency matrix A = [a ij ] (N+1)×(N+1) with non-negative elements a ij . The directed edge (i, j) in graph G(V, E, A) is associated with two ordered vertices i and j which are, respectively, called the parent and child vertices. Denote G(V, E, A) by G if there is no confusion will arise. A path on G from vertex i 1 to vertex i s is a sequence of ordered edges of the form (i k , i k+1 ), k = 1, 2, . . . , s -1. Note that only simple graph is considered here, i.e., multiple edges and self-loops are forbidden in G. A digraph is said to have or contain a directed spanning tree if there exists a node called root such that there exists a directed path from this node to each other node. The adjacency matrix A = [a ij ] (N+1)×(N+1) of a digraph G is defined by a ii = 0 for i = 1, 2, . . . , N + 1, and a ij &gt; 0 for ( j, i) ∈ E but 0 otherwise. The Laplacian matrix L = [l ij ] (N+1)×(N+1) is defined as l ij = -a ij , i = j, and l ii = N+1 k=1 a ik for i = 1, 2, . . . , N + 1. Lemma 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>: The Laplacian matrix L of digraph G has a simple zero eigenvalue and all the other eigenvalues have positive real parts if and only if G has a directed spanning tree.</p><p>Before moving on, some basic lemmas on matrix theory are provided as follows.</p><p>Lemma 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>: For any given x, y ∈ R n , and matrices P &gt; 0, D and S of appropriate dimensions, one has 2x T DSy ≤ x T DPD T x + y T S T P -1 Sy.</p><p>Suppose that M ∈ R n×n is a positive definite matrix and H ∈ R n×n is symmetric, one then has that matrix pencil H, M n×n is normal <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. By using the norm matrix pencil theory, one knows that all the eigenvalues of matrix M -1 H are real for any given symmetric matrix H ∈ R n×n and positive definite matrix M ∈ R n×n <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Based on the above analysis, one can establish the following lemma.</p><p>Lemma 3: Suppose that M ∈ R n×n is a positive definite matrix and H ∈ R n×n is symmetric. Then, for any vector x ∈ R n , the following inequality holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">λ min M -1 H x T Mx ≤ x T Hx ≤ λ max M -1 H x T Mx.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Problem Formulation</head><p>Consider a multiagent system consisting of N + 1 agents where agent N + 1 is designated as the leader and the rest are designated as the followers. The dynamics of the leader are described as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">θ(t) = Aθ(t) + g(θ (t), t) y(t) = Cθ(t).</formula><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">)<label>1</label></formula><p>The vector θ(t) ∈ R nm indicates the state of the leader, n and m are two positive natural numbers, A ∈ R nm×nm represents the system matrix, nonlinear function g(θ (t), t) : R nm × [0, +∞) → R nm is a continuously differentiable vector-valued function satisfying the global Lipschitz condition</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">g(ρ, t) -g( , t) ≤ γ ρ -, ∀ρ, ∈ R mn , t ≥ 0 (2)</formula><p>for some γ ≥ 0.

Furthermore, the nonlinear function g(θ (t), t) is assumed to be partitioned as g(θ (t</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">), t) = (g 1 (θ 1 (t), t) T , g 2 (θ 2 (t), t) T , . . . , g n (θ n (t), t) T ) T where g i (θ i (t), t) : R m × [0, +∞) → R m is a continuously differentiable vector-valued function.</formula><p>The vector y(t) ∈ R m is the output information of the leader which is assumed to be available to a subset of followers, output matrix C ∈ R m×nm .</p><p>For the convenience of analysis, it is assumed that</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">C = (O m , O m , . . . , O m , I m ) ∈ R m×nm and ( C, A) is detectable.</formula><p>Note that in many practical multiagent systems, the leader plays the role of a command generator providing a reference state for the followers to track. Thus, in this paper, it is assumed that the evolution of the leader will not be affected by those of any followers.</p><p>The dynamics of ith (1 ≤ i ≤ N) follower are given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">x i (t) = Ax i (t) + f i (x i (t)) + ω i (t) + u i (t)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">x i (t) = (x i1 (t), x i2 (t), . . . , x im (t)) T ∈ R m is the state vector, smooth functions f i (x i (t)) : R m → R m describe the unknown unmodeled dynamics, ω i (t) ∈ R m are the unknown disturbances, A ∈ R m×m is a known matrix.</formula><p>For practicability, it is assumed that the initial condition θ(0) is unknown to each follower and only the output information y(t) of the leader can be measured by some designed followers. The control goal in this paper is to design some consensus tracking protocols u i (t), i = 1, 2, . . . , N, under which the states of the followers ultimately track the output of the single leader [given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>] with bounded residual errors.</p><p>The communication topology among the N+1 agents is represented by a digraph G(V, E, A), where V = {1, 2, . . . , N+1} represents the set of agents, E is the set of edges (i.e., communication channels) and A = [a ij ] (N+1)×(N+1) is the adjacency matrix. Since the leader has no neighbors, one has that a (N+1)j = 0, for all j = 1, 2, . . . , N. Thus, the Laplacian matrix L of topology G can be partitioned as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">L = L a 0 T N 0<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">L ∈ R N×N and a = (a 1(N+1) , a 2(N+1) , . . . , a N(N+1) ) T ∈ R N .</formula><p>Here, a i(N+1) &gt; 0 if and only if follower i can directly sense the output information of the leader, i = 1, 2, . . . , N. In this paper, the controllers u i (t), (1 ≤ i ≤ N), are designed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">u i (t) = u ct i (t) + u ft i (t) (6)</formula><p>where u ct i (t) and u ft i (t) are, respectively, the observer-based compensation term and the local feedback term given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">u ct i (t) = Ãx i (t)+g n z n i (t), t + n-1 j=1 Ânj z j i (t)-αF n η i (t) u ft i (t) = -β x i (t) -z n i (t) -Ŵi (t) T ϕ i (x i (t)) (7) of which Ã = Ânn -A, z j i (t) ∈ R m , i = 1, 2, . . . , N, j = 1, 2, . . . , n, z i (t) = (z 1 i (t) T , z 2 i (t) T , . . . , z n i (t) T ) T ∈ R nm</formula><p>is the state of the estimator embedded at follower i such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">żk i (t) = g k z k i (t), t + n j=1 Âkj z j i (t) -αF k η i (t), k = 1, 2, . . . , n<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where Âkj , k = 1, 2, . . . , n, j = 1, 2, . . . , n, are given in (3), α and β are positive scalars to be selected, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">η i (t) = N j=1 a ij z n j (t) -z n i (t) + a i(N+1) y(t) -z n i (t)<label>(9)</label></formula><p>the feedback gain matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">F = (F T 1 , F T 2 , . . . , F T n )</formula><p>T and the coefficient matrices Ŵi (t), i = 1, 2, . . . , N, will be designed later.</p><p>Since the dimensions of the leader's and the followers' dynamics are different, the multiagent system under consideration is indeed heterogeneous. Further, only some partial information of the leader is available for some followers. To make the states of each follower ultimately synchronize to the output of the leader with bounded residual errors, the controller u i (t) associated with an estimator (8) are constructed. As it will be seen that the estimator z i (t), for each i = 1, 2, . . . , N, can be regarded as a full-order observer of the high-dimensional leader. Typically, only the relative local information between agents and the neighbors can be used for controller design within the context of multiagent system theory. In the present design framework, the vector η i (t) defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> represents the relative local information available to follower i (1 ≤ i ≤ N). However, to compensate the effect of unmeasurable states of high-dimensional leader on consensus tracking, the compensation term u ct i (t) defined in ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is utilized. Furthermore, the local feedback term u ft i (t) is designed to achieve consensus tracking and reduce the effect of followers' unknown unmodeled dynamics on consensus tracking. It is also worth pointing out that another possible way to solve such a distributed consensus tracking problem with partial information of the leader is the distributed output regulation-based approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>By noticing that the nonlinear functions f i (x i (t)), i = 1, 2, . . . , N, in (4) are smooth, it can be thus obtained from Stone-Weierstrass approximation theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_17">that f i (x i (t)) can be approximated on a compact set ⊂ R m by f i (x i (t)) = W T i ϕ i (x i (t)) + i , ∀x i (t) ∈<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">ϕ i (•) : R m → R s is a known basis function, W i ∈ R s×m is the ideal neural network (NN) weight matrix, i ∈ R m is the NN approximation error.

Assumption 1 holds if there is a follower in each such component that can directly sense the output of the leader. In this case, the minimum number of followers should be informed by the leader to make Assumption 1 hold is κ. Note also that, for a given directed graph, it is possible to find all of its strongly connected components in linear time. Furthermore, Assumptions 2 and 3 are quite standard in the filed of NN-based distributed control of multiagent systems (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>).</p><p>We are now in a position to formulate the consensus tracking problem considered in this paper.</p><p>Definition 1: The multiagent system consisting of the highdimensional leader (1) and the followers (4) equipped with the controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, is said to solve the consensus tracking problem with residual error &gt; 0, if, lim t→∞ x i (t)y(t) ≤ , for all i = 1, 2, . . . , N.</p><p>It is worth noting that, despite many significant achievements have been made on achieving consensus tracking/pinning synchronization for homogeneous networking systems, we continue to lack tools to efficiently guarantee consensus tracking for multiagent systems with unknown dynamics and a high-dimensional leader. The main challenges are twofold: first, to obtain the consensus tracking error system, one needs to reconstruct the unmeasurable dynamics of high-dimensional leader by designing distributed observers; and second, the effects of unmodeled dynamics and unknown external disturbances on consensus tracking should be coped with online while only local relative information is available.</p><p>Remark 2: Note that one closely related topic to consensus tracking of multiagent systems is the pinning synchronization of complex dynamical networks where it is always assumed that the full state information of the target node (i.e., the leader) is available to some following nodes (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>). Two slight differences between consensus tracking of multiagent systems and pinning synchronization of complex networks are summarized below. First, complex networks are typically refer to the large-scale graphs with nontrivial topological features while multiagent systems may have trivial topological properties; furthermore, the inner linking matrices of complex networks are commonly assumed to be fixed while the feedback gain matrices in communication protocols of multiagent systems are generally designable.</p></div>

It can be seen from Theorem 2 that, under some suitable conditions, practical consensus tracking may be ensured if the switching period h is larger than a threshold value. It should be noted that consensus tracking in multiagent system (4) with a high-dimensional leader (1) and directed switching topology can be achieved for an arbitrarily given positive switching period h if there exists a common Lyapunov function for the switched systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>. However, it is still a challenging yet unsolved problem to find a common Lyapunov for switched systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>. Furthermore, it is assumed in this paper that the communication channels among neighboring agents work perfectly and the actuators embedded in agents and network topology switch synchronously. It is interesting yet important to further consider how to ensure consensus tracking for multiagent system in the presence of packet dropouts <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, actuator failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, and asynchronous switching <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p><p>Remark 7: By using some similar manipulations as used in Remark 5, the solvability conditions for LMIs ( <ref type="formula">45</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">46</ref>) can be obtained. Since the observer error system (43) becomes a switched system, a class of multiple Lyapunov functions has been constructed to analyze the convergence property of its zero equilibrium point. It is also worth noting that the results given in Theorem 2 can be directly extended to the case of multiagent systems with aperiodic switching directed topologies by using dwell-time-based analysis approach (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>).</p><p>Remark 8: It is well known in the literature on NN-based control (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>) that the size of the compact set in which the states of the control plant are uniformly bounded is not needed in NN-based controller design. Specifically, it can be seen from Theorems 1 and 2 that the bound of the compact set in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> is not involved in consensus protocol design. In practical applications, the size of could be assumed to be as large as desired such that states x i (t) stay inside for all t &gt; 0. In this sense, the analytic results given in Theorems 1 and 2 are semi-global. It is also worth noting that the results of this paper will be global in the scenario where <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> hold for all x i (t) ∈ R m , i = 1, 2, . . . , N.</p></div>

Choose c1 = 0.001  and W i = 1000, for all i = 1, 2, 3, 4, it can be thus obtained from Theorem 2 that consensus tracking in the closed-loop multiagent system under the protocol designed by Algorithm 2 can be ensured.

CONCLUSION By using neuro-adaptive control approach, distributed consensus tracking problem for a class of multiagent systems with unmodeled dynamics and unknown disturbances has been addressed in this paper. In the considered system model, the dimensions of the leader are higher those of the leaders and only some partial state information of the leaders are available to a small group of followers. A distributed full order observer is developed to estimate the unmeasurable state information of the leader. To make the states of followers track the output of leader with bounded residual errors, a local controller based on the designed full-order observer is then proposed for each follower. Theoretical results on consensus tracking with both fixed and switching directed topologies have been derived and analyzed. Future works include the study on consensus tracking of multiple uncertain multiagent systems in the presence of multiple high-dimensional leaders.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
