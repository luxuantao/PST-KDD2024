<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> Recently, Olariu et al. [3]<p>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proposed to refer to a dynamic group of vehicles whose excess computing, sensing, communication, and storage resources can be coordinated and dynamically allocated to authorized users, as a vehicular cloud. One of the characteristics that distinguishes vehicular clouds from conventional clouds is the dynamically changing amount of available resources that, in some cases, may fluctuate rather abruptly. In this work, we envision a vehicular cloud involving cars in the long-term parking lot of a typical international airport. The patrons of such a parking lot are typically on travel for several days, providing a pool of cars that can serve as the basis for a datacenter at the airport. We anticipate a park and plug scenario where the cars that participate in the vehicular cloud are plugged into a standard power outlet and are provided Ethernet connection to a central server at the airport. In order to be able to schedule resources and to assign computational tasks to the various cars in the vehicular cloud, a fundamental prerequisite is to have an accurate picture of the number of vehicles that are expected to be present in the parking lot as a function of time. What makes the problem difficult is the time-varying nature of the arrival and departure rates. In this work, we concern ourselves with predicting the parking occupancy given time-varying arrival and departure rates. Our main contribution is to provide closed forms for the probability distribution of the parking lot occupancy as a function of time, for the expected number of cars in the parking lot and its variance, and for the limiting behavior of these parameters as time increases. In addition to analytical results, we have obtained a series of empirical results that confirm the accuracy of our analytical predictions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION</head><p>T HE past few years have witnessed the emergence of cloud computing (CC), a paradigm shift adopted both in the US and around the world, by information technology (IT) companies with a large installed infrastructure base that often goes underutilized <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The unmistakable appeal of CC is that it provides scalable access to computing resources and to a multitude of IT services. Not surprisingly, CC and cloud IT services have seen and continue to see a phenomenal adoption rate around the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Inspired by the success and promise of conventional cloud computing, Olariu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> developed a framework for leveraging the excess computing and storage resources in our vehicular fleet. For this purpose, they introduced the concept of a vehicular cloud, (VC), a nontrivial extension, along several dimensions, of the CC paradigm. Olariu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> have argued that in the past decade the vehicles on our roadways have grown in sophistication by leaps and bounds: present-day cars are endowed with powerful on-board computers and with an entire panoply of sensing devices intended to make our driving experience safer and more enjoyable. The most recent 2011 US-DOT statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> reveal that the registered vehicular fleet on American streets and roadways is almost 256 million vehicles strong and growing steadily. Statistics also show that most of these vehicles spend many hours per day parked in a parking garage, parking lot, or driveway. At the moment, the computing and storage resources of these vehicles are untapped and the opportunity for their use is wasted.</p><p>It is very likely that, given the right incentives, the owner of a vehicle will decide to rent out their on-board capabilities on-demand or on a per-hour or per-day basis, just as owners of large computing or storage facilities find it economically appealing to rent out their excess capacity. For example, we anticipate that in the near future air travelers will park and plug their cars in airport long-term parking lot. In return for free parking and other perks, they will allow their vehicle to participate, during their absence, in the airport datacenter. Likewise, the drivers of vehicles stuck in congested traffic will be more than willing to donate their computing resources so that municipal traffic management centers can run complex simulations designed to help alleviate the effects of congestion by city-wide rescheduling of traffic lights.</p><p>While these VCs may be used much like traditional clouds, their true novelty is that they may used to supplement a municipal department of transportation's computing resources during extended periods of traffic congestion or even during emergency conditions, such as an evacuation. In such scenarios, the VC can provide on-demand solutions to traffic events that had occurred but whose timely resolution cannot be met reasonably with preassigned assets or in a proactive fashion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Our Contributions</head><p>In a series of papers, Olariu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> discussed two types of potential VC applications. The first group includes two value-added applications that aggregate the computing capabilities of parked vehicles; these applications benefit from a VC but could, potentially, be run on top of conventional clouds. The second group includes two traffic-related applications that are highly dynamic in nature and cannot be run on conventional clouds. More specifically, Olariu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> suggested ways in which underutilized computing, networking, and storage facilities can be used effectively and/ or be shared between drivers or rented out to other customers over the Internet.</p><p>As already mentioned, the distinguishing characteristic that sets the VCs apart from conventional clouds is the dynamically changing amount of available resources. It is, therefore, clear that the VCs can only achieve their full potential if their basic architecture is tailored to offer a seamless integration and decentralized management of the cyber-physical resources of the participating vehicles. In particular, the VC architecture must dynamically adapt its managed vehicular resources allocated to an application according to dynamically changing requirements and systems conditions.</p><p>The main contribution of this work is to take the first step toward implementing a nontrivial form of a VC. Specifically, we envision a VC involving cars in the long-term parking lot of a typical international airport. The patrons of such a parking lot are typically on travel for several days, providing a rather stable pool of cars that can serve as the basis of a datacenter at the airport. We envision a park and plug scenario where the that cars that participate in the VC are plugged into a standard power outlet and are provided Ethernet connection to a central server at the airport.</p><p>The key ingredient in being able to assign various computing tasks to the various cars in the datacenter is to have a very accurate of picture of the number of vehicles that are present in the parking lot at any moment in time. What makes the problem difficult is the time-dependent arrival and departure rates. Since the amount of resources available is dynamic, the number of nodes at the datacenter is itself dynamically changing and it becomes extremely important to get a good handle on the amount of resources available, as a function of time. The number of vehicles in the parking lot (i.e., occupancy) can be best modeled as a stochastic process, with time-varying arrival and departure rates.</p><p>The key contributions of this work include closed forms for the probability distribution of the parking lot occupancy as a function of time; for the expected number of cars in the parking lot and its variance; and for the limiting behavior of these parameters as time increases. Extensive simulations conducted in parallel with our analytical derivations, have confirmed the accuracy of our analytical derivations.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 contains a succinct review of the state of the art; Section 2.1 offers a primer of cloud computing and services; Section 2.3 introduces the assumed vehicular model, while Section 2.4 looks at vehicular clouds and some of their possible applications. Section 3 discusses the details of the proposed datacenter. Therein, Section 3.1 offers a high-level discussion of our datacenter architecture. Further, Section 4 discusses the time-dependent probability of the presence of a given number of vehicles in the parking lot, of the expected number of cars and its variance, as well as the limiting behavior of these parameters as time increases. For the details of these derivations, the reader is referred to the supplemental file, which can be found on the Computer Society Digital Library at http://doi.ieeecomputersociety. org/10.1109/TPDS.2012.47, that accompanies this paper. Numerical results intended to see to what extent our theoretical predictions materialize in practice are then provided in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 offers concluding remarks and maps out directions for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Cloud Computing</head><p>Cloud computing started from the realization of the fact that instead of investing in infrastructure, businesses may find it useful to rent the infrastructure and sometimes the software needed to run their applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This powerful idea has been suggested, at least in part, by ubiquitous and relatively low-cost high-speed Internet, virtualization and advances in parallel and distributed computing and distributed databases. One of the key benefits of cloud computing is that it provides scalable access to computing resources and IT services. With CC, developers with innovative ideas for new Internet applications and services are no longer required to afford large upfront investments in hardware/software or human expertise to deploy their services or test their ideas.</p><p>Among the appealing contributions of CC are cloud services where not only computational resources and storage are rented, but also specialized services are provided on demand. In this context, a user may purchase the amount of services they need at the moment. As their IT needs grow and as their services and customer base expand, the users will be in the market for more and more cloud services and more diversified computational and storage resources. In the past few years, CC has become synonymous with hosted services over the Internet. NIST defines CC as "a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction" <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>There are, essentially, three established types of cloud services <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> as we now discuss.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service</head><p>Under IaaS the cloud provider offers its customers computing, network and storage resources. Amazon Web Services (AWS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> is a very good example of this category, where Amazon offers its customers computing resources through its elastic compute cloud (EC2) service and storage service through both Simple Storage Service (S3) and Elastic Book Store (EBS).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">PaaS: Platform as a Service</head><p>PaaS solutions are development platforms where the development tool itself is hosted in the cloud and accessed through a browser. With PaaS, developers can build web applications without installing any tools on their computer and then deploy those applications without any specialized systems administration skills. Google AppEngine <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and Microsoft Azure <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> are typical examples of this category.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">SaaS: Software as a Service</head><p>With SaaS the provider licenses an application to customers as a service on demand, through a subscription, in a pay-asyou-go model. This allows customers to use expensive software as much as their applications require, without any upfront investment and with no need to install and maintain software. IBM SmartCloud <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> IBM is a representative example of this category.</p><p>Cloud computing has three characteristics that differentiate it from traditional hosting. Indeed, CC services are on demand, typically by the hour, by the day, by the week, or any other time unit that makes sense; elastic, a user can buy as much or as little of a service as suits their needs. Should these needs change, the use can adjust their demand for services accordingly; and, fully managed by the cloud provider with no long-term commitment from the user <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>A cloud can be private or public. A public cloud sells services to anyone on the Internet. Currently, Amazon Web Services is the largest public cloud provider. A private cloud is a proprietary network or a datacenter that supplies hosted services to a limited number of people. When a service provider uses public cloud resources to create their private cloud, the result is called a virtual private cloud <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Mobile Clouds</head><p>The phenomenal proliferation of mobile devices and the urgent need to use these devices to solve meaningful problems will necessarily user in some form of mobile clouds where the mobile device will typically provide input and the computation will be performed remotely by some instance of a cloud server. In this setup, only the "last leg" of the mobile cloud will be actually mobile, the remainder will be tethered. The issue of interfacing mobile devices with standard cloud servers needs some form of intermediaries, perhaps in the form of the recently proposed cloudlets <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> that can be housed by smart access points or, indeed, some by other form of intelligence-rich intermediates between the mobile user and the cloud server. For a recent perspective on the topic of the future of mobile computing we refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">The Vehicular Model</head><p>The past 20 years have seen an unmistakable trend to make the vehicles on our roads and city streets smarter and the driving experience safer, less stressful and, consequently, more enjoyable. As a result, a typical car or truck today is likely to contain at least some of the following devices: an onboard computer, a GPS device, a radio transceiver, a shortrange rear collision radar device, and a camera, supplemented, in high-end models, by a variety of sophisticated sensing devices that can alert the driver to all sorts of mechanical malfunctions and road conditions. In addition to their sophisticated array of sensing and computation capabilities, the availability of virtually unlimited power supply and growing Internet presence will make our vehicles perfect candidates for housing powerful on-board computers augmented with huge storage devices that, collectively, may act as networked computing centers on wheels.</p><p>The significant array of on-board capabilities is likely to remain underutilized by safety applications alone. The realization of this fact has already motivated the investigation of offering value-added services including online gaming, mobile infotainment, along with various locationspecific services. We conjecture that the potential is even far beyond that. In fact, along with the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> we are convinced that it is only a matter of time before the huge vehicular fleets on our roadways, streets and parking lots will be recognized as an abundant and underutilized computational resource that can be tapped into for the purpose of providing third-party or community services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Vehicular Clouds</head><p>Recently, Olariu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proposed to call a VC a dynamic group of vehicles whose excess computing, sensing, communication, and storage resources can be coordinated and dynamically allocated to authorized users. We view the VC concept as the next natural step in meeting the computational and situational awareness needs not only of the driving public but also of a much larger segment of the population. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> two types of potential VC applications were presented. The first group includes two value-added applications that aggregate the computing capabilities of parked vehicles; these applications benefit from a VC but could, potentially, be run on top of conventional clouds. The second group includes two traffic-related applications that are highly dynamic in nature and cannot be run on conventional clouds. More specifically, we suggest ways in which underutilized computing, networking, and storage facilities can be used effectively and/or be shared between drivers or rented out to other customers over the Internet. One can contemplate at least the following three novel types of cloud services enables by VCs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1">NaaS: Network as a Service</head><p>While some vehicles on the road have Internet connection, at the moment, due to the combined effects of the short transmission range of DSRC mandated by the FCC <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and to the lack of installed roadside infrastructure, most vehicles nowadays do not have Internet connection while on the move. It is, however, expected that many drivers will have persistent connectivity to the Internet through cellular networks and other fixed access points on the road while driving, just imagine how many people have such connectivity through the 3G/4G cellular network today. This network resource is also expected to be underutilized by many drivers as not all of them will be searching or downloading from the Internet while driving, same as what is happening today on personal computers with cable or DSL connectivity. This important resource can then be shared between drivers on the road providing Internet to those drivers who are interested to rent it. It is, therefore, natural that the vehicles with Internet access will offer their excess bandwidth to the other cars that may need or want access to the Internet.</p><p>The expectation is that each driver with Internet connectivity, who is willing to share this resource, will advertise such information to all vehicles around them on the road. This information may then be multihopped between vehicles in the local vicinity informing them about the existing cars who can act as hops to the Internet access points. Taking the small relative speed between codirectional vehicles into consideration, we can look at the NaaS system as a traditional mobile ad hoc network composed of a set of fixed access points and a set of mobile computing nodes moving at a low speed. Thus, existing protocols can be used to allow vehicles in a given local area to have connectivity to the Internet through available access points or cars with Internet connectivity.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows an example of cars on the road where cars a and d have persistent 3G/4G Internet connectivity while car e has transient WiFi connectivity through the access point R. Cars a and d will periodically broadcast a packet indicating their intention to share the network with other vehicles on the road. On the other hand, car e will broadcast a periodic message about its transient WIFI connection to the roadside R. If any car, say c, is interested to have Internet access, it may route its requests to any of these cars based on many parameters such as relative speed, expected connection stability, required Internet speed and expected connection time. For example, if car c needs to perform a fast query or to download a small file, it may prefer to route its traffic through car e and the access point in turn that has a faster connection speed than the 3G/4G network. On the other hand, if car c needs a stable connection that lasts longer time, it may route its traffic through car d to the 3G/4G network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2">CaaS: Collaboration as a Service</head><p>We perceive NaaS as an instance of a much broader picture that we refer to as CaaS: Collaboration as a Service that may include brainstorming and/or various flavors of collective problem solving. We believe it is not too far-fetched to imagine, in the not-so-distant-future, a large-scale federation of VCs established ad hoc in support of mitigating a largescale emergencies. One of these large-scale emergencies could be a planned evacuation in the face of a potentially deadly hurricane or tsunami that is expected to make landfall in a coastal region <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Yet another such emergency would be a natural or man-made disaster apt to destroy the existing infrastructure and to play havoc with cellular communications. In such a scenario, a federation of VCs could provide a short-term replacement for the infrastructure and a decision-support system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.3">StaaS: Storage as a Service</head><p>While some vehicles have ample on-board storage capabilities, we anticipate that some other vehicles may need extra storage for their applications. Naturally, the vehicles with excess capacity will be inclined in providing storage as a service.</p><p>It is expected that on-board computers will have multiple Terabytes of persistent storage. This is mainly because of two reasons. First, persistent storage is becoming less expensive-nowadays a Terabytes of storage costs less than $40, which is negligible compared with the cost of the vehicle itself. Second, even under present-day technology, most vehicles can accommodate multiple hard drives. Needless to say that having that huge persistent storage sitting idle is a waste of resources.</p><p>This available storage can be used by many applications in the cloud: for example, it can be rented by the airport management to customers over the Internet; similarly, the storage may be used in content delivery and p2p applications where a file is decomposed into several blocks distributed across nodes of the network and interested users collect different blocks to reconstruct the file <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Observe that offering storage as a service in VANET is different from providing computational resources or network access since the potential customers benefit from computing and network access instantly, while they benefit from storage over an extended period of time. This is because, as a rule, storage is used for backup purposes or for p2p applications that will benefit later from them. Therefore, in the airport datacenter example, cars will leave the airport parking lot before customers can really benefits from their rented storage. This limitation may be a strong obstacle against renting cars storage for backup. However, p2p applications can still be supported by storing multiple replicas of the same block at many cars and moreover smaller block sizes should be used. By doing so, cars can still share and send their blocks within any short period of connectivity that may be available through fixed access points or through other cars willing to share their network connection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">A DATACENTER AT THE AIRPORT</head><p>We are interested in a VC scenario characterized by relatively stable, long-term availability of resources, very much in line with what one expects to see at the long-term parking lot of a major international airport or in the parking lot of a large company where, on workdays, employees' cars are parked for hours on end. In this paper, we assume a park and plug situation where parked vehicles are provided cable connection to the Internet. For simplicity, we model this scenario on the Eucalyptus open-source CC architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, running on top of many single-core CPUs. A typical CC architecture, such as Eucalyptus <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, consists of a client-side API translator, a cloud controller, several cluster controllers, and even more node controllers. A client application on one side of the network communicates with a cloud controller that facilitates the exchange of data to and from multiple services hosted on the back end. In turn, the cloud controller communicates with multiple cluster controllers which manage multiple node controllers. In the generic form of the cloud architecture, each of these node controllers is a software application that runs on top of a server in the datacenter of the company employing the cloud. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Architectural Overview</head><p>If the VC concept is to achieve its full potential, its basic architecture must be engineered to offer a seamless integration and decentralized management of the excess cyber-physical resources of the participating vehicles. In particular, the architecture must dynamically adapt its managed vehicular resources allocated to an application according to dynamically changing requirements and systems conditions. In this section, we offer a high-level overview of the architecture and challenges involved in engineering a datacenter at the airport (datacenter, for short).</p><p>Referring to Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, from a high-level standpoint the DC involves 1. a client-side API, very much like in the Eucalyptus architecture; 2. a datacenter manager that plays the role of a cloud controller to interface with the outside world; 3. a number of cluster controllers, each in charge of a resource cluster. Each cluster controller interfaces with the vehicles in its cluster. The various cluster controller may contain elements of the task manager to suit the granularity of a cluster; 4. each vehicle in a cluster is analogous to a node controller in a conventional CC architecture. These vehicles are willing to lend their excess on-board resources in return for some quantifiable benefit. The datacenter resources are the pooled resources of the individual vehicles parked at the airport that are willing to participate in the vehicular cloud.</p><p>As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, the datacenter manager consists of the following components: a broker daemon that negotiates cloud service requests on behalf of the VC from various potential clients. The broker has the authority to accept feasible requests and to commit cloud resources to meet their specifications; a virtualization agent that configures the available cloud resources in ways that best match the commitments underwritten by the broker; a resource manager in charge of discovering and managing the dynamically changing cloud resources; and, a task scheduler that allocates computational tasks to individual clusters or even to individual vehicles in a cluster based on the amount of available resources.</p><p>We now describe the actions involved in setting up the DC. To begin, the broker daemon receives a request for cloud services and decides, in consultation with the resource manager and the virtualization agent, whether or not the currently-available cloud resources suffice to meet the anticipated demands of the requested services. If the cloud service request is accepted, the broker daemon's job is to ensure that the client will not request more resources than originally stipulated.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> illustrates the logical data path between the client and the DC. Once the cloud service request has been accepted by the broker, the client application is presented with an API that provides the illusion of a virtual platform. The client application communicates with the virtualization agent, which, in turn, specifies strategies for configuring the available cloud resources in ways that best match the needs of the client application. The resource manager's job is to allocate physical resources that, together, provide the virtual environment requested by the client application.</p><p>In addition to allocating the physical resources, the resource manager, in coordination with the cluster controllers, performs the following tasks:</p><p>. keeps track of currently available resources, . discovers new resources as soon as they become available, . predicts the availability of resources using a suitable stochastic model, . migrates tasks from a vehicle leaving the VC to an available vehicle, . balances the loads of the existing clusters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">ANALYTICAL RESULTS</head><p>One of the key components of a decision support system for the datacenter we envision is the ability to predict the availability of computational resources in the parking lot in the face of dynamic arrivals and departures. This translates into the ability to predict, with some degree of accuracy, the number of cars present in a given parking lot, given generic information about the arrival and departure rates.</p><p>Specifically, we are interested in the following problem. At time t ¼ 0, the parking lot contains n 0 ! 0 cars. After that, cars arrive at a time-dependent rate ðtÞ and depart at a time-dependent rate ðtÞ. Of interest are . the probability that at a given time t &gt; 0, there are exactly k cars in the parking lot; . the expected number and variance of the number of cars in the parking lot at time t &gt; 0; . the limit as t ! 1 of the expected number of cars in the parking lot (if such a limit exists and/or makes sense).</p></div>

We let P k ðtÞ denote the probability that the event fNðtÞ ¼ kg occurs.</p><p>In accord with the problem statement, we assume that</p><p>. the parking lot has a very large capacity, that we take to be infinite; this assumption is justified as airport parking lots are engineered to meet customer demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>; . the cars arrive at a time-dependent rate of ðtÞ, independent of the number of cars already in the parking lot; . if at time t the parking lot contains k cars, then the departure rate is kðtÞ, where ðtÞ is a function of t. We further assume that ðtÞ and ðtÞ are bounded and have at most a countable number of discontinuity points on ½0; 1Þ. It follows that for all t ! 0, ðtÞ and ðtÞ are integrable on ½0; t and that there exist constants M 1 ; m 1 ; M 2 ; m 2 , 0 &lt; m 1 M 1 and 0 &lt; m 2 M 2 independent of t such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">m 1 ðtÞ M 1 ; m 2 ðtÞ M 2 :<label>ð1Þ</label></formula></div>

Observe that (24) tells us that if lim t!1 ðtÞ ðtÞ does not exist, ÃðT Þ remains a function of t, bounded below by the ratio of the minimum arrival rate and maximum departure rate, and bounded above by the ratio of the maximum arrival rate and minimum departure rate. In this case the process NðtÞ becomes an inhomogeneous Poisson process with parameter ÃðtÞ; . Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> and (32) tells us that in the long run the expected number of vehicles in the parking lot and its variance are bounded below by the ratio of the minimum arrival rate and maximum departure rate, and bounded above by the ratio of the maximum arrival rate and minimum departure rate; . Even though the difference jÃðtÞ À ðtÞ ðtÞ j cannot be made arbitrarily small in this case, it is still of great interest to find a reasonable bound. This interesting question is dealt with in the last section of the supplemental file, available online, that accompanies this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">NUMERICAL RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we validate empirically the analytical results derived in Section 4. For this purpose, we compare the theoretical predictions with numerical results obtained by numerically solving the system of differential equations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. We placed ourselves in the context of a mid-size airport whose parking lot can accommodate 1,000 vehicles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Simulation Setup</head><p>We assumed that, at the beginning of the simulation, i.e., at time t ¼ 0, there were n 0 ¼ 500 vehicles in the parking lot. The vehicles were assumed to arrive at and depart from the parking lot at certain time-varying rates. To evaluate the analytical results, we considered three scenarios, as described next:</p><p>. Scenario 1. The first set of results was designed for constant arrival rate and departure rates. For illustration purposes, we have chosen ¼ 800 and ¼ 2; . Scenario 2. The second set of results was designed for time-dependent arrival and departure rates but such that limit lim t!1 ðtÞ ðtÞ does not exist; . Scenario 3. The third set of results was designed for time-dependent arrival and departure rates such that limit lim ðtÞ ðtÞ exists. To set the stage for explaining our design decisions, imagine a typical long-term parking lot of a mid-size airport, as discussed above. A glance at the flight arrivals and departure schedule will convince us, first, that the flight arrival and departure rates are time-dependent stochastic phenomena; and, second, that flights depart and arrive on a 24-hour periodic schedule. It is, consequently, clear the car arrival and departure rates from the airport parking lot will mirror fairly closely the flight departure and arrival rates. It follows that the car arrival and departure rates into/from the long-term parking lot should also be periodic functions of time.</p><p>While many periodic functions could possibly be employed, we have decided to adopt as generic arrival and departure rates Having settled on this choice, there were two further problems that needed attention. The first was the most appropriate simulation granularity: after some trials we have decided that the most appropriate time unit model the car arrival and departure is one hour. With this is mind, for arbitrary t ! 0, we have decided to take ðtÞ ¼ t 12 .</p><p>Assuming the average occupancy of a mid-size airport to be between 400 and 500, we have chosen the constants a ¼ 1;300; b ¼ 500; c ¼ 3; d ¼ 1. With this in mind, the arrival and departure rates used in Scenario 2 were ðtÞ ¼ 1;300 þ 5 sin t 12</p><p>; and ðtÞ ¼ 3 þ 1 sin t 12</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>:</head><p>It is easy to confirm that, in this case, the limit lim t!1 ðtÞ ðtÞ does not exist.</p><p>For Scenario 3, we adopted quasi-periodic time-dependent arrival and departure rates ðtÞ and ðtÞ, with a period close to 24 hours, in such a way that the limit lim t!1 ðtÞ ðtÞ existed. Again many quasi-periodic functions could possibly be employed. But we have decided to adopt as generic arrival and departure rates as We begin by investigating the expected number E½NðtÞ of cars in the parking lot. The comparisons between the analytical results and the numerical results have been performed for the above three scenarios. For each scenario, we set the simulation time to 60 hours and we computed the expected number of parked vehicles at time t. Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref> shows E½NðtÞ plotted against time in Scenario 1 with arrival rate ¼ 800 and the departure rate ¼ 2. We notice that E½NðtÞ stabilizes at ¼ 400. In fact, even though the initial number of vehicles was 500, E½NðtÞ dropped sharply to 400 to within 3 hours into the simulation. The parking lot becomes stabilized after that, due chiefly to the constant arrival and departure rates.</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">ðtÞ ¼ 800 þ 400½1 þ</formula><p>The effect of the initial conditions on E½NðtÞ is similar in Scenarios 2 and 3: due to the departure of the initially parked vehicles, the expected number of parked vehicles is dropping sharply as illustrated in Figs. <ref type="figure">4b</ref> and<ref type="figure">4c</ref>. However, once the effect of the initial conditions has worn off, Scenarios 2 and 3 are vastly different. As expected, in Scenario 2 we see a periodic fluctuation of the expected number of parked vehicles as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>. In addition, Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref> clearly shows, as predicted by our analytical results, that E½NðtÞ is bounded by 400 and 450 after t &gt; 3. In the case of Scenario 3, Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref> shows, as expected, that in the long-run E½NðtÞ settles down to a constant value near the limit lim t!1 ðtÞ ðtÞ . Before stabilization, fluctuating values are shown but fluctuation becomes weaker as t increases. The duration of the fluctuation actually depends on the exponential parameter. The exponential component of arrival rate in this result is expðÀ0:3tÞ and the one of departure rate is expðÀ0:2tÞ. The bigger values of the exponential components are, the faster the system stabilizes.</p><p>Next, we turned our attention to evaluating V ar½NðtÞ versus time. Three sets of comparisons (corresponding to the three scenarios discussed in Section 6.1) between the analytical results and the numerical results have been performed. For each of them, the simulation time t was 60 hours and, as before, the number of the initial parked vehicles is n 0 ¼ 500. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5a</ref> shows that in Scenario 1, V ar½NðtÞ stabilizes to a constant value after fluctuation in the first few hours. Fluctuation in the first few hours is caused by the departure of the initially parked vehicles, explained earlier. As expected, the variance of the expected number of parked vehicles settles down to , i.e., 400 when t &gt; 3. By contrast, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5b</ref> captures the behavior of V ar½NðtÞ in Scenario 2 where the limit lim t!1 ðtÞ ðtÞ does not exist. Just as predicted by our analytical derivations, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5b</ref> shows that V ar½NðtÞ fluctuates with a period of 24 hours. In addition, a noticeable variance range [400, 450] can be read from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5b</ref>.</p><p>The situation is vastly different in Scenario 3 as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5c</ref>. Here, V ar½NðtÞ stabilizes at 400 after t &gt; 25 hours of simulation. The probability of the departure of initially parked vehicles and the exponential component in the arrival rate and departure rate can affect the pattern of the unstable fluctuation.</p><p>It is observed that the variance is stabilized at 400 for both Figs. 5a and 5c and at a range <ref type="bibr">[400,</ref><ref type="bibr">450]</ref> in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5b</ref>. These values are rather large, considering that the expected number of parked vehicles E½NðtÞ is also 400. Therefore, we need to show the in spite of the large variance of NðtÞ, the probability that the number of vehicles in the parking lot is low is negligible. We have decided to investigate, experimentally, P r½fNðtÞ &lt; 400g and P r½fNðtÞ &lt; 300g. Three sets of comparisons (one for each scenario) have been performed. For each set of comparison, we adopt the same simulation settings as the previous ones and compute the probability values. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6a</ref> shows the probability P r½fNðtÞ &lt; 400g in the case of Scenario 1. The probability P r½fNðtÞ &lt; 400g tends to 0.5 and P r½fNðtÞ &lt; 300g tends to be 0 after an initial unstable fluctuation induced by the initial conditions. In Scenario 2, where both arrival rate and departure rates are periodical function of time and the limit lim t!1 ðtÞ ðtÞ does not exist, we expect to see the periodical probability values. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6b</ref> shows, as expected, that the probability P r½fNðtÞ &lt; 400g is periodical and bounded by [0, 0.5]. The probability P r½fNðtÞ &lt; 300g remains close to 0.</p><p>In the case of Scenario 3, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6c</ref> shows that, as expected, the probability P r½fNðtÞ &lt; 400g stabilizes at 0.5 after a certain fluctuation due mostly to the effect of initial conditions. The duration of the fluctuation is controlled by the initially parked vehicles and by exponential components in the arrival and departure rates.</p><p>In summary, the probability of the event that there are at least 300 vehicles in the airport parking lot is 100 percent. In other words, it is guaranteed that there are at least 300 vehicles parked in the airport at any time for our utilization.</p><p>To test the clustering of the probability mass around E½NðtÞ, we have performed a 3D plots of P k ðtÞ, i.e., P r½fNðtÞ &lt; kg, time t and the number of parked vehicles k versus time. The goal was to find a direct view of relationships of the probability P k ðtÞ at time t that there are k vehicles parked in the airport parking lot. We varied both time t and the number k of parked vehicles and calculate the probability values. Two cases have been investigated: Scenario 2 and Scenario 3. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> shows a shaded surface and as a contour plot of both cases. It clearly shows that in Scenario 2, the probability varies periodically with time t and k. By contrast, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7b</ref> shows, as expected, that in Scenario 3 the probability eventually stabilizes after some initial fluctuation. To see better these trends, we also plotted the logarithm of the probability at various times t and the number of parked vehicles k. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8a</ref> shows these results in the case of Scenario 2, while Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8b</ref> shows the logarithm of the probability at various times in the case of Scenario 3.  In this paper, we concerned ourselves with the simplest implementation of a VC, namely aggregating the computing capabilities of parked vehicles in a rather stable environment, the long-term parking lot of an international airport. the main contribution of this paper is to provide analytical and simulation results concerning the availability of computational resources in such an environment. However, we have not addressed the specific ways in which computational tasks are to be assigned to the participating vehicles and, similarly, ways in which tasks have to be migrating from vehicles whose departure is imminent.</p><p>In the future, we shall move on to dynamic scenarios. US statistics show that day-in and day-out mall customers spend hours shopping with some peaks over the weekends or the holiday season. For example, a recent study performed on teens shopping at malls in 2008 showed that 95 percent of shoppers spent more than one hour at the mall while 68 percent of them spent more than two hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Thus, hundreds of thousands of customers visit different malls every day, parking their cars in the mall garage or parking lot and spending a couple of hours doing their shopping while leaving their computing resources in their vehicles idle during that time. Obviously, the parking lot of a typical mall is far more dynamic and the time spent per car far less predictable. We plan to extend the scenario discussed in the paper to such dynamic environments.</p><p>Yet another direction that we plan to explore is security and privacy of VCs. Indeed, security and privacy are the perennial concerns when allowing multiple users to share the same set of resources and VCs are no exception. Essentially, while sharing resources between different users, two constraints have to be met. First, the privacy and security of the vehicle's owner should be preserved. Second, the security and privacy of the VC customers who rent these resources must also be preserved. One simple answer to both concerns lays in the use of virtualization techniques. Virtualization refers to a strategy whereby access to a single underlying hardware is coordinated so that multiple guest operating systems can share a single piece of hardware, with no guest operating system being aware that it is actually sharing anything at all. Thus, with full virtualization, a single computer on a vehicle can be rented simultaneously to several customers and none of them will be aware of the existence of other users in the system. This will preserve both the privacy and security of all users in the system. Virtualization of resources and services is a well understood technology and a number of successful virtualization vendors offer secure cloud services. The interested reader should refer to VMWare <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and Citrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
