<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Owing to the ever-growing popularity of mobile computing, a large number of services have been developed for a variety of users. Considering this, recommending useful services to users is an urgent problem that needs to be addressed. Collaborative filtering (CF) approaches have been successfully adopted for services recommendation. Nevertheless, the prediction accuracy of the existing CF approaches is likely to reduce due to many reasons, such as inability to use side information and high data sparsity, which further lead to low quality of services recommendation. In order to solve these problems, some modelbased CF approaches have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a novel quality of service prediction approach based on probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF), which has the capability of incorporating network location (an important factor in mobile computing) and implicit associations among users and services. First, we propose a novel clustering method that is capable of utilizing network location to cluster users. Based on the clustering results, we further propose an enhanced PMF model. The proposed model also incorporates the implicit associations among users and services. In addition, our model incorporates the implicit relationships between the users and the services. We conducted experiments on one real-world data set, and the experimental results show that our model outperforms the compared methods.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is widely-used in distributed computing environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, such as cloud computing and mobile computing. As the core element of SOA, services are also largely adopted as a popular way to provide configurable functions, especially in mobile computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. So the number of services is increasing dramatically. It becomes an inevitable problem to select suitable services for a user <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Meanwhile, since the number of candidate services in mobile computing environment is large, it is hard for a user to finish the services selection task, and thus it is an urgent task to develop an effective services recommendation system. In services recommendation, quality of service (QoS for short) is a quite important factor, and the recommendation task can focus on uncovering those services that can provide best QoS. Because the number of services that a user can invoke or use is usually quite limited, the number of the known QoS values that a user can have is also limited. So the prediction of unknown or missing QoS values becomes the key task.</p><p>In recent years, collaborative filtering (CF) approaches have been successfully adopted in traditional recommender systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. CF approaches utilize the invocation records of a user to identify similar users and further use such similarity to predict QoS for the target user. However, in QoS prediction for services, CF approaches usually suffer from low accuracy, especially when the QoS records are sparse. Traditional CF approaches are classified into two categories: neighborhood-based CF (also known as memory-based CF) and model-based CF <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Some previous studies proposed model-based CF approaches to predict QoS, such as the methods extended from matrix factorization (MF). Their results show that the MF-based methods can effectively improve the QoS prediction accuracy under the case of high sparsity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. However, the traditional MF methods still have limitations, because different from the traditional rating prediction in recommender systems, QoS values are largely affected by physical and geographical factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, such as network location and geographical location, especially in mobile computing case. The traditional MF methods only utilize users' invocation records as explicit information to predict missing values, lacking of the capability of utilizing the context information, such as network or geographical locations, which are important factors in mobile computing.</p><p>Among the existing MF approaches, the probabilistic MF model (PMF), performs well on the large and sparse Netflix dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Although PMF is a popular method in recommender systems, it still suffers from drawbacks in QoS prediction, which are two-fold. First, PMF represents users and services with latent features, but ignores the effect biases of users and services. Second, PMF assumes that the latent features of users and services are independent, ignoring the implicit associations among users and services.</p><p>In this study, we propose a novel QoS prediction approach based on PMF, which aims to incorporate the network location and implicit associations among users and services. Our work is motivated by the following observation. In the process of service invocation, the performance of the underlying network has a considerable effect on QoS (for example, response time and throughput) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Users in the same country or same autonomous system share similar network configuration, such as bandwidth and routing protocols, so the QoS values received by these users are likely to be similar. Thus, our algorithm first clusters users into several regions based on network location and QoS records. The extensive experiments were conducted on one real-world QoS dataset. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.</p><p>• It proposes a new clustering algorithm based on K-prototype clustering algorithm. The proposed method is capable of leveraging a user's features to find users with similar network environment.</p><p>• It constructs an extended prediction model using the clustering results, and further propose an ensemble model which combines the baseline model and PMF model.</p><p>• It proposes a new prediction model extended from matrix factorization, which incorporates the services' network location information and implicit associations among users and services.</p><p>• It proposes an ensemble model, which combines the above two models. The experiments conducted on the real-world datasets show that our approaches can generate superior prediction results. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses the related work. Section III presents our framework. Section IV elaborates on the proposed prediction models. The experimental results and their analyses are presented in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper and discusses our future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RELATED WORK</head><p>Service recommendation systems aim at providing high quality services to target users. In recent studies, CF has been widely used in recommendation systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. However, these CF recommendation algorithms often face many challenges, such as the cold start problem, data sparseness, and algorithm scalability <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Considering the large number of services and the enormous cost for service users to invoke all services, it is infeasible to immediately acquire the QoS value to select the optimal service. To address this problem, many personalized QoS prediction approaches have been proposed in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed a personalized QoS prediction approach for web services using latent factor models; in their study, they explain how latent factor models can be utilized to predict the unknown QoS values. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> built feature models and employed these models to make personalized QoS prediction for different users. Li and Ou <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> developed a new model named pairwise PMF, which employs two techniques, including learning to rank and PMF, to learn the relative preference for items, which is advantageous for QoS prediction. Xie et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> proposed an asymmetric correlation regularized MF to alleviate the data sparseness problem.</p><p>The CF approaches are divided into two categories: neighborhood-based and model-based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Some of the neighborhood-based approaches achieve good prediction results. Shao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> proposed a user-based CF approach to predict the QoS values based on the similarity between service users. Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> explored an improved item-based movie recommendation algorithm, which increases cinematic genres' effect on computing items' similarity. Further, Jiang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> developed an effective personalized hybrid collaborative filtering (PHCF) technique by integrating personalized user-based algorithm and personalized item-based algorithm for web services recommendations. However, the neighborhood-based recommendation approaches are usually unable to flexibly integrate many useful information, such as users' interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. We need to utilize the explicit or implicit information to obtain a more accurate prediction. Considering this, some researchers found that the model-based approach can effectively integrate this implicit information for QoS prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Qi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> proposed a novel QoS prediction method based on the MF model, integrating both user network neighborhood information and service neighborhood information with the MF model to predict personalized QoS values. Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> proposed a general contex.t-sensitive MF approach (CSMF) for collaborative QoS prediction. By considering the complexity of service invocations, CSMF models the interactions of users-to-services and environment-to-environment simultaneously, and makes full use of implicit and explicit contextual factors in QoS data. Further, Wei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> proposed an extended MF (EMF) framework with relational regularization for predicting missing QoS values. To avoid the expensive and costly web services invocations, they first elaborated the MF model from a general perspective. Then, they systematically designed two novel relational regularization terms inside a neighborhood. Finally, they combined both terms into a unified MF framework to predict the missing QoS values. Moreover, some researchers have found that integrating the context information into CF algorithms can lead to better prediction accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> proposed an alternative and efficient approach to predict the missing QoS values, called the Location and Reputation aware MF-based Location Information (LRMF). The LRMF combined both the user's reputation and location information to achieve more accurate prediction results. He et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> designed a location-based hierarchical MF method to perform personalized QoS prediction, based on which, effective service recommendation can be made.</p><p>Although the abovementioned studies made some improvements for QoS prediction models, the effect of implicit feedback information on the QoS prediction is not considered. Considering that the country information can affect the QoS values, in our study, we combined the implicit service location feedback information with the PFM model for QoS prediction. Consequently, by modelling the users' preference behavior in different countries, we make a personalized prediction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. THE PROPOSED SERVICE RECOMMENDATION FRAMEWORK</head><p>To recommend high quality services, we focus on achieving QoS prediction with high accuracy. We propose a service recommendation framework containing the proposed prediction models, which are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The three components of this framework are stated as follows.</p><p>Users clustering: This component uses a new initialization method to improve the accuracy of users clustering, by integrating users' network location information. This component aims at finding similar users in similar network environments, and then applies this clustering result to construct a novel PMF model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PMF model building:</head><p>In this component, a PMF model is proposed, exploiting the results of the mentioned clustering. Besides, we incorporate the implicit associations among users and services into t the proposed PMF model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>QoS Prediction:</head><p>We use the proposed PMF model to predict the missing QoS values.</p><p>Using the users' and services' network locations, we first propose a baseline model based on this clustering result, and then build a PMF model based on implicit feedback information. To provide effective service recommendation, we combine these two models to predict the missing QoS values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. PROPOSED PREDICTION MODELS</head><p>In this section, we present the two models used in our approach, i.e., the user clustering model and the enhanced PMF model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. IMPROVED USER CLUSTERING MODEL</head><p>We propose a clustering method based on the K-prototype algorithm. The K-prototype algorithm can be used to cluster data with mixed attributes, including numerical and categorical attributes. The results of the clustering using K-prototype algorithm are largely determined by the quality of the selected initial points. It indicates that this algorithm is sensitive to the choice of initial points. To solve this problem, different from the traditional initialization method in K-prototype algorithm, we propose a new initialization method fully take advantage of the characteristics of QoS records.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) K-PROTOTYPE ALGORITHM</head><p>In this section, we introduce our clustering method based on the users' QoS records, network location and geographical location. We define a cluster as a group of users who are located close to each other and have similar QoS records.</p><p>QoS values are usually strongly related to the user's network environment, such as network bandwidth and network distance. In the same autonomous system, users are subject to the same routing protocol (usually it is the internal gateway protocol), using the same router group, so the routing capability of the users' devices are the same. Thus, the network transmission status within the same autonomous system is similar. It can be inferred that users in close network locations are likely to experience similar QoS. We cluster users based on the users' QoS records and network location information, and those users within the same cluster are similar in receiving QoS. However, because QoS records are numeric attributes, whereas network location is categorical, we utilize the K-prototype algorithm to handle the clustering problem which is involved in mixed data. A novel PMF model is further proposed based on the clustering results.</p><p>The K-prototype algorithm is typically used for clustering of data with mixed attributes, and is based on the K-means and K-mode algorithms. The K-means algorithm is a simple, yet time-consuming clustering algorithm, especially on large-scale datasets. However, the K-means algorithm can be only used for data with numerical attributes, limiting its application scope. On the contrary, the K-mode algorithm can be used to cluster data with categorical attributes, but cannot be used for data with numeric attributes. The K-prototype algorithm combines the advantages of K-means and K-mode algorithms and can be used to cluster data with mixed attributes.</p><p>In service recommendation, the QoS records are numerical attributes, while the country affiliation and the number of autonomous systems (AS) are categorical attributes. The three attributes are then unified into a mixed attribute. The mixed data vectors composed of mixed attributes are clustering objects, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>In this specific implementation, the sample refers to the users. First, we have -→ X = {X 1 , X 2 , . . . , X n }, which denotes the dataset with n users. Each X i has a mixed attribute vector</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(x n i,1 , x c i,2 , x c i,3</formula><p>), which represents the three attribute values mentioned above for user X i . In detail, x n i,1 is the QoS vector of user X i , while (x c i,2 , x c i,3 ) represents the country affiliation and the number of AS of the user.</p><p>Let k be the number of clusters, and C = {C 1 , C 2 , . . . , C k } be the set of clusters. In K-prototype algorithm, the center of each cluster is named as a prototype. Let Q = {Q 1 , Q 2 , . . . , Q k } denote the prototypes set for the k clusters. Each Q l also has a mixed attribute vector (q n l,1 , q c l,2 , q c l,3 ), which represents the abovementioned three attribute values for the prototype Q l . In clustering, the core task is to calculate the dissimilarity between each user and the prototype of each cluster. The dissimilarity of numerical attributes is computed by Euclidean distance between the numerical feature of a user and a cluster's prototype. This dissimilarity between user X i and prototype Q l is computed as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d n (X i , Q l ) = p j=1 x i,j -q l,j 2 (1)</formula><p>where p represents the number of numerical features. The dissimilarity between two categorical features is calculated using Hemingway distance as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">d c (X i , Q l ) = m j=p+1 δ x i,j , q l,j<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where m represents the number of categorical features. If x i,j = q l,j , then δ(x i,j , q l,j ) = 0, and if x i,j = q l,j , then δ(x i,j , q l,j ) = 1. Combining Eq.1 and Eq.2, the dissimilarity of the mixed features is computed as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">d (X i , Q l ) = d n + γ d c = p j=1 x r ij -q r lj 2 + γ m j=p δ x c ij , q c lj (3)</formula><p>Finally, the cost function of clustering is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">E = n i=1 k l=1 u il d (X i , Q l ) s.t.      k i=1 u il = 1 u il ∈ [0, 1]<label>(4)</label></formula><p>In the case of u il = 1, user X i is in cluster C l . In the case of u il = 0, user X i is not in the cluster C l . The steps of the improved K-prototype algorithm are as follows.</p><p>Step 1: It sets the number of clusters and select a prototype for each cluster, and gets k prototypes.</p><p>Step 2: It computes the dissimilarity between each user and each prototype based on Eq. 3. Based on clustering results, it divides users into different clusters, wherein a user belongs to the cluster with the smallest dissimilarity value.</p><p>Step 3: Using Eq. 3, it recalculates the prototype of each cluster, and updates the prototypes correspondingly. Step 3 is repeated until users in each cluster remain unchanged.</p><p>In Step 3, after the prototype of each cluster is generated, the value of numerical feature of the prototype is set as the average value of numerical features of all users in the cluster. The value of categorical feature of the prototype is set as the categorical value of the user in the cluster with the highest similarity.</p><p>Due to high data sparsity, the number of known QoS records is small. To ensure that the dimension of each QoS vector is the same, the missing QoS value in each vector is filled with the mean of each user's QoS records. The pseudo-code of K-prototype algorithm is present in Algorithm 1. In Algorithm 1, X [i] represents the mixed vector of user u i , and X [i,j] is the value of feature j in X [i].</p><p>QoSvalues[] and attributes[] store QoS values and features, </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) IMPROVED INITIALIZATION METHOD</head><p>The traditional K-prototype algorithm randomly selects several samples as initial points. However, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, the deficiency of random selection of initial points is likely to impair clustering results. We propose an improved initialization method that utilizes the user density and distance.</p><p>First, we use Eq. 3 to obtain the distance between two users, and then we define the density of a user as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ρ(X t ) = |N (X t )| π θ 2 , |N (X t )| = {X i ∈ X , d(X t , X i ) ≤ θ } (5)</formula><p>where X t denotes the target user, ρ(X t ) is the density of user X t , and |N (X t )| represents the number of users satisfying the constraint of θ . A higher density ρ(X t ) of a user X t indicates, a larger number of users close to X t and a higher probability of X t being a cluster prototype. So we select the user with the maximum density as the first initial point. For selection of the rest of initial points, we compute the distance </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>as follows. Let</head><formula xml:id="formula_6">Q = {Q 1 , Q 2 , . . . , Q k } denote the k initial points.</formula><p>Step 1: Q = ∅. For each X i ∈ X , this step computes ρ(X i ).</p><p>Step 2: The second initial point Q 2 is the user who has the farthest distance from the first point Q 1 , where</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Q 2 satisfies Q 2 = X i , d(X i , Q 1 ) = max{d(X 1 , Q 1 ), . . . , d(X n , Q 1 )}.</formula><p>Step 3: To find the rest of initial points, we compute the nearest distance from each initial point Q l to each user X i , where</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">X i can get d min (X i ) = |Q| min l=1 {d(X i , Q l )}, X i ∈ {X -Q}, Q l ∈ {Q}.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) CLUSTERING RESULTS ANALYSIS</head><p>As used in the evaluation of common clustering methods, we use two metrics Compactness (CP) and Separation (SP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> to evaluate our proposed clustering method. CP is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">CP i = 1 |C i | X i ∈C i X i -Q l (6)</formula><p>where C i is the set of users X i that have been grouped into a cluster, and Q is the set of Q l prototypes of clusters in C i . The average CP value of all clusters is calculated as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">CP = 1 k k i=1 CP i (7)</formula><p>where k denotes the number of clusters. As the members of each cluster should be close to each other, a lower value of CP indicates more compact clusters. SP measures the average distance between each prototype.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">SP = 2 k 2 -k k i=1 k j=i+1 Q i -Q j 2 (8)</formula><p>where a higher value of SP indicates a better degree of separation. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> shows the CP and SP of two initialization methods on four matrices with densities being 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%. It can be seen that our initialization method (Density-based) can generate more effective clustering results. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) MOTIVATION FOR PMF IMPROVEMENT</head><p>We first present the motivation for improving the basic PMF model. The key improvements of our model are as follows.</p><p>• As discussed in Section III, users in the same cluster have a similar network environment. and such similarity is also applied to the service invocation. With the clustering results, our method extends the prediction way of basic PMF.</p><p>• In services recommendation, the basic PMF model only takes the' QoS values as input. Considering the different network configurations of users located in different regions, we incorporate implicit feedbacks to the basic PMF model.</p><p>In the remainder of this section, we present our two models, and the ensemble model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) THE EXTENDED PREDICTION MODEL</head><p>The QoS values are largely impacted by the network environment in which users and services are located. Although it is expected that users in the same cluster receive similar QoS values after invoking the same service, the network condition of some users is unstable at a certain time, which further impairs QoS. Thus, in average, the QoS of these users is worse than that of other users in the cluster. Likewise, there are some services that have a worse QoS because of unstable network condition. To incorporate the QoS deviation caused by the instability of network, we propose to incorporate a bias term devised based on clustering results, which is given below.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">B (i, j, C) = µ C + BU i + BS j (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">)</formula><p>where µ C represents the average QoS value in cluster C, and BU i and BS j represent the bias terms of user i and service j, respectively BU i and BS j are computed with</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">BU i = j∈R(i) q ij -µ C β 1 +|R (i)| , BS j = i∈R(j) q ij -µ C -BU i β 2 +|R (j)|<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where R(i) represents the set of services invoked by user i.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) IMPLICIT FEEDBACK</head><p>We propose another QoS prediction model based on PMF model incorporating the implicit associations among users and services. The QoS records are commonly explicit feedbacks, such as response time. However, implicit feedback is not represented by numerical values, but by the user's invocation records to reflect a user's preference for  services. The explicit and implicit feedback in service invocation can be organized as two matrices that are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>The elements in explicit feedback matrix E (shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) are QoS records. The element E i,j represents the QoS value received by user i after invoking service j. In the implicit feedback matrix T (shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), value 1 means that user i has invoked service j, and value 0 means that user i has never invoked service j before.</p><p>The traditional CF method takes QoS values as input, and usually relies on an assumption that most of QoS values are known or stable. However, because of the instability of network environment, users usually cannot invoke all services, resulting in noise data, which further decrease the prediction accuracy. In contrast, the implicit feedback can also reflect user invocation preferences, such as the frequency of a user invoking different services. Based on the observation, it can be inferred that a service's location is an important factor that influences user invocation choice. For example, if a user is to analyze the weather of a certain location, this user is highly likely to frequently invoke the weather forecast services of that location. Based on this observation, we propose an implicit feedback model.</p><p>We define the preference vector of user i as</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">Z i = U i + c∈G   ω ic |N i (c)| -1 2 s k ∈N i (c) Y k  <label>(16)</label></formula><p>where U i represents the user latent feature vector. G represents the set of all countries in which services are located.  The conditional distribution of the user-service QoS matrix is</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">p R|U , S, Y , σ 2 R = m i n j N R ij S T j U i + c∈G ω ic |N i (c)| -1 2 × s k ∈N i (c) Y k     , σ 2 R   I ij (<label>17</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_25">)</formula><p>The implicit feedback factor vectors Y follows mean spherical Gaussian prior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. THE ENSEMBLE QOS PREDICTION</head><p>In previous sections, we state two proposed prediction models. The first one is the prediction model based on clustering results, and the second one is the model based on implicit feedback.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EXPERIMENTS AND EVALUATION</head><p>In this section, we evaluate the performance of our proposed prediction model. We also will study the impact of model parameter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. DATA SET</head><p>In this study, we adopt a public dataset of real-world services provided by Zheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, which contains 1,974,675 QoS records from 339 users and 5,825 services distributed all over the world. This dataset contains network location information on both user side and service side, IP addresses of users and WSDL (Web Services Description Language) files of services. The data statistics are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. DATA PREPROCESSING</head><p>The autonomous system information of the original dataset is not provided. In order to solve this issue, we use a free and public database and the IP address (in WSDL files) of a user and a service to the corresponding autonomous system number. After mapping, 137 and 1021 autonomous domain codes are obtained, which correspond to 339 users and 5102 services respectively. However, there are 723 services remained that could not be mapped to autonomous domain numbers.</p><p>To evaluate the performance of our method in different data sparsities, we generate the training sets by randomly removing a part of records, and form four sparsity cases with 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%. The density of response time in 10%, as an example, from the original response time, a random matrix of size M × N ×0.1 QoS values is as the training set. The remaining M × N ×0.9 QoS values is as the test set. We repeat 100 times for each experimental value and report the average result, to avoid the probable instability of methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. EVALUATION METRICS</head><p>We use the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure the prediction accuracy. RMSE computes the standard deviation of the prediction error, which is computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">RMSE = 1 N i,j q ij -qij 2<label>(23)</label></formula><p>where q ui represents the real QoS value, qui represents the prediction value, and N is the number of values in the test set. A smaller RMSE value means higher prediction accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. PERFORMANCE COMPARISON</head><p>We compare our proposed model with the following wellknown approaches that have been developed to predict QoS values, including: 1. UserMean: A user-oriented mean prediction method. 2. ItemMean: An item-oriented mean prediction method. 3. UPCC <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>: The user-based collaborative filtering algorithm using Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). 4. IPCC <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>: The item-based collaborative filtering algorithm using PCC. 5. WSRec <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>: A hybrid model composed of UPCC and IPCC with confidence weight.  6. LACF <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>: LACF is short for location-aware collaborative filtering. 7. PMF <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>: PMF is short for probabilistic matrix factorization. PMF model has been explained in Section IV. 8. JLMF <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>: A collaborative recommendation framework containing three prediction models. 9. LRMF <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>: LRMF stands for location and reputationaware matrix factorization. For parameter setting, the number of users clusters k is set as 20, and the dimension f of latent feature vector is set as 30. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> presents the RMSE values of all methods in four matrices with densities from 5% to 20%. CA-PMF (context-aware PMF) is our proposed method. Based on the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, the following observations can be made.</p><p>1. The RMSE values of all methods decrease as the training set density increases, which indicates that more invocation records will promote the prediction performance. 2. The proposed method CA-PMF produces smaller RMSE than all compared approaches in all cases of training set densities, which indicates that our model outperforms other models under all different circumstances. It is worth noting that our model performs consistently better than PMF, clearly indicating that the clustering method employed and the use of network location information helps improve QoS prediction accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF PARAMETERS 1) IMPACT OF k</head><p>The parameter k determines the number of user cluster. If k is set to be 1, all users are in the same group. On the one hand, when k is relatively small, we mainly use historical invocation records of users and services to build the bias model, with limited network location information. On the other hand, if k is quite large, it indicates that there are few users in the same cluster, including some clusters with only one user. In such a case, the bias model changes to the user bias model. Thus, k takes an important role in our QoS prediction method.</p><p>To investigate the impact of k on the performance of CA-PMF model, the value of k was varied from 1 to 30.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> shows the change of RMSE as the value of k varies from 1 to 30 for four different matrix densities settings. From Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6(a</ref>) and 6(b), it can be observed that the RMSE drops down sharply at beginning and then increases smoothly, which indicates that when k is small, the size of cluster will be large, leading to dissimilar users in the same cluster, which will hamper the performance of our model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) IMPACT OF f</head><p>In our proposed method, the parameter f determines the number of latent factors. In this section, we evaluate the sensitivity of our method to f which ranges from 10 to 100 with a constant increment of 10. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> shows the impact of the parameter f on RMSE under different matrix densities settings, where we can find that the prediction accuracy of our model increases with the increase in parameter f . However, it performs stably on RMSE when the parameter f is greater than 50.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this study, we propose a novel QoS prediction method to build an effective service recommendation system, which incorporates network location information and implicit associations between users and services. We propose a novel clustering algorithm by improving the initialization, integrating the user's network location information to find similar users. We also propose a novel PMF model. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset, and the results verify the effectiveness of our models.</p><p>In the future, we plan to investigate the performance of our models on more QoS properties, such as reputation and reliability. In addition, we are going to investigate ways of incorporating time factor into the existing models.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1.
