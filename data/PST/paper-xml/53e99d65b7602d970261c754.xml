<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) as an essential network component of smart grid, provides services by periodically collecting the charging status of a battery vehicle (BV). A BV is normally associated with a default interest group (e.g., power grid operator). When the BV accesses its default charging or communication point, it works in the home mode. The BV may move around and temporarily access other aggregators, and then it works in the visiting mode. In this paper, we first identify that, for an aggregator, BVs have different security challenges when they work in different modes. Then, we propose an aggregated-proofs based privacy-preserving authentication scheme (AP3A) to achieve simultaneous identification and secure identification for different working mode BVs. In AP3A, BVs are differentiated into either home or visiting mode, and multiple BVs can be simultaneously authenticated by an aggregator to conserve communication resources.</p><p>In addition, the aggregated pseudo-status variation is presented to realize that multiple BVs' power status can be collected as a whole without revealing any individual privacy. We perform comprehensive analysis on the proposed scheme, including attack analysis, security analysis, and performance analysis. It is shown that AP3A can resist major attacks for security protection and privacy preservation, and can be an efficient authentication approach for V2G networks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>However, communication may suffer from data leakage, therefore, security becomes a significant issue in V2G networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>In V2G networks, a BV is normally associated with a default interest group. Here, an interest group is a generic term and can represent a power grid operator or an organization. In daily usage, the BV may move around in different sub-areas which belong to different groups. During the BV's interactions with different groups, it may have different security/privacy requirements and authentication implementation. In this paper, we will identify and address a new security challenge in V2G networks due to BVs' movement around different sub-areas with different group attributes.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows two working modes: home mode and visiting mode. The aggregator serves as the default charging and communication access point for the white BVs. We say that the white BVs work in the home mode when they access the aggregator. The black BVs move from other sub-areas and temporarily access the aggregator, and they work in the visiting mode. In this scenario, the BVs confront different security requirements in different working modes. For instance, the home mode BVs and the aggregator may perform more convenient authentication mode than those belonging to different groups. Therefore, a universal authentication scheme is not suitable for BVs, and we need to design different authentication protocols for BVs in different modes.</p><p>During the interaction between BVs and an aggregator, the aggregator can monitor the BVs to capture the charging status. The process of data acquisition may confront the abuse of privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. For instance, it is possible to correlate a BV's identity information with its detailed power status. It becomes critical to realize anonymous data transmission for privacy consideration. Furthermore, it has been shown that most BVs are averagely in the parking status 95% of a whole day <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. This indicates that an aggregator may have several BVs at one time. Thereafter, it is possible for an aggregator to simultaneously authenticate several BVs during their stay in the parking lots. It is envi-sioned that the aggregated authentication can conserve system resources compared with the one-by-one authentication scheme.</p><p>Based on aforementioned requirements, we will focus on the privacy preservation authentication: 1) to differentiate the working modes, and to design a new authentication scheme for different groups. The technical details in authenticating different modes will be further presented in Section IV-C; 2) to consider a simultaneous identification and authentication scheme to effectively authenticate multiple BVs at the same time; 3) to periodically collect power status data without compromising individual privacy, here the power status refers to a BV's energy related status information (e.g., charging efficiency, and battery saturation status). It is observed that working modes differentiation or its security consideration has not been studied yet in the context of V2G networks. For simultaneous authentication, we are inspired by coexistence-proof which was studied in radio frequency identification (RFID) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In RFID systems, coexistence-proof is mainly introduced to simultaneously scan multiple tags by a reader. It is noteworthy that the coexistence-proof technique cannot be trivially applied in V2G networks. Traditional coexistence-proofs schemes usually require an entity as a proof initiator which acts as central role during the communications. As the proof initiator, it needs to link, distribute, and collect messages from other generic entities. In decentralized V2G networks, it is very difficult to appoint a BV to act as such entity. Hence, a new mechanism is needed since all BVs are equivalent. For this reason, we will present simultaneous existence of multiple BVs as a whole group to be verified by an aggregator. Following this, the established aggregated-proofs can realize the multiple-to-single authentication for both the home and the visiting BVs.</p><p>In particular, an aggregated-proofs based privacy-preserving authentication scheme (AP3A) is proposed in the V2G networks. We have proved that the proposed AP3A scheme can achieve the following security requirements. 1) Data confidentiality, integrity, and availability: The exchanged messages between BVs and aggregators should be protected against unauthorized access and modification. The communication channels should be ensured reliable for legal entities. 2) Mutual authentication: BVs and an aggregator should pass each other's verification so that any illegal BV cannot access the networks to steal power resources, and any illegal aggregator cannot acquire the BV's power status data. 3) Dynamic participation: BVs can dynamically join and leave the networks without influencing ongoing communications. 4) Forward and backward security: Attackers cannot correlate two communication sessions, and also cannot derive the previous or subsequent interrogations according to the current session. 5) Privacy preservation: Aggregators or attackers cannot correlate a BV's real identity with its private power information (e.g., state of charge). In summary, we have three major contributions in this work.</p><p>• We identify the necessity in differentiating BVs' home and visiting modes in V2G networks, and consequently propose different authentication schemes for different modes.</p><p>Multiple BVs can simultaneously access and be authenticated by an aggregator with dynamic participation and session unlinkability.</p><p>• We present anonymous aggregated-proofs to realize the geographically dispersed BVs' power status to be collected as a group without revealing any individual privacy. • We introduce a virtual battery vehicle concept for privacy consideration, which is an independent component to enhance message randomization and to realize distributed nondistinctive identifications. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the related work. Section III describes the system model, and Section IV introduces the proposed AP3A scheme. Section V further discusses the attack analysis. The security analysis and performance analysis are presented in Sections VI and VII respectively. Finally, Section VIII draws a conclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RELATED WORK</head><p>Towards the security solutions in V2G networks: Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> identified privacy-preserving issues and proposed a secure communication architecture with blind signature to achieve privacy-preserving for BV monitoring and rewarding. The protocol focuses on the privacy-preserving communication and precise reward architecture for V2G networks. Guo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> proposed an interesting batch authentication protocol to address the multiple responses from a batch of vehicles. The proposed protocol introduces the concept of interval time for an aggregator authenticating multiple vehicles, and applies the modified digital signature algorithm (DSA) to establish batch verification. The protocol focuses on multiple BVs' batch authentication for V2G networks. Vaidya et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> proposed a multi-domain network architecture for V2G networks. The protocol incorporates a comprehensive hybrid public key infrastructures (PKI) model which integrates hierarchical and peer-to-peer cross-certifications.</p><p>Towards the general security researches in smart grid: He et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> considered the secure service provision in smart grid, and established a communications procedure among the electric utility, consumers, and service providers. Metke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> discussed the main security technologies for smart grid, including PKI algorithm and the trusted computing. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proposed a one-time signature scheme based multicast authentication scheme, which effectively reduces both storage cost and signature size. Efthymiou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> proposed a privacy solution for anonymizing the high-frequency metering data by a pseudonymous identifier. Qiu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> proposed an energy efficient security algorithm for power grid wide area monitoring system by encryption-decryption based code optimization techniques. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> applied the hierarchical Petri net (PN) model to analyze cyber-physical attacks on smart grid. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> built a distributed intrusion detection system, which uses the support vector machine and artificial immune system to detect malicious data and cyber-attacks. Son et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> proposed a voucher scheme for securely trading the authority on the power usage for the collaborative customer community. Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> proposed a key management scheme which combines symmetric key encryption and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to realize scalability and fault-tolerance. Fouda et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> proposed a lightweight message authentication scheme, in which the shared session key is established with Diffie-Hellman exchange protocol, and the mutual authentication is achieved by the shared session key and hash-based authentication code. Lu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> proposed an aggregation scheme to achieve privacy preservation, which applies a super-increasing sequence to structure multi-dimensional data and encrypt the structured data by the homomorphic Paillier algorithm.</p><p>Different from existing security protocols in V2G and smart grid, we will identify and solve a new security challenge in V2G networks due to BVs' movement. We also observe that BVs may work in different modes within an aggregator's range. Thus, a universal authentication scheme is not suitable for all BVs in an aggregator. We need to design different authentication protocols for BVs that work in different modes (i.e., the home and visiting modes). It is observed that BVs' working modes are not differentiated in the literature. As a result, distinct security challenges for different groups have not been studied yet in the previous studies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Network Model</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> illustrates the V2G network architecture with the home and visiting modes BVs. The V2G network architecture mainly includes three real entities and one virtual entity: battery vehicles ( s), local aggregators ( s), central authority ( ), and virtual battery vehicles ( s). Both real and viral entities participate in power transmission and information communication: the solid line is for power transmission, and the dashed line is for information communication. A is owned by an individual owner, and is normally associated with a preferred power grid operator.</p><p>s are granted by a power grid operator to collect s' power status data for power scheduling. as a trusted third party belongs to an independent institution. as a virtual entity provides ancillary authentication function for its attached . In the network architecture, s can simultaneously access to obtain charing services, can directly communicate with the smart grid on behalf of the geographically dispersed s to obtain power status data. can derive the uploaded aggregated-proofs to achieve further bill services (e.g., payment for charging).</p><p>Assume that there are two groups in the V2G networks, and we designate in-group entities to include the home battery vehicles s, home local aggregator , and home virtual battery vehicle of the same group, and the home mode is launched by ; out-group entities to include the visiting battery vehicles s, visiting local aggregator , and visiting virtual battery vehicle of different groups, and the visiting mode is launched by . In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, and represent the aggregators of two different groups, and s can work as the home mode BVs and the visiting mode BVs for an in-group aggregator and an out-group aggregator. For the sake of illustration, we use two denotations for the same . For instance, the denotations are used for when it provides services for and , respectively. For instance, a specific battery vehicle moves from the range of to the range of , and it may act as for in the home mode. When it moves to the range of , it may act as for in the visiting mode.</p><p>Towards the introduced , it is embedded into a to provide support to enhance message randomization and to realize distributed nondistinctive identification. Similarly, has the variants for the home and visiting modes, and the detailed working mode is determined by the group attributes of the interactive and . It means that may coexist in a single during the interactions of the in-group and out-group entities. We introduce the concept of mainly due to privacy consideration. communicates with and is also under 's jurisdiction. For this reason, cannot obtain the 's private algorithms (e.g., pseudo-random status generation, and Hamming distance based extension). In addition, plays different roles in different access modes to deal with diverse security requirements. In the home mode, performs the necessary pseudo-status storage and re-computation for the additional data inquiry. In the visiting mode, will not store a 's pseudo-status data for privacy consideration (e.g., individual or group interest privacy). In the networks, is self-triggered upon receiving s' access challenges, and it may be in three phases, including the pre-trigger phase, trigger phase, and post-trigger phase.</p><p>• Pre-trigger phase: Upon receiving a 's challenge, is in the pre-trigger phase and is ready to launch its functions; • Trigger phase: Upon forwarding the 's session identifier, is in the trigger phase. Then, invokes its private algorithms and performs corresponding operations in different working modes; • Post-trigger phase: Upon transmitting the multiple s' aggregated-proofs to is in the post-trigger phase and is ready for the next round challenge. The communication between , , and is not limited to a specific communication technology. It can be based on either traditional computer networks or wireless communications. For instance, the interface between and can use radio frequency identification (RFID).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Trust and Attack Model</head><p>Trust relationships among the entities are as follows.</p><p>is the only entity trusted by all the other entities. and have inherent mutual trust, and no other direct trust relationships exist among , , and . Generally, are rational and sensitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Being rational means that a 's behavior would be never based on experience or emotion, and misbehavior may only occur for selfish interests. Being sensitive means that a is reluctant to disclosure its sensitive data, but has strong interests in others' privacy. Meanwhile, that is granted by a power grid operator, is assumed to be honest but curious. Being honest means that always appropriately follows the protocol procedure. Being curious means that may attempt to obtain s' private information (e.g., state of charge) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Suppose that the communication channels between and are exposed to an attacker, which has the following capabilities. The attacker may: 1) corrupt the aggregator and the virtual battery vehicle, and impersonate as a legal entity to forward and modify the intercepted messages in the current session; 2) eavesdrop and record the exchanged messages in the former sessions, and replay the messages in the ongoing communication; 3) perform tracking and traffic analysis to monitor and estimate user privacy. The attacker cannot: 1) obtain pre-shared secrets, and distort the built-in timestamp of the exchanged messages; 2) extract the real identifier via the intercepted messages, and generate the consistent pseudonyms; 3) acquire the pseudo-random generation algorithm of the virtual battery vehicle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. PROPOSED AUTHENTICATION SCHEME: AP3A</head><p>The proposed AP3A with the home mode and the visiting mode is designed for the in-group and out-group entities. In the home mode, multiple (i.e., ) simultaneously access to perform power services (e.g., charging). collects the BVs' power status data with the assistance of to provide information services for smart grid, meantime periodically uploads the aggregated data to for bill services.   Similarly, the out-group key can be obtained according to the DH key agreement and mutual authentication. In the following authentication, we consider the multiple BVs for and , which are regarded as a whole entity during the following specifications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Authenticating Home BVs</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the interaction among , , and in the home mode, in which the in-group vehicles simultaneously access the in-group , and can provide the distributed power services and other advanced data inquiry services.  will regard the suspicious as an illegal vehicle and eliminate it from the protocol.

Authenticating Visiting BVs</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the interaction among , , and in the visiting mode, in which the out-group vehicles are not under 's default jurisdiction, and the out-group only provides the basic power services without storing BVs' privacy data or providing additional data inquiry services. The limited authority is appointed for the visiting mode according to the practical applications. Upon receiving the message, computes , and verifies by checking whether the computed equals the received . If it does not hold, will regard the suspicious as an illegal vehicle and eliminate it from the protocol; otherwise, the protocol will continue.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Requirements and Approaches for Authenticating BVs in Different Modes</head><p>In this section, we will clarify the privacy requirements to authenticate BVs in different modes, and present the approaches to satisfy the authentication differentiations.</p><p>1) Power Service Privilege: The home mode serves for in-group entities to provide the distributed power services and other data inquiry services. Thereby, performs pseudo-status storage and recomputing to conduce to later data inquiry.</p><p>stores the pseudo-status , and re-computes to realize pseudo-status inquiry within an allowable time interval. Hence, the home mode allows to store for 's future retracing. The visiting mode serves for out-group entities to only provide the basic power services without allowing to store a BV's pseudo-status for privacy consideration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Power Status Derivation:</head><p>In a practical application, the in-group and out-group entities share different secrets and algorithms. It is necessary for the home mode to perform the reversible SKE algorithm by the in-group keys for mutual authentication, and for the visiting mode to apply the nonreversible HMAC function to avoid data inverse derivation.</p><p>Towards authentication operators, performs the symmetric key encryption on with the in-group key to obtain , and on with the updated key to obtain . The authentication operators are computed via symmetric key encryption. While applies HMAC function on , , with the updated out-group key , and on with the group identifier-based key . It realizes that verify each other based on the reversible encryption algorithm, and perform the verification via the nonreversible function, which conforms the two modes' conditions.</p><p>3) Entity Group Attribution: The group attribution can recognize that whether the communicated entities belong to the same group, initiate the corresponding home or visiting mode, and extract the in-group or out-group keys for authentication.</p><p>In the home mode, can recognize that belong to the in-group entities by the identity flag , and the following authentication does not need to introduce any group identifier. Different from the home mode, the visiting mode performs the group attribution extraction with the purpose to ascertain the BVs' general group information, rather than to obtain the detailed identity information. and need extract each other's group identifiers as the authentication operators, and ascertain the corresponding out-group keys . can only know that the corresponding in-group or out-group has accessed the networks, rather than acquaint 's specific identity. This process can enhance privacy preservation since there is no real identifiers leakage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Entity Prior-Trust Degree:</head><p>The home and visiting modes have different authentication demands. Particularly, first performs authentication on in the home mode while first verifies in the visiting mode. For , it knows that the accessed aggregator is its home aggregator, thereby has a strong demand to verify the unknown . For , it knows that and itself belong to different groups, and it is a more vulnerable entity and has a stronger demand to authenticate . Therefore, it is desirable for to first perform verification on .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5) Entity Session Control:</head><p>In the home mode, and jointly work to monitor the active session in order to maximize 's session control efficiency, which is convenient for the in-group aggregator to provide full services for its supervised BVs. Particularly, generate session identifiers , and extends into . The re-computed session identifiers are obtained to guarantee session freshness. Comparatively, in the visiting mode, only owns the initiative to generate and control session identifier .</p><p>does not publish any session identifier to minimize the access privilege of the out-group BVs, and provides the basic power services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. ATTACK ANALYSIS</head><p>We perform attack analysis, including impersonation attack, replay attack, and denial of service (DoS) attack.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Impersonation Attack</head><p>Impersonation is a typical attack, in which an attacker forges as a legal entity to obtain the access authority. For instance, an imitated vehicle impersonates as an in-group vehicle (or an out-group vehicle ) to access (or ). If the aggregator cannot discern the suspicious vehicle, may perform power stealing or cheating. For another unfrequent instance, an imitated local aggregator serves as (or ) to collect s' power status. If the s cannot recognize the suspicious aggregator, the sensitive data may be abused with malicious intentions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Replay Attack</head><p>Replay attack means that an attacker eavesdrops a legal entity's messages during former sessions, and in another session the attacker replays the intercepted messages to involve into the current communication. For instance, an illegal vehicle replays 's query to challenge , or an illegal aggregator replays 's response to reply 's query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1)</head><p>Replay Attack: Suppose that an attacker replays 's outdated query to involve into the communication. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Denial of Service Attack</head><p>DoS attack may be caused by flooding data streams or jamming channels to interfere in the normal communication. An attacker may disguise as legal a BV to transmit a huge number of queries with false addresses. The purpose of the DoS attack is not to capture a BV's sensitive information, but rather to ensure that a legal entity cannot establish communication.</p><p>In AP3A, the quick check mechanism is able to resist the DoS attack. For instance, an attacker may disguise as to consecutively challenge a legal . Upon receiving the queries, performs the quick check on by verifying whether the received and repeatedly emerge within an unacceptable time interval.</p><p>can discern the illegal according to the one-time-valid session identifier and the incorrect timestamp in the identity flag , and will eliminate it from the protocol without influencing other ongoing authentications. Thus, cannot involve into the sessions to disturb the normal communication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. SECURITY ANALYSIS</head><p>We perform security analysis that focuses on the security requirements for V2G networks, and present the main features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Data Confidentiality and Data Integrity</head><p>Data confidentiality and data integrity are achieved by the anonymous aggregated-proofs. Towards the aggregated-proofs , six parameters are included: are the aggregated pseudo-status variations to provide information for power scheduling, the pseudo-random numbers and the session identifiers are used to guarantee data randomization and session freshness, the identity flags are used to determine group attributes, and are used to derive the detailed real-status for bill purposes. Meanwhile, apply HMAC functions on the current real-status , to obtain , in which have been wrapped with . Upon receiving the messages, map their respective real-status-inbuilt values into the pseudo-status to realize anonymous data transmission. Particularly, the aggregated-proofs are established based on the distributed networks, which may reduce the dependency on the central authority. Meanwhile, applies the primary authentication on multiple s, and eliminates any suspicious s from the protocol without influencing other ongoing authentications. Meanwhile, the identity flags with the timestamp are used for the quick check, which may terminate the malicious message challenges to alleviate the DoS attack, and to provide enhanced data availability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Mutual Authentication</head><p>Two round mutual authentications are performed to establish trusted relationships. In both the home and visiting modes, and first perform the quick check based on the received session identifiers and identity flags. Thereafter, and verify each other by SKE or HMAC algorithms. During the execution of the cryptographic algorithms, the in-group key is assigned to and , and the out-group key is assigned to and . If and only if both mutual authentications succeed, s will transmit the pseudo-status to for the final aggregated-proofs establishment. (or ) periodically uploads the current aggregated pseudo-status along with other parameters to . Furthermore, even if only one BV (e.g., ) communicates with an aggregator , the aggregated pseudo-status cannot reveal 's real-status. knows nothing about the function , so that it cannot compute to derive the real-status variation .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Forward and Backward Unlinkability</head><p>Towards , the session identifiers are XORed as the combined session identifier , and the timestamp in the identity flags are dynamic to ensure the identity randomization. Towards , the session identifier and the combined identity flag jointly guarantee the session freshness. Meanwhile, the home and visiting modes also introduce the extended pseudo-random numbers and pseudo-status to make the communication unlinkable, and the nonreversible HMAC function assists to provide forward and backward security. The attacker regards the previous sessions as random even if both s and have been corrupted, and regards the subsequent sessions as random even if the attacker can intercept the current exchanged messages. The current security compromises cannot correlate with the previous and subsequent interactions due to the introduced pseudo-random values (e.g., session identifier).</p></div>

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS</head><p>The storage requirement of a includes a real identifier , a pseudo-identity flag , a group identifier , an in-group key , an out-group key , and two access lists of aggregators' identity flags and pseudonyms . is assumed to be a hardware-unrestricted entity, which includes a pseudonym , in-group key set , and out-group key set . Meanwhile, has additional components: metering device, control and communication module, and the hardware cost is moderate <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>The computation load mainly consists of the bitwise logical operation (BLO), pseudo-random number generation (PRNG), symmetric key encryption (SKE), keyed hash message authentication code (HMAC), and other defined arithmetic functions (DAF). The computation loads of the home and  <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">II</ref>. Both modes have comparable computation loads, and the main distinction is on SKE and HMAC operations due to the practical applications. In AP3A, lightweight and flexible encryption algorithms may be recommended. For instance, AES 128-bit keysize encryption <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, needs less than 5 K logic gates for tiny solution, less than 9.5 K logic gates for standard solution, and less than 27 K logic gates for fast solution. HMAC-SHA-256 [31] needs less than 30 K logic gates. Meanwhile, the extension approach on is based on the pre-defined Hamming distance, and avoid performing the PRNG operation for each to alleviate redundant calculations. The communication overhead depends on the data packets during the protocol execution. The authentication scheme completes via 4 rounds for the home mode, and 3 rounds for the visiting mode. Thereinto, the pseudo-status storage and recomputing phase does not executed in the visiting mode. Suppose that: 1) the session identifier, identity flag, and pseudo-random number are 16-bit length; 2) the pseudo-status and its variant are 64-bit length; 3) the encrypted SKE and HMAC values are 128-bit length. Thus, the communication overheads of and are estimated as bytes in the home mode, and bytes in the visiting mode, respectively. The communication overhead is lightweight for the current communication environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have identified a new security challenge for authenticating different group BVs, and proposed an authentication scheme AP3A with the home and visiting modes in V2G networks. The proposed scheme applies anonymous aggregated-proofs to achieve an aggregator simultaneous authenticating BVs without compromising individual privacy. Besides the accredited privacy preservation, other essential features include mutual authentication, dynamic participation, and session unlinkability. Security analysis and performance analysis indicated that AP3A can perform securely and efficiently for V2G networks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
