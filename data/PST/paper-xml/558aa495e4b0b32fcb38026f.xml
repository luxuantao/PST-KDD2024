<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we consider a wavelet based edge-preserving regularization scheme for use in linear image restoration problems. Our efforts build on a collection of mathematical results indicating that wavelets are especially useful for representing functions that contain discontinuities (i.e., edges in two dimensions or jumps in one dimension). We interpret the resulting theory in a statistical signal processing framework and obtain a highly flexible framework for adapting the degree of regularization to the local structure of the underlying image. In particular, we are able to adapt quite easily to scale-varying and orientation-varying features in the image while simultaneously retaining the edge preservation properties of the regularizer.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I N MANY applications, recorded images represent a de- graded version of the original scene. For example, the images of extraterrestrial objects observed by ground based telescopes are distorted by atmospheric turbulence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> while motion of a camera can result in an undesired blur in a recorded image. Despite the different origins, these two cases along with others from a variety of fields, share a common structure where the exact image undergoes a "forward transformation" and is corrupted by observation noise. The source of this noise is the disturbance caused by the random fluctuations in the imaging system and the environment. The goal of image restoration is to recover the original image from these degraded measurements.</p><p>Often, the forward transformation acts as a smoothing agent so that the resulting restoration problem is ill-posed in the sense that small perturbations in the data can result in large, nonphysical artifacts in the recovered image <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Such instability is typically addressed through the use of a regularization procedure which introduces a priori information about the original image into the restoration process. The prior information underlying the most commonly used regularization schemes is that the image is basically smooth <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. While the regularized restorations are less sensitive to noise it is well known that the smoothness assumption impedes the accurate recovery of important features, especially edges.</p><p>In response to this problem, there has recently been considerable work in the formulation of "edge-preserving" regularization methods which result in less smoothing to areas with large intensity changes in the restored image. These methods necessarily require nonquadratic regularization functions and therefore result in nonlinear image restoration algorithms. Along these lines, Geman and Yang <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> introduced the concept of "half quadratic regularization" which addresses the nonlinear optimization problem that results from using such functions. Later, Charbonnier et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> built upon the results of this work by providing the conditions for edge preserving regularization functions. Another recent advance in this area is the total variation (TV) based image restoration algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In this approach, images are modeled as functions of bounded variation which need not be continuous. Therefore, formations of edges are encouraged and the restorations obtained by the TV based algorithms look sharper than those obtained by conventional techniques, especially if the exact image is piecewise continuous.</p><p>In this work, we consider a statistically based, wavelet-domain approach to edge-enhanced image restoration in which we employ a stochastic interpretation of the regularization process <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. We note that most of the work to date on wavelet-based, statistical regularization methods has concentrated on the use of multiscale smoothness priors <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. While Wang et al. did consider issues of edge preservation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, their method was based on the processing of the output of an edge detector applied to the noisy data to alter the degree of regularization in a multiscale smoothness constraint. As described below and in subsequent sections, our approach is significantly different as the edge preservation is built directly into the regularization scheme itself.</p><p>Specifically, we regard the image as a realization of a random field for which the wavelet coefficients are independently distributed according to generalized Gaussian (GG) distribution laws. This model is motivated by two factors. First, recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, suggests that these models, which have heavier tails than a straight Gaussian distribution, provide accurate descriptions of the statistical distribution of wavelet coefficients in image data. Second, in addition to being a basis for , wavelets also are unconditional bases for more exotic function spaces whose members include functions with sharp discontinuities and thus serve as natural function spaces in which to analyze images <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Because the norms in these Besov spaces are nothing more than weighted , , norms of the wavelet coefficients, it is shown easily that deterministic regularization with a Besov norm constraint is equivalent to the specification of an appropriately parameterized GG wavelet prior model. From this perspective, our work can be viewed as an extension of the research done mostly in the area of image denoising. Specifically, the wavelet domain image model of interest in this paper and the resulting nonlinear restoration algorithm are related to the large body of work originating from the wavelet shrinkage estimators first proposed by Donoho and Johnstone <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In a series of papers, Donoho and Johnstone have shown that wavelet shrinkage estimators achieve near optimal estimation performance when the unknown signal belongs to Besov spaces. Later, several authors contributed to the advancements in the area. The notion of Besov regularization has been introduced by Amato and Vuza <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and Chambolle, DeVore, Lee, and Lucier <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and the resulting theory was interpreted in a function space setting. On the other hand, Simoncelli and Adelson <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> developed a similar denoising scheme, which they called Bayesian wavelet coring, by stochastically modeling the image subbands.</p><p>In this work, we make use of GG wavelet priors in a number of ways. We show that their use in an image restoration problem does in fact significantly improve the quality of edge information relative to more common smoothness priors. Inspired by the "lagged diffusivity" fixed point iteration proposed by Vogel and Oman <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> for the solution of the TV problem, we also provide an efficient algorithm for solving the nonlinear optimization problem defining the restoration. By appropriately structuring the weighting pattern on the wavelet norm, we demonstrate that these models provide an easy and flexible framework for adaptively determining the appropriate level of regularization as a function of the underlying structure in the image; in particular, scale-to-scale or orientation based features. This adaptation is achieved through a data-driven choice of a vector of regularization parameters. For this task, we introduce and make use of a multivariate generalization of the -curve method developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> for choosing a single regularization parameter. We verify the performance of this restoration scheme on a variety of images, comparing the results both to smoothness constrained methods and the TV restorations.</p><p>We recognize that there are asymptotic results which state that the -curve does not provide consistent estimates of the regularization parameters either as the noise level goes to zero or the data length goes to infinity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. In the nonasymptotic regime however, empirical results do point to the practical utility of this method. Moreover, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, the -curve framework is easily adapted to handle multiple regularization parameters, a feature required for the work here.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II we give the wavelet domain formulation of the image restoration problem. In Section III we introduce a multiscale prior model for images and use this model in Section IV to develop an image restoration algorithm. In Section V we apply the " -hypersurface" method to the simultaneous multiple parameter selection problem posed by our image restoration al-gorithm. In Section VI we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing our results with existing image restoration schemes. Finally, in Section VII, conclusions and future work are discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. REGULARIZED IMAGE RESTORATION</head><p>A grey-scale image, , can be considered as a collection of pixels obtained by digitizing a continuous scene. The image is indexed by , , and the intensity at the position is denoted by . In image reconstruction and restoration problems, the objective is to estimate the image from its degraded measurements. Mathematically, such a scenario can be adequately represented by the following linear formulation: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where the vectors , and represent, respectively, the lexicographically ordered degraded image, the original image, and the disturbance. The known square matrix represents the linear distortion.</p><p>is typically ill-conditioned. This implies that the exact solution, , to (1) is extremely contaminated by noise. Rather, a unique and stable estimate is sought by incorporating prior information on the original image. This has the effect of replacing the original ill-conditioned problem with a well-conditioned one whose solution approximates that of the original. Such a technique is called a regularization method <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>In the Bayesian image restoration method of interest here, the prior information is quantified by specifying a probability density on and combining this with the information contained in to produce an estimate of the unknown image. We assume here a linear, additive white Gaussian noise model so that the probability density for is where is the number of pixels in the image and is the noise variance. If it so happens that the probability distribution for is in the form then by Bayes's rule, the MAP estimate, , is obtained by minimizing the following log-posterior density with respect to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> (2)</p><p>The function , called the energy function in the context of Bayesian estimation, is the energy attributed to the image , and is the vector of possibly unknown model parameters. We give low energy to the images which coincide with our prior conceptions and high energy to those which do not. Thus, if our prior belief about the image is that the original image is smooth, then the energy is a measure of the roughness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Wavelet Representation of Image Restoration Problem</head><p>In this paper, we adopt a wavelet domain approach to the image restoration problem. A comprehensive introduction to the wavelet theory can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. It is possible to obtain the wavelet transform of images through a separable representation. This decomposition can be implemented by one- where is the 2-D wavelet transform matrix, , and are the vectors holding the scaling and wavelet coefficients of the data, the original image, and the disturbance, is the wavelet domain representation of our linear degradation operator , and follows from the orthogonality of the wavelet transform. Note that since the wavelet transform is orthonormal is again Gaussian with zero mean and variance .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. MULTISCALE IMAGE MODEL</head><p>A key component of our image restoration algorithm is the use of a multiscale stochastic prior model for . To motivate the particular choice of prior model used here, consider the wavelet coefficients of a typical image at a particular resolution. Wavelet coefficients are obtained by differentiation-like operations. Since the spatial structure of many images typically consists of smooth areas dispersed with occasional edges, the distribution of wavelet coefficients should be sharply peaked around zero, due to the contribution of smooth areas, and have broad tails representing the contribution of the edges <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Following the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> on image coding and denoising, we model the distribution of wavelet coefficients of images by a generalized Gaussian (</p><p>) density <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> (4)</p><p>where is a parameter which determines the tail behavior of the density function and is a scale parameter similar to the standard deviation of a Gaussian density. We will refer to the zero mean density in (4) as . For we have the Laplacian density and for we have the familiar Gaussian density. The tails of the GG distribution becomes increasingly heavy as approaches zero. We assume that the mean of the image is subtracted from the image and that the scaling coefficients , are i.i.d. . The specification of one parameter for each scale and orientation results in an image model far too complex to be of use in a restoration procedure. Nonetheless, the structure of the model in (4) coupled with the specification of the problem in the wavelet domain does suggest a variety of simplifications which are of use for the restoration problem. In this work, we consider the following three models.</p><p>1) Model 1: Scaling coefficients , are i.i.d. with and the wavelet coefficients are i.i.d. with exponentially decreasing variances, i.e.</p><p>with the coarsest scale, the scale parameter corresponding to and . The rationale behind this model is that it is equivalent to a deterministic modeling of the image as a member of a Besov space <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. . Such a model is most suitable for images with significantly different characteristics in different orientations as might arise in geophysical restoration problems involving layered structures. We make several observations regarding these models. First, they are indeed of low dimensionality. In addition to the and parameters, Model 1 is characterized by two coefficients: one for the coarsest scale scaling coefficients and one multiplying the exponential for the wavelet coefficients. There are a total of 's for Model 2 and four values required to characterize Model 3. In subsequent sections, we shall see that the number of regularization parameters to be determined in the restoration algorithm is equal to the number of 's characterizing the prior model being used. Moreover, an appropriate on-line choice of the model parameters provides a mechanism for adapting the level of regularization in an image to the underlying scale-to-scale structure (Models 1 and 2) or to orientation-dependent structure (Model 3). While, the above three models certainly do not represent an exhaustive enumeration of all possible multiscale regularization approaches, as seen in Section VI, they do provide a strong indication as to the utility of this type of modeling technique for image restoration.</p><p>Finally, we comment on the estimation of the hyperparameters, , , and . In a restoration algorithm, these parameters could be estimated from the data by assigning appropriate priors to each and maximizing the resulting log-posterior function with respect to the hyper-parameters and the image. However, such an approach presents many computational difficulties and unnecessarily complicates the problem. Instead, for the remainder of this paper we choose to simplify the problem by fixing the and a priori. Generally, the performance of the regularizer is impacted to a greater extent by the on-line identification of the parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> (or as explained in subsequent sections, quantities closely related to ) so we concentrate our effort on identifying good choices of . The issue of selecting an appropriate is extensively discussed in Section IV-A. As for the selection of , we propose using a fixed a priori choice obtained from the empirical study of a number of images. According to our findings, for most images representing natural scenes the value which produced the best fit to the image data under the Model 1 scheme (for ) fell between 0.6-1.6 with mean . We evaluated the effects of varying the value on a number of restoration problems and saw that the results were relatively insensitive to variations in in the range suggested by the observations. The first example in Section VI supports this. Note also that past research reveals similar conclusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> indicating that the performance of the estimator is degraded little by the error in . Therefore, for all experiments performed we used as our fixed a priori choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. MULTISCALE IMAGE RESTORATION ALGOITHM</head><p>The MAP estimate of the wavelet coefficients of the original image is found by maximizing the log-posterior function in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Substituting the prior probability density developed in Section III into (2), the MAP estimate of is seen to be the minimum of the following cost function with respect to (assuming for the time being that is known)</p><p>(5) where are weighting parameters and . The formulation in (5) easily accommodates the Models 1-3 regularization schemes discussed in Section III by defining the appropriate relationships for . For example, putting and results in the Model 1 regularization scheme while assigning a different to each scale in the wavelet domain without regarding the orientation we obtain the Model 2 regularization scheme. Suppose that has a minimum in , then at a stationary point , the gradient of must vanish. Unfortunately, the norm terms appearing in ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) is not differentiable for . Hence, we propose the following smooth approximation to the norm, raised to the power , as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> (</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">)<label>6</label></formula><p>where is a stabilization constant and denotes the th element of the vector . Substituting ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">6</ref>) into ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and taking the gradient of the cost function we arrive at the following equation ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> where is the minimum of with the approximation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, is the th element of , and is the associated regularization parameter. The above equation gives the first order conditions that must be satisfied by . By direct analogy with the lagged diffusivity method of Vogel and Oman <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, we can develop a fixed point iteration to solve for . Starting with an initial point , we solve the following equation for :</p><p>where is obtained by replacing by in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. The iteration is terminated whenever , with being a small positive constant. We use in our simulations. The fixed point iteration in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">9</ref>) is a special case of the "half quadratic regularization" scheme introduced by Geman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and the ARTUR scheme due to Charbonnier et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Adopting the notation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> we define the following function: <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> Then, the approximated cost function can be expressed in terms of the function . Furthermore, satisfies the conditions a)-i) presented in [4, Eq. ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>)]. Roughly speaking, these conditions ensure that the large-magnitude wavelet coefficients, primarily associated with edges, are penalized less than the small-magnitude wavelet coefficients and that the restoration algorithm is convergent in the sense that the sequence is convergent and that . In the special case where is convex (which occurs if ) and is full-rank, the iterates converge and the computed solution is the unique minimum of (5). However, when , is nonconvex the algorithm computes a local minimum of ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>The iterative algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> requires the solution of a very large linear matrix equation. Note that the matrix appearing on the right hand side of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">9</ref>) is symmetric and positive definite. Therefore, the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> can be conveniently used to compute the solution in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">9</ref>) at each step. In this way, the algorithm given in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">9</ref>) is doubly iterative in that an outer iteration is used to update the solution and an inner iteration is used to solve the system of equations in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">9</ref>) by the CG method. The special structure of the matrices and could be used to decrease the computational cost substantially. The first matrix, is merely the wavelet domain representation of our degradation operator. If the kernel is convolutional, it has been shown by Zervakis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> that this matrix can be diagonalized by a special Fourier transform matrix by invoking the circulant assumption. On the other hand, the second matrix is diagonal in the wavelet domain. Therefore, the vector matrix multiplications required for the implementation of the CG algorithm can be computed in an efficient way by going back and forth between the wavelet and the Fourier transform domains. In this case, the cost of multiplying a vector with the matrix is dominated by the cost of the FFT which is . We note that the iterative algorithm in (9) can be efficient even in the case where is not convolutional since the wavelet domain representation of a wide range of operators is sparse <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In those cases, standard techniques for sparse matrices can be used to reduce computational complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Selection of Appropriate and values</head><p>The possibility that multiple local minima of (5) may exist for presents an interesting tradeoff. From a computational viewpoint, it is highly desirable to use , since in this case the cost function is convex and global convergence is guaranteed. However, based on empirical studies of the wavelet coefficients of images it has been shown that the GG model for the distribution of the wavelet coefficients usually corresponds to and a typically recognized value is <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Analysis of the use of GG priors in the context of image denoising has been performed by Moulin and Liu <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> suggest that only modest improvement can be achieved by using as compared with . In our experiments, we essentially arrived at the same conclusion. That is, the restored images obtained by using the best value of (in terms of model fit) were visually almost the same as the results obtained by using , although slightly lower estimation errors were observed for</p><p>. Therefore, we propose using as the fixed a priori choice for the shape parameter of the GG distribution. Note that we do not claim that is the right value for all types of images. Rather, we are saying that the estimation of directly from the data is a complicated problem and in the absence of accurate prior information on , provides strong restoration results with guaranteed global convergence properties.</p><p>The role of the parameter is two-fold. First it controls how close the approximation in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">6</ref>) is to the original norm. Using a relatively small provides better restoration of edges in the image since a smaller value provides better approximation to the norm. Second, it essentially determines the convergence speed of the algorithm. While we do not intend to carry out a numerical analysisofthefixedpointiterationin(9),thebasicreasonisthatfor , in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> is not differentiable at and instability in the numerical computations may arise. If is relatively large, the algorithm is fast, and the convergence speed deteriorates as gets smaller. Therefore, should be set so as to achieve a compromise between the convergence speed and the edge preservation. Based on our experience on natural scenes, we found that restorations obtained for were visually indistinguishable from the restorations obtained for . We note that a similar value is recommended for the TV algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. REGULARIZATION PARAMETERS SELECTION</head><p>In this paper, we use a multidimensional extension of the -curve method <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, called the -hypersurface method <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, to determine in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. In order to describe the method thoroughly, we consider the following generalized image restoration scheme where the estimate of the original image is obtained by minimizing the following cost function <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> where are the regularization parameters and are the corresponding regularization operators. The cost function in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> represents a multiply constrained least squares problem and includes many popular image restoration schemes as its special cases. Our wavelet domain image restoration algorithm is obtained if , and are in the wavelet domain and are the operators which extract desired portions of the wavelet transform of . For example, we can take as the operator extracting the coarsest scale scaling coefficients and as the operator extracting the wavelet coefficients for a doubly constrained, Model 1-type problem.</p><p>To extend the -curve, we first introduce the following quantities:</p><p>With the above definitions, the " -hypersurface" <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> is defined as a subset of associated with the map , such that For a single constraint, the -hypersurface reduces to the conventional -curve which is a plot of the residual norm versus regularizes the coarsest scale scaling coefficients and is used to penalize the wavelet coefficients in a Model 1 regularization scheme.</p><p>the norm of the restored image in a doubly logarithmic scale for a set of admissible regularization parameters. In this way, the -curve displays the compromise between the minimization of these two quantities. It has been argued and numerically shown that the so called "corner" of the -curve corresponds to a point where regularization and perturbation errors are approximately balanced <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Analogous to the one dimensional case, the -hypersurface is a plot of the residual norm against the constraint norms , . Intuitively, the "generalized corner" of the -hypersurface should correspond to a point where regularization errors and perturbation errors are approximately balanced. By a generalized corner, we mean a point on the surface around which the surface is maximally warped. We can measure how much a surface is warped around a point by computing the Gaussian curvature <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, we plot a typical -hypersurface along with its Gaussian curvature and the error between the original and the restored images for a range of regularization parameters. The experiment for which the -hypersurface was computed was the restoration of a image degraded by a Gaussian blur of variance one pixel and corrupted by white Gaussian noise at 30 dB SNR. We used our multiscale algorithm with and Model 1 regularization scheme as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5(a)</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(b)</ref> shows the curvature of the -hypersurface shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(a</ref>) with (resp. ) being the regularization parameter for the scaling (resp. wavelet) coefficients. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(b)</ref> and<ref type="figure">(c</ref>) clearly indicate the usefulness of the Gaussian curvature plot in assessing the goodness of regularization parameters. It is observed that the curvature is significant along an extended maxima which is very close to a region in the error norm, , plot in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(c</ref>) where the error between the actual and the restored images is minimized. Moreover, the curvature plot indicates that there is in fact more than one good regularization parameter for the scaling coefficients, and as long as we choose the correct value for the regularization parameter corresponding to the wavelet coefficients the restorations should have approximately the same quality. The error norm plot in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(c</ref>) supports this point of view.</p><p>For the numerical experiments described in Section VI, the regularization parameters are selected by searching over a grid of parameter values in space and choosing that point whose curvature is maximum. The computational complexity of this technique is clearly quite high. The major difficulty here is that the curvature of the -hypersurface possesses many maxima/minima as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">5(c</ref>) and therefore the use of well-known optimization techniques such as the Gauss-Newton method would fail. As the primary issue of interest here is in demonstrating that there is utility to the -hypersurface method, we leave the considerable effort of finding a more efficient implementation to future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we illustrate the performance of our proposed multiscale image restoration algorithm. All computations were carried out by using the Matlab commercial software package with double precision arithmetic. We used the routines in Donoho's Wavelab toolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> for the computation of forward and inverse wavelet transforms with Daubechies' eight tap most symmetrical wavelets <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In all cases below, we limited the number of levels of wavelet decomposition to three. In the first example, we used a Gaussian convolutional kernel, , with to blur the mandrill image. Zero mean white Gaussian noise was added to set the SNR to 30 dB. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>(a) and (b), we display the original and the blurred, noisy images.</p><p>We restored the degraded mandrill image using three regularization techniques: our proposed multiscale regularization scheme, the constrained least squares (CLS) algorithm with a 2-D Laplacian regularizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and the TV algorithm. The CLS and the TV algorithms are special cases of the generalized image restoration scheme in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> for in which taking , and (i.e., 2-D Laplacian) results in the CLS cost function and and gives the cost function corresponding to the TV algorithm. The action of the 2-D Laplacian operator at the pixel is and the action of the gradient operator is given by with and . Both operators are implemented by circulantly wrapping the image at the boundaries. The relevant regularization parameters were determined using the -curve or the -hypersurface method. For the TV algorithm and our algorithm we used . Experimental results obtained for indicate that smaller In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3(c</ref>) and (d) and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>(a)-(d) we display the restored mandrill images corresponding to the CLS, the TV and the multiscale algorithm. For our multiscale image restoration method we computed four restorations, displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>(a)-(d), according to the Models 1 and 2 regularization schemes described in Section III. Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> show that both the TV algorithm and our algorithm produce restored images visually superior to the CLS algorithm. We also observe that the images restored by our algorithm are a little sharper than the image restored by the TV algorithm and that the texture-like regions abundant in the mandrill image (e.g., the hairs around the mouth of the mandrill) are better recovered by our algorithm. The root mean square error (RMSE), , between the original and restored images are listed in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. For the Model 1 restoration in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>(a) the -hypersurface was used to determine two pa-rameters, and corresponding to the coarsest scale scaling coefficients and the wavelet coefficients respectively as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5(a)</ref>. In this case, the curvature of the -hypersurface is a 2-D function of the regularization parameters as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">6(a)</ref>. Also shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6(b</ref>) is a plot of RMSE as a function of these regularization parameters. Examining these plots shows that the curvature surface has a distinct extended maxima along which the norm of the error is very close to being a minimum. Thus, we see that the restoration algorithm is not overly sensitive to the scaling coefficient regularization parameter and locating the correct regularization parameter for the wavelet coefficients is more important.</p><p>In the Model 2 restoration in Fig. with the regularization parameter corresponding to the coarsest scale being constant. Again, the maxima of the curvature of the -hypersurface track well the minima of the RMSE surface so that we are close to the "optimal" regularization parameters. We see little difference either in terms of the error norm or in terms of visual quality between the Models 1 and 2 restorations in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>(a) and (b). This example verifies the primary assumption of Model 1 scheme where it was assumed that the variance of the wavelet coefficients decrease uniformly across scales according to an exponential law.</p><p>Finally, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>(c) and (d) we display the Model 1 restorations corresponding to an idealized case where the parameters and were estimated directly from the original image. Clearly, this is not a realistic situation since in practice the original image is not available. Nonetheless, this example is interesting since it gives us an idea about how much improvement can be expected when using the optimal and values as opposed to fixed a priori choices and . The optimal was estimated by using the method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and was found to be . The exponential parameter was estimated by computing the slope of the line fitted to the for . It was found to be . Since yields a nonconvex optimization task, we computed the restorations for this case in two stages. The first stage starts with computing the restoration for , which is unique and then the restored image for is fed as the starting point to the restoration algorithm with . There is no guarantee that the restored image for corresponds to the global minimum of the cost function, nevertheless we obtained good results with this scheme. Fig. <ref type="figure">6(c</ref>) and (d) shows the -surface and the RMSE surface for , respectively. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>(c) and (d) are the restorations obtained for this case. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4(c</ref>) and (d) differs only in the value used for which was set to in (c) and in (g). As already pointed out the two restorations are visually indistinguishable, though the convergence of the algorithm took significantly longer for . Finally, comparison of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4(c</ref>) and (d) with Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>(a) and (b) reveals that there is visually little difference between the restored images corresponding to and cases. This example shows that using does not yield a significant improvement in the performance of the multiscale algorithm.</p><p>In our second example, we first blurred the original bridge image in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>  Although the RMSE values in Table <ref type="table">I</ref> were similar, the restored images in Fig. <ref type="figure">8(c</ref>) and (d) exhibit vastly different visual characteristics. The TV algorithm fails to recover many of the small features in the image and produces an overly homogenized restoration resembling an "oil painting" of the original scene. The multiscale algorithm is able to reproduce finer detail thereby yielding a more visually appealing restoration. As in the previous example, we see little difference in terms of the visual quality between the Models 1 and 2 restorations. Note that we used the same value in both mandrill and bridge examples regardless of the image considered.</p><p>In our final example, we demonstrate the orientation adaptive nature of our approach. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>(a), we display an artificial image which has significant structure in the horizontal direction, but little in the vertical and diagonal directions. This image was blurred by a Gaussian convolutional kernel with , and zero mean white Gaussian noise was added to set the SNR at 30 dB. Because of the large differences between the structure in the horizontal and vertical directions, an ideal image restoration algorithm should use different regularization parameters for vertical, horizontal and diagonal directions. With this in mind, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10(c</ref>) and (d) we display the restorations obtained using Models 1 and 3 schemes which require three regularization parameters, , , and , as displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure">5(b</ref>) and (c), respectively. The -hypersurface was employed to determine the required regularization parameters. For both Models 1 and 3 schemes, we set the scaling coefficient regularization parameter to . For the Model 3 restoration, the regularization parameters obtained for the vertical and diagonal orientations (in which the image is constant) were approximately two orders of magnitude larger than the regularization parameter obtained for the horizontal orientation. It is clear from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10(c</ref>) and (d) that the orientation adaptive algorithm produces a much better restoration than the scale adaptive algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we introduced a wavelet domain multiscale image restoration algorithm for use in linear image restoration problems. Following the recent results in the area of image denoising and coding, we developed a statistical prior model for the wavelet coefficients of images. Our priors are able to capture spatial, scale and orientational characteristics of images accurately. We developed a half-quadratic algorithm to solve the nonlinear optimization problem resulting from using such priors and utilized the -hypersurface method for choosing the required regularization parameters. Experimental results show that our algorithm can produce restorations which are visually significantly better than that of the traditional techniques and at least comparable, if not better, than that of the the edge-preserving algorithms.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
