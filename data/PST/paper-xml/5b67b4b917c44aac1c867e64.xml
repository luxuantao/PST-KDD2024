<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper addresses the distributed consensus controller design approaches for one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear multiagents by employing relative state feedback. A new treatment for one-sided Lipschitz nonlinearity is rendered from the consensus control point of view. By employing the quadratic inner-boundedness and the one-sided Lipschitz constraints, a sufficient condition for asymptotic consensus of nonlinear systems under strongly connected communication topologies is provided. Further, a robust consensus protocol design scheme for the nonlinear multiagents is derived by ensuring the L 2 stability of the consensus error system.

In contrast to the conventional consensus control methodologies, this paper is less conservative and can be applied to a broader class of nonlinear multiagent systems. Moreover, the proposed consensus control approach is less conservative for robustness against disturbances owing to its ability to handle amplitude-bounded disturbances and due to the relaxation of a balanced communication topology.

To address the communication protocols between the multiagents, graph theory has been effectively utilized for the modeling of networks and the derivation of stability conditions via Lyapunov theory.</p><p>Some important results on the consensus control of specific classes of linear, nonlinear, and fractional-order multiagents, as seen in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, respectively, have been developed. However, because various communication topologies and multiple nonlinear systems must be considered, the derivation of suitable control protocols is challenging for generalized forms of linear systems and especially challenging for nonlinear systems.</p><p>Consensus control strategies for linear multiagents have been the main focus of researchers over the last decade. To synchronize multiple discrete-time single-and doubleintegrator agents, decentralized model predictive control approaches were derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> by incorporating input constraints. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, an optimal control approach to optimize a global cost function for a deeper understanding of the stability was investigated for attaining the consensus point of multiagents. The control scheme in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> employed higher order consensus protocols to provide some necessary and sufficient consensus conditions by characterizing the region of consensus. Distributed adaptive protocols using dynamic output feedback by providing suitable adaptation laws for edge-based and node-based control remedies were explored in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> for a generalized form of linear multiagents having undirected communication topologies. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, the issue of input and communication time delays for the consensus of linear agents subjected to a directed spanning tree during communication was explored, and sufficient conditions for consensus control were developed. Note that most of the abovementioned papers dealt with linear systems; however, a large number of existing systems are encountered by various types of nonlinearities that should be incorporated in consensus protocol design.</p><p>As far as nonlinear systems are concerned, consensus control techniques are lacking in the literature, and there is a great demand for the development of consensus protocols for different classes of nonlinear systems. For this reason, several attempts have recently been made to synchronize nonlinear systems by considering various communication topologies. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, a consensus protocol was explored based on the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model, under an arbitrary communication topology, for robustness against perturbations.</p><p>2168-2216 c 2017 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission.</p><p>See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information.</p><p>For uncertain nonlinear mechanical systems, an adaptive leaderless distributed finite-time control strategy under an undirected communication topology was developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Fully distributed adaptive synchronization of voltages of inverter-based power micro-grids by the application of neural networks for the compensation of uncertainties was addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Further, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, consensus control protocols for the distributed cooperative learning of discrete-time nonlinear multiagents were presented by employing radial basis function neural networks to ensure consensus errors were uniformly ultimately bounded. State feedback consensus control approaches for Lipschitz nonlinear systems with directed communication topologies, incorporating the properties of Lipschitz continuity, were presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Edgebased distributed adaptive protocols for Lipschitz nonlinear systems were employed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and a transformation-oriented consensus control methodology was formulated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The most recent work on the consensus control of Lipschitz nodes, utilizing state feedback for dealing with switching communication topologies, was provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>The Lipschitz continuity employed for the nodes in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> was conservative; however, an advanced form called the one-sided Lipschitz continuity is now being utilized for the observer and controller designs of nonlinear systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. This generalized Lipschitz continuity is not only less conservative than the conventional Lipschitz condition but can be used to represent a more general form of nonlinear agents. Some recent results addressed the synchronization and consensus control of one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear systems by incorporating graph theory. A preliminary work on the consensus protocol design using a simple Lyapunov function for one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear systems under the effect of disturbance by employing a robust stability approach is provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. A leader-following consensus approach using an observer-based control protocol has been studied for the tracking of multiple nonlinear agents satisfying the one-sided Lipschitz <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and generalized linear incremental <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> conditions. Sufficient conditions for the leaderless synchronization of one-sided Lipschitz agents with linear coupling by adjusting the coupling weight have been addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. However, the work on the consensus of one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear agents is still insufficient to address the fundamental issues in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and to synthesize the consensus protocols for nonlinear systems with more general nonlinearities than those found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Motivated by the above discussion, this paper aims to fill the research gap on the consensus control of one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear systems under undirected or directed communication topologies. A relative state feedback consensus protocol with coupling weight is proposed for one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear agents by employing the quadratic inner-boundedness and onesided Lipschitz conditions for derivation of the control protocols. The main contribution of this paper is fourfold: First, the dynamics of the nonlinear agents considered in this paper are more general than those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> due to the incorporation of one-sided Lipschitz and quadratic inner-boundedness conditions. In this regard, a new treatment for the more general onesided Lipschitz nonlinearities is explored in this paper from the leaderless consensus control point of view. Second, a sufficient condition for determining the consensus protocol gain and the coupling weight based on the relative state feedback is derived that ensures asymptotic convergence of the consensus error to the origin. Third, two novel robust consensus control criteria against external perturbations are provided by ensuring the L 2 gain reduction between the external disturbances and the consensus error and by guaranteeing asymptotic convergence of the consensus error into a compact set. It is worth noting that the resultant robust consensus treatments are less conservative than the existing approaches (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>) in dealing with amplitude-bounded disturbances and the relaxation of balanced communication topologies. Fourth, extensions to the proposed asymptotic and robust consensus protocol design conditions to the leader-following scenario of one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear multiagents are provided.</p><p>A similar problem on the consensus approach of onesided Lipschitz nonlinear agents was considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> by ignoring the input matrix. Compared to this approach, this paper considers a more complicated control situation by considering the input matrix, deriving the proposed synchronization criteria by employing a more general Lyapunov function, and taking amplitude-bounded disturbances as well as energy-bounded disturbances into account to achieve the robust consensus. In contrast to the leader-following control schemes found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, this paper explores the different control problem of the leaderless consensus protocol synthesis of nonlinear multiagents. It is worth noting that the error stability analysis of leaderless consensus control is more difficult than that of leader-following consensus control. In the leader-following case, the consensus errors are defined between the states of leaders and all other agents (e.g., z i = x ix 1 ), while in the leaderless case, the synchronization errors are constructed by using the states of all the agents (e.g., e i = x i -N j=1 r j x j ). Therefore, a more complex stability analysis is required to design a consensus protocol. The proposed methodology differs from the leaderless synchronization approach of coupled nonlinear systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, when applied to consensus control, in several aspects due to its consideration of the input matrix, state feedback gain, and freedom in choice adjacency matrix entries (other than zero or one). Moreover, the robustness of the consensus protocol has been addressed with respect to the disturbances in comparison to the conventional approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Compared to our recent work on the consensus of Lipschitz systems in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, the proposed consensus control differs in three aspects. First, a more practical directed communication topology, rather than the undirected topology, is incorporated in this paper. Second, the present consensus control is applicable to a more general class of nonlinear system due to generalization of the one-sided Lipschitz continuity. Last, robustness against amplitude-bounded perturbations is taken into account in this paper, unlike in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, to consider a more realistic control environment. A simulation example of a network of eight mobile agents in the absence and presence of external perturbations is provided to demonstrate the strength of the proposed methods.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. Section II details the system description. The proposed consensus protocol design conditions for the leaderless and leader-following scenarios are given in Sections III and IV, respectively. Simulation results for a network of eight moving systems are provided in Section V, and the conclusions are drawn in Section VI.</p><p>Standard notation is employed in this paper.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION</head><p>Consider N identical systems, called agents, given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">dx i dt = Ax i + f (t, x i ) + Bu i + d i y i (t) = Cx i ∀i = 1, 2, . . . , N<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where The interaction between N connected multiagent systems can be denoted using directed graphs. A weighted directed graph is represented by = ( , ), where the set of vertices and set of edges between two distinct vertices are represented by = {1, 2, . . . , N} and ⊂ × , respectively. A path between nodes i and j in graph is defined as a sequence of edges (i, r) ∈ , where r = 1, 2, . . . , j are distinct vertices. In a weighted undirected graph, a set of edges is an unordered pair of vertices, which implies that an edge (i, j) ∈ shows that agent i can get relative state information from its neighboring agent j and vice versa. A graph topology is said to be connected if there exists a path from any one vertex to any other vertex. A graph is said to be strongly connected if there exists a directed path from any one vertex to any other vertex. A graph has a spanning tree if it is strongly connected, but the converse may not be true. The Laplacian matrix of is represented by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x i ∈ n , u i ∈ m ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">= [l ij ] ∈ N×N , whereas the weighted connectivity matrix of a graph is represented by = [a ij ] ∈ N×N .</formula><p>The left eigenvector of the Laplacian matrix associated with the zero eigenvalue is denoted by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">r = [r 1 , r 2 , . . . , r N ] T ∈ N .</formula><p>The function f (t, x i ) validates the one-sided Lipschitz condition and quadratic inner-boundedness constraint, given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">f (t, x a ) -f (t, x b ), x a -x b ≤ η x a -x b 2 (2) ( f (t, x a ) -f (t, x b )) T ( f (t, x a ) -f (t, x b )) ≤ δ x a -x b 2 + σ x a -x b , f (t, x a ) -f (t, x b ) (3)</formula><p>for scalars η, δ, and σ and vectors x a , x b ∈ n . Assumption 1: The communication topology among the nonlinear agents of (1) can be represented by a strongly connected graph .</p><p>Assumption 2: The function f (t, x i ) in (1) satisfies the conditions defined in (2) and (3).</p><p>Remark 1: This paper considers the consensus control of the one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear agents in (1) validating the conditions in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_85">2</ref>) and (3). It should be noted that leaderless consensus protocol design for one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear systems (1) satisfying ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_85">2</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) under a communication topology has been neglected in previous studies. Treatment of the synchronization error for the case of leaderless consensus control is more challenging than it is for the leader-following consensus control approaches in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>Remark 2: Assumption 1 considers the communication topology between the nonlinear agents as strongly connected. Note that an undirected graph can be represented by a directed graph, and a connected undirected graph is representable via a strongly connected directed graph. Given that the leaderless consensus of one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear agents is neglected in the literature, the approach presented in this paper is aimed at being applicable to both types of communication topologies, namely, connected undirected and strongly connected directed topologies. This is because the proposed consensus control schemes are derived based on the generalized algebraic connectivity of a graph rather than conventional algebraic connectivity. Utilization of the proposed methodology for undirected and directed communication topologies can support its effectiveness for a broader range of communication scenarios between agents.</p><p>The proposed control protocol for the ith agent is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">u i = cF N j=1 a ij x i -x j , ∀i = 1, 2, . . . , N<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where c ∈ is the coupling weight and F ∈ m×n is the gain matrix for the protocol.

From this discussion, we can conclude that e i = 0 if and only if x 1 = x 2 = . . . = x N .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Asymptotic Consensus Protocol</head><p>Now, we provide a consensus protocol synthesis condition by taking d i = 0 in the following theorem.</p><p>Theorem 1: Consider the nonlinear multiagents in (1) satisfying d i = 0 and Assumptions 1 and 2.

Remark 9: Theorem 4 provides a sufficient condition for the leader-following consensus control of one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear systems with a spanning tree containing the leader as a root. Unlike that in Theorem 1, the proposed consensus protocol in Theorem 4 can be employed to reach a consensus between the nonlinear agents by incorporating the leader tracking constraint. Similarly, the condition in Theorem 5 can be applied for the robust leader-following consensus control of nonlinear multiagent systems, unlike that in Theorem 2. The novel results in Corollary 2 are a specific case of Theorem 5 for Lipschitz nonlinear systems and can be applied to leader-following scenarios under Assumption 3 without any requirement of a balanced communication topology.</p><p>Remark 10: Leader-following consensus control, ensuring uniformly ultimately bounded stability as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, of nonlinear multiagents has been neglected in amplitude-bounded disturbance cases (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>). Leader-following consensus control protocol design conditions for Lipschitz and one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear multiagent systems for attaining convergence of the consensus error into a small compact set can be derived by employing the tactics used for the derivation of Theorems 3 and 5. These solutions are now trivial; therefore, they are left for the reader.</p><p>The proposed synchronization methodologies for the onesided Lipschitz agents are derived by incorporating the effects of disturbances under fixed directed communication topologies. In many practical situations, the communication topologies do not remain fixed, because switching between communication links can occur due to the timevarying nature of communication topologies. In such cases, adaptive consensus control methodologies, like the leaderfollowing consensus approaches of <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, can be employed to deal with the switching topologies. Further, lags at the input and output as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> can also be incorporated while designing the consensus protocols. In future, the adaptive consensus of delayed one-sided Lipschitz agents with switching topologies and fully distributed consensus protocol can be studied.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Case II: Robust Consensus Control</head><p>Now, the consensus control problem for nonlinear multiagents of (1) subjected to external disturbances is considered. Let us assume that the external disturbances on the multiagents are given by for the L 2 gain γ = 0.12 to achieve a robust consensus. The protocol gain matrix is obtained as F = -1.022 -10.22 .</p><p>(66)</p><p>The robust coupling weight is selected as c = 18.013 under the condition c ≥ λ/α( ). closed-loop state trajectories in the presence of external disturbances by the application of the proposed robust consensus protocol are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for x i1 and x i2 for all i = 1, . . . , 8. The initial conditions are taken to be the same as (61). It can be observed that the states x i1 for i = 1, . . . , 8 achieve a common time profile in a finite amount of time, as demonstrated by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. Similarly, the convergence of the states x i2 for i = 1, . . . , 8 is also robust against disturbances to attain coherent behavior. Hence, the external disturbances are efficiently rejected by the application of the proposed consensus protocol to achieve identical behavior of the one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear multiagents. In future, the proposed method can be worked out for the formation control of one-sided Lipschitz agents, and the communication topology can be treated as switching.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper considered the consensus control of one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear agents by the application of a relative state feedback protocol. Both leaderless and leader-following consensus protocol synthesis conditions ensuring asymptotic stability of the consensus error system were derived for strongly connected and spanning tree communication topologies, respectively. Further, external perturbations were incorporated for formulating the robust consensus control synthesis strategies by employing the L 2 stability theory. Novel results on the robust consensus of Lipschitz systems, without any requirement of balanced communication topology, were derived from the proposed methodology for one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear systems. Furthermore, robust consensus controller synthesis for one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear systems was addressed under amplitude-bounded perturbations for asymptotic stability of the consensus error outside a compact region. Compared with the existing methods, the resultant consensus protocols are less conservative and can be applied to a broader class of nonlinear systems. In addition, the resultant approaches are more efficient for handling disturbances, because of the relaxation of balanced communication topologies and the incorporation of more realistic disturbances. A numerical example was provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed consensus control methodologies in the absence and presence of external disturbances. Feedback of relative output and switching of the communication topologies for the consensus protocol design of one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear multiagent systems under disturbances and delays can be considered in future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
