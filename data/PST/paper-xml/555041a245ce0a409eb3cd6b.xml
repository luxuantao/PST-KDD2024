Denney Jr. and Jerry L. Prince</p><p>Abstract-Magnetic resonance (MR) tagging has shown great potential for noninvasive measurement of the motion of a beating heart. In MR tagged images, the heart appears with a spatially encoded pattern that moves with the tissue. The position of the tag pattern in each frame of the image sequence can be used to obtain a measurement of the 3-D displacement field of the myocardium. The measurements are sparse, however, and interpolation is required to reconstruct a dense displacement field from which measures of local contractile performance such as strain can be computed. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating a dense displacement field from sparse displacement measurements. Our approach is based on a multidimensional stochastic model for the smoothness and divergence of the displacement field and the Fisher estimation framework. The main feature of this method is that both the displacement field model and the resulting estimate equation are defined only on the irregular domain of the myocardium. Our methods are validated on both simulated and in vivo heart data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>MAJOR PROBLEM in cardiac imaging is the measure-A ment of cardiac motion for identification of ischemic and infarcted tissues. Magnetic resonance (MR) tagging [ 11, [2]  has shown great potential for noninvasive measurement of the motion of a beating heart. Tagged images appear with a spatially encoded pattern that moves with the tissue and can be analyzed to reveal the motion of the myocardium and to extract measures of local contractile performance such as strain. In this paper we address the problem of reconstructing a dense motion field from a collection of tagged MR images.</p><p>The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, 21218 USA. possibility of motion parallel to the tag planes, these points give information only about the displacement in the direction normal to the tag planes. To measure the displacement in other directions, tag planes must be applied in different orientations and additional orthogonal images acquired.</p><p>Several schemes for acquiring tagged images for the analysis of full 3-D, time-varying motion of the LV have been reported [6]- <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. All methods create tag planes and collect images in a coordinate system defined by the long-axis of the LV. By convention, the z direction is taken to be along the long-axis and the 5 and y directions are defined by the horizontal and vertical directions in a short-axis image [such as that in Fig. <ref type="figure">l(a</ref> [SI, which we use in this paper, acquires stacks of short-axis images, as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">2(a)</ref>, and a collection of long-axis images that are rotated about the long-axis, as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">2(b)</ref>. Imaging time imposes a severe limitation, so these image planes sparsely sample the LV (see Sections I11 and IV). Reg,ardless of the particular imaging and tagging geometry that is used, the result (after analysis to determine the locations of the tag lines in all acquired images) is a sparse set of displacement measurements at discrete points in space and time.</p><p>The next step is to compute a dense displacement field from thesl: sparse measurements. Previous research on this problem has focused on either polynomial or spline interpolation methods. Motivated by the geometry of the LV, O'Dell et al. <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, [SI proposed fitting a prolate spheroidal interpolating polynomial to the displacement measurements. One difficulty with this approach is that the correct order of the interpolating polynomial is not known. <ref type="bibr">Young and Axel [9]</ref> proposed fitting a finite element model to displacement measurements from grid-tagged images using heuristically chosen interpolation functions. <ref type="bibr">Kumar and Goldgof [4]</ref> proposed a method for estimating 2-D LV motion from grid tagged images using a thin-plate spline interpolating function.</p><p>In this paper, we develop a framework for computing a dense displacement field from sparse measurements by formulating the problem as a stochastic estimation problem. A priori knowledge of the measurements is incorporated in a stochastic measurement model, and a priori knowledge about heart motion is incorporated in a stochastic process model. These two models are then used to derive an optimal estimate equation. The advantage of this approach is that the estimate equation, which implies an optimal interpolating function <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>, is determined from a priori information about the behavior of heart muscle rather than by heuristic selection. Also, this a priori information does not come from a global model of the LV such as those in [11]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>, but rather from two very general physiological characteristics of myocardium. First, we use the fact that the heart wall is composed of connected muscle fibers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>, and as a result, the displacement vectors of two points close together in space are similar in magnitude and direction. We refer to this as the smoothness assumption. Second, since the myocardium is mostly water, it is approximately incompressible'. We refer to this as the isochoric assumption. There is considerable debate as to the validity of this assumption [ 141. Our experimental results, however, show an improvement in estimation error when the isochoric assumption is used in computing the displacement estimate. The process model derived from these two assumptions is similar to the continuous velocity field models used in optical flow estimation of motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>. Using the discretization approach developed by Chin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>, [l8] for optical flow, we can incorporate a 3-D segmentation of the LV (if available) thereby restricting the domain of the displacement field model to the LV. With this setup, we derive the optimal estimate equation using the Fisher estimation framework [ 191. We call this estimate the irregular domain displacement estimate (IDDE).</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. We develop the IDDE in Section II. In Sections I11 and IV we validate the IDDE through simulations and in vivo experiments respectively. The final section summarizes and discusses our future research direction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">IRREGULAR DOMAIN DISPLACEMENT ESTIMATE</head><p>In this section we develop our irregular domain displacement estimate (IDDE). After describing notation and geometry in Section I, we develop the observation and process models in Section 11. These models are written in matrix notation in Section 111, and the Fisher estimation framework is used to define the IDDE in Section IV. Finally, Section V briefly describes the last step, a transformation from spatial to material coordinates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Notation and Coordinate Systems</head><p>Scalars are designated by lower-case letters (e.g. x , a), and 3-D vectors are designated by lower-case bold letters (e.g. U, r). The components of a 3-D vector r are designated by T,, rY and rz. Lexicographically ordered vector fields and matrices are designated by upper-case letters (e.g. U , V ) .</p><p>Two coordinate systems are used to describe the location of points in space: a material coordinate system fixed on the left ventricle (LV) with end-diastole as the reference state; and a spatial coordinate system fixed in space so that the material and spatial coordinate systems coincide at end-diastole. The z-axis of the spatial coordinate system runs through the center of the LV at end-diastole from apex to base. The x and y axes are orthogonal to the z-axis and to each other, and the x-axis is parallel to the top and bottom edges of a short-axis image.</p><p>Displacement vectors are estimated only at those points that are both within the LV and on an N, x Ny x N , grid R enclosing the LV, as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>.

Defined in spatial coordinates for a deformed LV, the grid is taken to have a uniform grid spacing h, which can be arbitrarily small.</p><p>Since h is fixed for a given study, the values of N,, N Y , and N, are adjusted to make sure the grid volume encloses the LV.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Measurement Model</head><p>In O'Dell et al.'s imaging method [7], [8], three sets of 2-D images are acquired. The first two sets are shortaxis images taken at the planes depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">2(a)</ref>. The third set consists of long-axis images taken at the planes depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">2(b</ref>). Although these are three distinct data sets, all images correspond to the same phase of the cardiac cycle-i.e., the same instant of time. Additional sets can be acquired at different times to obtain sequences of image sets. In each image set, one component of the displacement field is measured. To measure the x-component, a set of parallel tag planes orthogonal to the z-axis are applied to the heart at end-diastole, and a stack of short-axis images is acquired at a later time in the cardiac cycle. To measure the y-component, tag planes orthogonal to the y-axis are applied, and another set of short-axis images is acquired. To measure the z-component, tag planes orthogonal to the z-axis are applied, and a set of long-axis images is acquired. We refer to tag planes orthogonal to the x-axis as vertical tags, tag planes orthogonal to the y-axis as horizontal tags, and tag planes orthogonal to the z-axis as long-axis tags. Since the reference position of the tag planes is known from the image acquisition process, it is only necessary to obtain these image sets at that phase of the cardiac cycle in which a displacement field estimate is desired. It should be noted that although we develop our measurement model in the context of the parallel tag plane  <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>. The tag lines in each image are tracked within the segmented myocardium using a method such as that proposed by <ref type="bibr">Guttman et al. [3]</ref> or <ref type="bibr">Kumar and Goldgof [4]</ref>. A tracked tag defines the intersection of a deformed tag plane within the image plane, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. A point r on a tracked tag is known to have originated from somewhere on a particular reference tag plane at end-diastole, but nothing more is known. Thus, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, only that component of displacement in the direction of the reference tag plane normal, e, can be measured. Further, these measurements can only be made at points lying on the tracked tags, which are in spatial coordinates. Thus, the fundamental measurements available from planar tagged images is a sparse collection of measurements of displacement field components in spatial coordinates.</p><p>We represent these measurements in a unified mathematical framework as follows. First, we let rX denote the set of z-displacement measurements, and ry and I ? , be the sets of y and z-displacement measurements. We designate the cardinality of r, , ry, and r, by Mx , My, and M z respectively Here, e,, eY, and e , are unit vectors corresponding the 2, y, and z axes, and w(r,) is a white random process with a Gaussian density given by N(0, 0;). The measurement noise w models the error inherent in tag tracking methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Reference , / '</p><p>Tag Plane Tag Plane In general, the points rm, m = 1, . . . , M , in (1) will not be on grid points. To account for this we model the displacement vector at r (where r can be any one of these measured points rm) as a function of its eight nearest grid points. We define R, as the set of indices of the eight grid points nearest r, as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. Then u(r) can be modeled as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">zjkEC2,</formula><p>where the weights a i j k are defined in the Appendix. Essentially, u(r) should be equal to a trilinear interpolation of its eight nearest neighbors. Note that for each measurement, trilinear interpolation is only used over a single grid cell which is on the order of 1.0 mm on a side (See Section 11-D.). Over a region this small, we do not expect the interpolation method to significantly affect the final displacement estimate. Substituting (2) into (1) yields where the m subscript on a indicates that the weights are generally different for each measurement. Equation (3) is our measurement model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Displacement Field Model</head><p>Ideally, one would like to reconstruct the displacement field vector u ( r i j k ) from the system of M equations given by (3).</p><p>This system, however, is underdetermined, which means that a priori knowledge about the displacement field must be used to compute a unique estimate. In this section we develop stochastic models for the displacement field based on the assumptions of smoothness and incompressibility, which will be used in subsequent sections to derive a displacement field estimate equation.</p><p>Smoothness Assumption To yield a smooth displacement field, we require that</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">u ( r i + l j k ) -u ( r i j k ) = v z ( r i j k ) , t J r i j k , r i + l j k E RLV U ( r i j + l k &gt; -u ( r i j k ) = V y ( r i j k ) , u ( r i j k + l ) -u ( r i j k ) = v z ( r i j k ) , v r i j k , r i j + l k E RLV Y r z j k , r i j k + l E OLV (4)</formula><p>where for all r i j k E R, v z ( r i j k ) , vy(r;jk) and v z ( r i j k ) are independent white random vector processes each of which has a joint Gaussian density given by N(0,h2a:l), where 0 is 3-vector of zeros, and I is the 3 x 3 identity matrix. Note that (4) only models differences between neighboring vectors that are both in OLV. As a result, the displacement field inside the left ventricle is completely unrelated to the displacement field outside.</p><p>Zsochoric Assumption An isochoric assumption on the displacement field can be specified in a straightforward manner.</p><p>From continuum mechanics, an isochoric displacement field satisfies (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">V . u(r) = 0</formula><p>(5) at every point r, where V. is the divergence operator. In practice, there are small changes in the volume of the heart wall during the heart cycle because of perfusion, and there will be some error from a finite difference approximation to (5). We allow for this uncertainty by modeling the isochoric assumption as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">[ u z ( r i + i j k ) -uz(rijIc)] +[uy(rij+l k ) -u y ( r i j k ) ] + [ u z ( r i j k + l ) -u z ( r i j k ) ] = v d ( r i j k ) (6)</formula><p>for a11 r i j k , r i + l j k , r i j + l k , r i j k + l E OLV, where vd(rijk) is a white random process with a Gaussian density given by N(0, h2a2). Equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) is similar to (4) in the sense that it models the value of the displacement vectors relative to each other, but unlike (4), (6) couples the z, y, and z components of the vector field. y(r,) = e(r,) .</p><p>a , , i j k u ( r i j k )</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">+ w(rm) ( 3 ) D. Fisher Estimate i j k € O , ,</formula><p>In this section we develop an optimal estimate of the displacement field at all grids points in RLV. The Fisher m = 1, ..., M , estimation framework provides a natural avenue for this goal, as we now demonstrate.</p><p>We begin by writing the model equations given by (3), (4), and (6) as matrix equations. We define NLV as the number of grid points in OLV and ULV as a ~N L V x 1 vector containing all the displacement vectors u(rijk) such that r i j k E OLV.</p><p>The M measurement equations given by (3) can be stacked to form the matrix equation</p><p>Next we stack the equations in (4) to form the matrix equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">SULV = vxyz (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where S is a spatial difference operator and Vzyz =</p><p>[V:bTKTlT.

Equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) can be written as the matrix equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">DULV = v d (9)</formula><p>where V d is the lexicographically ordered scalar field wd(r;jk), and D is a spatial difference operator. Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">8</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) can be stacked together to form a stochastic model for the displacement field as follows Note that in this formulation the domain OLV can be quite arbitrary, and is defined on a pixel by pixel basis by the structure of S, D and ULV. As a result, the model defined by ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) is a general model for incompressible elastic motion of irregularly shaped objects.</p><p>Typically when a stochastic state model of the form (10) is available, the Bayesian estimation framework is used to compute a state estimate. A Bayesian estimate cannot be used here, however, because (10) does not completely model the statistics of the displacement field ULV. In particular, because the matrix A = [ST DTlT in (10) is singular-note that AB = 0 when B is any nonzero constant vectorthe mean and covariance of ULV cannot be computed from (10).</p><p>In cases where the prior knowledge is probabilistic but incompletely specified, the Fisher estimation framework can be used [ 191. In this framework, prior probabilistic knowledge is recast into what are known as a priori observations. In our case, (10) is simply rearranged to look like an observation equation as follows This equation, together with (7) forms the augmented system</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">[i] [ 5 ] U L V +</formula><p>which captures both the observations and the prior statistical information.</p><p>The Fisher estimate is the linear estimator that minimizes the expected mean-square estimation error subject to the constraint that €{eLV} = €{ULV}, where €{.} denoted expectation.</p><p>Assuming constant noise variances 52, o;, and o : , the optimal estimate ULV is given by where 1 DTD+-ETE. We call ULV the irregular domain displacement estimate (IDDE). The estimate ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) can be solved using a sparse linear system solver. We use the method of conjugate gradients <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>.</p><p>The dimensions of C depend on the number of grid points in OLV, which depends on the grid spacing h. Smaller grid spacings increase the dimension of C, which results in an exponential increase in computation time. Also in this type of problem, the numerical condition of C degrades as its dimensions increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>, which both increases the computation time and limits the accuracy of the solution. Larger spacings, however, unnecessarily decrease both the resolution and the accuracy of the displacement estimate. A good practical choice is to make h approximately equal to the pixel size in the MR image data.</p><p>In practice, the variances a:, 02, and 0: are not known, and must be chosen empirically. When both sides of (13) are multiplied by o$, it becomes clear that the IDDE is only a function of the ratios a$/aGz and oi/o;. In our experiments, we choose a value for C T :</p><p>based on the tag tracker accuracy and vary os and 5; to minimize some measure of estimation error. In in vivo applications, 0," and 5: can be chosen to minimize the difference between the actual and reconstructed deformed tag line locations (see Section IV-C). When os is decreased, less weight is given to the tag line measurements and the IDDE is more smooth. When 0: is decreased, more weight is given to the incompressibility constraint, which means that the average local volume change will be smaller.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Transformation to Material Coordinates</head><p>The estimate ULV found by solving ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) is an estimate of the displacement field on a regularly spaced lattice in spatial coordinates. To calculate quantities such as strain, it is necessary to have a displacement field in material coordinates. Thus, a transformation of coordinate systems is required. This is accomplished using an interpolation from an irregularly spaced lattice as illustrated in 2-D in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>(a), our displacement estimate u(r) is initially defined on a regularly spaced lattice. From the definition of displacement, we know that there is a material point p that moves to the spatial point r and that the two are related by</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(15)</head><p>Thus as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">6(a)</ref>, for each r on the lattice, we can determine a corresponding material point p = r -U(.). The collection of these material points define an irregularly spaced grid of material points as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> regularly spaced lattice of material points shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6(c</ref>).</p><p>In general none of these points will coincide with the points in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>(b), and the material displacement u(p) for each regularly spaced lattice point p must be interpolated from the irregularly spaced grid. We decompose the irregular grid into tetrahedra and use linear interpolation on each tetrahedron to estimate the displacement in material coordinates on a regular grid. The accuracy of this interpolation depends on the size of the tetrahedra, which should stay approximately constant with time because the isochoric assumption was used in computing the spatial coordinate estimate.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. IDDE Evaluation</head><p>To evaluate the IDDE we conducted a simulation experiment using an LV deformation simulator program written by Walter O'Dell and Chris Moore [SI. This program assumes the LV at end-diastole is a prolate spheroidal shell with inner radius 32 mm and outer radius 40" centered at the origin. It simulates a typical deformation taking place at end-systole [ 111 and includes bulk translation, bulk rotation, and bulk shear, and torsion, transmural twist, transmural shear, and a gross incompressibility constraint.</p><p>Our experiment consisted of the following steps. First we generated tag line position data from a simulated 3-D planar tag imaging experiment using the above model of LV deformation. The simulated experiment consisted of 11 shortaxis image planes separated by 5.0 mm and 11 long-axis image planes equally spaced over 180 degrees. We used 11 horizontal and vertical tag planes separated by 5.5 mm, and 11 longaxis tag planes separated by 5.0 mm. Next a 64 x 64 x 64 lattice with a uniform spatial increment of 1.125 mm was defined around the deformed LV, and the segmentation shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> was obtained from the heart model parameters. Note that the segmentation is in spatial coordinates because the measurements are in spatial coordinates, and it is the true segmentation at this lattice resolution. The apex of the LV is not included in the segmentation because in practice, it is difficult to image [3] and is not typically included in motion analyses. Note that we enforce the isochoric assumption locally through the divergence-free condition [see ( 5 ) and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>)], and the global volume of the heart does not factor into the estimation process.</p><p>We next computed the IDDE assuming that C T ~ = 1, 02 = 1 and o i =</p><p>The values for 0; and C T ~ were determined by computing the IDDE for different values of these parameters, comparing the result to the true displacement and finding the values that resulted in the lowest RMS estimation error (see Section 111-B for a study of IDDE accuracy versus 0: and 02). The IDDE was compared to the true displacement at each point in the irregular domain shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, and a 3-D error map was constructed. A short-axis slice of the error volume is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8(a)</ref>. Plots of both the true and estimated displacement magnitude along the white line in this slice are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8(b)</ref>. The global mean, rootmean-square (RMS), root-median-square (RMdS), and median percent (Md%) error for this reconstruction are shown in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. These quantities were computed over 32,616 evenly spaced points inside LV. We note that RMdS errors are smaller than the RMS errors, which means that the RMS error is skewed upwards by a few particularly bad points near the boundary (See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>). We also note from the median percent error that the estimated displacement field is within 2% of the true displacement on average.</p><p>We make three observations from the above results. First, from the I-D plots in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref> we observe that the IDDE error is smallest in the middle of the LV wall and gets larger toward the endocardial and epicardial boundaries. This effect occurs because there are fewer displacement measurements near the boundaries. Second in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>(b) we observe that the IDDE underestimates the true displacement magnitude. The mean errors in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>, however, have different signs and are small in magnitude compared to the RMS errors, which means that we overestimate the displacement magnitude in other regions of the LV. Therefore, we conclude that underestimation is not a systematic problem with the IDDE. Finally we observe that the global errors in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. ESfect of IDDE Model Parameters</head><p>The accuracy of the IDDE depends on the variances C T ~, cr: and 0;. The measurement noise variance, 0; is derived from the tag tracker accuracy. The other variances are chosen empirically. To study the affect of a : and cr; on the estimation accuracy, we computed the IDDE for several values of 02 and cr; with cr; = IOp4. The RMS errors between the magnitudes of the IDDE and actual displacement vectors are listed in Table <ref type="table">11</ref>. We also computed the IDDE without the incompressibility assumption for the same values of 0:. The RMS errors for this case are listed in the "No Assumption" row in Table <ref type="table">11</ref>. We see that the IDDE errors are minimized when 0: = 0;. Therefore we conclude that incompressibility assumption reduces the IDDE error and that we should choose a : = 0;. The RMS errors versus cr? = 02 are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>, which reveals that the error is fairly constant for the last three decades of 0," = 02 (although it increases again slightly at a: = 02 = 10).</p><p>Therefore, we conclude that the IDDE is robust to the choice of of = 0," provided that they are chosen in the proper range.</p></div>

Experimental Parameters</head><p>The LV of a normal human volunteer was imaged using a parallel planar tag imaging protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>. In accordance with the 3-D displacement measurement scheme of O'Dell et al.  oriented as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref>, where the light planes represent short-axis image planes and the dark planes represent long-axis image planes. In each sequence, the tag planes were separated in the reference state (end-diastole) by 6 mm, which resulted in 12 tags across the LV in both the short-axis and long-axis sequences. The resulting images are 256 x 256 with a pixel size of h = 1.25 mm and are spaced 32.5 ms apart for a total of 10 time frames through systole.</p><p>In each image, points on the inner and outer contours of the LV and along the tag lines were identified using the method of Guttman et al. <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Each contour consisted of 32 points. The points identified along each tag line within the myocardium were spaced 1.0 mm apart.</p><p>In order to compute the IDDE we discretized the problem by defining a 3-D grid that encompassed the LV. A bounding box for the LV was determined from the contours identified in each image. A regular grid was constructed with a spacing of 1.25 mm in each direction that encompassed the bounding box. The x-y face of the grid was defined to be parallel with the short-axis image planes. A segmentation of the LV which gave ! &amp; , v for each time frame was obtained using the contour points in each image.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Displacement Field Estimate</head><p>The displacement field in spatial coordinates for each time frame was computed using the IDDE and then transformed to material coordinates using the procedure described in Section 11-E. For all time frames, we assumed 0; = The divergence-free variance 02 was set equal to the smoothness variance 0 : at each time frame (see Section 111-B), and 0: was chosen to linearly increase with time from 0: = 0.1 at time frame 0 to 0: = 1.0 at time frame 9. The rationale for increasing a: with time is as follows. First, strain can be loosely defined as the spatial variation in displacement (for a more precise definition, see [22]). Second, in the IDDE the spatial variation in displacement is controlled by 02. Third, myocardial strain increases with time during systole. Finally, a linear increase in a: was chosen as a first step. More precise methods of choosing 0: will be explored in future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Results</head><p>In in vivo heart experiments the true displacement field of the LV is not known and the accuracy of the displacement field estimate is difficult to determine. A qualitative indication of the accuracy can be obtained by using the displacement estimate to reconstruct the tag line data. Note that (1) the reconstruction of any given tag line requires all three components of the displacement field, and (2) tag line reconstruction only gives an indication of error near the tag planes, where we expect the IDDE to be most accurate. Fig. <ref type="figure">ll(a)</ref> shows an image sequence of one short-axis horizontally tagged slice at endsystole (t = 340 ms), where points on the tag lines have been darkened for emphasis. Each white dot represents a point where a tag plane deformed in three dimensions by the IDDE intersects the image plane. If there were no error in the estimated displacement field, the white dots would lie on the tag lines. Fig. <ref type="figure">ll(b</ref>) and (c) shows analogous images of a short-axis vertically tagged slice and a long-axis slice. The estimated tag points and the actual tag points match well in all three images. In some cases the dots lie next to the tag lines because both the actual and estimated tag line points are rounded to the nearest pixel.</p><p>A quantitative measure of the IDDE accuracy was obtained by computing average distance between the actual tag lines and the reconstructed tag lines. A plot of average error versus time is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>. The error increases with time from a value of 0.22 mm near end-diastole (t = 47 ms) to 0.28 mm at end-systole (t = 340 ms). The increase in error with time is to be expected because both the average magnitude of the displacement field and the strain increase with time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Effect of Incompressibility Constraint</head><p>We studied the effect of the incompressibility constraint on the IDDE estimate by computing the IDDE at the final time frame (t = 340 ms) for several values of a : and ai with 0; = lop4. The average tag line error for each pair of values is shown in Table <ref type="table">111</ref>.</p><p>Two important observations can be made from Table <ref type="table">111</ref>. First, the errors in Table <ref type="table">111</ref> have the same order of magnitude as the errors in Table <ref type="table">11</ref>. The errors do not vary as much with 0; and a: as those in Table <ref type="table">I1</ref> because the error is only computed at the tag lines where we expect the IDDE to be most accurate. Second, the lowest errors ( ~0 . 2 7 mm) occur near the region where 0 : = 0;. In contrast, the lowest error without the isochoric assumption is 0.28 mm. Given the relatively small variation in error in Table <ref type="table">I11</ref> compared to that in Table <ref type="table">11</ref>, the slight decrease in tag line error observed with the isochoric assumption suggests that a greater decrease in error might be observed if points between tag lines were included in the analysis. The relationship between tag line error and total error will be explored more fully in future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. DISCUSSION</head><p>In this paper we presented an estimation-theoretic framework for reconstructing a dense 3-D displacement field within the LV from planar tag correspondences. In this framework a priori information about the displacement measurements and heart motion is incorporated into a discrete stochastic measurement model and a discrete 3-D stochastic displacement field model. Fisher estimation techniques are then used to derive the optimal estimate called the IDDE from these two models. The IDDE assumes that a segmentation of the LV is available and restricts the displacement field model to the domain of the myocardium. The IDDE also incorporates an incompressibility assumption. The accuracy of the IDDE depends on the choice of global process noise variances, which are chosen empirically. We anticipate that with the development of more specialized displacement models, a more physiologically-based approach will be used. For the present, however, the simulation results in this paper show that both algorithms are robust to the choice of these parameters provided they are chosen in the proper range.</p><p>Tag and contour detection errors will also affect the accuracy of the IDDE. The degree to which tag detection errors are</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

Smaller values of these parameters will result reduced sensitivity to tag detection errors at the expense of spatial resolution. Contour detection errors will affect the IDDE by changing the domain over which the IDDE is computed. The specific effects of these errors are not known but are expected to be most pronounced near the endocardial and epicardial boundaries.</p><p>The IDDE algorithm as presently implemented takes roughly 20 minutes per time frame to execute on a SUN SPARC 20, which is too long for clinical use. No attempt, however, was made to optimize the algorithm for speed, and we expect to make considerable performance improvements to the algorithm in future work.</p><p>We used the IDDE algorithm to estimate the displacement field of an in vivo LV from actual MR image data. A displacement field was estimated for each time frame in an image sequence. A quantitative error measure showed reconstruction errors of 0.28 mm at end-systole. Our results also suggest that the incompressibility assumption may improve the DDE accuracy relative to estimates computed with only the smoothness assumption.</p><p>The ultimate goal of this research is to reconstruct a 3-D strain map of the left-ventricle. Strain can be computed from the material coordinate IDDE by using finite difference approximations to the spatial derivatives. Future research in this area will include characterizing the local error and spatial resolution of this strain map as well as the effects of tag line and displacement estimation errors.
