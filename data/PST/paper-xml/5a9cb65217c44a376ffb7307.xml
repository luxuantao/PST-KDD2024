<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This brief investigates fault-tolerant cooperative control (FTCC) strategies for multiple differentially driven autonomous wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) in the presence of actuator faults during formation operation. First, for normal/fault-free cases and for preparation to the faults occurrence cases, an integrated approach combining input-output feedback linearization and distributed linear model predictive control techniques is designed and implemented on a team of WMRs to accomplish a formation task. Second, when actuator faults occur in one of the robots of the team, two cases are explicitly considered: 1) if the faulty robot cannot complete its assigned task due to a severe fault, then the faulty robot has to get out from the formation mission, and an FTCC strategy is designed such that the tasks of the WMRs team are reassigned to the remaining healthy robots to complete the mission with graceful performance degradation and 2) if the faulty robot can continue the mission with degraded performance, then the other team members reconfigure their controllers considering the capability of the faulty robot. Thus, the FTCC strategy is designed to re-coordinate the motion of each robot in the team. Within the proposed scheme, a fault detection and diagnosis unit using a two-stage Kalman filter to detect and diagnose actuator faults is presented. Then, the FTCC problem is formulated as an optimal assignment problem, where a Hungarian algorithm is applied. Moreover, a collision avoidance algorithm based on mechanical impedance principle is proposed to avoid the potential collision between the healthy robots and the faulty ones. Formation operation of the robot team is based on a leader-follower approach, while the control algorithm is implemented in a distributed manner. The results of real experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FTCC scheme in different fault scenarios.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>members, and to accommodate occurred faults and mitigate their negative effect on mission execution. Such an objective can be achieved by so-called fault-tolerant cooperative control (FTCC) strategies.</p><p>The FTCC can be achieved by appropriately reassigning the task and re-coordinating the motion. Two cases need to be taken into account within the FTCC scheme. First, the robot cannot accomplish its assigned task in the presence of a severe fault. Thus, the mission should be reassigned to the remaining healthy robots. As a result, the formation shape should be reconfigured according to the new assignment. Next, the robot can still complete the mission with degraded performance in the presence of faults. In this case, the other healthy robots will reconfigure their controllers considering the capability of the faulty robot.</p><p>During a formation mission, it is expected that the robots can independently detect and diagnose faults. Therefore, each robot should have its fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) unit, which aims to detect the abnormal behaviors due to a component fault, determine the fault type and the exact location of the failed component, and identify the severity of the fault <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Then, the robot controller can be reconfigured to accommodate the fault based on the up-to-date information obtained from the FDD unit. FDD and fault-tolerant control (FTC) techniques have been extensively investigated over the last three decades (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and the references therein). Several interesting results have been presented for a single wheeled mobile robot (WMR). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the kinematic and dynamic models of a WMR in the event of faults such as a change in wheel radius, or general kinematic disturbances induced by slipping and skidding faults are presented. A torque filtering technique is applied to develop a prediction error based on fault detection signal. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, a bank of Kalman filters are exploited for FDD purposes. However, the FTC design is not addressed in this work. Further references related to FDD and FTC of WMRs under sensor and actuator faults can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>However, FTCC under actuator faults has not yet been fully investigated in the literature. The existing studies mainly focus on communication faults <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and the obstacle avoidance problem to avoid the collision with the faulty robot <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and very few works investigating the case of severe fault occurrence and determining how to accommodate the fault effect on the whole formation configuration. Mead et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> present an FTCC strategy under actuator faults of terrestrial robots. In this work, the formation recovery according to fault occurrence is achieved through an auction-based algorithm. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the FTCC problem for a team of UAVs is considered. The formation recovery algorithm is proposed based on a trajectory replanning technique. In the fault-free case, a differential flatness method is applied for each vehicle to plan its trajectory. Once an actuator fault occurs, by virtue of a centralized manner, a formation supervisor commands all the UAVs to replan their trajectories within the physical constraints of the faulty vehicle. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the FTCC of a team of WMRs is investigated. Faults are counteracted by adding an extra term to the basic control law, which is a function of the fault dynamics, and recovered by a neural network. The work reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> focuses on determining how to tolerate the individual fault of the team members, nevertheless the formation reconfiguration is omitted. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, an adaptive FTC algorithm for a team of UAVs subject to permanent and intermittent actuator faults is presented. The fault is modeled as a disturbance signal. The fault is estimated by an observer and therefore accommodated by a compensator to be added into the normal controller. However, the formation reconfiguration is not addressed. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, if an actuator fault occurs in a team of UAVs, the other healthy members start reconfiguring the formation to reach the target point. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, an FTCC scheme is considered for multiple UAVs. Feasible references in response to actuator faults can be generated by considering the health status of the team. While the FTCC gains can converge within finite time to facilitate the fault accommodation by applying the auxiliary integrated regressor matrix and vector method. This work can be seen as a motion re-coordination technique to keep the formation in the presence of actuator fault.</p><p>From the existing literature, the FDD of actuator faults for WMRs, and determining how to accommodate the fault effect on the whole team during formation in the presence of severe actuator fault are still open issues. Furthermore, most of the aforementioned references consider only the numerical simulations and have not yet been validated in the real-time experiments.</p><p>Motivated by the aforementioned issues, a new FTCC design for a team of WMRs is presented in this brief and validated by experimental tests. In the fault-free case, a team of N robots moves in a specific formation shape based on a combination of a dynamic feedback linearization and linear model predictive control (MPC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. When one or more robots subject to a fault, two formation reconfiguration strategies can be considered. First, if the faulty robot can no longer complete the mission in the event of a severe fault, its communication module will be switched off and this robot will be out from the formation. Subsequently, the other healthy robots can reconfigure their formation shape and continue the mission. Formation is reconfigured by casting the FTCC problem as an optimal assignment problem, ensuring that during formation reconfiguration one and only one robot should be assigned to a unique place in the new formation shape. The distributed Hungarian algorithm is used to solve the assignment problem in this case. Next, if the faulty robot can still complete the mission with degraded performance, then the controllers of the other healthy robots are reconfigured by considering the reduced capability of the faulty robot. This is implemented by regenerating a new reference trajectory that the leader and the team must follow considering the reduced capabilities of the faulty robot, and then, the other team members (including the faulty one) will follow the leader and continue the mission. As a result, the mission will be continued but with degraded performance. To detect, isolate, and estimate the actuator faults, the two-stage Kalman filter technique is used for the FDD purpose, where the faults are modeled as losses in the effectiveness of the robots' driving motors. Furthermore, an obstacle avoidance algorithm based on the mechanical impedance concept is applied to avoid the collision between the healthy and the faulty robots.</p><p>Compared with the existing works in the literature, this brief provides a new and complete solution for the FTCC problem with integration of the FDD function and experimental testing validation. The main contributions of this brief are summarized as follows.</p><p>1) Developing FTCC algorithms under both regular and severe actuator faults occurrence cases. In case of severe fault situations, the proposed algorithm solves the FTCC problem as an optimal assignment problem. The assignment problem is solved by applying a distributed Hungarian algorithm to each team member. 2) Exploiting the two-stage Kalman filter for WMR FDD purposes. The advantage of using the two-stage Kalman filter is to simultaneously estimate the states and fault parameters necessary for FTCC design and implementation as an active approach of the FTCC. 3) Proposing a collision avoidance algorithm for each robot in the team based on the mechanical impedance principle, in order to avoid collision of the healthy robots with the faulty ones as well as the surrounding obstacles during formation reconfiguration. 4) Implementing the proposed FTCC strategies in a team of real WMRs to validate the applicability of the proposed active FTCC scheme under both regular and severe fault cases. This brief is organized as follows. In Section II, the description of the WMR, its control architecture, and kinematic model are presented, the formation problem is formulated, the control objective is defined, and the formation controller in the faultfree case is presented. The FTCC algorithm with the collision avoidance capability is proposed in Section III. Section IV illustrates the experimental results for different fault cases, and conclusions are presented in Section V.</p></div>

PRELIMINARIES: MODELING AND FORMATION CONTROL OF WMRs UNDER FAULT-FREE CASES</head><p>The problem considered in this brief is to drive a team of differentially driven WMRs in a desired formation motion in both fault-free and fault cases. To design an FTCC scheme, formation control scheme under fault-free cases must be designed first as a preparation to the fault occurrence cases, this section presents kinematics and modeling of the WMRs, together with formation control of WMRs under fault-free cases.</p></div>

WMR Kinematics</head><p>Let q ∈ C be the s-vector of generalized coordinates for a WMR, C be the configuration space of the robot, and u be the m-vector of control inputs for the robot.

Let point q be the current posture with coordinates (x,y) and orientation angle φ. Then, the generalized coordinates are: q(t) = [x(t), y(t), φ(t)] T , q ∈ C = R 3 .

Formation Control Design in Fault-Free Case</head><p>The control algorithm is based on a combination of feedback linearization and linear MPC for each robot in the team. The linearized model of each robot with nonlinear dynamics is established via feedback linearization, while MPC is applied to perform the motion control as well as maintain the formation shape.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. FAULT-TOLERANT COOPERATIVE CONTROL ALGORITHM WITH COLLISION AVOIDANCE CAPABILITY</head><p>In this section, a new FTCC algorithm is presented. The main purpose of the FTCC algorithm is to: 1) reassign the formation mission on the healthy members if one or more robots subject to severe faults and cannot complete their mission; 2) let the team continue the mission with degraded performance if one or more robots subject to a fault but are still able to complete the mission; and 3) avoid the potential collision between the healthy robots and the faulty one if it gets out from the formation. As a result, the FTCC algorithm consists of: 1) the FDD scheme in order to detect and diagnose the actuator fault; 2) the task reassignment and decision making algorithm in which the mission is reassigned or recoordinated based on the new situation; and 3) the collision avoidance algorithm. The overall control system block diagram of each robot in the team is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Fault Detection and Diagnosis Scheme</head><p>As mentioned in Section II, each differentially driven WMR is equipped with two motors. According to the value of the optimum control inputs given from the MPC, the angular velocities of the driving motors can be calculated as mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. The angular velocities are converted to the corresponding applied voltage, then the motors are driven corresponding to this applied voltage. The basic idea of the FDD scheme is to estimate the loss of effectiveness of the motors based on the difference between the desired and the actual angular velocities as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The two-stage Kalman filter is used to estimate the loss of effectiveness of the driving motors (actuator fault parameters of the system). The main advantage of the two-stage Kalman filter is its capability for simultaneous estimation of both states and fault parameters, which provides natural solution for the purpose of fault detection, isolation, and identification as well as providing full-state estimation for state feedback-based controllers when state vector is not available through measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Assumption 1: Each robot in the formation has its own FDD scheme. Therefore, each robot can detect the occurred faults and estimate their loss of control effectiveness.</p><p>For the FDD scheme design, modeling of the dc motor and actuator faults are needed first. In general, the torque T generated by a DC motor is proportional to the armature current and the strength of the magnetic field.

The applied voltage is treated as the input, and the rotational speed is chosen as the output, then the governing equations can be written as The state-space model in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">9</ref>) can be extended for the two driving motors as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">ω i = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ - b I m K c I m - K c L a - R a L a ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ ω i + ⎡ ⎣ 0 1 L a ⎤ ⎦ E ω = [1 0] ω i .

This value can be changed according to the type of robot and the type of mission.</p><p>The basic idea of the FTCC algorithm is to deal with the actuator faults in one or more robots according to the fault magnitude information γ j i 0 ≤ γ j i ≤ 1 i = 1, . . . , m, j = 1, . . . , N.</p><p>(37) estimated by the above-mentioned two-stage Kalman filter-based FDD scheme to the faulty robot j as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Depending on the fault severity levels, the following situations may take place. 1) If γ j i = 0, then all robots are fault-free. So, all robots continue the planned mission. 2) If 0.65 &lt; γ j i &lt; 1, then one or more robots are subject to severe actuator faults, and they are unable to complete the mission. So, the remaining healthy robots start reconfiguring their formation, i.e, each robot switches to a new desired formation F d . 3) If 0 &lt; γ j i &lt; 0.65, the mission can still be completed with degraded performance in the event of actuator faults in the robot team. 1) Task Reassignment: In case of severe fault occurrence, the FTCC problem is solved as an assignment problem. Once the leader receives the fault decision from the FDD unit, the leader knows that the remaining number of followers is F = N -1. The leader sends a new formation shape S parametrized by a vector r in Cartesian coordinates relative to the leader position. The desired formation of F followers is assumed as slots to be filled, whilst each follower needs to be assigned to only one of the slots. This can be formulated as an optimal assignment problem, where the cost function c i j = c(F i , S j ) decides the cost of assigning the robot F i to slot S j . The cost considered herein is to minimize the distance between the follower and the assigned slot. Also the leader has a predefined formation shape according to the number of remaining robots. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the possible formation shapes for six robots or fewer.</p><p>The optimal assignment problem can be mathematically formulated as follows.</p><p>Definition 1: Let F = {F 1 , F 2 , . . . , F n R } denote the healthy followers, and S = {S 1 , S 2 , . . . , S n R } denote the slots. Given an n R × n R cost matrix where the element at the i th row and the j th column corresponds to the cost of assigning the i th follower to the j th slot, find a permutation π of {1, 2, . . . , n R } for which:</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">n R i=1 c(F i S π(i) ) (38)</formula><p>is a minimum. Let x i j = 1 denote F i occupying S j and 0 otherwise. Then, the optimization objective function is</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">min n R i=1 n R j =1 c i j x i j (39) subject to n R i=1 x i j = 1 ∀ j, n R j =1 x i j = 1 ∀i.<label>(40)</label></formula><p>The above-mentioned constraints presented in (40) ensure a unique assignment, i.e., one robot occupies one and only one slot. Many algorithms are presented in operations research and network theory. The most common algorithm is the Hungarian algorithm that reduces the complexity of finding the optimal assignment from combinatorial to polynomial in time <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The input to this algorithm is the n R × n R cost matrix, which is defined in Definition 1. The solution can be obtained using a bipartite graph where there are n R vertices representing the healthy followers, n R vertices representing the slots, and edges connect the followers and slots where each edge has a nonnegative cost c i j . The Hungarian algorithm obtains the set of edges that minimize the sum of edge costs such that there is an edge connecting each follower to a unique slot.</p><p>2) Motion Re-Coordination: In case that the faulty robot is still able to complete the mission, the other healthy robots should reconfigure their controllers within the capability of the faulty robot.</p><p>The idea of motion re-coordination is that: once the leader receives the faulty signal from the faulty robot and it is able to complete the mission regardless the fault, then the leader will regenerate its desired trajectory corresponding to the fault severity γ j i , i.e., it regenerates the values of x r , y r , ẋr , and ẏr as follows: The leader controller will get the leader to converge to the new trajectory. This means that the leader controller should be reconfigured to meet the following objective:</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">zr = [ xr ỹr xr ỹr ] T = (1 -γ j i )[x r y r ẋr ẏr ] T (41)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_45">lim t →∞ (z r (t) -z l (t)) = 0. (<label>42</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_46">)</formula><p>Following the steps presented in Section II-B and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the followers' controllers will ensure the followers to follow the leader considering the new capabilities of the leader and the faulty robot. Consequently, the performance of the whole team will be degraded due to the fault. Thus, the mission can still continue but with degraded performance. The abovestated FTCC strategy for a team of WMRs is summarized in Algorithm 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Collision Avoidance Algorithm</head><p>During formation reconfiguration, healthy robots should avoid potential collision with faulty robot(s) based on the robots' sensory information. The reactive obstacle avoidance algorithm presented here is similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, where the mechanical impedance principle is used. The main concept is to link the movement of each robot in formation to virtual repulsive forces based on its interaction with the surrounding environment. Then, the linear and angular velocities of the robot are changed in response to this repulsive force. More details of the proposed collision avoidance algorithm can be found in authors' previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Remark 1: In this brief, it is assumed that there is no communication fault between the team robots, and each robot knows the position of other robots in the team. However, in case of large-scale multiagent systems, it is of great importance to improve the communication links between the team members. Moreover, the communication faults should be considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ANALYSIS A. Experimental Setup</head><p>In order to validate the proposed control algorithms presented in this brief, these control strategies are implemented on a team of WMRs. This brief is performed in the networked autonomous vehicles laboratory (NAV Lab) in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Concordia University. All the videos of the experiments performed in this brief can be found in the NAV Lab YouTube Channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>The experimental test bed in this brief includes the QGV robots, the ground station, and the vision system, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. Quanser QGV is a two-wheeled differentially driven robot with a four degrees-of-freedom robotic manipulator. The QGV control module is comprised of a data acquisition board (HiQ DAQ) and an embedded Gumstix computer where QuaRC is the Quanser's real-time control software. Together with the Gumstix embedded computer, the HiQ controls the vehicle by reading on-board sensors and sending motor commands. The motor speed controller is connected to two pulsewidth modulation (PWM) servo outputs on the HiQ. The on-board Gumstix computer runs QuaRC, allowing rapidly develop and deploy controllers for QGV real-time control. Runtime sensors measurement, data logging, and parameter tuning are supported between the ground host computer and the QGV.</p><p>Since the experiments taking place indoor in the absence of GPS, then the high-level controller implemented on a PC receives the states of the QGV from the vision system consisting of 24 OptiTrack camera systems. The high-level controller uses this information to calculate the desired PWM to be sent to the driving motors. The ground station PC used has a processor Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU at 3.40 GHz, and 4-GB RAM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Experimental Scenarios</head><p>Due to the space limitation in the laboratory, the experiment is performed with one leader and two followers only.  In the experiments, the team of three WMRs performs a triangular formation. The leader's initial position is q l (0) = [-0.19, -1.92, 100°] T . The leader tracks a reference trajectory defined as x r (t) = cos(0.25t) -0.1 (43) y r (t) = sin(0.25t) -0.6.</p><p>The initial positions of the followers are q 1 (0) = [-0.69, -2.45, 100°] T and q 2 (0) = [-0.69, -1.474, 100°] T , respectively. The desired formation with respect to the leader is 0.75 m and 225°for the first follower, and 0.75 m and 135°f or the second one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Analysis of Experimental Results of Case 1</head><p>In this case, at time instant t = 12 s, a severe fault is injected to the left motor of the second follower, leading to mission incompletion of this robot.</p><p>1) FDD Results: Under this faulty situation, the FDD algorithm detects the fault occurred at the left motor of the second robot, and estimates the value of the loss of control effectiveness γ 2 L . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> shows that the two-stage Kalman filter can estimate the real value of loss of control effectiveness γ 2 L within 2 s of fault occurrence. Also, the estimate of the fault magnitude represented by the loss of control effectiveness of the right actuator γ 2 R remains close to zero. As can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>, the left motor of the second follower is subject to a severe fault, leading to a loss of its control effectiveness by about 92%. The robot cannot continue its planned mission and gets out from the formation.  2) Task Reassignment Results: Once the fault is detected and diagnosed, the second follower stops and sends a signal to the leader. Under this fault situation, the leader sends a new formation command to the remaining healthy robot. According to the possible formation patterns presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, new formation data are sent to the first follower, which is 0.75 m and 270°. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> shows the robots' trajectories during mission execution. As can be observed, the team starts the formation in a triangular shape, and ends in the form of line formation due to the occurrence of the fault in the second follower robot at 12 s. Moreover, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> shows the desired formation angle of the first follower. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>, the first follower starts reconfiguring its formation once it receives the new desired formation command.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Analysis of Experimental Results of Case 2</head><p>In this scenario, at the time instant t = 13 s, a fault is injected to the left motor of the second follower. The loss of control effectiveness of the left motor is about 38%. So, the second follower is still capable of continuing the mission but with degraded performance.</p><p>1) FDD Results: Under this situation, the fault is detected and the value of the loss of control effectiveness γ 2 L is estimated by means of the FDD algorithm. It is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref> that the two-stage Kalman filter can estimate the real value of the loss of control effectiveness γ 2 L within 2 s of fault occurrence. Also, the estimate of γ 2 R remains close to zero. Based on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref>, the left motor of the second follower is subject to a fault, resulting in a loss of its control effectiveness   by about 38%. The robot continues its planned mission with 62% of its capability.</p><p>2) Motion Re-Coordination Results: Based on the FDD result, the second follower sends the fault information to the leader. As a result and according to (41), the leader updates the reference trajectory states. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref>, the second follower tries to accommodate this fault and continue the mission, together with leader and the first follower.</p><p>As can be observed from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref>, the proposed motion re-coordination is achieved. All the robots after 15 s reduce the linear velocities by incorporating the fault occurred in the second follower. Each robot moves only with about 62% of its capability. If the healthy robots do not reduce their capabilities, then the desired formation configuration cannot be maintained due to the degraded capability of the faulty robot. Therefore, the robots reduce their capabilities but with expected formation performance should be achieved in such a case. Such a control strategy is referred as to graceful performance degradation inspired by the work proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> for single vehicle cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>The FTCC problem of a team of differentially driven WMRs is addressed in this brief. The linear MPC is exploited to solve this problem, while the input-output feedback linearization is used to solve the problem of system nonlinearity. The FDD of actuator faults in the team has been achieved by exploiting a two-stage Kalman filter-based FDD scheme and integrated with the FTCC strategy to form an active FTCC framework. The proposed FTCC scheme is capable of: 1) reconfiguring the formation in case that one or more robots are faulty and cannot complete the mission and 2) re-coordinating the motion of each robot in the team if one or more robots subject to fault but can still continue the mission with degraded performance. Furthermore, experimental results exemplify that the formation system is stabilized, converges to the desired formation and reconfigures the formation shape in the presence of severe actuator faults, and re-coordinate the mission in the case of nonsevere faults.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
