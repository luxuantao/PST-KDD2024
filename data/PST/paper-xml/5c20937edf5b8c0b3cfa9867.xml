<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>A multi-agent formation control task is usually constituted by two subtasks. The first is formation shape control, which is to steer a group of mobile agents to form a desired geometric pattern given any initial configuration. The second is formation maneuver control, which is to steer the mobile agents to maneuver as a whole such that the centroid, orientation, scale, and other geometric parameters of the formation can be changed continuously. Formation maneuver control is important for a formation of agents to achieve desired navigation tasks or dynamically respond to the environment to, for example, avoid obstacles.</p><p>Multi-agent formation control has been studied by various approaches in the last two decades. The approaches proposed in the early stage such as behavior-based ones can handle complicated formation tasks subject to various agent dynamics and constraints (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>). However, the system convergence of these approaches is difficult to prove mathematically <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. From the practical point of view, system convergence is vital for a multi-agent control system because it guarantees the system to behave as expected.</p><p>Since the successful application of the consensus theory in formation control <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, tremendous research efforts have been devoted to developing convergence-guaranteed Shiyu Zhao is with the Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering at University of Sheffield, UK. szhao@sheffield.ac.uk formation control approaches (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for recent surveys). These existing formation control approaches can be classified by how the target formation is defined. For example, displacement-based, distance-based, and bearing-based approaches are three conventional approaches that define target formations by using constant constraints on inter-agent displacements, distances, and bearings, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The invariance of the constant constraints of the target formation has critical impact on the formation maneuverability. In particular, inter-agent displacement constraints are invariant to formation translation. As a result, displacement-based formation control laws can be applied to track target formations with time-varying translations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. However, the scale or orientation of the formation is difficult to control using this approach because changing the scale or orientation requires changing the displacement constraints. As a comparison, distance-based control laws can be applied to track target formations with time-varying translations and orientations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, but it is difficult to track time-varying formation scales. Bearing-based control laws can track formations with time-varying translations and scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, but it is difficult to track time-varying orientations.</p><p>Motivated by the limitations of the three approaches, researchers have proposed some methods to modify them in order to achieve desired formation maneuvers. For example, the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> modified the displacement-based formation control approach by adding a formation scale estimation mechanism, and the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> modified the distance-based formation control approach to allow the final formation has an unspecified scale. These modifications, however, usually result in complicated control and estimation problems, and may require additional sensing or communication abilities for each agent. An approach that can track general time-varying formations has been proposed recently in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. However, the desired maneuver of each agent must be pre-specified in this approach.</p><p>Very recently, researchers have proposed some approaches defining target formations using new types of constant constraints such as local bearings <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, barycentric coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, complex Laplacians <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and stress matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. These approaches are appealing due to the enhanced invariance of the new constraints. For example, a complex Laplacian is invariant to the translation, rotation, and scaling variations of a formation. As a result, the approach based on complex Laplacians can be applied to simultaneously achieve translational, rotational, and scaling formation maneuvers. This approach is, however, merely applicable to formation control in two dimensions.</p><p>Among these new approaches, the one based on stress matrices is promising to achieve general formation maneuvers. The stress matrix of a formation can be viewed as a generalized graph Laplacian. Its structure is determined by the underlying graph, but the values of the entries are jointly determined by the formation configuration. Unlike conventional graph Laplacian matrices, in a stress matrix the weight of an edge may be positive, negative, or zero. Stress matrices have been applied in stabilization of stationary target formations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, but their great potential to solve formation maneuver control has not been explored yet. In fact, the stress matrix is invariant to any affine transformation of the formation configuration. An affine transformation is a general linear transformation that may correspond to a translation, rotation, scaling, shear, or compositions of them. As a result, stress matrices provide a powerful tool to achieve various formation maneuver behaviors.</p><p>In this paper, we adopt the leader-follower strategy to solve the problem of formation maneuver control based on stress matrices. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we address the leader selection problem and introduce the notion of affine formation localizability that indicates whether or not the selected leaders can fully control the entire formation to achieve desired affine transformations. Necessary and sufficient conditions for affine localizability are proved. Second, we propose a variety of distributed control laws for single-and double-integrator agent dynamics based on different types of measurements. With the proposed control laws, not only the desired formation pattern can be achieved, any time-varying affine transformation such as a translation, rotation, scaling, or even shape deformation of the formation can be tracked. The proposed control laws are globally stable and applicable to formation control in arbitrary dimensions. Third, we propose control laws for unicycle models subject to linear and angular velocity saturation constraints. The proposed nonlinear control laws are proved to be globally stable in the case of stationary leaders. It is worth mentioning that the proposed control laws do not require global reference frames if the desired measurements can be measured in each agent's local reference frame.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. Notations and preliminaries are given in Section II. In Section III, the problem of affine formation control is described and necessary results are presented. The problem of leader selection and affine localizability are studied in Section IV. Control laws for single-and double-integrator agent dynamics are proposed in Section V. Nonlinear control laws for unicycle agents are proposed in Section VI. The implementation of the control laws and simulation examples are given in Section VII. Conclusions are drawn in Section VIII.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Notations for Formations</head><p>Consider a group of n mobile agents in R d where d ≥ 2 and n ≥ d + 1. Let p i ∈ R d be the position of agent i and p = [p T 1 , . . . , p T n ] T ∈ R dn be the configuration of all the agents. The interaction among the agents is described by a fixed graph G = (V, E) which consists of a vertex set V = {1, . . . , n} and an edge set E ⊆ V × V. The edge (i, j) ∈ E indicates that agent i can receive information from agent j, and agent j is a neighbor of i. The set of neighbors of vertex i is N i = {j ∈ V : (i, j) ∈ E}. This paper only consider undirected graphs where (i, j) ∈ E ⇔ (j, i) ∈ E. Let m be the number of undirected edges. An orientation of an undirected graph is the assignment of a direction to each undirected edge. An oriented graph is an undirected graph together with an orientation. The incidence matrix H ∈ R m×n of an oriented graph is the {0, ±1}-matrix with rows indexed by edges and columns by vertices <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>A formation, denoted as (G, p), is the graph G with its vertex i mapped to point p i . Without loss of generality, suppose the first n agents are leaders and the rest n f = n-n agents are followers. Let V = {1, . . . , n } and V f = V \ V be the sets of leaders and followers, respectively. The positions of the leaders and followers are denoted as p = [p T 1 , . . . , p T n ] T and p f = [p T n +1 , . . . , p T n ] T , respectively. Denote ⊗ as the Kronecker product and vec(•) the vector obtained by stacking all the columns of a matrix. A useful property of vec(•) is that vec(ABC) = (C T ⊗ A)vec(B), where A, B, C are real matrices of appropriate dimensions. As a special yet useful consequence, x ⊗ y = vec(yx T ) for any real vectors x, y, because vec(yx T ) = vec(y1x T ) = (x ⊗ y)vec(1) = x ⊗ y. The two properties will be frequently used in this paper.</p><p>Let Null(•) and Col(•) be the null and column spaces of a matrix, respectively. Let • be the Euclidian norm of a vector or the spectral norm of a matrix, I d ∈ R d×d the identity matrix, 1 n ∈ R n the vector with all entries equal to one, and dim(•) the dimension of a linear space. For any vector x, diag(x) denotes the diagonal matrix whose iith diagonal entry is the ith entry of x.</p></div>

Affine Span and Affine Dependence</head><p>Given a set of points {p i } n i=1 in R d , the affine span of these points, denoted as S, is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S = n i=1 a i p i : a i ∈ R for all i and n i=1 a i = 1 .</formula><p>For example, the affine span of two distinct points is the 1dimensional line passing through the two points. The affine span of three points that are not collinear is the 2-dimensional plane passing through the three points. The affine span of four points that are not coplanar is R 3 . If a i is restricted to be nonnegative, affine span degenerates to convex hull.</p><p>Given any affine span, we can always translate it to contain the origin to obtain a linear space. The dimension of the obtained linear space is defined as the dimension of the affine span. If the dimension of the affine span is d, then we say that these points affinely span R d .</p><p>The set of points {p i } n i=1 are called affinely dependent if there exists scalars {a i } n i=1 that are not all zero such that n i=1 a i p i = 0 and n i=1 a i = 0, and affinely independent otherwise.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Stress Matrices</head><p>For formation (G, p), a stress is a set of scalars, {ω ij } (i,j)∈E where ω ij = ω ji ∈ R, assigned to all the edges. A stress is called an equilibrium stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> if it satisfies</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">j∈Ni ω ij (p j -p i ) = 0, i ∈ V.<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The mechanical interpretation of equilibrium stresses is as follows. The value ω ij represents an attracting force in edge (i, j) when ω ij &gt; 0 and a repelling force when ω ij &lt; 0. The vector ω ij (x j -x i ) represents the force applied on agent i by agent j through edge (i, j). Thus, equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> means that the forces applied on joint i by joints j ∈ N i are balanced. See Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> for an illustration. Denote ω = [ω 1 , . . . , ω m ] ∈ R m as the stress vector where ω k corresponds to the kth undirected edge (k = 1, . . . , m). Note that equilibrium stresses can be only determined up to a scalar factor. That means if ω is an equilibrium stress, then kω is also an equilibrium stress for any k ∈ R =0 .

In this example, the four points form a square where the length of each side is equal to 1 and the length of each diagonal chord is equal to √ 2. The corresponding stress matrix is positive semi-definite and its eigenvalues are {4, 0, 0, 0}. stress matrix may be positive, negative, or zero whereas the weight for an edge in a graph Laplacian is usually positive. See Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> for an illustrative example of stress matrices.</p><p>The properties of stress matrices have intimate connections to the structural rigidity of the formation. We next review some necessary notions in the distance rigidity theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In R d , two formations (G, p) and (G, p ) are equivalent if p i -p j = p i -p j for all (i, j) ∈ E, and congruent if p i -p j = p i -p j for all i, j ∈ V. Formation (G, p) is globally rigid if an arbitrary formation that is equivalent to (G, p) is also congruent to it. Formation (G, p) in R d is universally rigid if it is globally rigid in any R d1 where d 1 ≥ d. A configuration is generic if the coordinates of all the nodes do not satisfy any nontrivial equations with rational coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr">Section 7.2]</ref>. The following result establishes the connection between stress matrices and universal rigidity.</p><p>Lemma 2 (Generic Universal Rigidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>). Given an undirected graph G and a generic configuration p, formation (G, p) is universally rigid if and only if there exists a stress matrix Ω such that Ω is positive semi-definite and rank(Ω) = n -d -1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PROBLEM STATEMENT OF AFFINE FORMATION MANEUVER CONTROL</head><p>This section first defines the time-varying target formation and then explores the properties of an important notion termed affine image.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Time-Varying Target Formation</head><p>The objective of affine formation maneuver control is to steer a group of agents to track the time-varying target formation defined below.</p><p>Definition 1 (Target Formation). The time-varying configuration of the target formation has the form of     (e) The constant configuration r represents a typical geometric pattern that the formation would like to maintain. Here, r is called the nominal configuration and (G, r) the nominal formation. The target configuration is actually a timevarying affine transformation of the nominal configuration. Affine transformation is a general linear transformation that may correspond to a translation, rotation, scaling, shear, or compositions of them. Note that shearing or scaling of the formation in different directions would deform the formation shape (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref> for an illustration). Affine transformation preserves straight lines and planes. As a result, collinear (or coplanar) points remain collinear (or coplanar) after any affine transformations. Parallel lines are also preserved by affine transformations.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">p * (t) = [I n ⊗ A(t)]r + 1 n ⊗ b(t), where r = [r T 1 , . . . , r T n ] T = [r T , r T f ] T ∈ R dn is a constant configuration, and A(t) ∈ R d×d and b(t) ∈ R d are contin- uous of t. The desired position of agent i ∈ V in the target formation is p * i (t) = A(t)r i + b(t).</formula><p>With the notion of the target formation, the problem to be solved in this paper is to control the group of agents to track the time-varying target configuration so that p(t) → p * (t) as t → ∞. A trivial control strategy to solve this problem is to let each agent know A(t), b(t), and r i so that each agent can track its individual reference trajectory. The disadvantage of the strategy is that it requires A(t) and b(t) for all t to be specified in advance and stored on each agent, which is impractical because the formation is not able to dynamically respond to unexpected situations such as pop-up obstacles.</p><p>In order to achieve the target formation in a distributed manner, we adopt the leader-follower strategy, where the desired formation maneuvers are merely known by a small number of agents, called leaders, and the other agents, called followers, only need to follow the motion of the leaders. As will be shown later, the leaders' positions will have a oneto-one correspondence to the affine transformation (A, b). Therefore, the affine transformation of the entire formation is achieved by controlling the positions of the leaders. Since the number of the leaders is usually small, in this work we do not specifically design coordination control laws for the leaders, and simply assume that they can be controlled properly. In practice, the leaders may be controlled by human operators or intelligent decision making programs. Suppose the position of each leader is equal to the desired value in the target formation, i.e., p (t) = p * (t) for all t. Then, the control objective becomes steering the followers such that p f (t) → p * f (t) as t → ∞. In order to achieve the control objective, we need to study an important notion termed affine image in the rest of the section.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. AFFINE LOCALIZABILITY AND LEADER SELECTION</head><p>This section studies the problem of leader selection. In order to manipulate the entire formation through the leaders, we must select sufficient and appropriate leaders. First of all, we define a notion termed affine localizability.</p><p>Definition 2 (Affine Localizability). The nominal formation (G, r) is affinely localizable by the leaders if for any p = [p T , p T f ] T ∈ A(r), p f can be uniquely determined by p . Affine localizability indicates that if a configuration is in A(r), then the positions of the leaders can uniquely determine those of the followers. As will be shown later, it is the key property to ensure the followers track any desired affine transformation maneuvers. We next give a necessary and sufficient condition of affine localizability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem 1 (Leader Selection for Affine Localizability).</head><p>Under Assumption 1, the nominal formation (G, r) is affinely localizable if and only if {r i } i∈V affinely span R d .</p><p>Proof. For any p ∈ A(r), there exist (A, b) such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">p 1 = Ar 1 + b, . . . p n = Ar n + b.

Then, z can be uniquely determined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">z = P T (r ) P (r ) -1 P T (r ) ⊗ I d p .<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Then, p f can be uniquely determined using <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> and hence the nominal formation is affinely localizable. (Necessity) If {r i } i∈V do not affinely span R d , rank( P (r )) &lt; d + 1 and there will be an infinite number of z satisfying <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. In particular, if z * is a solution of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">6</ref>), then z = z * + z 0 with z 0 = 0 and z 0 ∈ Null( P (r ) ⊗ I d ) is another solution of (6). Assumption 1 implies that P (r) ⊗ I d is of full column rank. As a result, z 0 / ∈ Null( P (r f ) ⊗ I d ) (otherwise, P (r) ⊗ I d is not of full column rank). Therefore, z = z * + z 0 and z = z * would yield different values of p f . Hence, p f cannot be uniquely determined and hence the nominal formation is not affinely localizable.</p><p>Theorem 1 suggests that any agents in the nominal formation that affinely span R d can be selected as leaders to ensure affine localizability. Since the affine span of R d requires at least d + 1 points, the minimum number of leaders is d + 1. For example, we need at least 3 leaders in R 2 , and at least 4 leaders in R 3 . When there are exactly d + 1 leaders, given any leader positions p , there always exists (A, b) solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. When there are more than d + 1 leaders, the positions of the leaders must be dependent on each other; otherwise, there may not exist (A, b) solving (6), because ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">6</ref>) is an overdetermined linear system in this case.</p><p>The leader selection problem has been studied in [22, Theorems 7.1 and 7.2]. These results address under what conditions A can be uniquely determined by some agents as a rotational or identity matrix. Theorem 1 is a generalization of these results in the sense that it addresses under what conditions a general matrix A can be uniquely determined.</p><p>When the leaders affinely span R d , there is an one-to-one correspondence between the positions of the leaders and the affine transformation (A, b). The next result shows how to calculate (A, b) using the positions of the leaders.</p><p>Corollary 1 (Calculation of Affine Transformation).

It follows that z = [( P T (p ) P (p )) -1 P T (p )] ⊗ I d p = i∈V (∆ -1 ri ) ⊗ I d p i i∈V p i /n -i∈V (r T ∆ -1 ri ) ⊗ I d p i . As a result, vec(A) = i∈V (∆ -1 ri ) ⊗ I d p i = vec( i∈V p i rT i ∆ -1</formula><p>), which implies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, and b = i∈V p i /n -i∈V (r T ∆ -1 ri ) ⊗ I d p i = i∈V p i /n -i∈V p i rT i ∆ -1 r, which is <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. The second way to prove is to directly substitute p i = Ar i + b into ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">9</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> to verify. In particular, rewrite p i as p i = A(r i -r) + Ar + b := Ar i + c. Note that i∈V ri = 0. Substituting p i = Ar i +c into the right hand side of (9) leads to A, which verifies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. Substituting it into the right hand side of (10) leads to c -Ar = b, which verifies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</p><p>Remark 2. Corollary 1 also implies that {r i } i∈V affinely span R d if and only if i∈V ri rT i is nonsingular. While Theorem 1 gives an intuitive condition for affine localizability, we next give another mathematical condition expressed in terms of stress matrices. This mathematical condition will be widely used in the stability analysis of the control laws proposed in the following sections. In the sequel of the paper, denote Ω = Ω ⊗ I d for notational simplicity. Partition Ω according to the partition of leaders and followers as</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">Ω = Ω Ω f Ωf Ωff ,</formula><p>where Ωff ∈ R (dn f )×(dn f ) and Ωf ∈ R (dn f )×(dn ) .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem 2 (Stress Condition for Affine Localizability).</head><p>Under Assumptions 1 and 2, the nominal formation (G, r) is affinely localizable if and only if Ωff is nonsingular. When</p><p>Ωff is nonsingular, for any p = [p T , p T f ] T ∈ A(r), p f can be uniquely calculated as p f = -Ω-1 f f Ωf p . Proof. (Sufficiency) Since any p ∈ A(r) is also Null( Ω) by Lemma 4, any p ∈ A(r) satisfies Ωp = 0 which implies Ωff p f + Ωf p = 0. If Ωff is nonsingular, p f can be uniquely determined as p f = -Ω-1 f f Ωf p and hence the nominal formation is affinely localizable.</p><p>(Necessity) Assume that Ωff is singular and hence there exists a nonzero vector x 0 ∈ R dn f such that Ωff x 0 = 0. Let x = [0, x T 0 ] T ∈ R dn . Then, x T Ωx = x T 0 Ωff x 0 = 0. Under Assumptions 1 and 2, it follows from Lemma 5 that A(r) = Null( Ω). As a result, for any p ∈ A(r) = Null( Ω), we have (p + x) T Ω(p + x) = 0, and consequently p + x ∈ Null( Ω) = A(r). Therefore, for any p ∈ A(r), p+x is also in A(r). Note that p and p+x have the same leaders' positions but different followers' positions because the first dn elements of x are zero. As a result, it is impossible to distinguish p from p + x merely using the leaders' positions, and consequently the nominal formation is not affinely localizable. Now we are ready to make the third assumption of the nominal formation.</p><p>Assumption 3 (Affine Localizability of Nominal Formation). Assume that the nominal formation (G, r) is affinely localizable by the leaders.</p><p>Up to now, we have made three assumptions on the nominal formation. Assumption 1 requires that the nominal configuration affinely span R d so that dim(A(r)) = d 2 + d. Assumption 2 requires that the nominal formation satisfies some rigidity constraints so that Ω(r) is positive semi-definite and rank(Ω(r)) = n -d -1. Assumption 3 requires that the selected leaders in the nominal formation affinely span R d . According to Theorem 2, the three assumptions imply an important mathematical conation: Ωff is positive definite.</p><p>Recall that the control objective is to achieve p f (t) → p * f (t) as t → ∞ where p * f (t) is the desired position of the followers in the target formation. If Ωff is positive definite, we have p * f (t) = -Ω-1 f f Ωf p * (t). Define the tracking error as</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">δ p f (t) = p f (t) -p * f (t) = p f (t) + Ω-1 f f Ωf p * (t).</formula><p>As a result, the control objective becomes steering the followers so that δ p f (t) → 0 as t → ∞. The subsequent sections will present distributed control laws to achieve this objective.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. IMPLEMENTATION AND SIMULATION</head><p>To implement the proposed control laws, the first step is to design a nominal formation satisfying Assumptions 1-3.

To satisfy Assumption 3, at least d + 1 agents that affinely span R d in the nominal configuration must be selected as leaders. Once the nominal formation has been designed, the next step is to calculate the stress matrix. Calculating the stress matrix is nontrivial. It has been shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> that this problem can be formulated as a dynamic programming problem. Here we present an alternative formulation.</p></div>

The nominal formation for the two simulation examples is given in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, where the first three agents are selected as leaders and the rest as followers. Since the three leaders in the nominal formation are not collinear, they affinely span the plane. By using the method proposed in Proposition 2, we calculate an equilibrium stress, which has been depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The equilibrium stress is normalized so that its norm is unit. The corresponding stress matrix is positive semi-define and satisfies rank(Ω) = n -d -1 = 4.</p><p>The first simulation example shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref> demonstrates the control law in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> for double-integrator agent dynamics.

The tracking error remains zero when the formation maneuvers.</p><p>In the simulation, the trajectories of the three leaders are generated in advance. In practical applications, the leaders may generate proper trajectories in real time based on the task requirement and obstacles in the environment. In addition, it must be noted that the affine span condition of the leaders in Theorem 1 is for the nominal formation. The leaders do not need to satisfy this condition when the formation maneuvers. For example, as shown in the simulation result, the leaders may become collinear and hence do not affinely span R 2 . Finally, in the simulation, the acceleration feedback is delayed by 0.001 second. It is observed in the simulation The simulation animation can be found at https://youtu.be/HyCn8r7LBZw. that larger delays would result in larger tracking errors though the tracking errors are always bounded.</p><p>The second simulation example as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5</ref> demonstrates the control law in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> for unicycle agents subject to velocity saturation constraints. In this example, the leaders are stationary. The Lyapunov function converges monotonically to zero. Note that the relative positions of the leaders are different from those in the nominal formation. As a result, the final formation is an affine transformation of the nominal formation. It is shown that the collinearity and parallel lines are preserved in the final formation though the shape of the final formation is distorted.</p><p>For the sake of simplicity, undirected lines are used to represent the interactions among the agents in the above simulation results. However, it must be noted that the interaction between a follower and a leader is directional instead of bidirectional (or undirected) because the leaders do not need to receive the followers' information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This paper proposed a new approach based on stress matrices to achieve formation maneuver control in arbitrary dimensions. Distributed control laws for single-integrator, double-integrator, and unicycle agent models have been proposed and proved to be globally stable. The proposed control laws can track any target formation that is a timevarying affine transformation of a nominal formation. As a result, the centroid, orientation, scales in different directions, and other geometric parameters of the formation can all be changed continuously. The control laws do not require a common global orientation if the relative measurements can be measured in each agent's local reference frame.</p><p>Stress matrices can be viewed as generalized graph Laplacian matrices with negative or zero edge weights. The linear affine formation control laws proposed in this paper have similar expressions as consensus protocols or containment control laws <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> (i.e., consensus protocols with multiple leaders). The work presented in this paper demonstrated that with negative edge weights, the consensus-type control laws may exhibit many new interesting features. Consensus problems over networks with negative weights have received growing research attention in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. There are several important topics for future research. For example, the results presented in this paper may be generalized by considering more complicated agent dynamics, motion constraints, and directed underlying graphs. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head>Fig. 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2: An illustration of affine transformations of a nominal configuration.

Since P (p) has d + 1 columns, there exist at most d + 1 points that are affinely independent in R d . If {p i } n i=1 affinely span R d , there must exist d + 1 points that are affinely independent. As a result, P (p) has d+1 rows that are linearly independent and consequently rank( P (p)) = d + 1. This useful result is given as a lemma. Lemma 1 (Rank Condition for Affine Span). The set of points {p i } n i=1 affinely span R d if and only if n ≥ d + 1 and rank( P (p)) = d + 1.</figDesc><table /></figure>
