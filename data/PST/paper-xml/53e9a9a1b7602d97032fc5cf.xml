<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We present a nonsmooth output feedback framework for local and/or global stabilization of a class of nonlinear systems that are not smoothly stabilizable nor uniformly observable. A systematic design method is presented for the construction of stabilizing, dynamic output compensators that are nonsmooth but Hölder continuous.

INTRODUCTION</head><p>I N THIS PAPER, we investigate the output feedback stabi- lization problem for a class of nonlinear systems described by equations of the form . . . <ref type="bibr">(1.1)</ref> where and are the system state, output and control input, respectively. For is an odd positive integer, and , is a mapping with . The function is and . In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, it was proved that every smooth affine system, i.e., and</p><p>(1.2)</p><p>is feedback equivalent to the nonlinear system (1.1) with , by a local diffeomorphism and a smooth state feedback if, and only if, a set of necessary and sufficient conditions hold <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Moreover, it was pointed out <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> that the conditions are nothing but an extension of the exact feedback linearization conditions. In the case when , the conditions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> reduce to the well-known necessary and sufficient conditions for affine systems to be exactly feedback linearizable. Hence, (1.1) with a suitable form of is indeed a generalized normal form of affine systems when exact feedback linearization is not possible.</p><p>For system (1.1) in the Hessenberg form, i.e., , the problem of global stabilization by state feedback was addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Due to the presence of uncontrollable unstable linearization, system (1.1) may not be stabilized by any smooth state feedback, even locally <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. It is, however, globally stabilizable by Hölder continuous state feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. By comparison, little progress has been made in the design of output feedback controllers for the nonlinear system (1.1). As a matter of fact, output feedback stabilization of (1.1) is a recognized challenging problem, because the lack of uniform observability and the unobservable linearization of (1.1) make the conventional output feedback design methods inapplicable.</p><p>For nonlinear systems with uncontrollable/unobservable linearization, there are very few results in the literature addressing difficult issues such as observer design <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, and output feedback stabilization.</p><p>Even in some relatively simple cases, for instance, the local case, a fundamental question of whether the nonlinear system (1.1) is locally stabilizable by nonsmooth output feedback remains unknown.</p><p>Over the past few years, attempt has been made to tackle this difficult problem and some preliminary results have been obtained towards the output feedback stabilization of lower-dimensional nonlinear systems (some elegant results on state feedback stabilization of two or three-dimensional systems can be found, for instance, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>). The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> considered a class of planar systems in the lower-triangular form <ref type="bibr">(1.3)</ref> When , the first approximation of system (1.3) is not controllable nor observable. As a result, the traditional "Luenberger-type" or "high-gain" observer proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> cannot be applied to the high-order system (1.3). To solve the global stabilization problem by smooth output feedback, we proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> a one-dimensional nonlinear observer that is constructed using a feedback domination design combined with the tool of adding a power integrator. With the help of the reduced-order observer, a smooth output feedback stabilizer was designed for the planar system (1.3), under a high-order growth condition imposed on <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The growth condition was relaxed later in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, by employing nonsmooth rather than smooth output feedback. Note that both papers considered only the output feedback stabilization for planar systems. A major limitation of the papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> is that the proposed output feedback control schemes are basically an ad-hoc design. They are difficult to be extended to higher dimensional nonlinear systems with uncontrollable/unobservable linearization.</p><p>In the higher dimensional case, there are fewer results available in the literature, which address the question of how to stabilize non-uniformly observable systems via output feedback. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, the problem of global stabilization by smooth output feedback was shown to be solvable for a chain of odd power integrators with same powers (i.e.,</p><p>). This was done by developing a new output feedback control scheme that allows one to design both high-order observers and controllers explicitly. While the state feedback control law is constructed based on the standard tool of adding an integrator, the observer design was carried out by using a newly developed machinery which can be viewed as a dual of the adding a power integrator technique. A novelty of the nonlinear observer design approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> is that the observer gains can be assigned one-by-one, in an iterative manner.</p><p>Despite the aforementioned progress, many important output feedback control problems remain open and unsolved. One of them, for instance, is whether a chain of odd power integrators with different powers can be stabilized by output feedback? The other is when the nonlinear system (1.1) in the Hessenberg form, which is impossible to be handled by smooth feedback, is locally or globally stabilizable by nonsmooth output feedback? These fundamental issues will be addressed in this paper, and some answers will be given to these questions.</p><p>In particular, a nonsmooth output feedback control scheme will be developed to tackle the output feedback stabilization problem of system <ref type="bibr">(1.1)</ref>.</p><p>The objectives of this paper are twofold: To identify appropriate conditions under which a class of genuinely nonlinear systems (1.1) with arbitrarily odd integers is locally and/or globally stabilizable by nonsmooth output feedback, and to develop a nonsmooth feedback design approach for the explicit construction of a stabilizing, dynamic output compensator <ref type="bibr">(1.4)</ref> where is a but nonsmooth mapping. Inspired by the observer design approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, we will present in this work a new methodology to construct a reducedorder observer for nonlinear systems that go substantially beyond the systems studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The proposed observer design approach possesses several unique features different from existing methods: i) The observer has a nonsmooth structure as a necessary tool to overcome the obstacle caused by the complex structure of (1.1), which seems to be hard to be handled by the smooth observer design <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>; ii) the reduced-order observer is constructed recursively, in an augmented manner by which the estimators of the unmeasurable states are built one by one, from top to bottom; (iii) the selection of the observer gains requires a more subtle procedure due to the use of nonsmooth observers. Combining the new reduced-order observer design with the nonsmooth state feedback control method <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, we can achieve global stabilization by nonsmooth output feedback, for a number of nonlinear systems with unstabilizable/undetectable linearization. In fact, the nonsmooth output feedback stabilization theory thus developed leads to several new and important conclusions. One of them, among the other things, is that every chain of odd power integrators is globally stabilizable by Hölder continuous output feedback. Another important result is that the local stabilization is possible by nonsmooth output feedback for nonlinear systems in the Hessenberg or -normal form <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, where only global strong stabilization via nonsmooth state feedback was shown to be possible.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews some basic notions and results of homogeneous systems theory, which will be frequently used in the sequel. In Section III, we first consider, for the sake of clarity, the problem of output feedback stabilization for a chain of odd power integrators with different powers. For this simple yet genuinely nonlinear system, we explicitly construct a Hölder continuous output feedback controller. In Section IV, we extend the result of Section III to a class of nonsmootly stabilizable systems with undetectable linearization. The results on global output feedback stabilization are derived under restrictive growth conditions. In the local case, we show how the growth conditions can be removed, and how new stabilization results can be derived by the theory of homogeneous systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, in particular, by the robust stability theorem of homogeneous systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>[30] combined with the technique of homogeneous approximation. Appendix collects some useful lemmas and all the proofs of the propositions to be used throughout this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. HOMOGENEITY AND ROBUST STABILITY OF HOMOGENEOUS SYSTEMS</head><p>Aside from aesthetic aspect, dynamic systems that exhibit homogeneity often possess some important and useful properties.</p><p>For instance, as in the case of linear systems, local asymptotic stability of a homogeneous system implies its global asymptotic stability. Similarly, a nonlinear system is locally asymptotically stable if its homogeneous approximation is locally asymptotically stable. These distinguished features make the stability analysis and synthesis of homogeneous systems much simpler and easier than general dynamic systems without homogeneity.</p><p>In this section, we review a number of basic definitions and concepts related to the notions of homogeneous vector fields, homogeneity with respect to a family dilations, homogeneous approximations and robust stability of homogeneous systems, which play a key role in proving the main results of this paper. The reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and the books <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, as well as the references therein for additional details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Standard Homogeneity</head><p>The concept of homogeneity was introduced as a powerful tool for the stability analysis of nonlinear systems. In the literature, the homogeneity was originally defined as follows: the vector field of the autonomous system with (2.1) is said to be homogeneous if there is a constant such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(2.2)</formula><p>With this definition, the following stability result was established for a perturbed system of (2.1), which is analog to the first stability theorem of Lyapunov. Theorem 2.1: (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>) Consider an autonomous system of the form <ref type="bibr">(2.3)</ref> where satisfies (2.2) and . If the homogeneous systems (2.1) is asymptotically stable, the perturbed system (2.1) is also locally asymptotically stable.</p><p>Due to the richness of the nonlinearities, the class of nonlinear systems satisfying (2.2) is rather limited. To generalize Theorem 2.1 and to characterize a more general class of homogeneous systems, we review in the next subsection important concepts such as dilations, weighted homogeneity and homogeneous vector fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Weighted Homogeneity</head><p>The notion of weighted homogeneity was already discussed in the books <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> as a natural extension of the standard homogeneity. The concept and its applications were elaborated later in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. This powerful notion, together with the idea of homogeneous approximation, has led to some important stability results for analysis and synthesis of general nonlinear control systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In what follows, we recall the notions such as dilations and homogeneous vector fields with weighted dilation, and Hermes' theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> on robust stability of homogeneous systems to be used later on.</p><p>For a fixed coordinate and real numbers and : • a dilation is a mapping , defined by where is the weighting of the th coordinate; • a function is said to be homogeneous of degree if there is a real number such that</p><p>• a vector field is said to be homogeneous of degree if there is a real number such that for Remark 2.1: Notably, the standard homogeneity is a special case of the weighted one. This conclusion follows immediately by setting and . Throughout this paper, the weighted homogeneity will be used in the stability analysis of nonlinear systems.</p><p>The homogeneity and its properties reviewed so far for autonomous systems can be easily extended to the nonlinear control systems For instance, the vector field is homogeneous of degree if there exists a set of positive real number and such that</p><p>The introduction of weighted homogeneity has led to a powerful way for the stability analysis of nonlinear systems. Over the past few decades, the theory of homogeneous systems and its applications to feedback stabilization of nonlinear control systems have been developed extensively, and a number of important results have been obtained in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Among many other things, a well-known result of homogeneous systems is the equivalence between local and global asymptotic stability. Another important conclusion is that an asymptotically stable homogenous system admits a homogeneous Lyapunov function <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In the remainder of this section, we recall a robust stability theorem that is useful in proving asymptotic stability of nonlinear systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Robust Stability of Homogeneous Systems</head><p>With the aid of the concepts of dilation and homogeneous vector fields, the following stability result which is a natural extension of Theorem 2.1 can be established for general homogeneous systems.</p><p>Theorem 2.2: (See <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>) Suppose the following assumptions hold.</p></div>

Then, if the trivial solution of the homogeneous system (2.1) is locally asymptotically stable, the solution of the perturbed system is also locally asymptotically stable.</p><p>Remark 2.2: Clearly, applications of Theorem 2.2 depend crucially on how to identify a nilpotent approximating system which is homogeneous with respect to certain dilation. This is an important but difficult issue that was discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In this paper, we shall not address the issue of how to find a homogeneous approximation for general nonlinear systems. Instead, we will focus on a class of nonlinear systems in the Hessenberg form <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for which the homogeneous approximation can be easily identified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. GLOBAL STABILIZATION OF A CHAIN OF POWER INTEGRATORS BY NONSMOOTH OUTPUT FEEDBACK</head><p>In this section, we consider the problem of global output feedback stabilization for a relatively simple yet significant subclass of nonlinear systems (1.1). Specifically, we focus our attention on the nonlinear system with unstabilizable/undetectable linearization (3.1) known as a chain of odd power integrators.</p><p>When , global stabilization of system (3.1) has been shown to be solvable by smooth output feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The solution in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> was derived based on a novel output feedback control scheme that enables one to construct recursively a nonlinear observer and a smooth state feedback controller. Although the output feedback design method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> overcomes the obstacle caused by unobservability of the Jacobian linearization of high-order nonlinear systems, it is hard to be extended to the chain of power integrators (3.1) with different , due to the nature of a smooth feedback design.</p><p>In what follows, we present a nonsmooth output feedback control scheme for the construction of dynamic output compensators that globally stabilize system (3.1). A new ingredient will be the introduction of a recursive observer design algorithm, making it possible to construct a reduced-order observer step-by-step, in an augmented manner. A combination of the new observer design with the nonsmooth state feedback control strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> leads to a globally stabilizing, nonsmooth output feedback controller. The main result of this section is the following theorem.</p><p>Theorem 3.1: There is a Hölder continuous output feedback controller of the form (1.4) globally stabilizing the nonlinear system (3.1).</p><p>Proof: We break up the proof into three parts. First, a nonsmooth but Hölder continuous state feedback controller is designed via the adding a power integrator technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. We then construct step-by-step, a nonsmooth reduced-order observer with a set of constant gains that will be determined in the last step of design. Finally, we show that a careful selection of the observer gains guarantees global strong stability of the closed-loop system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nonsmooth State Feedback Design</head><p>For a chain of odd power integrators (3.1), globally stabilizing nonsmooth state feedback controllers can be constructed using the method suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The proposition below is a slight modification of the result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. It provides an explicit formula for the calculation of a global state stabilizer. For the convenience of the reader, a sketch of the proof is given in the Appendix.</p><p>Proposition 3.1: There is a Hölder continuous state feedback controller of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(3.2)</formula><p>with being real constants, such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(3.3)</formula><p>where is a positive definite and proper<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> Lyapunov function, whose form can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, and is a real constant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recursive Design of Nonlinear Observers</head><p>In the state feedback case, it is easy to conclude from the Lyapunov inequality (3.3) that the nonsmooth controller globally stabilizes the chain of power integrators (3.1). In the case of output feedback, the state of (3.1) is not measurable and only is available for feedback design. As a result, the controller (3.2) cannot be implemented directly. To obtain an implementable controller, one must design an observer to estimate . Motivated by the observer design methods in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>[33], we next develop a machinery that makes it possible to build a nonsmooth nonlinear observer step-by-step, in an augmented fashion. This is the basic philosophy to be pursued below.</p><p>To see how a nonlinear observer can be recursively constructed, we first consider the case of system (3.1) with . In this case, one can construct, similar to the design method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> with a suitable twist, the following one-dimensional nonlinear observer <ref type="bibr">(3.4)</ref> In other words, we use a reduced-order observer to estimate, instead of the state , the unmeasurable variable , where is a gain constant to be assigned later. When , a two-dimensional observer need to be constructed for estimating the unmeasurable variables . Of course, a desirable way for the recursive observer design is to keep the one-dimensional observer already built for unchanged, and being a part of the two-dimensional observer. With this idea in mind, we simply augment a one-dimensional observer of the form (3.5) to the dynamic system <ref type="bibr">(3.4)</ref>, where is an estimate of the unmeasurable variable , and is a gain constant to be determined later.</p><p>In this way, we have obtained, in a naturally augmented manner, a two-dimensional observer consisting of (3.4)-(3.5) for the chain of integrators (3.1) with . There are three new ingredients in the construction of the observer (3.4)-(3.5): i) no change of the structure is made to the observer for obtained in the previous step; ii) the augmented observer estimates the unmeasurable variable that is related to and , rather than a linear function of and as done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>; (iii) the observer (3.4)-(3.5) is nonsmooth while the nonlinear observer designed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> is smooth.</p><p>Such an augmented design method enables us to construct a nonlinear observer recursively, going from lower dimensional systems to higher dimensional systems step-by-step, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Indeed, for the -dimensional chain of odd power integrators (3.1), applying the augmented design algorithm repeatedly, we arrive at the following -dimensional observer:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(3.6)</formula><p>where and is the estimate of the unmeasurable variable . For the convenience of notations, we also denote and . Let be the estimate errors. Then, a direct calculation yields . . . where and . In order to estimate the terms on the right-hand side of (3.12), we introduce two propositions whose proofs involve tedious calculations but nevertheless can be carried out using Lemmas A.1-A. Remark 3.1: Theorem 3.1 has provided a global output feedback controller for a chain of odd power integrators with distinct powers 's. As a consequence, Theorem 3.1 recovers the previous result on global output feedback stabilization of the nonlinear system (3.1) when <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. While the controller obtained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> is smooth, the resulting output feedback stabilizer from Theorem 3.1 is continuous but nonsmooth, even if . However, it is worth pointing out that the main advantage of Theorem 3.1 lies in the development of a systematic nonsmooth output feedback design method, which enables one to deal with not only the output feedback stabilization of (3.1) without requiring the same 's, but also a number of nonsmoothly stabilizable systems with undetectable linearization, as shown in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. OUTPUT FEEDBACK CONTROL OF NONSMOOTHLY STABILIZABLE SYSTEMS</head><p>We now employ the output feedback design approach developed in the previous section to investigate the problem of output feedback stabilization for a class of triangular systems with undetectable linearization. Although the systems under consideration cannot be dealt with by smooth feedback, we show that under appropriate conditions, they are globally stabilizable by nonsmooth output feedback. We begin by introducing an important result that shows how Theorem 3.1 can be extended to a class of homogeneous systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Output Feedback Stabilization of Homogeneous Systems</head><p>In this subsection, we focus on the following class of homogeneous systems that are not smoothly stabilizable nor uniformly observable <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>: . . . where is a constant and , are integers between 0 and , such that and .

The objective of this subsection is 2 The notion of strong stability is nothing but a generalized notion of asymptotic stability for continuous systems with nonunique solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>to show that global stabilization of (4.1) is also achievable by Hölder continuous output feedback.</p><p>Theorem 4.1: The homogeneous system (4.1) is globally stabilizable by non-smooth output feedback.</p><p>Proof: The proof is similar to that of Theorem 3.1, with an appropriate modification. Due to the design of a nonsmooth nonlinear observer, the observer gains need to be chosen in a more subtle manner.</p><p>First of all, it is easy to verify that system (4.1) is homogeneous of degree with the dilation As a consequence, system (4.1) can also be globally stabilized by a nonsmooth state feedback controller of the form (3.2), with a different set of coefficients . In other words, Proposition 3.1 holds and the Lyapunov inequality (3.3) is still true. Next, we apply the recursive observer design method developed in the last section to construct a nonsmooth observer. Since the homogeneous system (4.1) has a lower-triangular structure, a more rigorous observer needs to be designed. In the case when , one can construct the following estimator for :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(4.2)</formula><p>To build estimators for , define With the aid of this compact notation, a set of estimators can be constructed recursively as follows:   for some constants . Substituting (4.7) and (4.11) into (4.5) results in <ref type="bibr">(4.12)</ref> which is of the form <ref type="bibr">(3.15)</ref>.</p><p>The remaining part of the proof will be the use of the inequalities (3.3) and (4.12) to conclude global strong stability of the closed-loop system (4.1)-(4.4)-(3.16), which is almost identical to the proof of Theorem 3.1, and thus left to the reader as an exercise.</p><p>Theorem 4.1 is illustrated by the following example. Obviously, when . This implies that . For , since . Similarly, and . Hence, (4.13) is of the form (4.1). By Theorem 4.1, there is a nonsmooth output feedback controller globally stabilizing (4.13). Notably, system (4.13) is genuinely nonlinear and cannot be dealt with by smooth output feedback schemes including the one suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, because the linearized system of (4.13) at the origin is uncontrollable and unobservable, and moreover, the uncontrollable mode has an eigenvalue whose real part is positive. In conclusion, global stabilization of (4.13) is only achievable by nonsmooth output feedback.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Global Output Feedback Stabilization of Non-Homogeneous Systems</head><p>It should be pointed out that the construction of the nonsmooth observer in Section IV-A relies heavily on the homogeneous property of the controlled plant. Consequently, the nonsmooth output feedback control scheme developed so far can only be applied to homogeneous systems.</p><p>On the other hand, a careful examination of Theorem 4.1 suggests that with a suitable twist, it is possible to relax the homogeneous requirement and to establish a more general stabilization theorem for a class of non-homogeneous systems.</p><p>As a matter of fact, a global stabilization result can be proved for the nonhomogeneous system (1.1) under the following conditions.</p><p>Assumption 4.1: For , there are constants such that Assumption 4.2: For , there are constants such that (4.14) Under Assumptions 4.1 and 4.2, there is a nonsmooth output feedback controller of the form (1.4) globally stabilizing the nonhomogeneous system (1.1).</p><p>Proof: Due to the nature of feedback domination design given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, it is easy to see that under the triangular growth condition (4.14), Proposition 3.1 still holds. That is, the non-homogeneous system (1.1) is globally stabilizable by the nonsmooth state feedback controller (3.2). For the construction of a nonlinear observer, we use the same structure of the observer (4.3) but in the current case . Consequently, the hypothesis (4.14) implies that This, together with (A.10), leads to the relation (4.10). The rest of the proof is very similar to that of Theorem 4.1 and thus omitted here.</p><p>Since Assumptions 4.1 and 4.2 characterize a more general class of non-homogeneous systems than the homogeneous systems (4.1), Theorem 4.2 can be used to handle the problem of global stabilization by nonsmooth output feedback, for a class of nonsmoothly stabilizable systems with undetectable linearization, which are not necessarily homogeneous. For example, with the help of Theorem 4.2, we are able to solve the difficult problem of global output feedback stabilization for a benchmark example in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, which is a simplified version of the underactuated unstable two degrees of freedom mechanical system studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Example 4.2: Consider the three-dimensional system (4.15)</p><p>which is not smoothly stabilizable nor uniformly observable. Due to the presence of , system (4.15) is not homogeneous and hence its output feedback stabilization problem is not solvable by Theorem 4.1.</p><p>On the other hand, it is easy to verify that the conditions (4.14)-(4.14) are fullfilled. By Theorem 4.2, there does exist a nonsmooth output feedback controller globally stabilizing <ref type="bibr">(4.15)</ref>. Such an output dynamic compensator can be constructed as follows. First, using the nonsmooth state feedback design method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, one can find the globally stabilizing, nonsmooth state feedback controller (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> for details) <ref type="bibr">(4.16)</ref> Then, following the recursive observer design method proposed in this paper, a reduced-order nonsmooth observer can be constructed, i.e., <ref type="bibr">(4.17)</ref> where and Now, substituting the estimated states and into (4.16) yields (4.18)</p><p>Finally, a straightforward argument similar to the proof of Theorem 4.1 leads to the conclusion that by choosing the gain parameters and suitably, the nonsmooth output feedback controller (4.17)-(4.18) globally stabilizes the nonhomogeneous system <ref type="bibr">(4.15)</ref>. The simulation results shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> illustrate the effectiveness of the nonsmooth output feedback controller (4.17)-(4.18). In the simulation, the observer gains are selected as and .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. LOCAL STABILIZATION OF NONLINEAR SYSTEMS IN THE HESSENBERG FORM</head><p>In the preceding sections, we identified a number of classes of nonsmoothly stabilizable systems (with undetectable linearization) for which global stabilization by nonsmooth output feedback has shown to be possible, under certain restrictive conditions such as Assumptions 4.1-4.2. The purpose of this section Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> Transient esponses of (4.17)-(4.18) with (x (0); x (0); x (0); ẑ (0); ẑ (0)) = (2; 2; 2; 0; 0). is to study, to what extent, the question that the restrictive conditions imposed previously can be relaxed if a less ambitious control objective, namely, local rather than global output feedback stabilization, is sought.</p><p>It turns out that, perhaps not surprisingly, if one is only interested in a local result, the class of nonlinear systems that is stabilizable by output feedback can be significantly enlarged. In particular, we will prove a general result on local output feedback stabilization of nonlinear systems. That is, every nonlinear system in the so-called -normal form or Hessenberg form <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, which is neither uniformly observable nor smoothly stabilizable, is locally stabilizable by nonsmooth output feedback, without requiring any growth condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Lower Triangular Systems</head><p>To highlight the main idea, we first examine the case when the nonlinear system (1.1) is of a lower triangular structure, i.e.,</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, it has been shown that this class of triangular systems is globally stabilizable by nonsmooth state feedback.</p><p>In what follows, we will show that without imposing any condition on , the triangular system (1.1) is locally stabilizable by nonsmooth output feedback.</p><p>Theorem 5.1: There is a Hölder continuous, dynamic output compensator of the form (4.3)-(3.16) locally stabilizing system (1.1) when . Proof: Since the vector field is and vanishes at the origin, by the Taylor expansion theorem (5.1) Clearly, there always exists an integer such that and . Then, the homogeneous approximation of (5.1) under the dilation (5.2) is <ref type="bibr">(5.3)</ref> Note that the remainder is a high-order term under this dilation. As a matter of fact <ref type="bibr">(5.4)</ref> because implies that , where . From (5.3) and (5.4), it is clear that system (4.1) is a homogeneous approximation of (1.1). According to Theorem 4.1, there exists a Hölder continuous, dynamic output compensator composed of (4.3) and (3.16), globally stabilizing the homogeneous system (4.1). By construction, the resulted nonlinear observer . . . is homogeneous of degree 0 under the dilation for for for (5.5)</p><p>Moreover, it is easy to see that has a same degree of homogeneity as . Therefore, the controller (3.16) is homogeneous under the composite dilations (5.2)-(5.5). By Hermes' robust stability theorem (i.e., Theorem 2.2), it is concluded that the dynamic output compensator (4.3)-(3.16) renders the triangular system (1.1) locally asymptotically stable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Nonlinear Systems in the Hessenberg Form</head><p>In this subsection, we show how the result presented in Section V-A can be further extended to a more general class of nonlinear systems in the Hessenberg form or -normal form <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> (5.6) where the functions , with , are .

Likewise, it is straightforward to prove that the homogeneous approximation of is identical to the homogeneous approximation of the function , which is equal to with an integer satisfying , and . In summary, similar to the case of a lower-triangular system considered in Section V-A, the nonlinear system in the Hessenberg form (5.6) has a homogeneously approximated system (4.1) that is stabilizable by the nonsmooth output feedback controller (4.3)- <ref type="bibr">(3.16)</ref>. Keeping this in mind and using the same arguments as in the proof of Theorem 5.1, we conclude immediately that the nonlinear system (5.6) is locally stabilizable by nonsmooth output feedback, for instance, by the output dynamic compensator (4.3)- <ref type="bibr">(3.16)</ref>.</p><p>We conclude this section by pointing out that Theorems 5.1 and 5.2 can be extended to a more general class of nonlinear systems, as summarized below.</p><p>Theorem 5.3: Suppose the nonlinear control system (5.7) has (4.1) as its homogeneous approximation with the dilation (5.2) and .

However, a simple computation indicates that system (5.8) has a homogeneous approximation of the form (4.1). By Theorem 5.3, the local stabilization problem is solvable by nonsmooth output feedback. Indeed, the homogeneous approximation of (5.8) is (5.9) with the degree and dilation . Under this dilation, the remainders in (5.8) are actually highorder terms. In fact, By Theorem 4.1, system (5.9) is stabilized by a homogenous output feedback controller of the form (4.3)-(3.16), which is, in the present case, given by <ref type="bibr">(5.10)</ref> According to Theorem 5.3, the same controller also renders system (5.8) locally strongly stable.</p><p>The simulation shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> confirms the conclusion.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have developed a nonsmooth output feedback framework that leads to a number of new results on local and global stabilization of nonlinear systems by output feedback. The proposed output feedback control approach is nonsmooth in nature and couples effectively the tool of adding a power integrator <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> for the design of Hölder continuous state feedback controllers, and a novel recursive algorithm for the construction of nonsmooth nonlinear observers.</p><p>With the help of the new framework, we have identified appropriate conditions under which the problem of global stabilization is solvable by nonsmooth output feedback, for certain triangular systems that are not smoothly stabilizable, even locally, by any smooth state/output feedback (due to the presence of unobservable and uncontrollable unstable linearization). For a wider class of nonlinear systems beyond a triangular structure, such as systems in the -normal form or Hessenberg form <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>[5], we proved that without imposing any growth condition, local stabilization by nonsmooth output feedback is possible. This was done by means of the homogeneous systems theory. The proof was constructive and carried out by explicitly designing output feedback stabilizers for the associated homogeneous systems. The significance of our output feedback control schemes has been demonstrated by several examples whose local and global stabilization problems appear to be unsolvable by any existing method. where the constants and can be determined in a manner similar to (A.13).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
