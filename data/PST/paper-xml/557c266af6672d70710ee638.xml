<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Tracking mobile targets in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has many important applications. As it is often the case in prior work that the quality of tracking (QoT) heavily depends on high accuracy in localization or distance estimation, which is never perfect in practice. These bring a cumulative effect on tracking, e.g., target missing. Recovering from the effect and also frequent interactions between nodes and a central server result in a high energy consumption. We design a tracking scheme, named t-Tracking, aiming to achieve two major objectives: high QoT and high energy efficiency of the WSN. We propose a set of fully distributed tracking algorithms, which answer queries like whether a target remains in a "specific area" (called a "face" in localized geographic routing, defined in terms of radio connectivity and local interactions of nodes). When a target moves across a face, the nodes of the face that are close to its estimated movements compute the sequence of the target's movements and predict when the target moves to another face. The nodes answer queries from a mobile sink called the "tracker", which follows the target along with the sequence. t-Tracking has advantages over prior work as it reduces the dependency on requiring high accuracy in localization and the frequency of interactions. It also timely solves the target missing problem caused by node failures, obstacles, etc., making the tracking robust in a highly dynamic environment. We validate its effectiveness considering the objectives in extensive simulations and in a proof-of-concept system implementation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Methods of tracking mobile targets have been gaining more and more attention due to their importance in employing wireless sensor networks (WSN) for surveillance applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. For instance, the American border patrol operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> tested both sensor-mounted UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) and generic vehicle in conjunction with the existing static WSN (or so-called "virtual fence") along the American/Mexican borders. In a battlefield reconnaissance, fast tracking operation is required to detect an intrusion into restricted areas or to focus on evicting an enemy from an overseas territory (i.e., the border or harbor patrolling <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. This has a top security priority in many developed countries. In an investigation scenario, it may be used to watch a susceptible person, regarding his movements and activities, and to follow the person to obtain specific information. Another scenario is road patrolling that is carried out to inspect the roadways <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>In practical scenarios similar to the above, the movements of a target are relevant only to local areas and for a short period of time. Such a scenario requires fast tracking operation. An envisioned tracking scheme should offer high quality of tracking (QoT) in the scenario. If one wishes to cope with these requirements using prior work, we argue that there remains concerns to be addressed for energy-constrained WSNs.</p><p>Communication concerns. Sensors are deployed to sense and record the detection and localization of a target into the data logger, or to send to a central server (or a sink). In many prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, sensors are so often required to interact with the sink, and reply with queries about a target and with locations. Although the work comes up with many practical solutions, there still exists concerns to be addressed, e.g., frequent interactions between the nodes and the sink, delay due to congestion, a single point of failure, etc. More importantly, the network area is usually divided into regions, cells, grids, clusters, trees, etc., to track the target in a distributed manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Such division obviously incurs extra frequency of interactions and energy consumption.</p><p>Localization concerns. Prior work, in which tracking heavily relies on high accuracy of localization, may compromise between the QoT and the energy efficiency of WSNs. Because accuracy in localization or distance estimation is never perfect in practice. A WSN can achieve localization by interpreting metrics of the target information transmissions. Examples include the received signal strength indication (RSSI), time of arrival (TOA), time difference of arrival (TDOA), multi-path signature (MPS), or their combinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Although these metrics are often used, the QoT is affected when operating environments are dynamic. The localization Path already travelled in F 1 Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. An illustration of an intrusion into a restricted area, where an intruder may be pursued by an authority in order to observe its movements.</p><p>suffers from biases and large unbiased errors (caused by measurement noises).</p><p>Robustness concerns. Due to the localization inaccuracy, the events of target missing problem often occur, resulting in a significant energy consumption (e.g., to relocate the missing target). The situation becomes more serious in the case of a WSN that is too dense or sparse, or when there are node failures, coverage holes, obstacles, etc.</p><p>Motivated by the above scenarios and concerns, we design a tracking scheme, named t-Tracking. We enable sensors located in a local area near a target moving path to detect the target (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), and compute and store data locally; they can even reply with queries locally. Target tracking is made more efficient by exploiting a mobile sink. The sink can always be around the detecting sensors or a little distance away (single to multi-hop) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The main objectives are to ensure the QoT and enhance the energy efficiency of the WSN.</p><p>Our Scheme. An entity, e.g., a respective authority that intends to follow a target, is called a "tracker". This can also be called a "mobile sink" because it traverses through a WSN. A "target" can be any mobile entity such as an enemy vehicle or an intruder. The WSN is deployed in a plane, where the target moves in dynamic patterns. Through graph planarization, the WSN is organized into non-overlapping local areas (called "faces", as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), which is usually carried out in localized geographic routing (particularly, in face routing) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Each face, e.g., F 2 , comprising a number of nodes, corresponds to a local area of the WSN.</p><p>When the tracker intends to follow a target, it queries the WSN. The nodes are periodically clock synchronized to be in an awakening, active, or inactive state. When a node of a face receives a query request, it checks with its neighboring nodes whether or not it is the closest to the target; if yes, it is elected as a "monitor" and one of its neighbors is elected as a "backup". The monitor then works at the request of the tracker and sends information about the monitor itself, the backup, and the target, while the target traverses through the face. Target detection and localization is mainly performed by the cooperation between the monitor and the backup.</p><p>The tracker then moves toward the monitor and queries for an update. If the target is still within the face, the monitor keeps tracking the target; at the same time, the monitor elects the next possible monitor and backup to be the new monitor and backup by using our prediction method. If the target has already moved out of the area of the face, the monitor informs the tracker about the new monitor and backup. The tracker moves toward them. Monitor and backup are two common sensors of the current face and one of its adjacent faces. When the monitor finishes its task, it changes its state to the inactive state. This is also true for the backup. In this way, a special linked list of monitors, backups, and other nodes in a face is formed as time goes on.</p><p>Advantages. Some distinctive advantages of t-Tracking help enhance the energy-efficiency and QoT. (i) We take the challenge to reduce the dependency on requiring high accuracy in localization. (ii) By employing a prediction of the next face, the number of nodes and faces is minimized. (iii) The nodes in the faces, where there is no target, need not perform any interactions in tracking and can be inactive to save energy. (iv) If there is the event of target missing, we allow neighbors that are the closest to the monitor in the current face to cooperate. Even in this case, if the target is not sensed, we allow all the neighbors in the face to relocate the target. If the target is still not sensed, we allow all the neighbors outside of the face to relocate the target. Even when all the neighbors fail, t-Tracking reverts to the initial detection state.</p><p>Contributions. We make the following contributions.</p><p>• This work is the first of its kind that studies the problem of target tracking through the prediction of localized areas (faces). We design t-Tracking to address the problem, showing how to organize nodes into faces to track a mobile target. • We propose a set of tracking algorithms that are completely distributed in nature, where we put into practice two mobile nodes under the static WSN. • For a high QoT, we provide the "face prediction" by using a simplified kinematics-based prediction. The QoT is ensured even when the localization is not so accurate. We design a sensor state transition model to save energy in each time step of tracking. • We evaluate the performance of t-Tracking in extensive simulations and in a system setup with 20 Imote2 sensors. Results show that, t-Tracking increases the QoT by at least 60% and the energyefficiency of WSN by at least 5 times in comparison to prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the related work. Section 3 explains the problem setup and our objectives. Section 4 provides the tracking algorithms. Section 5 illustrates the tracking process and robustness. The design of t-Tracking and the performance analysis are detailed in Section 6. Evaluation through simulations and a proof-of-concept system is conducted in Section 7 and Section 8 respectively. Finally, Section 9 concludes this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Research in the field of WSNs has generated a large body of works that have addressed various aspects of the problem of target detection and tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Considering constraints (e.g., energy, bandwidth) and real-time requirements in WSNs, distributed tracking systems are attractive. Prior distributed schemes improve difficulties usually found in the centralized tracking schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, Real-time processing and collaboration between nodes, and reduced data transmission during tracking are attained by the methods of the use of clusters or trees. However, there are also distributed algorithms, where the tracking operation is not fairly distributed, requiring the central interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Beside the methods of clusters and trees, the WSN area is also partitioned into regions, cells, grids, etc., to track a target in a distributed manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. There are huge interactions (the number of times each sensor talks to its neighboring nodes and the sink) during tracking operation. Coordinating different instructions and collecting data from sensors in a hierarchical manner enables the sensors to interact with neighbors, the intermediate leaders, and the sink so often. Delay in target detection and tracking may be induced due to multi-hop communication and congestion in the WSN. All these result in a lot of energy consumption of the network. Moreover, sensor nodes near the sinks consume more energy and die first such that the tracking task may become critical and slow. When faults occur in tracking nodes, and connectivity/coverage holes or physical obstacles appear during tracking, mitigating them at once is more challenging. t-Tracking is a kind of scheme that is different from them, which organizes the nodes into non-overlapping areas (faces), achieved at the system initialization (not during the tracking). All the nodes over the WSN do not need to be further organized (unlike the dynamic clustering or grouping) before the target arrives to a specific face.</p><p>A lot of localization techniques exist, e.g., RSSI, ToA, TDoA, AoA, MPS, GPS, etc <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.The localization or distance measurements from the nodes to a target are not so accurate <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, due to various reasons in the practical sensing field. Xu et al. consider the joint problem of mobile sensor navigation and mobile target tracking based on an improved TOA measurement model (labeled as "iTOA") <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Based on the model, they propose a min-max approximation approach to estimate the location and prediction for tracking, which is shown to be efficient. In the situation that, the location or distance estimation has inaccuracy, the QoT and energy efficiency are affected in iTOA. Such inaccuracy may happen in every step of tracking.</p><p>He et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> a real-time target tracking framework, called "VigilNet". This is a large-scale outdoor WSN that tracks, detects, and classifies targets in a timely and efficient manner. Through experiments, VigilNet shows that it can meet real-time requirements and provides fast tracking, and its trade-offs are validated. On the basis of the deadline partition method and the use of theoretical derivations to assure each sub-deadline, they make guided and engineering decisions to meet the endto-end tracking deadline. However, it still requires the high accuracy in localization, the high update cost, and a large number of nodes in tracking.</p><p>The idea of organizing "face-shaped" local areas of the WSN is mainly used in routing techniques. Dynamic target tracking (DOT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> is the initial work that uses faces for tracking. There are shortcomings of DOT. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> It assumes that a target may move in any way, so in all the ways (faces) the sensors need to be active. This implies that it requires a large number of sensors in each step of tracking. (2) It incurs significant wakeup delay, resulting in a message delay, while it uses a large number of reports. (3) Although it uses faces, it highly relies on finding accurate location information of the nodes in faces that is not realistic in practice, requiring more energy consumption. There are difficulties in planarization when constructing faces in practice; DOT does not tackle them. We present the idea of target movement prediction to improve some of these shortcomings <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> Later, another research effort based on faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>,called "Forms", presents the use of a differential one-form and location service for target tracking and aggregate range queries. It nicely discusses tracking through faces in terms of queries, local updates, and maintenance cost under target movement. However, the proposed algorithms are mainly based on theoretical aspects, ignoring the communication and localization aspects in target tracking in WSNs. During each time of tracking step, a number of faces (that containing a large number of nodes in total) need to involve in tracking. Forms scheme may be suitable for a very large scale network (with more than thousands of nodes). It may not be suitable for a small to medium scale network. We found that if it is applied in a network with hundreds of nodes (that is deployed in rectangular field), most of the nodes need to involve in tracking operation. As a result, achieving energy efficiency of a energy-constrained network in a surveillance application can be difficult.</p><p>To get the full advantages from this face-based tracking, we consider target tracking using "face prediction," instead of "target location prediction in faces" presented in our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. We found that it is non-trivial to determine exactly at which face a target is currently moving and then at which face the target may move. It requires low update and query cost (low interactions between the nodes), and a lower time in tracking. It is also useful for a small to large scale WSN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PROBLEM SETUP AND OBJECTIVES</head><p>In this section, we setup the problem of tracking a mobile target through the prediction of local areas (faces) of WSN for surveillance applications. We first provide preliminaries, and then some models. Finally, we discuss the objectives. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Preliminaries</head><p>Suppose that a target is moving in a two dimensional planar space A. A WSN is deployed in the space that may cover the entire space, where the sensor nodes have identical R s (for convenience's sake, refer to TABLE <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for notational conventions). More specifically, A is covered if any point in A is covered by at least one node u.</p><p>Any sensor node u is capable of communicating with other nodes in its proximity. Any two nodes u and v can communicate directly as long as their separation is not larger than R c , where |(u, v)| is the Euclidean distance between u and v. This is obtained by a network that is modeled as a graph G by utilizing a wellknown, distributed planarization algorithm, namely, a relative neighborhood graph (RNG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. G = (V, E) is the communication graph of a set of nodes V , where each node is represented by a vertex in V , and edge</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(u, v) ∈ E if and only if |(u, v)| ≤ R c .</formula><p>We assume that |(u, v)| may vary in a practical environment. Because the radio signal strength of a sensor is highly dependent on the environment and can be irregular, due to various reasons, e.g., radio-opaque obstacles, transceiver differences, etc. In such a case, R c can be set to the minimum |(u, v)| and the boundary of its irregular communication region <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Similar to this, we tackle difficulties found in this planarized WSN model in Appendix A of the supplemental material. Exploration of Faces. By removing intersecting edges from G, we can obtain a connected planar subgraph G ′ = (V, E ′ ) that maintains connectivity with fewer edges in RNG. The equation form is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∀u, v ∈ V : (u, v) ∈ E ′ if f ∃w ∈ V : max{d(u, w), d(v, w)} &lt; d(u, v)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>In other words, planarization is equivalent to an edge removal process on G with connectivity preservation</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">F1 F2 F3 F4 F12 F11 F13 F9 F10 F18 F5 v 4 v 3 v 5 v6 v 7 v 8 v 10 v 11 v 12 v 13 v 14 v 15 v 2 v 1 v 20 v 23 v 24 v 9</formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. A planarized network showing nodes and faces in the planar space.</p><p>[34]. Such a graph without having links crossing each other can be achieved by using some cross-link detection and removal techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows an example of a planarized WSN. It shows planar faces (with reference to Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), in a planar neighborhood graph, pointing to communication lines between any two nodes, indicating connectivity between them. Black and gray shaded nodes indicate the tracking nodes in active state s 0 .</p><p>The following terms and assumptions are in effect regarding in the system model in t-Tracking:</p><p>• The "tracker", T , is assumed to be a single generic source such as a mobile user (e.g., a military personnel in a battle field), an investigator (can be in a vehicle or petrol car), etc., who is interested in obtaining information about a target. The "target", t, is a signal emitter, which is observed by the WSN. • The "interest" is a query about t. The query is implemented as one or more specific interests, e.g., requesting specific sensor node(s) (e.g., monitor and backup) to report a specific measurement.</p><p>• Each node has a limited energy budget for sensing, computing, and transmitting. But, in an irregular case, e.g., inaccuracy in neighbors' location information, the presence of obstacle, or a region with high network density, the nodes are assumed to be able to adjust R c by choosing an upper power level. • Upon detection, failed/disabled nodes are avoided.</p><p>The system avoids the loss of one or more nodes and to keep functioning as reliable as possible. • A "close range" denotes the point in tracking when T reaches the proximity of l s i (normally the monitor location) and d(l s i , l i ) is less than a predefined range. In a real scenario, when T follows t, T may reach t within very close range (d(l s i , l i ) ≤ ε). ε is the predefined range, e.g., ε ≤ |Rs| 2 or |Rs| 4 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Models</head><p>How to identify the target in the sensing coverage through faces is discussed here. We use a simple sensing model. Each node of the WSNs should find out t's location inside a face in A, velocity, and direction. Suppose</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">that l i ∈ A is the location of the target at time h ∈ [0, H].</formula><p>If there is t within R s of a sensor node, the node senses the presence of t. It records the signal strength as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">S i =    0, if r+r e ≤ d(s i ,l i ) e -λa β + w i , if r e &gt; |r -d(s i ,l i )| w i , if r -r e ≥ d(s i ,l i )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Here, r is a measure of t's detection and r e is a measure of the uncertainty in t's detection, a = d(l s i , l i ) -(r -r e ), r e &lt; r; λ and β are parameters that measure the detection when t is at a distance greater than r e but is within a distance from the node. We normalize S i , such that w i has the standard Gaussian noise distribution. That is, w i ∼ (µ, σ 2 ), where µ and σ 2 are the mean and variance of w i respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Based on (2), ith sensor v i located at l s i is able to detect t whenever ||l s i -l i || ≤ R s . This detection may be unreliable, in the sense that failing to detect t does not imply that ||l s i -l i || ≥ R s .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Objectives</head><p>To measure the performance of t-Tracking, two of the important metrics are as follows:</p><p>1. Ensuring the Quality of Tracking (QoT). As the issue of the quality of service (QoS), the QoT is measured by the rate of successful tracking steps (rSTS) in a system with robustness against all difficulties, including the presence of high localization errors, sensor faults, physical obstacles, etc. We think that these difficulties remain to some degrees in the real operating environment.</p><p>2. Increasing the energy efficiency of the WSN. This is measured by the total amount of energy saving denoted by ∆E. We seriously take into account the energy consumed by sensor nodes in every time step of tracking and sensor node duty cycle. We then estimate the total amount of energy saving during tracking. That is to mention, ∆E is attained by two-phase energy saving: (i) E s k -the amount of energy saving by each sensor low-power state transition (s k = s 0 , s 1 , and s 2 ); (ii) E tr -the amount of energy saving attained during each period of tracking (including detection, localization, and prediction) by reducing the frequency of interactions between nodes and between the nodes and T .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">TRACKING ALGORITHMS</head><p>In this section, we first show how we organize the nodes of a planarized WSN into faces for the purpose of tracking. Then, we present algorithms for the computation of target moving sequence through faces. Finally, we discuss algorithms about the face prediction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Rules for Node Organization into Faces</head><p>The planar subgraph consists of faces that are enclosed and bounded, in face-shaped regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, as described earlier. Each subgraph may have one or more faces. Exploration of a single face by any node v i (such as the monitor) can be done in a localized way by applying the well-known "left-hand rule" that requires the message to traverse the edge. The "right-hand rule", in contrast, requires the message to travel the edge lying next in clockwise direction.</p><p>By utilizing the concept of faces as "local areas" from localized geographic routing techniques, we consider Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> as a representative example for the purpose of tracking in t-Tracking. As T wishes, it issues a message to the WSN to assist to track t. Suppose that v i is any node of the WSN that can detect t as t appears in the vicinity of v i , e.g., v 1 . Based on a detection probability (P d ), v 1 becomes the monitor. Then, v 1 starts finding face F i on which t appears. According to the WSN planarization at the system initialization, ith node v i already has the information about its neighboring nodes and faces. From there, v 1 further updates the information about faces. It corresponds to three adjacent faces, namely, F 1 , F 2 , and F 18 , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. F 1 and F 18 are called "neighboring faces." The nodes in the three adjacent faces in Therefore, the monitor and backup (v 1 and v 2 ) are the active nodes of F 2 for a period of tracking and some of the distant neighbors may already detect t. The computation of t's moving sequence and tracking is mainly performed by the two nodes. They connect T . The distant neighbors can assist the monitor in tracking if needed, e.g., in the case of t ′ s missing. The number of nodes in F 2 is five. The number of nodes in F 1 is four. In normal tracking, if t moves from F 1 to F 2 , the number of nodes needs to involve in tracking is four to five respectively. The two active nodes (monitor and backup) whose frequency of interactions can be higher than that of other nodes. Among them, the monitor usually has more interactions than the backup node. Thus, the number of total nodes required in a period is minimized. Similarly, node v 5 has five adjacent faces with eleven neighbors. If we considered all of the faces and nodes that correspond to a node, e.g., v 5 , the frequency of interactions in the WSN would be high, resulting in a high energy consumption.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">G ′ are -(v 1 , v 3 , v 4 , v 5 ), (v 1 , v 5 , v 6 , v 7 , v 2 ), and (v 1 , v 2 , v 3 ). v 1 has only three direct neighboring nodes v 2 , v 3 ,</formula><p>The above rules are extracted from the localized ge- ographic routing techniques, by which all static nodes have locally accessible information about their neighbors without the use of exact locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.

The main difference is that, we do not consider the packet transmission from a node of a face to a destination node of another face (which is usually a long distance away). This implies that a packet does not travel several faces on the way to the destination node. We restrict it to a face (e.g., F 2 where t is moving) and neighboring faces only. This specifies that the nodes of faces around t are only organized. There is no need to have exact localization in tracking via faces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Target Detection Inside a Face</head><p>In this subsection, we simply discuss the target detection procedure in t-Tracking. Each node is enabled to independently detect and process t's information locally, and collaborate with its neighbors in faces if t happens within its R s . Hence, t may be potentially detected by any node within their R s , i.e., any node, which belongs to one or more faces of the WSN, can detect t.</p><p>Each node estimates a detection probability P d , which is "the probability that a node reports the presence of t when t is within its R s ." It is estimated for the slow t to the fast t. The face strategy helps us to find t's moving, since the monitor and backup share a part or the whole area of the face where the t is moving. Suppose that t enters the tracking area from point 0 to L meters. The area can be rectangular or semi-circular. Thus, the detection probability is stated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P d = D c + πrL (2L + πr/2) • v • T p (4)</formula><p>In the case of t-Tracking, we therefore need to guarantee that t is detected before it leaves the monitor's sensing range. We take L = R. Hence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P d = D c + πrR (2R + πr/2) • v • T p (5)</formula><p>More details about the derivation of both slow and fast mobile target detection can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Algorithm 1 gives the pseudocode of t's detection by using <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> and localize it at location l i based on P d at the first time. Once t is localized, the face detection algorithm begins.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Target's Moving Face Detection</head><p>In this subsection, we discuss how each node (that already detected t) makes a decision on t: in which specific face t is currently moving and then localize t inside the face for the first time face detection. We present Algorithm 2 for this purpose. In Algorithm 2, there are several small steps in the target moving face detection that are described as follows.</p><p>Step 1. Node v i , e.g., v 1 , detects t by using P d at time instant h somewhere in the WSN. Similarly, some neighboring nodes, e.g., v 5 , v 3 , v 4 , v 6 , and so on, of v 1 might be able to detect t at h and have P d to some extents.</p><p>Step 2. v 1 first interacts with its adjacent neighbors by issuing a request, containing the information that t is in the range. The information includes P d and d(l s i , l i ). There are three adjacent neighbors of v 1 : v 5 , v 2 , and v 3 .</p><p>Step 3. After receiving the request messages from all of its neighbors (including the adjacent ones), node v i compares its P d with another node v j that are paired up with it, e.g.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">v 1 ↔ v 2 , v 1 ↔ v 3 , v 1 ↔ v 5 .</formula><p>Step 4. Among all the neighbors, v 5 or v 2 has the second best detection probability that are the immediate neighbors. v 3 may have the lower detection probability than that of v 5 or v 2 . Thus, t should be inside F 2 , instead of in F 18 or in F 11 . To know the pair of the nodes, which have the best detection probability, we consider a "combine detection probability (P c d )" of each pair. If one wishes, angle between two or three adjacent neighbors can be estimated to decide in which face t is in. Finally, we set three conditions for any pair of nodes such as v 1 and v 5 to be the monitor and backup: (i) P c d should be higher than other pairs of nodes; (ii) they should be the adjacent and also be the immediate neighbors; (iii) they should be in the same face F i , e.g., F 2 .</p><p>Step 5. As the monitor and backup, v 1 and v 5 update the information of F 2 and neighboring faces by following the rules described earlier. Then, the complete face F i is detected and nodes of the faces are organized to track t.</p><p>Note that the above steps are used for face F i detection at the first time. t's tracking can be easier in the WSN afterward, as another two nodes of F 2 (e.g., v 1 and v 5 ) compute t's movements and face prediction when t moves from F i to F j .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Computing t's Moving Sequence Inside a Face</head><p>In practice, t may move in complex and stochastic ways in any direction from face F i to a future face F j , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>(a). t's velocity is unpredictable and it may be impossible to explicitly express the velocity. When t moves inside F i and moves toward F j , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>(b), we enable the monitor and backup to compute the moving sequence based on possible locations of t, according to its current motion states and tracks.

Algorithm 3 shows the steps to compute t's moving sequence based the above information (t's displacement D t at a moving pattern and the estimation of a set of locations, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3(b)</ref>). Based on t's movement sequence, we need to compute "face prediction", i.e., t's moving from one face F i to another face F j .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Face Prediction</head><p>In this subsection, we discuss the final stage of tracking, i.e., we observe t's moving from a current face F i to a future face F j , and propose Algorithm 4 for the prediction of face F j . Through Algorithm 3, each monitor and backup can continue tracking t in its state s 0 and compute the moving sequence of t within R s .  They predicts t's moving toward the neighbors so that the neighbors can be further aware of t's moving from F 2 to F 3 . Two of the neighbors such as e.g., v 6 and v 7 become the new monitor and backup. They are the two common nodes between F 2 and F 3 . The monitor and backup use almost the same direction used in Algorithm 3 to calculate p. In the calculation of p, we consider the edge between the monitor and backup to be mapped over the x-axis in the 2D field, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4(b)</ref>. The direction arrow from node v 1 to node v 6 indicates t's possible moving in the direction. θ p specifies the direction, θ p ∈ (-π, π]. θ p = 0 is the instant direction at the current time. d(θ p ) and p(θ p ) are the radii from the monitor to the neighboring nodes in the face at direction θ p and at the directional probability respectively. p decreases linearly and reaches the minimum value at the direction of d(θ p = π), and α = x i+1 θ p + y i+1 α * = -x i+1 θ p + y i+1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> The following equation is used to get the value of p:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">p = { α, θ p ∈ (-π, 0] α * , θ p ∈ (0, π]<label>(12)</label></formula><p>After computing p, the current monitor issues the alert message on the direction with the monitor election information. As t leaves the monitor's sensing area, the monitor finally alerts the new monitor by handing over t's information in a message form. An example of sending an alert message in a possible direction can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4(c</ref>). Once the new monitor receives the alert, some nodes of F i such as F 2 also reorganize themselves into predicted face F j (e.g., F 3 ), by following the node organization rules. Upon receiving the alert, a timer h out (will be described further) is started to meet in real time with two purposes: (i) to specify the timeout period in which a new monitor waits to track t when t moves across between itself and the backup; (ii) to prevent situations of any irregular event happening or any wrong local information in face F 3 and in the neighboring faces before t's moving to F 3 . The pseudocode of this face prediction is presented in Algorithm 4.</p></div>

Once the WSN is deployed, the planarization is performed at the initialization. As T wishes, it sends a flooding request into the WSN at time h, requesting t' information. Since t is detected inside F 1 , T is informed of t's current location, and the closest node is v 4 (see Fig. <ref type="figure">5(a)</ref>). v 4 becomes the monitor by using P d and detects F 1 . In F 1 , v 4 has 3 neighboring nodes that are v 5 , v 1 , and v 3 ; its immediate neighbors are v 5 and v 3 . When T needs information about t, T sends a query to the monitor. For reliable queries and replies, T uses Algorithm 5, which gives a snapshot of how T and monitor interact with each other. If t moves in the direction of v 3 , v 4 is able to easily determine it.

Since T arrives at the vicinity of v 4 after t has moved away, v 4 informs T . This means that v 4 will transfer the information to T to follow the same route, i.e., to go to v 1 (in the proximity of t's current location).</p><p>The monitor interacts with T to transfer t ′ s information to reach a "close range". Algorithm 6 provides the pseudocode of the interactions between the monitor and T for t's tracking. When t moves from F 1 to F 2 along the route indicated in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>(b), at time h + 1, only the monitor v 1 or both monitor v 1 and backup v 5 are already aware of t's route. Notice that when a monitor indicates the predicted location and direction of t where T will be after given h, it determines which node will most-likely be the new monitor that t is approaching. It also elects an immediate neighbor of the new monitor as backup and informs them in advance about incoming t. v 1 is already in s 0 and detects t as it moves from F 1 to F 2 . v 1 receives the message from v 4 and forwards it in F 2 . It then checks itself to confirm if it is the new monitor. As a monitor, v 1 senses and observes t in F 2 . Meanwhile, T reaches the proximity of v 1 's locations and requests t's status (see <ref type="bibr">Algorithm 6)</ref>. Monitor v 1 works in the same way and elects a new monitor v 6 and a new backup v 7 by comparing with t's future movements at time h + 2.

As t comes across the monitor's area, the monitor constructs a linked list automatically and connects all the neighbors in the face.</p><p>If there is a node failure such as v 7 , the neighboring nodes perform a local maintenance (by merging two or more faces into one) around the failed node. In such a maintenance, the size of new face such as F 10 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>(b) become large. Thus, t can be detected inside the face. Similar solution is applied to if there is a permanent link failure due to an obstacle and hole in the WSNs, or other reasons. The monitor finds the optimal cycle (i.e., redundant link) to its neighbors. If the monitor can find one or more cycles, the current face is divided and merged with another faces (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6(b)</ref>). More details about such local maintenance on faces can be found in our earlier work <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Note that we do not insert any nodes inside a face unlike the work Forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. We think that node insertion into a face during tracking operation is not suitable and is time-and energy-consuming.</p><p>If there is an obstacle (either a concave or convex), the face may not be divided. Because if message transmission is impaired by a physical obstacle, the monitor alerts all of its face neighbors to be active and to detect t. During a discrete time instant, if t is not detected yet, the nodes in the neighboring faces become active and detect t. The link construction algorithm (see <ref type="bibr">Algorithm 7)</ref> runs between the monitor and the face neighbors.</p><p>To discuss detection failure, suppose that v 6 is currently elected as the new monitor, and v 7 is the backup; if t is not in R s of v 6 , v 6 may fail to detect t. However, in t-Tracking, we consider that if v 6 fails to detect t, v 7 cooperates in tracking t. If v 7 also fails due to the fact that t may change direction or because of other failures, v 7 and v 6 send a detection failure message to v 1 . Old monitor v 1 then sends a message to all of its neighbors in the face that tells them to cooperate in tracking t. These neighbors v 5 , v 6 , v 7 , and v 2 , except itself in F 2 .</p><p>In this case, v 1 is required to wait for a new monitor. If monitor v 1 gets a message about the presence of T , In the performance evaluation of t-Tracking, we found that this mechanism to detect t further by nodes in the neighboring faces is required for a very few times, specifically, two times in 50 simulation runs. Additionally, if t unfortunately stays in a hole region or t is not detected at all (due to an unknown reason), T gets a message about t missing. It means that T cannot get any information about the next destination. Then, if it can hear the nodes and receives a request after a predefined time instant, it relocates t. When t leaves the hole, t can be further detected in a face (outside the hole), and T can obtain its location. We found "no relocation" request to the WSN by T in the 50 simulation runs.</p><p>More concerns with the tracking algorithms, tracking robustness, and the cost of fault tolerance can be found in Appendix C, Appendix E, and Appendix F respectively. planarization is carried out after its deployment. Once the WSN starts tracking operation, t's detection element commences. Once t is detected by some nodes at the beginning through the "target detection" algorithm element, all of the nodes in the vicinity organized into faces via "face detection" algorithm element. Two of the nodes become the monitor and backup. Then, the main tracking operation starts. In the tracking, the computation of "target moving sequence" and "face prediction" elements are carried out until t is in the "close range". The design core element coordinates the tracking operations, including communication tasks, data recording and buffering, timing, synchronization, etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">State Transition Techniques and Energy Saving</head><p>We present state transition techniques for sensor nodes and make it suitable for tracking through faces. A node has three different states of operation: (i) active (s k=0 )when a node participates in tracking and interact with others; (ii) awakening (s k=1 )-when a node awakes for a short period of time, and listen and senses the environment; (iii) inactive (s k=2 )-when a node is in a sleeping state. Utilizing this technique, we calculate the amount of energy saved (E s k ) by the state transition during tracking. We also calculate the energy consumption considering all aspects in tracking, including communication, localization, listening, and idleness. Let E tr be the amount of energy saved from all of the aspects during tracking. Hence, the total energy saved in tracking is ∆E = E s k + E tr (a detailed description of the state transition model and the analysis of the energy consumption and saving can be found in Appendix D).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">PERFORMANCE EVALUATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Methods and Parameters</head><p>In this section, we evaluate the performance of t-Tracking through extensive simulations and provide more insight into the tracking issues from simulation perspectives. We implement it on the OM-Net++ simulation environment using the Castalia simulator (http://castalia.npc.nicta.com.au/index.php). We also utilize the extension of OMNet++: the Mobility Framework (MF). We set up a basic network of 350m x 350m, where 300 nodes are randomly deployed. The nodes communicate with each other by broadcasting messages across channels. These are assumed to be symmetric. We set R c ≥ 2R s , which is to ensure that two nodes with an overlapping sensing area are capable of communicating directly with each other.</p><p>In the simulation, we adopt several system-wide parameters that directly affect the real-time properties in tracking t. The monitor, backup, and all the nodes follow the time synchronization with respect to each other. We set a millisecond-level synchronization to coordinate the operations among the nodes. To compute different types of delays, the nodes synchronize with T within 1-5 milliseconds using the techniques presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>We adopt a number of parameters and values to see the performance of t-Tracking, which are similar to parameters in the real settings of VigilNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>The vital parameters used in simulations are listed as follows: i) v t is from 0.5 m/s to 10 m/s, while v T varies between 2 m/s, 6 m/s, 8 m/s, 10 m/s, and 12 m/s; ii) the physical delay in target detection; iii) the monitor node duty cycle (50%); iv) the inactive duty cycle (0.5%); v) the awakening duty cycle (5%); vi) the required degree of aggregation (1%); vii) R s = 20m (approx.); viii) R c ≥ 40m; ix) the required number of reports for tracker O(1); xi) ρ = (1 ∼ 2.5)/400m 2 ; xi) ϵ = 5m. We model each sensor with six discrete power levels in the interval {-10dBm, 0dBm}, as the power settings of Imote2 sensor platform is tuned within the IEEE 802.15.4. In most of the simulation configurations, we repeat the simulation for 200 times for high confidence and calculate the average as the final result.</p><p>Metrics. We focus on the two main metrics to evaluate the system performance. (i) The quality of tracking [QoT]: suppose that t is moving in a sequence corresponding to e events (detection, localization, etc.) of the sensors' duty cycles (D c ). The rSTS (rate of successful tracking steps) divided by e is the QoT, which reflects the accuracy of tracking performance. The QoT can show how successful a system is against all the difficulties, such as the presence of high localization errors, low detection probability, sensor faults, physical obstacles, etc. (ii) The energy efficiency [∆E]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">∆E = E s k + E tr .</formula><p>Comparison.</p><p>A high level comparison between t-Tracking and three prior prominent schemes (namely, Forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, VigilNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and iTOA <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>) are performed by simulations. The choice of VigilNet is due to the similarity of its concepts of real-time design, its fast target tracking, and its sensor duty cycle. In addition, it has a real implementation through a physical testbed with 200 XSM motes. Another choice is its system properties, such as energy consumption, accuracy (in terms of various types of delay measurements), and the use of sentry nodes (like the monitor in our work) in tracking. The choice of Forms, is that the use of the idea of planarization and faces in tracking. The choice of iTOA is that, the use of a prediction method and a mobile sink navigation, and a localization method through TOA for tracking. To support the key results, further result analysis can be found in Appendix G.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Simulation Results</head><p>We begin by observing the performance of t-Tracking in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref> in terms of QoT. We analyze rSTS based on the overall simulation results, considering the mentioned underlying difficulties. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref>(a) shows that the QoT varies according to v t . We observe that when n is very small or large (sparse or dense), the QoT is slightly lower than when n is medium (3 ≤ n ≤ 6). The QoT is fairly close to the maximum (0.8) in t-Tracking when n ≥ 4, v t is (8 ∼ 10) m/s, and v T is (6 ∼ 8) m/s. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref>(b) depicts that the QoT in different schemes. n and S max in both Forms and iTOA are at least 3. When n = 4, QoT is around 0.55 in iTOA, 0.57 in VigilNet, 0.68 in Forms, while it is 0.75 in t-Tracking. The QoT is close to 0.8 when n = 18 in Forms, n = 12 in VigilNet, n = 10 in iTOA, and n = 7 in t-Tracking. This reveals that t-Tracking achieves higher QoT than prior schemes, which is about 42% higher than VigilNet, 35% higher than iTOA, and 27% higher than Forms. Both VigilNet and iTOA performs worse than t-Tracking and Forms, as VigilNet and iTOA heavily rely on high localization accuracy. Once there is an event of target missing caused by a large localization error or by a node failure, discovering and localizing t further is difficult. Besides reducing the dependency on localization similar to Form, t-Tracking applies t's different movement patterns and face prediction in real-time. This is why, its QoT performance is much better than that of others.</p><p>Next, we report the energy consumption (E) of the WSN after t is in the "close range", as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref>(a). In the simulations, we observe t's moving with a changing speed. We change v t from 2 m/s to 10 m/s. We can see that when v t is between 6 m/s and 10 m/s, the reduction in energy consumption of the WSN is drastic in t-Tracking, while it is gradual in iTOA and typical in both VigilNet and Forms. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref>(a) reveals that Forms consumes more energy than VigilNet and iTOA. Forms uses a large number of nodes in each tracking step. More precisely, n is 18 to 35 and S max is 13 to 19 (on average) in Forms, while n is 11 to 15 and S max is 7 to 10 in VigilNet, and n is 10 to 14 and S max is 6 to 10 in iTOA. Although delays are handled comprehensively in VigilNet, the tracking still consumes a lot of energy. Many nodes, including sentry nodes, are used. The final decision about t's detection needs a large amount of communication (including additional interaction between the nodes and the sink). Overall, VigilNet and iTOA take robustness actions in a repetitive manner to further discover t, once there is a large amount of localization errors or the events of target missing. When v T increases, the average energy consumption decreases in VigilNet and iTOA, but the events of target missing increase.</p><p>In contrast, n is 5 to 10 and S max is 2 to 6 in t-Tracking. In most steps of tracking (about more than 70%) in all the simulation runs, S max = 2 to 4. Unfortunately, if t is not in R s of the monitor and backup, it queries all of the neighbors in a face or in neighboring faces. In such a cases, S max increases. More importantly, the monitor and backup are only used to interact with T in tracking t. Thus, fewer nodes, less local interactions between nodes, and low tracking time help in reducing a significant amount of energy consumption. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref>(b) depicts the energy efficiency (∆E = E s,k + R tr ) as time goes on in each simulation in t-Tracking. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref>(c) depicts the energy saving vs. the number of nodes in all the schemes respectively. In both figures, the energy saving is averaged by the data gathered from 200 uninterrupted simulations with different parameters. ∆E is significantly high in t-Tracking. Specifically, this is more than five times improvement on the energy saving, compared to the energy saving of other schemes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">PROOF-OF-CONCEPT SYSTEM EVALUATION</head><p>To verify the effectiveness of t-Tracking, we implemented the system using the Intel Imote2 sensor that runs TinyOS 2.0.1. The system is deployed in the field of our campus stadium to track an experimental vehicle. It contains 20 Imote2 sensors. For the sake of simplicity, we marked the mote locations during the deployment to get the tracker expected moving direction. A programmable remote control car equipped with a speaker (as a sound source) was employed as target t in the field. t was moved in dynamic patterns. Another programmable remote control car (relatively larger in size than t) is employed as tracker T . We place an Imote2 as the sink node and a laptop on the car. The Imote2 is connected to the laptop via a USB port and stores the collected data from the WSN, while the tracker car carries them. Based on the received t's moving patterns and the directions from a tracking node (a monitor or a backup) toward another nodes of a face, the tracker car is controlled to move toward the specific node locations. It is moved in a straight, left and right patterns to follow the target. There are some tracking delays occurred by manually controlling the tracker's movement (controlling errors), during the upload and download time, delay in processing at the laptop. We configure v t = (0.5 ∼ 3.5) m/s, v T = (0 ∼ 3.5) m/s, R s = 8m, R c ≥ 16m. ϵ = 2m. We repeated the experiments for a total of 20 rounds. We analyze the experimental results gathered from all of the rounds. Further detail of the system setup, target traces, and trace results can be found in Appendix H. Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref> demonstrates the QoT vs. n. We observe that as n increases, the QoT increases. In many cases, the QoT is more than 0.6 when S max (≤ n) is 2 and 3 in t-Tracking, while it is 3 to 6 in iTOA and 3 to 14 in Forms. t-Tracking outperforms these schemes, by achieving a higher QoT (more than 60%) than them.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref>, we report the performance on the energy consumption (E) of the experimental WSN, obtained after the time point that t is in the "close range". We see that when v t is between 1.5 m/s and 3 m/s, the reduction in E is drastic in t-Tracking, while it is gradual in Forms and in iTOA. Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref> reveals that t-Tracking may consume low energy during t's tracking in practice. This is because fewer sensors and less local interactions between sensors are used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper, we have proposed a new tracking scheme in WSNs, t-Tracking. Our ideas such as (i) fast tracking operation through face detection and prediction, (ii) reducing the interactions between a mobile tracker and monitor/backup, (iii) reducing the dependency on the need of strict localization accuracy in tracking, can all be useful to many surveillance applications. We used "face prediction" instead of "target location prediction", which mitigates the effects of localization inaccuracies, node failures, and obstacles on tracking. Evaluation results obtained through extensive simulations and a real system showed that the proposed scheme can highly contribute to the quality of tracking and energy efficiency in comparison to the recent prominent schemes.</p><p>In the future endeavors, we aim to further work in two aspects. One aspect is to investigate more practical issues in using the concept of faces as localized areas for tracking, especially in the case of a target localization by two nodes. Another aspect is to verify the proposed scheme in different tracking situations. For instance, intruders such as people are moving toward the fence (or border) of a surveillance region and are taking different directions. In this instance, it can be interesting to consider the edge crossing between the monitor and backup as the border crossing of the surveillance region.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>e.g., F 2 )</figDesc></figure>
