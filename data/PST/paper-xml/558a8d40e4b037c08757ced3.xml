<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>E CHOCARDIOGRAPHY has several advantages over other medical imaging techniques. It is noninvasive, it does not produce ionizing radiation, and it is relatively nonexpensive and fairly simple to use. For this reason it is widely used in cardiology as well as other medical applications. The problem of automatic identification of the boundary of the heart ventricles from echocardiographic images has received considerable attention in the literature aiming to provide computational and display tools for the diagnosis of heart disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In particular, the analysis of the shape of the left ventricle (LV) is useful for the detection of coronary artery disease and for the evaluation of acute myocardial infraction.</p><p>Several approaches for detecting the epicardial or endocardial boundary of the left ventricle have been presented <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, reporting partial success. The complex three-dimensional (3-D) deformation that occurs during the contraction and relaxation of the LV has forced investigators to make major simplifying assumptions to interpret LV motion. Such assumptions, however, may not be valid in abnormal ventricles or if the observation point changes, i.e., for a different orientation of the probing device. In many cases, user interaction is required to provide some prior knowledge, e.g., to specify the center of the cavity. Also, many algorithms suffer from poor definition of chamber edges, due to limited spatial resolution, and do not impose coherence between the boundaries detected in subsequent frames. The signal dependent speckle noise that is common in B-mode ultrasound images decreases the success of the boundary detection algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Research in LV boundary detection has been also inspired by parallel research for the analysis of nonrigid motion in other applications. In order to accurately describe nonrigid deformations, physics-based models have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> which simulate the shape and dynamic behavior of physical objects. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> the physics-based paradigm was developed, with active contours, simulating an elastic material deformed by forces corresponding to image-intensity gradients. The finite-element approach was used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> to analytically describe object shape and deformation. All of the above algorithms are used to detect and track image features such as intensity edge boundaries, but they are unable to provide a so-called canonical representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, i.e., an analytic description of the deformation at each object point. Another shortcoming of physics-based modeling is that the models produced are coarse, and prior assumptions about the model parameters are needed. A canonical representation is obtained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> where nonrigid motion modeling is performed via finite-elements analysis, by extracting the deformation modes of the object. These constitute a frequency-ordered orthonormal basis of the object's deformation space. By discarding the high frequency modes, a global modeling of shape deformation is achieved.</p><p>Active-contour models (snakes) were introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> as a method transcending the traditional reliance on low-level image features like pixel intensities. A polygonal is used to model an edge in the image. Two energy functionals are defined. The internal energy imposes continuity and smoothness constraints, and the external energy attracts the snake to salient image features. The use of snakes turns boundary extraction into an energy minimization problem. Several advances of the original ideas have been reported, including the smart snakes or active shape models in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. However, all these methods are static and do not exploit temporal coherence, and for this reason they appear to be, by themselves, inadequate for the description of the complex dynamics of heart motion. Furthermore, the methods in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> have the disadvantage of requiring laborious manual 0278-0062/99$10.00 Â© 1999 IEEE placement of a set of landmark points for each image of the sequence.</p><p>In this paper a temporal learning-filtering procedure is applied to refine the boundary detected by an active-contour model. Instead of making prior assumptions about the LV shape or its motion, this information is incrementally gathered directly from the images and is exploited to achieve more coherent segmentation. Specifically, a Hough transform technique is used to find an initial approximation of the object boundary at the first frame of the sequence. Then, an active-contour model is used in a coarse-to-fine framework for the estimation of a noisy LV boundary. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to form a reduced-order orthonormal basis of the LV deformations, based on a sequence of noisy boundary observations. Then, this basis is used to constrain the motion of the active contour in subsequent frames, and thus provide more coherent identification. Finally, results of epicardial boundary identification in B-mode images are presented.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: In Section II an algorithm to find an initial estimate of the LV boundary is described. The active-contour approach, used to refine the initial estimate, is presented in Section III, and two algorithms for tracking the boundary over a sequence of images are described in Section IV. In Section V, we present results of the proposed techniques and, finally, conclusions are drawn and suggestions for further work are offered in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. INITIAL BOUNDARY ESTIMATION</head><p>An initial estimate of the left ventricle boundary is found by approximating its shape with an ellipse. The center of the ellipse, the sizes of the axes of the ellipse, and the rotation angle are estimated using intensity information by applying a generalized Hough transform <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Direct application of the Hough transform algorithm for the detection of ellipse parameters requires a search in a five-dimensional space, which is computationally prohibitive. An alternative approach, exploiting the image gradient information, was used instead, so as to restrict search to a 3-D space.</p><p>An ellipse in polar coordinates is described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(1)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where are the lengths of the ellipse axes, is the rotation angle, and is the center if the ellipse. Taking derivatives with respect to we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(3) (4)</formula><p>where have been eliminated. Thus, by using the gradient direction of each intensity edge point along with (3) and ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) the parameters are estimated. More specifically, the 3-D space defined by the parameters is discretized as finely as necessary to portray the unknown parameters with accuracy. Every point in this discrete space , corresponding to a combination of unknown parameters, will be assigned a value An intensity edge point on the image votes for a specific set of parameters according to the following Hough algorithm: for all edge points for all solve using (3), ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">if then</formula><p>where is the gradient of the intensity image calculated using a Sobel mask, and is a threshold. The set of parameters maximizing defines the ellipse that optimally matches the intensity edges in the image. These are subsequently used in ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">2</ref>) to estimate using a twodimensional (2-D) Hough transform performed in the space of unknown parameters for all edge points solve (1), (2) for An example of the result of this procedure to two frames of an ultrasound image sequence is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>After ellipse detection, points placed uniformly along the estimated ellipse boundary are selected and are used to initialize an active-contour model for further refinement of the boundary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. BOUNDARY DETECTION USING AN ACTIVE CONTOUR</head><p>Active contours (snakes), were originally proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to provide a regularization step in edge-detection algorithms. A snake is an ordered set of points on the image grid, positioned so as to minimize the snake energy functional <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> where the external energy attracts the snake to salient image features, while the internal energy emphasizes regularization by favoring curve smoothness. The external energy is chosen as follows: <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> where is the intensity gradient at calculated using a Sobel mask and is a unit vector normal to the snake at <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The internal energy is given by ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) Since echo images contain speckle noise, which leads to erroneous gradient estimation, a despeckling procedure is applied prior to image gradient computation. A signal-adaptive filter proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> is given by where is the noisy observation at pixel is the signal-adaptive filter output, and is the maximum-likelihood estimate of the original signal , based on local observations of in a window surrounding . As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, assuming a Rayleigh distribution for and the value of that locally minimizes inside is given by We start filtering by using, initially, a window of size 5 5. If the factor exceeds an appropriate threshold , the window size is decreased until the factor assumes a value lower than the threshold or until the window reaches the size 3 3. Otherwise, the window size is increased to its maximum size ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>7). The estimation of the snake points which minimize is based on the dynamic programming algorithm proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. We search for the location of points on the image grid only along the direction of the normal vector (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), since the optical flow component perpendicular to the edge gradient is not observable <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. More specifically, the energy functional is written in the form (8) where and for a closed contour. Then the solution is obtained recursively by and using backward substitution to yield</p><p>The above procedure is iteratively applied to yield where each is the minimum energy solution obtained by searching in the neighborhood of . The algorithm terminates when the energy can not be further reduced.</p><p>A coarse-to-fine scheme was used to reduce the computational complexity and avoid the entrapment to local minima Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Estimated eigen-modes. The dotted curve shows the mean shape V V V while the solidly drawn curve is V V V + U i ; i = 1;2;3; with U i the ith eigenvector and a = 50: often caused by noise in the data. We start with a coarse polygon to find an initial estimate of the curve boundary. Then the polygon is refined by introduction of new points and the snake algorithm is repeated for the refined polygon, using a smaller search range.</p><p>The ability of the active-contour model to be attracted to edges may be used to track the left ventricle boundaries along time in cases where the motion is small. The snake is simply initialized by the contour obtained at the previous time instance and is left to converge to the edges of the deformed object. The above procedure, however, is very sensitive to noise and does not guarantee convergence in the presence of large motion or occlusion, which are common in ultrasound images. Although contours estimated with this technique seem to approximate well the LV boundary, their motion does not reflect the actual motion of the ventricle. The degrees of freedom of the active-contour model are equal in this case to the number of points of the contour polygon. However, the left ventricle boundary has only a few degrees of freedom, and therefore, by constraining the motion of the contour using information of the heart dynamics, a more coherent boundary estimation may be achieved.</p><p>Since the dynamics of the heart motion are not known in advance, they must by estimated directly from the images. In this paper, a learning procedure is used to accumulate knowledge about the dynamics of the left ventricle boundary. This information is then exploited to constrain the positions of the estimated active-contour points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONTOUR TRACKING</head><p>In order to constrain the motion of the boundary, the -dimensional observation vector containing the snake vertex locations is restricted to a -dimensional orthonormal basis where . As is well known <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the resulting basis restriction mean square error is minimized if the -dimensional basis is formed by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of , which corresponds to its largest eigenvalues, i.e., when principal component analysis (PCA) is used. This has the effect of analyzing the dynamics of the object motion using the observed deformations estimated at previous time instances. We found that very good results are obtained with a value of in the neighborhood of ten. The mean shape and the shape covariance matrix corresponding to the random observation vector are computed by a moving average approach (9) (10) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> where is the orthogonal matrix with columns eigenvectors of and is a diagonal matrix with where are the eigenvalues of By considering only the lower frequency eigenvalues we form the matrix with columns the first columns of . The columns of form a reduced-order orthonormal space and therefore <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> illustrates an example of the first three modes estimated.</p><p>Then, a statistical observation model may be established <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> where is a -dimensional model vector. The model vector represents generalized deformation parameters, such as scaling, tapering, pinching, etc., specific to the deformable object.</p><p>The process is assumed to be zero mean Gaussian noise with correlation matrix The observation variances are assumed to be inversely proportional to the corresponding intensity gradient strength computed at the converged snake position <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> where is a constant (set to 20 in our experiments).</p><p>In the above model, the object shape is a perturbation of a mean shape along specific generalized deformation axes (the eigenvectors of contaminated with observation noise. Two alternative schemes were investigated to fit this model to the observations. The first one is an implicit filtering strategy, while the second one consists of modifying the internal energy functional in the snake itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Kalman-Filtering Approach</head><p>The optimal estimation of the state vector from noisy observations given by ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) is required.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Explicitly Constraining Snake Energy</head><p>The columns of provide an orthonormal basis of reduced dimension and physically correspond to the degrees of freedom of the object. Since these modes are updated at each time instance, knowledge of the object deformation dynamics is accumulated in the covariance matrix , and therefore the eigenvectors of correspond to the actual object deformation modes. Then these modes are exploited to constrain the estimated object motion along the principal deformation vectors and thus provide regularization. This is done by expressing the snake energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> in terms of the reduced parameters set <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> where is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. With this approach, the snake only is allowed to deform along specific directions, dictated by the columns of With this modification, the total snake energy functional may not be written as a summation of local energy terms, and therefore the dynamic programming algorithm described in Section III is not applicable. Instead, a gradient-descent approach was adopted to minimize where a typical value of was chosen to be 0.01.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>The proposed techniques were tested on several sequences of B-mode echocardiograms. The sequence shown here was acquired with an ATL HDI5000 CV scanner using a P42 phasedarray probe (imaging bandwidth from 2 to 4 MHz). It is a parasternal short-axis view from a 25-year-old healthy male volunteer. In total, 95 frames of the sequence were used, corresponding approximately to 4 s of the cardiac beat. Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows the results obtained for several frames by applying the active-contour algorithm with no attempt at contour tracking. The boundary obtained at a specific time instance was simply used as an initial value at the subsequent time instance. This approach is commonly used in practice. In this simulation, the initial active-contour polygon consisted of 40 points. The search area was selected to be 3 pixels along</p><p>The smoothness weight was experimentally optimized using a small set of frames. Then the same value was used for all results presented in this paper. From these results it is clear that the estimated LV boundary is reasonably accurate, especially over the areas where high contrast edges exist. At the left part of the images, where the edges are fuzzy, the snake fails to converge to some strong feature. In addition, the estimated boundary is not coherent over time. This is more apparent if the whole sequence is shown as video.</p><p>Improved results were obtained when the contour was tracked using the Kalman-filtering approach, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. The temporal window used for the estimation of the shape modes contains past observations. The advantage of this approach is that temporally coherent LV boundaries are obtained with only a small computational overhead. The accuracy at the left side of the images is also improved. Even more accurate results were obtained by reducing the degrees of freedom of the active-contour algorithm, as described in Section IV-B. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref>. In this case, the contour does not lose contact with the boundary, even when the edge contrast is low or the deformation is large.</p><p>We also measured the accuracy of the proposed scheme quantitatively by comparing the estimated boundaries with manually traced ones. Specifically, the match ratio, defined as the overlap area divided by the area inside the manually traced contour, was computed for ten frames of the sequence. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>, where the accuracy of the simple snake approach is compared with the two approaches that exploit temporal tracking. It is clear that both temporal tracking methods increase very much the accuracy of the boundary detection algorithm. In particular, the results of the application of the reduced-basis algorithm of Section II are virtually identical to those obtained with laborious manual tracing of the contour by expert doctors. In conclusion, the proposed schemes increase very considerably the accuracy of the boundary detection algorithm by imposing temporal constraints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER WORK</head><p>In this paper an algorithm was described for the identification of the LV epicardial boundary from B-mode echocardiographic images. In our approach, the basic active-contour algorithm was used along with additional constraints to the shape of the LV. These constraints are not based on prior assumptions about the shape of the LV but, rather, they are estimated directly by observing the shape deformations. In this way, more accurate and temporally consistent estimation is achieved, even in image sequences with a small signal to noise ratio. Temporal coherence of boundary estimates is very desirable since medical doctors base their diagnosis on observations of dynamic sequences rather than static images.</p><p>The results obtained in this paper may be improved by replacing the simple active-contour (snake) algorithm used for the estimation of individual boundaries by more sophisticated contour descriptions, in terms of control parameters, such as those presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. By combining these algorithms with the temporal tracking schemes proposed in this paper, we expect increased boundary detection accuracy.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
