<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, due to the rapid progress of micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) and wireless communication technology, Wireless Sensor Networks have obtained dramatic development. As one of the most important technologies in the 21 st century and the core technology of the Internet of things (IoT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, WSNs are profoundly changing the human life, and its application scopes become wider and wider, especially, the application of Small-scale Wireless Sensor Networks (SWSNs) which contains dozens to several hundreds of sensor nodes. Largescale Wireless Sensor Networks can be hierarchical sensor networks comprised of some SWSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. The wide applications are involved with both civilian and military scenarios, including environmental monitoring, surveillance for safety and security, automated health care, intelligent building control, traffic control, object tracking, smart homes and smart grid, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</p><p>A WSN comprises of numerous small devices, i.e., sensor nodes, which contain sensing (measuring), computing, and communication component that ensure an administrator to observe and react to events and phenomena in a specific area called a sensor field <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. These sensor nodes scattered in the sensor field can collect local environmental information, process them into useful data packets, and send the packets to the sink node by multi-hop. The sink node transmits the packets to administrator via internet or GPRS. Most of these sensor nodes suffer from the same constraint: limited battery life, limited transmission power, low memory and limited processing capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. With the dramatic development of hardware technology, the CPU and flash memory are becoming smaller, more powerful and cheaper. As a result, the memory and processing capabilities of sensor nodes will not be the most important obstacle for the application of WSNs. However, the battery technology has failed to obtain a breakthrough yet. Obviously, the energy capacity of sensor nodes will be the key bottlenecks for the development of WSNs in a very long time. So the research on improving energy efficiency of WSNs, so as to prolong the network lifetime, is still the focus at present and in the future. The technical ways and methods of improving energy efficiency of WSNs mainly involve the energy efficient routing algorithms and clustering algorithms. This paper is devoting to develop an energy efficient routing algorithm for WSNs.</p><p>For the wide applicability range of WSNs, WSNs routing protocols must be application-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, which means that designing a WSNs routing algorithm that meets the requirements of all application is impossible. Instead it is of impor-A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t tance that designing general routing algorithms which somehow can be applied to some application and meanwhile balance the energy consumption to increase the network lifetime as far as possible, which is an important and challenging issue, as well as the focus of developing the routing protocols for WSNs. As routing in WSNs for maximum lifetime has proven to be a NP-hard problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, more and more researchers try to develop heuristic and meta-heuristic based routing algorithms to address it. However, there is enormous scope for improvements in energy efficiency for some WSNs applications. And on account of the uncertain variable number and strong constraints of the routing problem in WSNs, most meta-heuristics are inappropriate to design routing algorithms for WSNs. This paper tries to develop an energy efficient routing algorithm for WSNs based on an improved Harmony Search (HS) algorithm, a meta-heuristic.</p><p>The energy-saving mechanisms based on the management of the node status <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, allowing turning nodes from sleep mode to transmitting/receiving mode, has not been taken into account in this paper. Because these mechanisms are normally implemented in Physical and MAC layer.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the stateof-the-art of routing protocols for WSNs, mainly discusses the routing algorithms based on heuristic and meta-heuristic approaches. In section 3, the IHSBEER algorithm is described in detail, in conjunction with another approach, which is the core of this paper. Section 4 presents the experimental results performed to evaluate the proposed routing algorithm. Related discussion about the proposed routing algorithm is presented in section 5. The last section is the conclusions and topics for further work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work</head><p>WSNs and mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) have a lot in common, such as they both involve the multi-hop communications. However, the two systems have several significant differences. The typical and most important difference is that WSNs is subject to energy constraint, which is not always the case in MANETs, where the communication devices handled by humans can often be replaced or recharged. Due to the unattended operation of several weeks or months for most applications of WSNs, it is very important to manage energy resources of sensor nodes efficiently. Therefore, many routing schemes of MANETs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> are inappropriate to WSNs. And the design of energy-efficient routing algorithm for WSNs has become the research focus.</p><p>At present there is a great amount of research about the design and development of routing protocols in WSNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. These protocols are designed for different applications and different architecture of networks. However, they A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t all have one thing in common: they have considered the energy efficiency of sensor nodes, which directly affects the extension of the network lifetime. In this section, a brief overview on applying heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms to design routing protocols for WSNs is presented. A detailed and complete reference on the motif can be seen from <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</p><p>Camilo et al. proposed an Energy Efficient Ant Based Routing (EEABR) Algorithm, which is based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), to improve the energy efficiency of WSNs and maximize the network lifetime <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. In this routing algorithm, the paths between the source nodes and the sink node are found by forward ants, which select next hop according to the amount of pheromone trail stored in current nodes routing table and residual energy of neighbors. When computing the number of pheromone trail that a backward ant will left during its journey, both the energy levels of all nodes in path and the path length are taken into consideration, which have a great contribution to balancing the energy consumption of nodes and reducing the time delay. Meanwhile, a parameter called travelled distance, i.e., the number of visited nodes, is introduced in this phase, which makes those nodes closer to sink node have more pheromone trail, so that forward ants could reach the sink node more efficiently. However, during the early period of transmitting packets, the forward ants cannot find the optimal or near optimal paths due to the little difference of the amount of pheromone trail in routing table.</p><p>Multipath Routing Protocol (MRP) is proposed by Jing et al. to reduce energy consumption and maximize the network lifetime <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, which is based on dynamic clustering and ant colony optimization. MRP contains three phases: cluster formation, multipath construction and data transmission. In the first phase, the cluster head is selected from those nodes located in the event area according to their residual energy. Furthermore, with dynamic clustering, the efficiency of data aggregation has been improved dramatically, so that the energy consumption of network has been decreased effectively. In the phase of constructing multipath, an improved ACO algorithm is used to calculate the multiple paths between the cluster head and the sink node, which has balanced the energy consumption of nodes. In the last phase, the cluster head dynamically select one path to transmit data to the sink node according to a load balancing function.</p><p>Adaptive energy-efficient and lifetime-aware routing protocol (QELAR), based on Q-learning technique, is proposed by Hu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. It has introduced Qlearning technique to the routing protocol to balance nodes workload for prolonging network lifetime. Whats more, QELAR can improve energy efficiency of network by decreasing networking overhead, and better adapt to dynamic networks by efficiently learning the environment.</p><p>Routing using ant colony optimization router chip (ACORC), proposed by Okdem and Karaboga, is a multi-path routing protocol, which can provides reliable A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t communications in the case of node faults <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Whats more, the packets to be transmitted dont need to retain those nodes that have ever been visited, so that the size of data has been decreased and nodes energy has been saved. However, in the phase of calculating the amount of pheromone trail that a backward ant will deposit during its journey, it only considers the length of path not the energy levels of nodes in path, so that the distribution of pheromone is not so reasonable, which will have a negative effect on maximizing network lifetime.</p><p>Marcelo et al. have proposed a Cognitive LF-Ant protocol for emergency reporting in healthcare wireless sensor networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, which is inspired by the natural behaviour of the ants and a cognitive component providing the capabilities to dynamically allocate resources, in accordance with the emergency degree of each patient. The inter-cluster routing is inspired by the behaviour of foraging Saharan desert ants, which is based on the criterion of shortest path between the cognitive sensor node and the sink node. Simulations results show the decrease in the average delay time to report emergency situations. And the packet loss rate was also reduced.</p><p>Liu et al. have proposed an agent-assisted QoS-based routing algorithm (QoS-PSO) for WSNs, which is based on Particle Swarm Optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In QoS-PSO, the objective function of PSO is the synthetic QoS composed of delay, bandwidth and packet loss, which contributes to obtain the optimal path and improve the network performance. The changes of network communication flow, each nodes routing state and network topology can be monitored by intelligent software agents, which can also participate in network routing and maintaining. It can be seen from the experimental results that QoS-PSO provides better quality of service than other algorithms. However, the global information needs to be stored in each sensor node for QoS-PSO, which is not suitable for large-scale WSNs.</p><p>BeeSensor protocol, proposed by Saleem et al., is an event driven, reactive and on-demand multipath routing protocol, which is inspired by the foraging principles of honey-bees <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. There are four phases in this protocol: scouting, foraging, swarming and routing loops and path maintenance. Hence, BeeSensor works with four types of agents: packer, scouts, foragers and swarms. The major responsibility of packer is to receive packets coming from the upper layer and locate an appropriate forager for them. Scouts are of two sorts: forward scouts and backward scouts, whose task is to build a path between the source nodes and the sink node and report the quality of the discovered path. In BeeSensor protocol, foragers are the main workers, whose major task is to carry packets to the sink node through a predetermined path that is selected stochastically at the source node. And a swarm encapsulates all foragers belonging to its own group in its payload, and then route towards the source node to keep the source node has enough foragers. The experimental results show that BeeSensor performs better than other Swarm Intelligence based routing protocols in terms of packet-delivery ratio, la-A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t tency and energy efficiency.</p><p>Lu et al. have proposed FRMOO routing algorithm based on fuzzy random optimization and multi-objective optimization, which aims to prolong network lifetime and achieve better and wider performances of delay, latency jitter, reliability, communication interference, energy and balanced energy distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. This routing algorithm utilizes fuzzy random variables to depict the fuzziness and randomness of link delay, link reliability and residual energy of nodes. The routing model is based on fuzzy random expected value and standard deviation model. And a multi-objective genetic algorithm with fuzzy random simulation is used to calculate Pareto optimal solution. However, the selection mechanism of one path used to transmit packets from the Pareto optimal solution has not been provided.</p><p>Fuzzy Ant Colony Optimization Routing (FACOR) algorithm, proposed by Amiri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, has combined the foraging behavior of ants with fuzzy logic to achieve optimal path. The experimental results showed that FACOR has a better performance than AODV in terms of routing setup time, the number of routing request packets, energy consumption, delay and network lifetime.</p><p>From the above, we can find that these meta-heuristics based routing algorithms are developed for different applications, and the energy efficiency of network need to be improved in a greater degree. HS algorithm is firstly developed by Zong Woo Geem <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, which is inspired by the improvisation process of musician looking for a perfect state of harmony. According to reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, HS algorithm is very efficient in finding the global optima in both continues and discrete optimization problems. Until now, HS algorithm has been successfully applied to address various optimization problems including traveling salesman problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, assembly sequence planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, multicast routing of high-speed networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, design of water distribution network <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, clustering of the web documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, design of pipeline network <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and vehicle routing <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, etc. Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> mainly uses HS algorithm to solve the bandwidth-delay-constrained leastcost multicast routing problem of high-speed networks. The encoding scheme of multicast tree, i.e., harmony, is called Node Parent Index (NPI) encoding. This representation is implemented in an array with size 2N elements, where N is the number of nodes in networks. For each node v in the tree, two consecutive positions in the array are allocated to which the first position (with odd index number in the array) is the node label and the second position (with even index number in the array) is the position index of parent of v. However, the problem be addressed in this paper is unicast routing problem in WSNs, which is different from the multicast routing problem in reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. The number of sensor nodes in transmitting path is variable for unicast routing problem in WSNs. Therefore, the encoding scheme of harmony in reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> is not suitable to design unicast routing algorithm for WSNs. Nevertheless, It is still able to utilize HS algorithm to design unicast routing approach for WSNs in principle. However, at present, A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t the research regarding the application of applying HS algorithm to design unicast routing approach for WSNs are few. Our anterior research of how to implement HS algorithm to route for SWSNs was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. In this paper, HS algorithm is used to solve the routing problem WSNs for maximizing network lifetime.</p><p>First of all, a basic implementation of the routing process is presented. Secondly, the encoding of harmony memory and improvisation of a new harmony have been improved based on the characteristics of routing in WSNs. Thirdly, the adjustment process of HS algorithm has been discarded to make the proposed routing algorithm concise and only contains one algorithm-specific parameter, i.e., HMCR.</p><p>Meanwhile, the dynamic adaptation is introduced for the parameter HMCR to avoid the prematurity in early generations and strengthen its local search ability in late generations. Finally, an effective local search strategy is proposed to improve the convergence speed and the accuracy of algorithm. In addition, an objective function model of algorithm that has taken both the energy consumption and the length of path into consideration is developed, which contributes to the balance of energy consumption and the maximization of the network lifetime. Then an Improved Harmony Search Based Energy Efficient Routing (IHSBEER) Algorithm for WSNs is proposed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Improved harmony search based energy-efficient routing algorithm</head><p>Because of the strict energy constraint that the sensor nodes, deployed in real environment and powered by battery, may not have energy replenishment capabilities, it is important to balance the energy consumption of network for the routing algorithm, so as to prolong the network lifetime as far as possible. In this section we propose a new energy-efficient routing algorithm for WSNs, the IHSBEER algorithm, which is based on improved HS algorithm and Local Search strategy.</p><p>First, a basic implementation of the routing process of proposed routing algorithm for WSNs is presented. Next, the Energy Efficient Harmony Search Based Routing (EEHSBR) algorithm is explained. Finally, the proposed IHSBEER algorithm is presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Basic implementation of the routing process</head><p>First of all, the sink node was designed with uninterrupted power supply, bigger transmission power range, stronger computing power and more storage capacity to execute the proposed routing algorithm. All the sensor nodes were assigned unique IDs, and the position of all nodes were obtained by a localization algorithm with GPS system. All nodes are capable of detecting their remaining power and communicate with each other using slotted Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA-CA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> protocol. A basic implementation of the routing process is as follows.</p><p>A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 1) At the beginning, the sink node sets the same transmission power with sensor nodes, and broadcasts a packet containing number of hops, initialized to 0, to sensor nodes within its communication range. Receiving nodes record the minimal hops to sink node, and ignore the packet containing bigger hops to sink node. Then they let the value of hops plus 1, and broadcast the packet to their neighbor nodes. In this way, all nodes can obtain their minimal hops to sink node. Meanwhile, they record the IDs of their neighbor nodes. Then, each sensor node sends the packet containing its residual energy, hops and IDs of neighbor nodes to the sink node. And the sink node executes the proposed routing algorithm to find best forwarding paths for all nodes. After that, the sink node sets a strong enough transmission power to send packet containing each nodes best forwarding path to each node in single hop.</p><p>2) When a sensor node has detected useful data from surrounding, it processes them to packet. And the forwarding path is stored in memory and its residual energy is added to the packet. Then the sensor node transmits the packet to next hop according to the forwarding path.</p><p>3) When the next hop has received the packet, it adds its residual energy to the packet, and deletes the node, which has been visited, from the forwarding path in packet. Then sending the packet to next hop according to the forwarding path stored in the packet. Going on with this step until the packet has been received by the sink node.</p><p>4) When the sink node has received the packet, it processes the packet and sends the data detected from surrounding to observer via internet or GPRS, then, updates the residual energy of those nodes in packet. At regular intervals, the sink node transmits the packet containing each nodes forwarding path to each sensor node in single hop. If the new forwarding path of a node calculated by the sink node is the same as that stored in the node, the sink node does not send packet to the node.  dimension of harmony in HM may be different. Therefore, the classical HS algorithm cant be applied to address routing problem of WSNs directly. And several improvements for traditional HS algorithm have to be put forward according to the characteristics of WSNs routing problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Energy</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Energy-efficient harmony search based routing algorithm</head><p>As explained in previous section, the encoding of harmony memory and generation of a new path are the two steps we should improve based on the characteristics of routing in WSNs. By improving the two key steps and proposing an objective function model taking both the energy consumption and the length of path into consideration, Energy Efficient Harmony Search Based Routing (EEHSBR) Algorithm is presented in this section. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> depicts the flowchart of EEHSBR algorithm.</p><p>As we can see from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, the initial HM is established with roulette wheel selection method. This section describes the encoding of HM first, then illustrates the initialization of HM with roulette wheel selection method and the generation of a new path respectively, and finally explains the new objective function model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Encoding of harmony memory</head><p>For classical HS algorithm, the dimension of each harmony in HM must be equal <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. In our study, a harmony represents a forwarding path that consists of some sensor nodes, in which the first node is source node and the last node is sink node. Therefore, the dimension of each harmony in HM can be different, as shown in Eq.1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">HM =                  X 1 X 2 . . . X i . . .

X i , i.e., (s,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x i,2 , • • •, x i, j , • • •, d),</formula><p>is the i-th harmony, which represents the i-th forwarding path between the source node and the sink node.</p><p>This improvement is the first step and has a tremendous contribution to applying HS algorithm to design routing approach for WSNs. Each harmony in HM is generated with roulette wheel selection method. The probability P(i, j) of node i selecting node j as the next hop is calculated as shown in Eq.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Initialization of harmony memory</head><formula xml:id="formula_2">P (i, j) =      ∑ k∈N i (h k )-h j (C(N i )-1) * ∑ k∈N i (h k ) if ( j ∈ N i ) , 0 else. (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where h k denotes the hop count of node k to the sink node; similarly, h j denotes the hop count of node j to the sink node; N i is the the set of neighboring nodes of node i, excepting the nodes already exist in current forwarding path; C(N i ) is the capacity of set N i .</p><p>It can be seen from Eq.2, the node which is within the communication range of current node i and gets closer to the sink node is more likely to be next hop. With this method, it is able to generate some good initial harmony, i.e., initial forwarding path, which will contribute to the convergence speed of routing algorithm.</p><p>The detailed procedure of utilizing roulette wheel selection method to select the next hop of node i is as follows: First of all, a random number R between 0 and 1 is generated. The R is used to subtract the probability P of the first node in N i .</p><p>If the value of subtraction is negative, choose the first node in N i as the next hop of node i. Otherwise, the value of subtraction is used to subtract the probability P of the second node in N i . Then determine whether the value of second subtraction is positive or negative. If it is negative, choose the second node in N i as the next hop of node i. Otherwise, the subtraction operation goes on, until the value of subtraction is negative. And the corresponding node in N i is selected as the next hop of node i.</p><p>As we can see the initialization of the first path in HM from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, the source node s is set as the first node. When selecting the next hop of source node, executing the above roulette wheel selection method. After subtracting the probability P of node 27, the subtraction value is negative, so the next hop of source node is set as node 27. Going on with the roulette wheel selection until the sink node is selected into the forwarding path to complete the initialization of the first path.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Improved harmony search based energy-efficient routing algorithm</head><p>When optimizing the continuous problems using HS algorithm, the pitch adjusting bandwidth is bw, which is different from the case in discrete optimization problem. There are two algorithm-specific parameters, i.e., HMCR and PAR, in EEHSBR algorithm presented above. From Eq.3 and Eq.4 we can see that, when</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">P 1 is not smaller than HMCR or N x ′ i-1 ∩ { x 1,i , x 2,i , • • •, x HMS,i } = / 0, x ′ i is se- lected from N x ′ i-1</formula><p>, which is as same as the case when P 2 is smaller than PAR. Obviously, PAR is not so important to EEHSBR. And because WSNs routing algorithms should be concise and contain few parameters, we have discarded the adjustment process of EEHSBR. As a result, only one algorithm-specific parameter (i.e., HMCR) is left. Whats more, to avoid the prematurity and enhance the global exploratory capability of the proposed routing algorithm in early generations and strengthen its local search ability in late generations, we have introduced dynamic adaptation for the parameter HMCR in improvisation step. In addition, we have proposed an effective local search strategy to improve the convergence speed and the accuracy of the algorithm. Thus a new routing method called Improved Harmony Search Based Energy-Efficient Routing (IHSBEER) Algorithm is proposed.</p><p>The flowchart of IHSBEER algorithm is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1.">Adaptive HMCR</head><p>There is only one algorithm-specific parameter (i.e., HMCR) in the proposed routing algorithm IHSBEER. If HMCR keeps a small static value with the increasing of iterations, the algorithm would loss local search ability and cant find global optimum. And if HMCR keeps a big static value, the algorithm would be easily trapped in local optimum. Therefore, it is important for HMCR to take small value to enhance the global exploratory capability in early generations, and take big value to strengthen its local search ability in late generations, so as to find the global optimum.</p><p>According to a large number of experimental results, we find that the proposed routing algorithm performs best when HMCR increases with generation number by the exponential rule as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and expressed as follow: HMCR (gn) = HMCR min × exp gn × ln( HMCR max HMCR min )</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">NI (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">)</formula><p>where HMCR(gn) denotes the value of HMCR at gn-th generation.

Definition 1. For a path(s, x i,2 , • • •, x i, j-1 , x i, j , x i, j+1 , • • •,d) in HM, assuming that a node v belongs to the intersection between N x i, j-1 and N x i, j+1 , so define the path</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">(s, x i,2 , • • •, x i, j-1 , v, x i, j+1 , • • •, d) as an adjacent path of path (s, x i,2 , • • •, x i, j-1 , x i, j , x i, j+1 , • • •, d).</formula><p>The local search strategy for WSNs routing is illustrated in detail as follows. For example, for a path, X i , i.e., (s, x i,2 , • • •, x i, j , • • •, d) stored in HM, if x i, j is selected, the process of local search is as follow:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">x i, j ← x i, j ∈ (N x i, j-1 ∩ N x i, j+1 ) x i, j if (N x i, j-1 ∩ N x i, j+1 = / 0), otherwise.

Otherwise, it remains unchanged.</p><p>As we can see from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>, for example, the node 71 in path {s, 31, 33, 71, 80, 38, 49, 88, 51, d} is selected for local search. The intersection of the neighbors of node 33 and the neighbors of node 80 is {63, 64, 65, 71, 82}. So an element is randomly selected from {63, 64, 65, 71, 82} to replace node 71 to complete local searching, here, node 63 is selected. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Simulations and results</head><p>This section presents the results of simulation experiments. The simulation program was developed by C++ programming language on a PC with 2.3 GHz Intel core i7 3610QM processor and 8 GB RAM to analyze the energy cost of sensor nodes and the network lifetime. According to the effective communication radius, 10 small-scale scenarios were randomly generated. The number of nodes of these scenarios varied from 10 to 100, with increments of 10. And the simulated area also varied from 200×200 m 2 (10 nodes), 300× 300 m 2 (20 nodes) to 1100×1100 m 2 (100 nodes) as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> in which the squares and stars represent the sensor nodes, and the inverted solid triangles represent the sink nodes. Two well-known ACO based WSN routing algorithm, i.e., EEABR <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>and ACORC <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and EEHSBR were used to make comparisons, so as to verify the success of IHSBEER algorithm.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 7. 10 scenarios</head><p>To make comprehensive comparison between the proposed routing algorithms and EEABR algorithm, this paper has performed extensive experiments on the following three cases:</p><p>1) Case 1: the energy level of all nodes in 10 scenarios is set to 10J.

And each sensor node periodically sends packets to the sink node.</p><p>Related parameters are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.

As we can see from Fig. <ref type="figure">8(c</ref>), the results obtained by IHSBEER and EEHSBR are better than those obtained by ACORC and EEABR in the vast majority of the scenarios. As a result, IHSBEER and EEHSBR will perform better in prolonging the network lifetime than ACORC and EEABR does in the vast majority of the scenarios, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8(d)</ref>.</p><p>And we have also recorded the time of running IHSBEER 10 times to calculate the optimal forwarding paths from the source node to the sink node for the last scenario shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>. The total time of 10 runs is 39 seconds, which means that the base station only needs an average of 3.9 seconds to calculate the optimal forwarding path from the source node to the sink node. So the proposed routing algorithm has a satisfactory performance.  It can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>(a) that the IHSBEER algorithm gives the best results in the vast majority of the scenarios, in particular performs far better than ACORC and EEABR. Therefore, the IHSBEER algorithm can save much more energy in than EEHSBR, ACORC and EEABR do, for transmitting the same size packet to the sink node. From Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> It can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>, IHSBEER and EEHSBR perform far better than ACORC and EEABR in both saving energy and balancing the energy consumption of networks, as well as extending the network lifetime. That is because sensor nodes always transmit packets to the sink node along optimal or near optimal paths by utilizing IHSBEER or EEHSBR, whereas sensor nodes using ACORC or EEABR are not able to obtain good paths to the sink node during the early period of transmitting packets, for difference between the amount of pheromone trail in routing table is too small.</p></div>

In the experiments, the average residual energy, standard deviation of residual energy and minimum residual energy of nodes were calculated respectively with different algorithms when the number of packets received by the sink node varied from 300, 400 to 1200. Figs.11-13 illustrate the A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t comparison results. It can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">11</ref>-13 that IHSBEER also presents better results than EEHSBR, ACORC and EEABR do, which conveys that IHS-BEER performs better in both saving energy and balancing the energy consumption of networks than EEHSBR, ACORC and EEABR do for SWSNs. Especially it can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref>, the standard deviation of residual energy obtained 555 by ACORC and EEABR gets larger and larger with the increasing of number of packets received by the sink node, while the standard deviation obtained by IHS-BEER and EEHSBR decrease with the increasing of number of packets received by the sink node, which indicates that IHSBEER and EEHSBR perform far better in balancing the energy consumption of networks than ACORC and EEABR do. From the experiments results of the three cases, we can find that the IHSBEER algorithm almost has presented the best results in all metrics. Finally, it can be concluded that IHSBEER can perform far better in balancing the energy consumption of networks and extending the network lifetime than EEHSBR, ACORC and EEABR do.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>IHSBEER proposed in this paper is very efficient in balancing the energy consumption of networks and extending the network lifetime as shown in the experiments results of section 4. That is because the forwarding paths of sensor nodes, calculated by the sink node with IHSBEER algorithm, are always optimal or near optimal. The outstanding results of IHSBEER algorithm depends on four aspects: 1) a novel encoding of harmony memory; 2) an effective generation method of a new path; 3) an effective local search strategy; 4) an excellent objective function model. However, there are two main drawbacks of the proposed routing algorithm. One is that the proposed approach requires a static configuration phase to calculate the hops of sensor nodes and to record the IDs of neighbor nodes of each node during deployment, which will takes away scalability and ease of deployment. And the static configuration phase is essential to IHSBEER algorithm. Because of this, it is reasonable to establish hierarchical networks with cluster heads have more battery capacity than member sensor nodes to improve the scalability and the ease of deployment of networks. In the hierarchical networks, IHSBEER algorithm is performed for the multi-hop communication between the cluster heads and the base station. And each cluster head take charge of the joining and exiting of the normal sensor nodes nearby. Therefore, the scalability of networks will be im-A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t proved on the premise of keeping the networks energy efficiency. The other one is that the data forwarding paths of sensor nodes are received from the sink node, which is unsatisfactory to a very large-scale wireless sensor networks. However, large-scale wireless sensor networks can be hierarchical networks comprised of some SWSNs. IHSBEER can be executed by base station to calculate optimal forwarding path for each cluster head, or be executed by cluster heads to calculate optimal forwarding path for each member sensor nodes. And for most of current applications, such as smart homes, industrial and manufacturing automation, etc, the number of nodes is not so big. Thus the proposed approach have great application prospects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions and future works</head><p>In this paper, we have proposed an energy efficient routing algorithm for WSNs, called IHSBEER, which is based on improved HS algorithm. First of all, the encoding of harmony memory has been improved based on the characteristics of routing in WSNs, and the roulette wheel selection method is used to initialize the HM, which contributes to the convergence speed of routing algorithm. Secondly, the improvisation of a new harmony has also been improved. In this procedure, the adjustment process of HS algorithm has been discarded to make the proposed routing algorithm concise and only contains one algorithmspecific parameter, i.e., HMCR. Meanwhile, we have introduced dynamic adaptation for the parameter HMCR to avoid the prematurity in early generations and strengthen its local search ability in late generations. Thirdly, an effective local search strategy is proposed to enhance the local search ability, which contributes to improve the convergence speed and the accuracy of routing algorithm. In addition, an objective function model that has taken both the energy consumption and the length of path into consideration is developed, which has a great contribution to the maximization of network lifetime. The IHSBEER algorithm has been compared to two well-known ant based routing algorithms, i.e., ACORC and EEABR, and EEHSBR by several simulation experiments.
