<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>N ETWORKED control systems (NCSs) are control sys- tems wherein the control loops are closed through a shared band-limited digital communication network. The defining feature of NCSs is that control and feedback signals are transmitted among the systems' components in the form of data packets through a communication network. NCSs have been the subject of intensive research in areas from robust H 2 /H ∞ control <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, sequence-based control <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, fuzzy control <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, quantized control <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, asynchronous sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, time-varying sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, multirate control <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, to observer-based control <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and many more.</p><p>Industrial control systems are generally subject to faults. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> investigated fault-tolerant flight control design for aircraft systems. Fault detection has been an active research topic, and great efforts have been made to investigate fault detection and fault compensation for traditional control systems (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and the references therein). Some nice results on fault detection for NCSs have also been achieved <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Note that network-induced delays are ignored in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>; plant state delays instead of networkinduced delays are taken into account in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>; network-induced delays are not included in the established model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>; and the sensor-to-fault detection filter network-induced delays are considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Moreover, no control input is considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, while network-induced transmission delays of control inputs are ignored in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. In this paper, we introduce a control station consisting of the fault detection filter (FDF) and the controller to study the problem of fault detection. However, inserting the sensor-to-control station and the control station-to-actuator communication networks will induce network transmission delays inevitably. For NCSs subject to faults, since both the plant and the FDF are described as dynamic systems, taking into account the sensor-to-control station and the control station-to-actuator network-induced delays will introduce considerable difficulty for network-based modeling and the simultaneous design of FDF and controller. How to address these issues is practically valuable and still unresolved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. This gives the first motivation of this paper.</p><p>In the aforementioned works, the plant states or measurement outputs are sampled at specific sampling periods and then transmitted to the controller and/or FDF periodically through a communication network. Generally speaking, transmitting all the sampled data packets can lead to a good system performance. However, this may not always be the truth. On the one hand, if the communication network cannot provide enough network bandwidth, releasing all the sampled data packets into the communication network may cause network congestion. On the other hand, if the fluctuations of the sampled states or measurement outputs are not worth acting on, releasing all the sampled data packets into the communication network is a waste of scarce network resources.</p><p>Therefore, how to efficiently choose sampled data packets to be released into the communication network motivates the study of the event-triggering mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. For the event-triggering mechanism in NCSs, some valuable results have also been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Note that the event parameters in their event-triggering mechanisms are fixed and not adjustable. Different from the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, adjustable event parameters have been constructed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> to introduce more flexibility for the event-triggering mechanism.</p><p>In fault detection for NCSs, on the one hand, if the occurrence of faults is detected, then, the system can respond by transmitting less data packets to save scarce network bandwidth resources. On the other hand, NCSs are subject to variable fault occurrence probability which can be obtained by using historical data. If the fault occurrence probability is low, the system can also choose to transmit less data packets. However, when investigating fault detection for event-triggered NCSs, the fault occurrence probability has received little attention except in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Moreover, the event-triggering status is ignored in the literature. Specifically speaking, if the events are continuously triggered for θ times with θ &gt; 0, a less sensitive event-triggering condition may be utilized to release less measurement outputs and/or control inputs, and save network bandwidth resources accordingly; if the events are continuously untriggered for θ times, a more sensitive event-triggering condition may be utilized to release more measurement outputs and/or control inputs, and improve the system performance accordingly. How to take into account the fault occurrence detection progress (which means that whether the occurrence of faults is detected) and the fault occurrence probability simultaneously, and introduce an adaptively adjusted eventtriggering parameter to achieve the efficient utilization of the communication network are, to our knowledge, yet unresolved. Answering these questions is the second and main motivation of the current work.</p><p>We observe that only the sensor is taken as event-triggered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. In fault detection for NCSs, if both the sensor and the control station are event-triggered, less data packets will be released and network resources can be saved accordingly. When dealing with fault detection for event-triggered NCSs equipped with a control station, considering both the event-triggered sensor and the event-triggered control station can lead to a further reduced network bandwidth occupation. However, it will also introduce much difficulty for modeling and FDF design. How to tackle this issue is the third motivation of this paper.</p><p>This paper is concerned with adaptively adjusted eventtriggering mechanism-based fault detection for a discrete-time NCS subject to plant faults. A novel coordinated eventtriggering mechanism, which is based on the fault occurrence detection progress, the fault occurrence probability, and an adaptively adjusted event-triggering parameter, is proposed. The simultaneously event-triggered sensor and control station are utilized to establish new closed-loop models, which are based on for the event-triggered simultaneous design of FDF and controller. We further furnish a new algorithm for choosing the adaptively adjusted event-triggering parameter in order to achieve the efficient utilization of network resources.</p><p>The proposed event-triggering mechanism and fault detection scheme are applied to aircraft dynamics and shown to be effective.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.</p><p>1) A coordinated event-triggering mechanism, which takes into account the fault occurrence detection progress and the fault occurrence probability, and incorporates an adaptively adjusted event-triggering parameter, is proposed for the first time. A new adaptively adjusted event-triggering parameter selection algorithm is proposed.</p><p>2) The event-triggered simultaneous design of FDF and controller is proposed to detect the occurrence of faults. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.</p><p>Section II establishes new network-based models for the discrete-time NCS. Section III is concerned with the simultaneous design of FDF and controller. Performance analysis and design consideration are presented in Section IV. Some closing remarks are given in Section V.</p></div>

To safeguard the safety and reliability of the unmanned aircraft system, it is important to study how to detect the occurrence of faults in time. For the purpose of fault detection, measurement outputs should be transmitted to the control station. Moreover, the unmanned aircraft system is subject to the external disturbance. If the disturbance and faults are taken into account, the model in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">2</ref>) is converted to</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ẋ(t) = Āx(t) + Bu(t) + Ēω(t) + Ff (t) y(t) = Cx(t)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where ω(t) ∈ R p , f (t) ∈ R q , and y(t) ∈ R l denote the external disturbance, the plant fault signal, and the measurement output, respectively; Ē, F, and C are known constant matrices of appropriate dimensions. It should be mentioned that the bias-type and the noise-type faults are investigated in this paper. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the network-based structure for an eventtriggered unmanned aircraft system, where event generators 1 and 2 determine whether the sampled measurement outputs and control inputs should be released to the control station and the actuator, respectively, and hold the recently released data packets; the control station consists of the FDF and the controller. In this paper, we assume that network-induced delays occur in both the sensor-to-control station channel and the control station-to-actuator channel, and that there do not exist packet disordering and packet dropouts.</p><p>In practical network-based control systems, communication, especially wireless communication, takes place over a digital network where the data packets are transmitted in discretetime. Thus, a discrete-time NCS is considered in this paper. Suppose that the length of the sampling period is h. The discrete-time expression of the system (3) is described as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu c (k) + Eω(k) + Ff (k) y(k) = Cx(k) (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where A = e Āh , B = </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Modeling NCS Subject to Dual-Channel Network-Induced Delays</head><p>In this section, we model an NCS subject to dual-channel network-induced delays. More specifically, the delays are the sensor-to-control station network-induced delays and the control station-to-actuator network-induced delays. Both the sensor and the control station are event-triggered. Under these conditions, the following FDF and controller can be adopted to generate the residual signal:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ x(k + 1) = A f x(k) + B f y c (k) + D f xc 1 (k) + G f xc 2 (k) u(k) = K x(k) r(k) = C f x(k) (5)</formula><p>where x(k) ∈ R n and u(k) ∈ R m denote the state of the FDF and the output of the FDF, respectively; r(k) ∈ R q denotes the residual signal; y c (k) denotes the measurement output which is transmitted to the control station through a communication network channel; xc 1 (k) and xc 2 (k) denote artificially constructed vectors which will be discussed below in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, while c 1 and c 2 imply that the influences of a communication network channel are taken into account to construct xc 1 (k) and xc 2 (k); and A f , B f , C f , D f , G f , and K are to be designed.</p><p>Note that D f xc 1 (k) and G f xc 2 (k) are introduced in (5) to avoid bilinear matrix inequalities which are encountered in the simultaneous design of FDF and controller.</p><p>As discussed in Section I, if the occurrence of faults has been detected and/or the fault occurrence probability is low, the system can release less data packets into the communication network. Moreover, introducing an adaptively adjusted event-triggering parameter can lead to the efficient utilization of the communication network. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to propose the adaptively adjusted event-triggering mechanism which takes into account both the fault occurrence detection progress (which means that whether a fault occurrence is detected) and the fault occurrence probability.</p><p>The event generators 1 and 2 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> determine whether the newly sampled measurement outputs and control inputs should be released to the control station and the actuator, respectively.</p><p>Event generator 1 adopts the following adaptively adjusted event-triggering condition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">[y(t k + q) -y(t k )] T (W + ρ k I)[y(t k + q) -y(t k )] &gt; α(k)y T (t k )Wy(t k ) (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><p>where W is a symmetric positive definite event-weighting matrix to be designed; ρ k is an adaptively adjusted eventtriggering parameter whose selection criterion is presented in Algorithm 1 to be discussed in Section III; t k , t k + q, t k+1 , and t k+1 + q (k = 0, 1, 2, . . ., while q = 1, 2, . . .) denote sampling instants; α(k) is a coordinated event-triggering parameter, which takes into account the fault occurrence detection progress and the fault occurrence probability, with</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">α(k) = (1 -λ 1 (k))[λ 2 (k)α 1 + (1 -λ 2 (k))α 2 ] + λ 1 (k)α 3 ,</formula><p>where the predefined switching variables λ 1 (k) and λ 2 (k) are equal to 1 or 0; and α 1 , α 2 , and α 3 are given parameters satisfying 0 ≤ α 1 &lt; α 2 &lt; α 3 . Once the event-triggering condition ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">6</ref>) is satisfied, event generator 1 releases y(t k +q) to the communication network channel and stores y(t k +q) as y(t k+1 ); otherwise, the corresponding sampled data packet is discarded purposely.</p><p>The selection criteria for λ 1 (k) and λ 2 (k) are described as follows: if the occurrence of faults has been detected,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">λ 1 (k) = 1, otherwise, λ 1 (k) = 0; if the fault occurrence probability is higher than a given threshold ε with ε ∈ (0, 1), λ 2 (k) = 1, otherwise, λ 2 (k) = 0. Remark 1: It should be mentioned that if λ 1 (k) = 1, then, α(k) = α 3 . Note that α 1 &lt; α 2 &lt; α 3 . Compared with α(k) = α 1 and α(k) = α 2 ,</formula><p>the event-triggering condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> with α(k) = α 3 is more difficult to be satisfied, which implies that less data packets will be released into the communica-</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">tion network. If λ 1 (k) = 0 and λ 2 (k) = 0, then, α(k) = α 2 .</formula><p>Compared with α(k) = α 1 , less data packets will be released since α 1 &lt; α 2 . Thus, the event-triggering condition (6) and the assumption α 1 &lt; α 2 &lt; α 3 are reasonable.</p><p>Remark 2: The problems of fault detection for a discretetime NCS and fault detection for a continuous-time NCS are studied in this paper and our related work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, respectively. It should be mentioned that there are significant differences. A coordinated event-triggering mechanism, which takes into account the fault occurrence detection progress, the fault occurrence probability, and an adaptively adjusted event-triggering parameter selection algorithm, is proposed in this paper, while the simultaneous network bandwidth utilization ratio and fault occurrence probability-based eventtriggering mechanism is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The event-triggered sensor and control station are utilized simultaneously to further reduce the network bandwidth occupation in this paper, while only event-triggered sensors are taken into account in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The sensor-to-control station and the control station-to-actuator network-induced delays are considered simultaneously in this paper. However, only the sensor-to-FDF network-induced characteristics are investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Thus, compared with <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, this paper provides some novel results.</p><p>The event-triggering condition for the event generator 2 is the receiving of measurement outputs at the control station. If a measurement output is received, the control station generate and release control inputs to the actuator; otherwise, no control input is generated and released.</p><p>Throughout this paper, we incorporate a set of buffers at the control station and the actuator for holding the recently received measurement outputs and control inputs, respectively. Suppose that the measurement outputs sampled at the instants t k , t k+1 , . . . are released to the control station, while the measurement outputs sampled between the instants t k and t k+1 (k = 0, 1, 2, . . .) are not released to the control station. Define τ sc k and τ ca k as the sensor-to-control station network-induced delays and the control station-to-actuator network-induced delays, respectively, and τ sc k + τ ca k = τ k . Thus, the control input generated at the instant t k + τ sc k is received by the actuator at the instant t k + τ k . More specifically, for k ∈ {t k + τ k , . . . , t k+1 + τ k+1 -1}, the control input utilized by the plant is described as</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">u c (k) = K x(t k + τ sc k ).</formula><p>Once the actuator receives the control input u c (k) at the instant t k + τ k , the actuator sends an acknowledgment signal which is assigned the highest transmission priority to the control station, where the transmission delay of the acknowledgment signal is negligible. When the control station receives the acknowledgment signal, the measurement output y(t k ) is utilized by the control station. Thus, for k</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">∈ {t k + τ k , . . . , t k+1 + τ k+1 -1}, y c (k) = y(t k ).</formula><p>Combining the discrete-time system (4), the FDF (5), u c (k) and y c (k), one has</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + BK x t k + τ sc k + Eω(k) + Ff (k) x(k + 1) = A f x(k) + B f y(t k ) + D f x(t k ) + G f x t k + τ sc k r(k) = C f x(k)<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where xc 1 (k) and xc 2 (k) in ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) are constructed as x(t k ) and x(t k + τ sc k ), respectively, and x(t k ) is given as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">x(t k ) = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ x(t k ), k ∈ ϒ 1 x(t k + 1), k ∈ ϒ 2 . . . x(t k + d), k ∈ ϒ d+1<label>(8)</label></formula><p>with d denoting a given positive scalar.

Consider the following two cases. 1) If t k+1 -t k + τ k+1 -τ sc k -1 ≤ 1 + τ ca M , define an interval time-varying delay σ (k) = k -(t k + τ sc k ), then, τ ca m ≤ σ (k) ≤ 1 + τ ca M . 2) If t k+1 -t k + τ k+1 -τ sc k -1 &gt; 1 + τ ca M</formula><p>, one can see that there always exists a scalar σ &gt; 0 satisfying</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">t k + σ + τ ca M &lt; t k+1 + τ k+1 -1 ≤ t k + σ + τ ca M + 1.

By combining the event-triggering condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> and Algorithm 1, one can achieve good fault detection performance without causing network congestion. Therefore, the event-triggering condition ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">6</ref>) is more general than the existing ones.</p><p>Remark 6: From step 4 of Algorithm 1, one can see that if N CUTE = NCUTE and ρ k ≥ ρ M , N UT is set as N UT + 1. A large N UT implies that a larger ρ M should be chosen, which leads to the more easily satisfied event-triggering condition ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">6</ref>) and improved fault detection and control performance. Similarly, from step 5 of Algorithm 1, one can see that if N CTE = NCTE and ρ k ≤ ρ m , N T is set as N T + 1. A large N T implies that a smaller ρ m should be chosen, which leads to a more difficultly satisfied event-triggering condition ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">6</ref>) and a reduced communication network occupation. It is clear that there is a tradeoff between the system performance and the communication network occupation. Indeed, using Algorithm 1 can achieve such a tradeoff.</p></div>

Solving the FDF and controller design criteria in Theorem 1, Theorem 2, and Corollary 1, one can obtain the corresponding FDF gains, the controller gains, and the event-weighting matrices, which are not shown here for brevity.</p><p>Suppose that the initial state of the residual systems ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_42">23</ref>) is η(0) = [0.1 -0.2 0 0 0 0 0 0] T , and that the disturbance input ω(k) is a 2-D vector described as</p><formula xml:id="formula_67">ω(k) = ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ 8 k sin(k) 7 k cos(k) ⎤ ⎥ ⎦.</formula><p>First, we consider the biased fault f (k) described as</p><formula xml:id="formula_68">f (k) = 0.02, 100 ≤ k &lt; 200 0, 0 ≤ k &lt; 100, and 200 ≤ k ≤ 300.

As discussed in Section II, different eventtriggering parameters α 1 , α 2 , α 3 , and ρ k can lead to different release instants for the sampled measurement outputs. Suppose that the fault occurrence probability threshold ε = 0.5, and for 0 ≤ k ≤ 300, the actual fault occurrence probability is higher than ε. Under the proposed event-triggering scheme, the coordinated event-triggering parameter α(k) is set as α 1 until the fault occurrence is detected, and α(k) is set as α 3 when the fault occurrence is detected. For 200 ≤ k ≤ 300, since no new fault is detected, the coordinated event-triggering parameter α(k) is set as α 1 .</p><p>For Algorithm 1, the parameters used are ρ m = 0.3, ρ ini = 0.5, and ρ M = 0.7. Then, Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref><ref type="figure">4</ref><ref type="figure">5</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>show the aircraft  state response x(k), the residual response r e (k), the residual evaluation function response J(k), and the release instants, respectively.</p><p>From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>, one can see that the side slip angle β(k), the roll rate p(k), the yaw rate r(k), and the roll angle φ(k) are robust to the disturbance input ω(k). Moreover, β(k), p(k), r(k), and φ(k) are almost not affected by the occurrence of the fault in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>, which illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed controller design. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> demonstrates that the residual response r e (k) can reflect the occurrence of the biased fault signal f (k) in time. From Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and the fault detection logic presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, one can see that the fault detection time corresponding to Fig. <ref type="figure">5(a)-(c</ref>) is 1h, 1h and 1h, respectively. Thus, Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> illustrates that the designed FDFs in Theorem 1, Theorem 2 and Corollary 1 can both reflect the occurrence of the fault in time and recognize the fault without confusing it with the disturbance ω(k). The numbers of triggered events in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>(a) and (b) are 22 and 23, respectively. The numbers of continuously triggered events in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>(a) and (b) are all 0, while the numbers of continuously untriggered events in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>(a) and (b) are 46 and 45, respectively. Thus, one can conclude that the chosen event-triggering parameter α(k) is a little large while ρ k is a little small. If the communication network bandwidth resources are enough, one can choose a smaller event-triggering parameter α(k) and a larger ρ k to transmit more sampled measurement outputs to the control station, and to improve the state response performance correspondingly.</p><p>Remark 7: As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, the r e (k) based on gains calculated using Theorems 1 and 2 is close to that based on gains calculated using Corollary 1. A similar conclusion can be drawn from Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. For Corollary 1 without adopting an eventtriggering mechanism, the numbers of released data packets corresponding to Figs. 4(c) and 5(c) are all 300; while the numbers of triggered events in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> (a) and (b) are 22 and 23, respectively. Thus, Theorems 1 and 2 lead to a greatly reduced network bandwidth occupation without sacrificing the fault detection performance. Moreover, the similarity of r e (k) in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>(a) and (b), and the similarity of J(k) in Fig. <ref type="figure">5(a)</ref> and<ref type="figure">(b</ref>) demonstrate the robustness of the FDF and controller design in Theorems 1 and 2 to different network-induced delays.</p><p>Second, we consider the noise-type fault f (k) described as</p><formula xml:id="formula_70">f (k) = 0.1sin(k)cos(k), 100 ≤ k &lt; 200 0, 0 ≤ k &lt; 100, and 200 ≤ k ≤ 300.<label>(33)</label></formula><p>Figs. 7-10 show the aircraft state response x(k), the residual response r e (k), the residual evaluation function response J(k), and the release instants, respectively.</p><p>As observed from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>, the side slip angle β(k), the roll rate p(k), the yaw rate r(k), and the roll angle φ(k) of the aircraft are robust to the disturbance input ω(k) and the occurrence of the fault in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>, which illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed controller design. Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> demonstrates that  the residual response r e (k) can reflect the occurrence of the noise-type fault signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> in a timely manner. Combining Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> and the fault detection logic presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, one can see that the fault detection time corresponding to Fig. <ref type="figure">9(a)-(c</ref>) is 1h, 1h, and 1h, respectively. Thus, the FDFs designed in this paper can reflect the occurrence of the noise-type fault in time. The numbers of triggered events in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref>(a) and (b) are 37 and 39, respectively. The numbers of continuously triggered events in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref>(a) and (b) are all 0, while the numbers of continuously untriggered events in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref>  40 and 41, respectively. Thus, if the communication network can provide enough bandwidth, one can choose a smaller event-triggering parameter α(k) and a larger ρ k to transmit more sampled measurement outputs to the control station, and to improve the system performance correspondingly. From Figs. 8-10, one can analyze the relationship between the fault detection performance and the numbers of released data packets. The detailed analysis is similar to Remark 7, here it is omitted for brevity.</p><p>Remark 8: Compared with Theorems 1 and 2, the controller gains calculated using Corollary 1 can provide smaller oscillation ranges of the side slip angle β(k), the roll rate p(k), the yaw rate r(k), and the roll angle φ(k), which is verified by Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>. More specifically, if no event-triggering mechanism is adopted, the oscillation ranges of the aircraft states β(k), p(k), r(k), and φ(k) are reduced greatly. However, the settling time of the roll angle φ(k) under the controller gain calculated using Corollary 1 is larger than that under the controller gains calculated using Theorems 1 and 2. Moreover, the numbers of triggered events in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6(a</ref>) and (b), and 10(a) and (b) are 22, 23, 37, and 39, respectively; if no eventtriggering mechanism is adopted, the number of released data packets would be 300. Thus, adopting the event-triggering mechanism can reduce the occupation of the communication network bandwidth greatly. There is a tradeoff between the number of released data packets and the aircraft state response performance.</p><p>As observed from Figs. 6 and 10, compared with the numbers of continuously triggered events, the numbers of continuously untriggered events are large. Thus, one can choose a smaller event-triggering parameter α(k) to release more sampled measurement outputs to the control station. In the  following, we investigate the influences of a small eventtriggering parameter α(k) on the release instants. Suppose that for 0 ≤ k &lt; 100, 100 ≤ k &lt; 200, and 200 ≤ k ≤ 300, the event-triggering parameter α(k) is chosen as α 1 , α 3 , and α 2 , respectively, where four different cases for the values of α 1 , α 2 , and α 3 are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">I</ref>. Then, the numbers of triggered events under gains calculated using Theorems 1 and 2 are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">I</ref>. The release instants with FDF and controller gains calculated using Theorems 1 and 2 are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref>, respectively. On the one hand, from the adaptively adjusted eventtriggering condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, one can conclude that the smaller the event-triggering parameters α 1 , α 2 , and α 3 , the larger the numbers of triggered events, which is verified by Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">I</ref>, Figs. 11, and 12. Similarly, the larger the event-triggering parameter ρ k , the larger the numbers of triggered events. Since the parameter ρ k is adjusted adaptively in Algorithm 1, the release instants and the numbers of triggered events corresponding to different ρ k are omitted here for brevity. On the other hand, from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">I</ref>, one can see that for specific α 1 , α 2 , and α 3 , the numbers of triggered events based on gains calculated using Theorems 1 and 2 are very close, which demonstrates the robustness of the proposed FDF and controller design to the variation of network-induced delays.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>The adaptively adjusted event-triggering mechanism-based simultaneous design of FDF and controller for a discrete-time NCS subject to faults, and the sensor-to-control station and the control station-to-actuator network-induced delays has been studied. The event-triggered sensor and the event-triggered control station, the fault occurrence detection progress, the fault occurrence probability, and an adaptively adjusted eventtriggering parameter have been taken into account to establish new network-based closed-loop models. A new algorithm for choosing the adaptively adjusted event-triggering parameter has been given to achieve the efficient utilization of the communication network bandwidth. Based on the established models, the simultaneous design of FDF and controller has been presented. The effectiveness of the event-triggered simultaneous design of FDF and controller has been verified by the performance analysis of aircraft dynamics.</p></div>
