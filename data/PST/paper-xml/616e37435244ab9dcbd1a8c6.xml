<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Language modeling (LM) is a basic and long-standing task in natural language processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Shannon, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bahl et al., 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chen &amp; Goodman, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Mikolov et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Xie et al., 2017)</ref>. It aims at predicting the upcoming token given the sequence of previous context consisting of a sequence of tokens. A common practice to train a language model is to enforce the model to maximize the probability of the upcoming ground-truth token at training time. At test time, the next token to predict could be the one with the highest probability (via greedy search) or the one that maximizes a window of tokens through the beam search strategy. This form of training-test procedure can be viewed as a process of memorization, or doing a close-book examination, if we compare the training data to a book and inference to doing an examination: The process of iterating N epochs over the training data is comparable to reviewing the book N times and the model needs to memorize what is the most likely to appear given specific context based on the training data. At test time, the book needs to be closed, i.e., the model does not have means to refer to the training data at test time, and the model has to invoke related memory to predict the next token during inference.</p><p>There are two limitations to this close-book examination strategy: (1) the memorization-based language models are usually hard to memorize the knowledge of hard examples (e.g., long-tail cases in the training set); (2) memory required to memorize the whole training data is usually intensive. The difficulty of resolving these two problems can be substantially alleviated if the model can be provided with related contexts from the training set so that the model can reference them for decisions. This process can be viewed as a strategy different from memorization or close-book examinationcopy, or in other words, open-book examination. For example, given a prefix "J. K. Rowling is best known for writing" and we want to predict the upcoming token, a language model will more easily generate token "Harry" if it can refer to the context "J. K. Rowling wrote the Harry Potter fantasy series". Motivated by the observation that "to copy is easier than to memorize", or "an open-book exam is easier than to a close-book exam", in this work, we introduce a new language modeling scheme  </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">c t = (w 1 , • • • , w t−1</formula><p>) (here the context is "The movie is"), a base LM model encodes it into a high-dimensional representation h t , which is then used to query the training datastore to retrieve the nearest contexts along with the visited tokens (marked in red). Right: The tokens in the input context and the retrieved tokens comprise a graph and are viewed as two types of nodes: nodes from the original text and nodes from the neighbor text. Intra-context edges link tokens within the same input, and inter-context edges link tokens from the retrieved contexts to the original context. After modeling the graph as a whole with GNNs, we use the updated representation of w t−1 (token "is" in this example) to compute the likelihood of the next token.</p><p>-GNN-LM, which provides an LM model with the ability to reference similar contexts from the entire training corpus as cues for prediction. The similar contexts, defined as the k neighbors of the input in the training corpus, are served as additional references for the model to predict the next token. To integrate retrieved neighbors with the input, we build a directed heterogeneous graph on top of the input and the extracted contexts, where nodes are the tokens and edges represent the connections between them. We define two types of nodes -the original node from the input context and the neighbor node from the extracted contexts, and two types of edges -the inter-context edge and the intra-context edge that respectively associate inter (i.e., between retrieved contexts and input contexti.e., context within the input) and intra (i.e., context within the inputi.e., context in the retrieved sentences) contexts. A graph neural network (GNN) is employed to aggregate information from both inter-context and intra-context, which is used to generate the target token. We observe that the proposed scheme retrieves the related contexts as references, making it significantly easier for the model to predict upcoming words in the LM task.</p><p>We further combine GNN-LM with kNN-LM <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Khandelwal et al., 2019)</ref>, an orthogonal technique enhancing language models, to improve the overall performance of our model. We carry out experiments on three widely used language modeling benchmarks: WikiText-103, One Billion Word and Enwik8. Experimental results show that our proposed framework outperforms the strong baseline on all three benchmarks. Specifically, applying the GNN-LM framework to a strong base LM leads to substantial performance boost (-1.9 perplexity) on WikiText-103, and combining with kNN-LM achieves a new state-of-the-art perplexity of 14.8 -a 3.9 point improvement over the base LM. We perform comprehensive analyses including complexity analysis and the effects of different components to better understand the mechanics of GNN-LM.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">OVERALL PIPELINE</head><p>We present the overall pipeline of our model in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. At each time step t, a neural language model (LM) f (•) first encodes a sequence of context tokens c t = (w 1 , w 2 , ..., w t−1 ) to a high-dimensional representation h t = f (c t ) ∈ R d , where d is the dimension of hidden states. Then a transformation matrix W ∈ R V ×d is used to estimate the probability of the t-th token p(w t |c t ) = softmax(W h t ), where V is the size of the vocabulary. We augment the vanilla neural language model by allowing it to reference samples in the training set that are similar to the current decoded sequence. Concretely, we leverage a novel self-attention augmented Graph Neural Network (GNN) on top of the vanilla LM to enable message passing between the context c and retrieved reference tokens from the training set, updating the representation h t generated by the vanilla LM. The updated representation, which aggregates additional information from reference tokens, is then used to estimate p LM (w t |c t ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">GRAPH CONSTRUCTION</head><p>The first step of our proposed framework is to build a graph capturing the connections between the context tokens c t = (w 1 , w 2 , ..., w t−1 ) and those similar to c t in the training set. To this end, we construct a directed heterogeneous graph, where the nodes are tokens from c t or the tokens from the neighbor contexts retrieved from the training set, and the edges represent different relationships between the nodes to be discussed below.</p><p>Formally, we define a graph as G = (V, E, A, R, τ, φ), where V is a collection of nodes v and E is a collection of edges e. We define two types of nodes A = {a o , a n }, where a o means that the node is within the input c t . a n means the node is in N (c t ), the set of extracted contexts within the neighborhood of c t . We also define two types of edges R = {r inter , r intra }, where r inter means inter-context connection (from a n nodes to a o nodes) and r intra means intra-context connection (between two nodes of same type). Each token within the input is a node of type a o , and edges of type r intra are constructed from node w i to w j (i ≤ j), which can be viewed as a graph interpretation of the transformer structure. Both nodes and edges are associated with their respective type mapping functions τ (v) : V → A and φ(e) : E → R.</p><p>For an input context c t , we retrieve k nearest neighbors</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">N (c t ) = {c (1) t1 , ..., c<label>(k)</label></formula><p>t k } of c t from the training set as follows: we first use h t to query the cached representations of all tokens for training samples, where the cached representations are obtained by a pretrained LM. The distance is measured by the cosine similarity<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> , and we retrieve the top K tokens denoted by {w (i) j }. The superscript (i)  denotes the i-th training sample and the subscript j denotes the j-th time step. w (i) j thus means that the j-th time step of the i-th training sample is retrieved as one of the nearest neighbors to h t . w  j+1 , which is the token right after the retrieved token w (i) j , to directly augment the output probability, we explicitly take advantage of all contextual tokens near w (i) ti as additional information in the form of graph nodes. In this way, the model is able to reference similar contexts in the training set and leverage the corresponding ground-truth target tokens via the heterogeneous graph built on both the original input tokens and the context reference tokens.</p><p>For the neighbor context window size l and r, we set l = r = 1 in all experiments. During experiments, we find that using shallow (i.e. 3) GNN layers and adding r intra edges between adjacent tokens can alleviate overfitting. Since a 3-layer GNN only aggregates information from 3-hop nodes in the graph, using larger l and r have no influence on GNN representations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">GNN ON THE CONSTRUCTED GRAPH</head><p>We now use graph neural networks (GNNs) to aggregate and percolate the token information based on the graph constructed in Section 2.2. In this work, to accommodate the modeling of r intra from node w i to w j (i ≤ j) within c t , where Transformer with self-attention is usually adopted, we extend the self-attention mechanism to r inter , and construct a self-attention augmented GNN.</p><p>Specifically, the l-th layer representation of node n is computed by (here we use the superscript [l] to represent the l-th layer):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">h [l] n = Aggregate ∀s∈N (n) (Attention(s, e, n) • Feature(s, e, n)) + h [l−1] n .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Attention(s, e, n) estimates the importance of the source node s on target node n with relationship e, Feature(s, e, n) is the information feature that s should pass to n, and Aggregate(•) aggregates the neighborhood message with the attention weights. To draw on the information in the heterogeneous graph, we use different sets of parameters for different node types τ (•) and different edge types φ(•) akin to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hu et al. (2020)</ref>.</p><p>Attention Similar to the multi-head attention mechanism of Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref>, the Attention(•, •, •) operator in our model consists of h heads, which compute attention weights independently, followed by concatenation to get the final output. For simplicity, we only describe the single-head situation below. For each edge (s, e, n), the representation of target node n is mapped to a query vector Q(n), and the representation of source node s is mapped to a key vector K(s). The scaled inner-production is then used to compute the attention weight between Q(n) and K(s), which is further normalized over all edges that have the same edge type:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">K(s) = W k τ (s) h [l−1] s , Q(n) = W q τ (n) h [l−1] n , Attention(s, e, n) = 1 Z exp K(s)W ATT φ(e) Q(n) • µ τ (s),φ(e),τ (n) √ d , Z = s ∈N (n),e ∈φ(e)</formula><p>Attention(s , e , n),</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">)<label>2</label></formula><p>where d is the hidden dimensionality, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">W q τ (s) ∈ R d×d , W k τ (n) ∈ R d×d , W ATT φ(e) ∈ R d×d , µ ∈ R |A|×|R|×|A| are learnable model parameters.</formula><p>Feature Parallel to the calculation of attention weights, we propagate information from source node s to target node n. The single-head feature is defined by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Feature(s, e, n) = W v τ (s) h [l−1] s W FEA φ(e) ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where W v τ (s) ∈ R d×d and W FEA φ(e) ∈ R d×d are learnable model parameters.</p><p>Aggregate Aggregate(•) weight-sums the feature Message(s, e, n) within the vicinity using Attention(s, e, n), and the result is then linearly projected into a d-dimensional representation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Aggregate(•) = W o τ (n) ⊕ ∀s∈N (n) (Attention(s, e, n) • Feature(s, e, n)) (4)</formula><p>where ⊕ is element-wise addition and W o τ (n) ∈ R d×d is model parameter. The representation of token w t−1 from the last layer is used to compute the language model probability p LM (w t |c t ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">kNN BASED PROBABILITY FOR NEXT TOKEN</head><p>We further incorporate the proposed model with kNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Khandelwal et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Meng et al., 2021)</ref>, a related but orthogonal technique, to improve the performance of our model. It extends a vanilla LM by linearly interpolating it with a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) model. Concretely, for each input context c t = (w 1 , w 2 , ..., w t−1 ), we retrieve the k nearest neighbors</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">N (c t ) = {c (1) t1 , ..., c (k) t k },</formula><p>and compute the kNN based probability for the next token by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">p(w t |c t ) = λp kNN (w t |c t ) + (1 − λ)p LM (w t |c t ), p kNN (w t |c t ) = 1 Z k i=1 1 wt=w (i) t i exp cos(f (c t ), f (c (i) ti ))/T ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>with Z being the normalization factor, f (•) is the neural language model encoding contexts to high dimensional representations, cos(•, •) is cosine similarity, and λ and T are hyperparameters.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">EXPERIMENTS</head><p>We conduct experiments on three widely-used language modeling datasets: WikiText-103 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Merity et al., 2016)</ref>, One Billion Word <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chelba et al., 2013)</ref> and Enwik8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Mahoney, 2011)</ref>. For all experiments, we add a 3-layer self-attention augmented GNN on top of the pretrained base LM, and use the same hidden dimension and number of heads as our base LM. We retrieve k = 1, 024 nearest neighbors for each source token, among them the top 128 neighbors are used in graph, and all of them are used in computing the kNN-based probability p kNN (w t |c t ). For the neighbor context window size l and r in Section 2.2, we set l = 1 and r = 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">TRAINING DETAILS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>KNN Retrieval</head><p>In order to reduce memory usage and time complexity, in practice we use FAISS <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Johnson et al., 2019)</ref> for fast approximate kNN search. Concretely, we quantized each dense vector to q bytes, followed with a clustering of all vectors to C clusters. During retrieval, we only search in 32 clusters whose centroids are nearest to query vector. For WikiText-103 and Enwik8 datasets, which contain approximately 100M tokens, we set q = 128 and c = 4, 096. For One Billion Word dataset, we set q = 64 and c = 1, 048, 576 (2 20 ) for faster search.</p><p>Data Leakage Prevention When searching for the k nearest neighbors of c t = (w 1 , w 2 , ..., w t−1 ), we need to make sure each reference neighbor token does not leak information for w t . Specifically, we should not retrieve c t+1 = (w 1 , w 2 , ..., w t ) as reference, otherwise the model prediction is trivial to optimize since the information of target token is already included in the graph. Let T be the maximum sequence length and L be the number of layers. Practically, the representation of each token is dependent on previous T and T × L tokens for Transformer and Transformer-XL, respectively. Therefore we ignore all the neighboring nodes within this interval in graph construction during training. During inference, we do not impose this constraint.</p><p>Feature Quantization The input node representations of the graph neural network H [0] are generated by a pretrained neural language model. To accelerate training and inference, we wish to cache all token representations of the entire training set. However, frequently accessing Terabytes of data is prohibitively slow. To address this issue, we followed <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Meng et al. (2021)</ref> to use product quantization (PQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Jegou et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ge et al., 2013)</ref> to compress the high-dimensional representation of each token. In our experiments, quantizing representations from 1,024-dimension floating-point dense vectors to 128 bytes reduces the memory consumption from 2.3TB to 96GB for the One Billion Word dataset, thus making the end-to-end model training feasible.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Wu et al., 2018)</ref> 0.34B 26.7 Mesh-Tensorflow <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Shazeer et al., 2018)</ref> 4.9B 24.0 Evolved Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Shazeer et al., 2018)</ref> -28.6 Transformer-XL <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dai et al., 2019)</ref> 0.8B 21.8 Adaptive inputs (base) <ref type="bibr">(Baevski &amp; Auli, 2018)</ref> 0.36B 25.2 Adaptive inputs (large) <ref type="bibr">(Baevski &amp; Auli, 2018)</ref> 0.46B 23.9</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WikiText</head><p>base LM <ref type="bibr">(Baevski &amp; Auli, 2018</ref>   shows the comparison between base LM and GNN-LM in speed in WikiText-103. We observe that the speed of GNN-LM is approximately 8 to 20 times slower than the base LM <ref type="bibr">(Baevski &amp; Auli, 2018)</ref> with respect to different k.</p><p>It is worth noting that the overhead of the proposed model comes from kNN retrieval, which can be done in advance and thus does not result in time overhead when running the model. Specifically, the time overhead for retrieval comes from two processes: 1) building data indexes with token representations in the train set; 2) collecting nearest neighbors by querying the data indexes. For WikiText-103, building data indexes takes approximately 24 hours on a CPU machine with 64 cores. And querying data indexes for all tokens in train set takes approximately 30 hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">ABLATION STUDY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of Neighbors per Token</head><p>The number of neighbors per source token (i.e., k) significantly influences how much information could be retrieved from the training set. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>(c) shows that test perplexity monotonically decreases when k increases from 8 to 128. This trend implies that even larger improvements can be achieved with a larger value of k.</p><p>Neighbor Quality We evaluate the quality of kNN retrieval by examining whether the target token to predict (i.e., w t ) is the same as the token that comes right after the retrieved nearest sequence using Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022 kNN recall range <ref type="bibr">[0, 4) [4, 27) [27, 137) [137, 463) [463, 1024]</ref> base LM -7. </p><p>t k }, the quality of kNN retrieval is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">R(c t ) = k i=1 1 w t = w (i) ti ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where w t is the target token to predict at time step t, and w</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">(i)</formula><p>ti is the token that comes right after the i-th retrieved neighbor. We calculate and then divide all samples in the WikiText-103 test set by the recall value into 5 buckets, with each bucket containing around 50k tokens. Results are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>. We observe that GNN-kNN-LM gains more relative improvements to base LM when the quality of kNN retrieval reaches a relatively high level.</p><p>Representation in kNN We finally study the effect of using different representations in the kNN scoring function in Section 2.4. We experiment with two types of representations: (1) from the last layer of Transformer, which is the default setting, and (2) from the last layer of GNN. The model performances with different choices for query and key are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>. Results show that using GNN representations for both query and key leads to the best performance. It suggests that GNN learns better representations for context similarity. We also observe that the performance is marginally worse when both query and key are using Transformer representations. Considering that building an additional datastore for GNN representations is computationally intensive, in practice we can directly use Transformer representations (the default setting). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this work, we propose GNN-LM, a new paradigm for language modeling that extends vanilla neural language model by allowing to reference similar contexts in the entire training corpus. High dimensional token representations are used to retrieve k nearest neighbors of the input context as reference. We build a directed heterogeneous graph for each input context, where nodes are tokens from either the input context or the retrieved neighbor contexts, and edges represent connections between tokens. Graph neural networks are then leveraged to aggregate information from the retrieved contexts to decode the next token. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms strong baselines in standard benchmark datasets, and by combining with kNN LM, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art results on WikiText-103. In future work, we will consider improving efficiency for building the graph and retrieving nearest neighbors.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: An overview of the proposed GNN-LM model pipeline. Left: Given an input contextc t = (w 1 , • • • , w t−1) (here the context is "The movie is"), a base LM model encodes it into a high-dimensional representation h t , which is then used to query the training datastore to retrieve the nearest contexts along with the visited tokens (marked in red). Right: The tokens in the input context and the retrieved tokens comprise a graph and are viewed as two types of nodes: nodes from the original text and nodes from the neighbor text. Intra-context edges link tokens within the same input, and inter-context edges link tokens from the retrieved contexts to the original context. After modeling the graph as a whole with GNNs, we use the updated representation of w t−1 (token "is" in this example) to compute the likelihood of the next token.</figDesc></figure>

Accordingly, training GNN requires approximately k times larger memory than vanilla LM, since we have to maintain hidden representations of each node for backward propagation. We propose two strategies to alleviate the space issue: (1) For all datasets, we first train with a smaller k = 32, then further finetune the model with a larger k = 128; and (2) For datasets with extremely long dependency (e.g., WikiText-103), we truncate the context to a smaller length (e.g., 128) instead of the original longer context (e.g., 3,072) used by vanilla Transformer(Baevski &amp; Auli, 2018). Note that we build GNN model on top of the vanilla Transformer, and the parameters of Transformer are fixed when GNN parameters are being trained. Hence, the GNN could exploit long dependency information learned by Transformer without having to build a large graph with long context.
