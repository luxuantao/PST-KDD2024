<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study aims to address two research gaps in prior studies on knowledge sharing in virtual communities (VCs). First, prior studies have focused on knowledge sharing VCs with no explicit reward system, but VCs sharing knowledge based on a competition-based reward system (e.g., transactional VCs) have not been explored. Second, prior related studies have concentrated on the determinants of initial participation in sharing knowledge rather than sustained participation despite there being important distinctions between these two stages of participation behavior. In this study, we focus on understanding sustained participation in knowledge sharing in transactional VCs by drawing on expectancy-value theory and a social learning process. Considering that a social learning process is involved in maintaining sustained participation, we propose that task complexity and self-efficacytwo social learning factorsmoderate the relationship between motivation and sustained participation. A field survey with 205 subjects in a transactional virtual community was conducted to test the research model. According to the findings, extrinsic and intrinsic motivations significantly influence sustained participation intention. A negative interaction effect between extrinsic motivation and task complexity, as well as positive interaction effect between intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy, was also observed. A non-linear interaction effect between intrinsic motivation and task complexity was also found. Study implications and future research directions are also discussed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Virtual communities (VCs) as an important Internet-based platform to facilitate knowledge sharing among individuals have been widely discussed in information systems (IS) research 1  <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref>. Knowledge contributors in VCs share their knowledge with others based on a mechanism of "gift-giving" <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> or reciprocity <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. However, as knowledge provided by participants is deemed to be a public good <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> that is free to all, no economic value is generated. This serves as an impetus for researchers and practitioners to explore a new VC business model to extract economic value from shared knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>.</p><p>Since 2005, a new form of virtual community supporting the realization of economic value has emerged and rapidly developed worldwide. Popular applications include Amazon's Mechanical Turk and myTino.com in the USA, as well as Taskcn.com and Witkey.com in China. In these VCs, knowledge seekers post tasks and extend certain monetary compensations in sourcing others' knowledge to resolve problems, while problem solvers participate in these tasks and compete with other solvers to earn monetary rewards (a business model also often called crowdsourcing <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81]</ref>). In other words, unlike knowledge sharing in previous VCs, knowledge contributors in these VCs leverage their knowledge to gain payment through a competition-based reward system. Since knowledge exchange in this context is considered a transaction, this new type of VC is termed as a transactional virtual community (TVC). In contrast, we term the previous type of VC with an emphasis on relational or social exchange as relational virtual community (RVC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. It is worth noting that while there are several other ways to extract economic value from virtual communities as discussed in previous literature, such as e-commerce communities and viral marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>, our study focuses on the TVC in which economic value is extracted through knowledge exchange or knowledge-based problem solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</p><p>This new application has achieved enormous success over the past several years. For example, over 20 websites have adopted this business model in China. A typical website, Taskcn.com, currently has over 2.8 million solvers, over 39,000 tasks, and over 4 million US dollars in task reward. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> Likewise, over 178,000 knowledge-sourcing requests, human intellectual tasks in their terms, have been posted on Amazon's Mechanical Turk. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref>The immense business potential of this new form of VC has urged both scholars and practitioners to consider how it could be sustained. Since the existence and sustainment of VCs rely heavily on ongoing participation of knowledge contributors who share their expertise <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>, their continuous participation in knowledge sharing becomes a critical success factor. However, the turnover rate of solvers remains a significant challenge for the survival of TVCs. As numerous solvers compete to gain the rewards yet a mere handful could win in the end, those who frequently lose in the competition may leave the TVC websites. For example, Taskcn.com has over 2.8 million registered members, but a mere 0.24 million (less than 10%) gain income through continued participation in online tasks. Furthermore, active solvers only occupy a minimal part of the total number of solvers. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence solvers' sustained sharing behavior in TVCs is critical. This goal constitutes the objective of the present study.</p><p>Prior related studies have identified that extrinsic and intrinsic motivations are important factors leading to initial participation in knowledge sharing in VCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref>. In understanding sustained participation in TVCs, the present study builds on and exceeds these findings by presenting two important theoretical distinctions. First, this study focuses on knowledge sharing in the TVC, a new form of VC that facilitates knowledge sharing through a competition-based reward system, which is in contrast to previously studied organizational settings or VCs with no explicit reward systems. Second, this study addresses the issue of maintaining sustained participation, rather than initial participation, in knowledge sharing. Factors depicted as being important for initial participation may be inadequate to explain sustained participation. In fact, research in other virtual community settings has suggested that the strength of initial motivations may change over time. In particular, initial motivations may not always be strong enough to sustain participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. This implies the existence of moderating factors between initial motivations and participation.</p><p>To address these two theoretical distinctions, an innovative approach that integrates the social learning process into expectancy-value theory (EVT) is used. Drawing on the EVT <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, motivational factors, which refer to extrinsic and intrinsic benefits gained through participation in online tasks, are framed as value perceptions to predict participation behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>. Expectancy perceptions, which reflect the probability to achieve the intended outcome, serve as the moderator between value perceptions and participation behavior. Solvers are theorized to renew their expectancy perceptions of the complexity of the task (e.g., task complexity) and their ability to complete it (e.g., self-efficacy) in the continued participation stage through social learning process <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>. In this paper, it is argued that this perception reconstruction process may alter the explanatory mechanisms through which motivational factors influence participation behavior.</p><p>This study contributes to the theoretical understanding of sustained participation in TVC in several important ways. First, existing findings with respect to the role of intrinsic versus extrinsic motivations in affecting knowledge sharing in RVC are extended to the context of TVC by identifying the important distinctions between the two types of communities. These distinctions provide insights into the differential effect of these motivations on knowledge sharing behavior in the TVC context. Second, integrating EVT and the notion of social learning, this study contributes to motivation literature by theorizing and empirically verifying the moderating role of expectancy perceptions on the relationship between motivations and sustained participation behavior.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Knowledge sharing in virtual communities</head><p>A virtual community is defined by Porter <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> as "an aggregation of individuals or business partners who interact around a shared interest, where the interaction is at least supported and/or mediated by technology and guided by some protocols or norms." Virtual communities have long been understood, as well as practiced, as an Internet-based space for socialization <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, where "social aggregations … emerge from the Net when enough people carry on those public discussion long enough, with sufficient human feeling, to form webs of personal relationships in cyberspace" <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. As virtual communities of this type exist to facilitate the exchanges and interactions that bring value to members and form relationships with other members, they are termed relational virtual communities (RVCs), where knowledge sharing activities are driven by a social norm (e.g., reciprocity), and knowledge is treated as a public good that is free to all members <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>.</p><p>The majority of prior studies on knowledge sharing in virtual communities have focused on the motives of initial participation in relational virtual communities. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, the factors associated with participation can be generally classified into two streams: personal motives and social motives. Personal motives can be further classified into extrinsic (e.g., extrinsic reward and reputation or image) and intrinsic motives (e.g., sense of self-worth, learning, and enjoyment in helping others) <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>, whereas social motives include community advancement, social identity, reciprocity, and a sense of belonging. These prior studies offer a sound understanding of why people initially share their knowledge in the RVC context. Besides, there are a few previous studies on continued participation in RVC <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref> and initial participation in TVC <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. However, previous research on continued participation in RVC focuses on the role of satisfaction and habit <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> from the information systems continuance perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> rather than from the motivational perspective. The previous research on participation in the TVC context is still at its infancy stage, focusing on conceptual modeling or design issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. Knowledge on the sustained participation in the TVC context from the motivational perspective is lacking. Thus, it is imperative to (1) learn the extent to which important factors in the RVC context remain applicable in the TVC context, and (2) identify influencing factors that are distinctive to the context of sustained participation. Next, distinctions between RVCs and TVCs and between initial participation and sustained participation are discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Transactional virtual community versus relational virtual community</head><p>Recently, researchers have transcended the social view of virtual communities by conceptualizing virtual communities as a business model <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>, on the premise that information and knowledge shared by solvers can create actual economic value <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Unlike prior VC which relies heavily on social relationships for knowledge sharing, this new form of VC takes knowledge sharing as a transaction. To further address this distinction, we define prior knowledge sharing VC, which treats knowledge sharing as a social activity, as RVC (e.g., Wikipedia and Yahoo! Answers). On the other hand, we define the new form of VC that stresses the transactional nature of knowledge sharing as being a transactional virtual community (TVC) (e.g., Mechanical Turk and Taskcn.com). Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, the type of TVC that we focus on in this study extracts economic value from knowledge exchange or knowledge-based problem solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, as opposed to other common ways such as advertisement or commodity trading <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. The notion of TVC specified in our study is approximated by several other concepts, such as crowdsourcing and an open source software (OSS) community <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Crowdsourcing is a new outsourcing approach that takes tasks as an open call to an undefined, large group of people <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. This approach has become more and more popular nowadays for advancing innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, harnessing crowd wisdom <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, and leveraging cost-advantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. It has been practiced in global IT outsourcing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, in idea competition or open innovation (e.g., where companies collect innovative ideas from customers) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, and in knowledge contribution, such as Wikipedia and online question and answer sites (e.g., Yahoo! Answers) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. A TVC can thus be considered to be a subset of crowdsourcing platforms. It is specific to the types of crowdsourcing platforms that feature (1) micro-tasks manageable through individual effort rather than by means of largescale projects in need of collective effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>, and (2) an explicit competition-based reward system through which solvers can be compensated for sharing knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>. When compared to OSS communities, TVC differs in three aspects: (1) the monetary reward system is not explicitly available in an OSS community <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>; (2) OSS stresses team work and collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> while TVC emphasizes individual activity and competition; (3) tasks in an OSS community are often cumulative, lasting for a long time <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> while tasks in TVC are one-off.</p><p>After clarifying the relationship between TVC and its relevant concepts, we will here highlight the distinctions between TVC and RVC. There are two key distinctions between TVC and RVC. First, knowledge is viewed as a public good in RVC <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78]</ref> but as a private good in TVC. Second, a knowledge exchange in RVC is treated as a social exchange activity that relies on the relational contract <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, such as reciprocity and norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref>, but economic exchange activities in TVC stress economic benefit and cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. These distinctions between the RVC and the TVC contexts have important implications to the present study. First, as an economic exchange is the principle for knowledge exchange in TVCs, problem solvers more likely base their decision-making choices on personal rather than on social benefits. In this situation, social motives such as reciprocity, which adopt the role of relational or psychological contract <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, become not so important as personal benefits. Second, extrinsic motivation such as monetary rewards should assume a more important role in TVCs than in RVCs. Prior studies on knowledge sharing in RVCs have revealed mixed results with respect to the relationship between extrinsic motivation and knowledge contribution behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. One possible explanation for the insignificance of the effect of extrinsic motivation may be the social exchange nature of knowledge exchange in the relational contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref>. When social exchange or gift economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> dominate people's knowledge sharing behavior, extrinsic motivation may not be a salient predictor. However, in the TVC context where economic exchange is the principle, the role of extrinsic motivation should become more important.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Initial participation versus sustained participation</head><p>The sustainability of virtual communities is an important criterion for measuring the success of VCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73]</ref>. A sound virtual community should preserve its membership base and sustain participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>. However, users may initially participate in a virtual community and later leave without intending to return. Differing from initial solvers, sustained solvers have accumulated a certain amount of participation experience from which they can attain feedbacks and adjust their subsequent expectations through a social learning process <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. This social learning process may result in motivational factors that work in the initial participation stage yet lose their power in sustained participation. For instance, before participants actually participate in an online task, they form their expectancy beliefs by observing others' behavior or simply using their own imaginations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. At this stage, participants may be of the opinion that they have adequate ability to fulfill the task or that the task is easy. This would explain why they tend to initially participate in online tasks (i.e., initial high expectancy perceptions). However, after participating in several tasks, these initial participants may diverge in terms of the feedbacks they attain from past experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. For example, some of them may have successfully completed several tasks and gained monetary rewards. This positive feedback would in turn enhance their expectancy perceptions and encourage them to continue participating in online tasks. In contrast, others may not have earned any rewards due to their low level of performance. Such negative feedback would negatively affect their expectancy perceptions, e.g., they may feel that they do not have enough ability or that the task is too difficult to complete. These updated expectancy perceptions could cause them to leave a transaction virtual community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Expectancy-value theory (EVT)</head><p>EVT is used to address the two aforementioned important distinctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. It suggests that a person's actions are related to his/her subjective value of behavioral outcomes and the expectancy or probability to conduct the behavior successfully and achieve outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. It has become the foundation of a series of behavioral theories, including the theory of reasoned action <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and the uses and gratifications theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>.</p><p>EVT suggests that the effect of motivation on participation behavior is contingent upon expectancy perceptions. While the influence of motivational factors on behavioral intentions may not be supported at all times, they can be very useful under selected conditions. According to EVT, as expectancy (or value) increases, the effect of value (or expectancy) on behavioral intentions increases as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. Specifically, when the expectancy level to complete a task successfully is high, people's value perception will strongly influence their participation intentions. In contrast, if their expectancy level is extremely low, regardless of how high or low their value perceptions are, people may not participate in the task, indicating a weak relationship between value and intentions. Thus, expectancy-relevant factors may moderate the relationships between motivational factors and sustained behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75]</ref>. This concept is helpful for understanding why people who are equally motivated to initially participate in online tasks may ultimately diverge in their degree of sustained participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Reformulation of expectancy through the social learning process</head><p>The original form of EVT is a static model that takes into consideration how expectancy and value perceptions influence behavioral intentions at a single point in time <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. However, a person's beliefs may not remain stable at all times but may rather evolve through a social learning process. By drawing upon social learning process, the recent development of EVT makes a paradigm shift from a static model to a dynamic model. The modern EVT explains how expectancy perceptions are renewed through feedbacks from past behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. For example, gratification theory argues that prior behavior and gratification can reshape people's expectancy perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, and the goal-setting theory suggests that people adjust their perceptions on self-efficacy and task complexity according to their prior performance and satisfaction levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. The notion of renewed expectancy perceptions is beneficial for understanding the distinction between initial participation and sustained participation discussed earlier in this paper. Since value perceptions are considered to be a set of stable, general perceptions of what is desirable and emerge from both society's norms and the individual's psychological needs (i.e., initial value is equal to adjusted value) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, the reason why people initially participate in online tasks yet fail to maintain sustained participation can be attributed to the evolution of expectancy perceptions. In particular, those who initially have high expectancy levels that subsequently become low will not engage in continued participation in online tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research model and hypotheses</head><p>The research model is founded on the integration of EVT and social learning process (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Extrinsic and intrinsic motivations are used to address value-relevant factors. Value is regarded as a key concept in motivational theories. More specifically, people are motivated to perform a particular behavior because they expect to attain a certain value to satisfy innate needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>. Value can be produced by outcomes (i.e., instrumental value) or process (i.e., experiential value), and these two values respectively correspond to extrinsic and intrinsic motivations in terms of the self determination theory or SDT <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>.</p><p>Self-efficacy and task complexity are viewed as two expectancyrelevant factors. Task complexity refers to the person's perception of the extent to which a task is difficult to complete, and self-efficacy refers to a person's perceived ability and competence to accomplish particular tasks. People can attribute their successes or failures to internal factors such as self-efficacy and to external factors such as task complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>. After their initial participation in online tasks, solvers will renew their perceptions of self-efficacy and task complexity by assessing their previous performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. For example, when solvers achieve a low performance level in a previous participation, they may lower their perceptions of self-efficacy or raise their perceptions of task complexity. It is worth noting that self-efficacy and task complexity are not initial perceptions but perceptions formed on the basis of prior experience. These adjusted perceptions, which are based on first-hand experience rather than on initial perceptions arising from the imagination, may prove to be more accurate in capturing solvers' perceptions of their ability and task complexity, and subsequently be more relevant to sustained participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Extrinsic and intrinsic motivation</head><p>Motivation theories such as self-determination theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref> have postulated two basic behavioral motivations: extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation. The former refers to performing an act because it leads to a separable outcome, whereas the latter pertains to performing an act because it is inherently interesting or enjoyable <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. In the present research context, extrinsic motivation mainly refers to monetary rewards provided by seekers as compensation for solvers' time and effort expended on online tasks, whereas intrinsic motivation refers to the enjoyment and sense of self-worth caused by participating in online tasks.</p><p>Viewing knowledge as a private good, solvers in TVCs tend to exchange knowledge through market mechanisms in order to receive commensurate benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. Therefore, extrinsic rewards should play a more important role in the knowledge sharing process in TVCs than in RVCs where social exchange is the norm <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. When solvers formulate a decision based on whether or not to continue participating in an online task, they consider the value of behavioral outcomes caused by the task participation activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. Extrinsic rewards, as a key source of solvers' value perceptions, should have a positive influence on solvers' continuance intentions. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p><p>H1a. Extrinsic motivation is positively associated with continuance intention.</p><p>Intrinsic motivation is considered a determinant of solvers' continuance intentions. According to the self-determination theory, individual behavior will be evoked when people conclude that the behavior can satisfy their needs for competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>. Prior studies in the RVC context have revealed that people will engage in knowledge contribution when they experience a sense of self-worth and achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Since TVC is managed through a competition-based reward system, solvers can attain a sense of achievement when they compete with peers and win the competition. Thus, intrinsic motivation has a positive influence on continuance intention as well. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p><p>H1b. Intrinsic motivation is positively associated with continuance intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Moderating effects of task complexity and self-efficacy</head><p>Task complexity is defined as solvers' perceptions on the extent to which online tasks in TVCs are difficult to complete. Self-efficacy, meanwhile, pertains to their perceptions of the extent to which they possess the competence to accomplish online tasks in TVCs. Since the task fulfillment process is a person-task interaction process, the probability of succeeding in particular tasks should be associated with both persons and tasks. This paper argues that the probability of succeeding in a task is determined by the relationship between an individual's ability and the ability required by the task. This relationship is particularly important since, when the individual's ability level exceeds the required ability, that individual is more likely to succeed; in contrast, when the individual's ability level is lower than the required ability, the probability of success will be low as well. Therefore, expectancy is positively associated with self-efficacy but negatively associated with task complexity.</p><p>According to the EVT, a positive interaction effect exists between expectancy and value <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75]</ref>. This implies that extrinsic motivation can only exert its influence on participation intentions when solvers consider the probability of success to be high. When the probability to win is low, even if extrinsic rewards are high, solvers may still not participate in the task. In contrast, when the probability to win is high, even low extrinsic rewards may lead to high participation intention. Therefore, the probability to succeed positively moderates the relationship between extrinsic motivation and continuance intention. This likewise explains why people who initially participate in online tasks diverge in their sustained participation behavior; those who perceive high probability to succeed will stay while those who believe the probability to succeed to be low will leave. Inasmuch as task complexity is negatively associated with the probability to succeed, while self-efficacy is positively associated with the probability to succeed, this paper proposes that task complexity should weaken the relationship between extrinsic motivation and continuance intention, whereas self-efficacy should strengthen this relationship. Thus, the following hypotheses are proposed:</p><p>H2a. Task complexity negatively moderates the relationship between extrinsic motivation and continuance intention.</p><p>H2b. Self-efficacy positively moderates the relationship between extrinsic motivation and continuance intention.</p><p>Intrinsic motivation can influence participation intention depending on its fulfilling two conditions: (1) the task accomplishment can demonstrate solvers' competence, and (2) the solver believes that she/he can succeed in the task. With respect to the first condition, if a solver can successfully complete a task, yet task fulfillment cannot indicate if the solver is competent, participating in this task cannot satisfy her/his needs for competence. For example, a simple task can be easily completed but participating in it may not provide a sense of achievement. As to the second condition, a sense of achievement can be attained only when solvers succeed in the task. If a person participates in a task that is far beyond her/his ability, it is impossible for her/him to accomplish the task, and the intrinsic motivation may not be satisfied either. In other words, only when these two conditions are present at the same time, can intrinsic motivation explain the cause of participation behavior.</p><p>Task complexity is associated with both of these two conditions, but in competing ways. On the one hand, task complexity indicates the extent of the challenge connected with innate human needs for competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. When a task is more complex, completing the task can reflect a higher competence; hence, it is more likely to satisfy people's needs for competence. On the other hand, task complexity is negatively related to the probability to complete the task. In this case, when a task becomes more complex, people are faced with greater difficulty to complete the task and achieve a sense of competence. To summarize, when a task is too simple, completing it cannot bring a sense of competence among people. On the other hand, when a task is too difficult, people might not successfully complete the task and therefore would not gain a sense of competence as well. In both situations, intrinsic motivation has a weak influence on participation behavior. Only when a moderate level of task complexity is perceived can intrinsic motivation strongly affect participation behavior. Thus, we argue that the effect of task complexity on the relationship between intrinsic motivation and participation behavior exhibits an inverted-U shape. The following hypothesis is proposed:</p><p>H2c. The effect of intrinsic motivation on continuance intention is weak at low levels of perceived task complexity; it reaches a peak substantive positive effect at moderate levels of perceived task complexity and it is again weak at high levels of perceived task complexity.</p><p>Self-efficacy is likewise relevant to the solvers' sense of competence and the probability that they can succeed in tasks. When selfefficacy is high, solvers perceive themselves as being highly competent and possessing a high probability to complete tasks successfully. Thus, intrinsic motivation should produce a stronger influence on participation when self-efficacy is high. When self-efficacy is low, solvers would feel less competent in accomplishing the task, hence leading to a weak influence of intrinsic motivation on participation. In other words, self-efficacy is argued to moderate the relationship between intrinsic motivation and continuance intention positively. Thus, the following is hypothesized: H2d. Self-efficacy positively moderates the relationship between intrinsic motivation and continuance intention.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Setting and participants</head><p>Data were collected through a field survey in a specific TVC website, Taskcn.com, in China (Witkey website in their term). Although various types of tasks such as designing, programming, strategic planning, and writing are posted on Taskcn.com, the main focus is on IT-relevant tasks; specifically, the final product should be an IT artifact (e.g., a website, a program, or a computer-aided logo design). IT-relevant tasks are more knowledge-intensive, requiring solvers to tap into a host of resources such as knowledge, time, and effort in the task fulfillment process. This requirement is consistent with the present research objective of understanding knowledge exchange behavior in TVCs. Several other tasks, such as the naming of a baby, require a minimal amount of knowledge, and are not suitable for this study. Thus, only solvers with experience in IT-related tasks in the research site are eligible for participation in the survey.</p><p>The survey was posted on the Taskcn.com website. The objective of the survey and the requirements of subject recruitment were introduced at the beginning of the survey. Solvers with experience in IT design tasks (e.g., logo design, graphic design, website design, and program design) were eligible to participate in the survey. The URL of the questionnaire Web page was shown in the description as well. A lucky draw with a success rate of 10% was to be conducted, and each winner could gain RMB 20 (approximately US$ 3).</p><p>Subjects were recruited by two means. First, the survey was open to voluntary participants. Interested subjects with IT design task experience could participate in the survey without invitation. Second, we sent invitation letters to 700 randomly selected participants. These subjects, like those sampled through the first channel, should have been involved in at least one IT design task in Taskcn.com. We obtained a total of 140 and 146 responses through these two channels, respectively. Of the responses gathered through the first channel, 81 responses were invalid because these subjects either had never participated in any IT design project prior to the project or their questionnaires were incomplete. Thus, only 59 usable responses were obtained from the first channel. Overall, 205 usable responses were gathered.</p><p>The demographics of the respondents are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. To ensure the appropriateness of merging the two datasets, the demographic details of respondents from the two data collection channels were compared as well. According to the comparison, no significant differences existed in gender (χ 2 = .048, p = .827), age (χ 2 = 7.937, p = .160), education (χ 2 = 5.613, p = .132), experience in computer (χ 2 = 3.819, p = .282), experience on the Internet (χ 2 = 3.373, p = .338), experience in Witkey (χ 2 = 7.453, p = .114) or participation intensity (χ 2 = 1.821, p = .769). The similarity of the subject demographics across the two groups also implied that self-selection bias was not a major threat to this study. Therefore, the overall sample was used in later analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Measurement</head><p>The measurement of the majority of constructs was adopted from prior relevant studies (see Appendix A). Slight wording modifications were necessary to make them suitable for the research context, and all measures used a seven-point Likert scale. Sustained participation was measured using the instrument of continuance intention adopted from Bhattacherjee <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. According to the theory of reasoned action, intention is a salient predictor of behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, thus the continuance intention was used as the proxy of sustained participation behavior. Meanwhile, extrinsic motivation was measured by the level of extrinsic rewards adopted from Kankanhalli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Intrinsic motivation was measured by using two items describing perceived enjoyment <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and two items describing the sense of achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Task complexity was measured by using three items on participants' (1) perceived difficulty to complete tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>, (2) perceived challenge of online tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, and (3) belief in the complexity of online tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. The three items used to measure self-efficacy were adopted from Kankanhalli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Data analysis</head><p>Data analysis was conducted through two stages. At the first stage, the reliability and validity of the constructs were assessed using LIS-REL to ensure the appropriateness of the measurement model. At the second stage, the hypotheses were tested using moderated multiple regression analysis (MMR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> because it is considered to be "one of the most popular, if not the most popular, approach for testing hypothesis about interaction effects" <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In contrast to other analysis approaches (e.g., SEM), MMR is more appropriate for models with multiple moderators and multiple moderating effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Reliability and validity</head><p>Reliability and convergent validity for constructs were assessed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in LISREL 8.70 software. CFA results revealed that loadings for the second item of continuance intention (CI2) and the third item of extrinsic motivation (EXM3) were lower than 0.5; thus, these two items were excluded from the model and not considered in later analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. After removing these two items, the results shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> reveal that the composite reliability (CR) and average variance extracted (AVE) for all the constructs exceed the threshold values of 0.60 and 0.50, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, exhibiting sound construct reliability. However, the Cronbach's Alpha for extrinsic motivation (0.66) is slightly lower than the typical threshold of 0.7 and this should be taken as a limitation of this research. Further, all t-tests of factor loadings were significant, confirming the fact that all of the indicators possessed a high convergent validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. Discriminant validity was assessed by comparing the square root of a construct's AVE and the correlations relevant to this construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, the square root of AVE is greater than the correlations for all constructs, indicating sound discriminant validity.</p><p>Furthermore, as all of the questions were answered by the same respondents, a threat of common-method bias (CMB) may exist. To test whether CMB was a problem for this study, a test was conducted using the hierarchically nested covariance structure model in LISREL 8.70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84]</ref>. This analysis revealed that CMB did not pose a major threat to the study (Appendix B).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Hypotheses tests</head><p>Four hierarchical regression models were used to test the proposed hypotheses. Task complexity and self-efficacy were first of all entered into Model I. Then, value-relevant factorsextrinsic and intrinsic motivationswere entered into Model II, and the interaction terms between value-relevant constructs and expectancy-relevant constructs were entered into Model III. To examine the hypothesized inverted U   moderating effect of task complexity on the intrinsic motivationcontinuance intention relationship, a product of intrinsic motivation and the square of task complexity were added to Model IV <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> summarizes the results of the hypotheses tests. Extrinsic motivation was found to have a significant effect on continuance intention in Model II (β = .178, p b .05) but not in Model III (β = .107, p &gt; .1), partially supporting H1a and demonstrating that its effect on continuance intention may be moderated by other factors. Intrinsic motivation produced a significant effect on continuance intention in both Model II and Model III (all p b .01), lending support to H1b. Furthermore, task complexity was observed to moderate the relationship between extrinsic motivation and continuance intention negatively (β = -.312, p b .001). Meanwhile, self-efficacy was observed to positively moderate the relationship between intrinsic motivation and continuance intention (β = .274, p b .001). These findings provide support for H2a and H2d. No significant interaction effects between extrinsic motivation and self-efficacy were observed (β = -.139, p &gt; .05); thus, H2b was not supported. Nor was the inverted U moderating effect (H2c) supported (β = -.118, p &gt; .05).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Note: CR ¼ ∑λ ð Þ 2 ∑λ ð Þ 2 þ∑θ ; AVE ¼ ∑λ 2 ∑λ 2 ð Þ þ ∑ θ ð Þ [25]</formula><p>The two supported interaction effects are illustrated in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows that extrinsic motivation produced a positive and significant influence on continuance intention under low task complexity conditions, but had an insignificant effect on continuance intention under high task complexity conditions. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, the effects of intrinsic motivation on continuance intention were observed as being significant under both the low level self-efficacy condition and the high level self-efficacy condition, but the relationship was stronger under the high self-efficacy condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussions and implications</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Key findings</head><p>A number of interesting findings can be derived from this study. First, the influence of extrinsic motivation on continuance intention is contingent on task complexity. When task complexity is low, extrinsic motivation has a positive and significant influence on continuance intention. However, when task complexity is high, extrinsic motivation has no effect on continuance intention.</p><p>Second, intrinsic motivation plays an important role in the TVC context. As a virtual community with a competition-based reward system, solvers may enjoy the challenge residing in the task participation process. Experiencing a sense of self-worth is a critical motivator of sustained participation behavior. Particularly, a positive interaction effect between intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy is observed, suggesting that when solvers perceive high levels of self-efficacy, the influence of intrinsic motivation (e.g., sense of self-worth) on continuance intention will be considerably stronger.</p><p>However, the hypothesized inverted U interaction effect between intrinsic motivation and task complexity was not found. To further investigate this unsupported hypothesis, we conducted a post-hoc analysis by examining how the relationship between intrinsic motivation and continuance intention changed with respect to task complexity. We split the sample into three sub-samples that respectively represented low, moderate, and high levels of task complexity (TSKX) 1. Prior literature also suggests including the interaction effects between moderators (if there are more than two moderators) in the regression analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>, thus we also included the interaction effect between task complexity and self efficacy in the regression analysis but found it was not significant (β = -.032, p &gt; .1).</p><p>Removing this interaction factor in the model had not changed the conclusion. Thus, to simplify the analysis, we report the results without this factor here.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intrinsic Motivation Continuance Intention</head><p>High Self Efficacy Low Self Efficacy condition. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> The relationships between intrinsic motivation and continuance intention under these three conditions are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. It indicated that the path coefficient in the low TSKX condition was very similar to that of the path coefficient in the moderate TSKX condition but the path coefficient in the high TSKX condition was different from those in the low and moderate TSKX conditions.</p><p>To understand the extent to which the coefficients were different under the three TSKX conditions, we compared the three path coefficients according to the method developed by Chin <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and widely used by other researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70]</ref>). The results are as shown in Table <ref type="table">6</ref> (see details in Appendix C). The results revealed that the path coefficient in the high TSKX condition was significantly different from that of the low (Δ = .362 t = 2.059, p b .05) and moderate (Δ = .406 t = 2.605, p b .01) TSKX conditions. However, the difference in the path coefficients was not significant when comparing the low and the moderate TSKX conditions (Δ = .044, t = .288). According to this result, we re-constructed the interaction effect between intrinsic motivation and task complexity as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. In this reconstruction, the effect of intrinsic motivation on continuance intention remains stable until task complexity reaches a threshold value, beyond which the increase of task complexity will weaken the impact of intrinsic motivation on sustained participation.</p><p>Moreover, the hypothesized positive interaction effect between extrinsic motivation and self-efficacy is not supported. One possible explanation for this insignificant interaction effect can be attributed to the crowding-out effect of competing extrinsic and intrinsic motivations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. The crowding-out effect of motivation shows that when the effect of one type of motivation increases, the effect of the other type of motivation decreases <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In this study, the effect of intrinsic motivation increases when self-efficacy increases; however, this will decrease the effect of extrinsic motivation (i.e., crowdingout effect). Thus, an increase in the effect of extrinsic motivation caused by self-efficacy may be neutralized by the crowding-out effect of intrinsic motivation, and no significant increase in the effect of extrinsic motivation may be observed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Limitations</head><p>Before discussing the implications, the limitations of this study must first be addressed. First, the study was conducted in a specific TVC website in China. Although similar websites exist in the USA (e.g., Amazon's Mechanical Turk), they are different in terms of task types and reward scale; few IT-relevant tasks are posted on Mechanical Turk and rewards no higher than US$10 are provided to solvers. These differences may limit the generalizability of our conclusions to other websites. Furthermore, prior studies on culture postulate that individuals with different cultural backgrounds have different behavioral motivations; that is, individualists are more likely to be motivated by extrinsic and instrumental incentives, while collectivists tend to base their decision making on intrinsic and relational factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Therefore, the effects of extrinsic and intrinsic motivations on sustained participation may vary across countries with different cultures. Future studies should focus on this cross-cultural issue and compare the results obtained in different cultural contexts in order to extend the proposed research model used in this study.</p><p>Second, the use of cross-sectional data and regression analysis does not allow for the possibility of exploring feedback effects. Expectancyrelevant and value-relevant factors were explored at the same time reference point when solvers had achieved a certain amount of TVC participation experience. This study attempted to use the adjusted expectancy and value perceptions to understand why people diverge in their sustained participation paths. However, a better understanding of this issue may require a careful consideration of both adjusted perceptions and initial perceptions through the conducting of a longitudinal analysis. These approaches may better capture how people's perceptions evolve over time. Such factors should be taken into account in future research.</p><p>Third, the research context is limited to the TVC that extracts economic value through knowledge exchange or knowledge-based problem solving. Caution must be exercised in generalizing the conclusions to the broader TVC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Theoretical implications</head><p>This study advances theoretical development in the area of knowledge sharing in the virtual community by filling two research gaps. First, previous studies on knowledge sharing in virtual communities were conducted within the context of RVC, but the factors influencing people's knowledge sharing behavior in the TVC had not been sufficiently investigated. Second, the majority of prior studies accord greater attention to the general or initial motivation to participate in knowledge sharing virtual communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref>. However, the underlying mechanism that could explain sustained participation behavior is not fully understood. This study developed a research model to address these two gaps based on the EVT and social learning theory.</p><p>First, this study extends previous understanding of knowledge sharing in a RVC to the context of a TVC by identifying the distinctions between these two research contexts and discovering how the underlying motivation mechanisms explaining knowledge sharing behavior changes due to these distinctions. Two key distinctions between RVC and TVC are identified: (1) knowledge is considered to be a public good in RVCs but a private good in TVCs, and (2) knowledge sharing follows a principle of social exchange in RVCs but a principle of economic exchange in TVC. Because of these distinctions, the underlying mechanisms explaining people's knowledge sharing behavior are different. In RVCs, extrinsic rewards or selfish benefits are not the major incentives that motivate people to share their knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>, and only intrinsic motivation plays an important role in this context <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. The present study finds that the TVC context reveals a different story. As economic rewards are provided by TVCs and economic exchange becomes the principle of knowledge sharing, the role of extrinsic motivation is more salient in this context. However, intrinsic motivation (e.g., a sense of self-worth) remains an important predictor of knowledge sharing behavior. These conclusions enrich the understanding of knowledge sharing in virtual communities, further implying that economic factors should be considered when investigating TVCs.</p><p>Second, this study contributes to the theoretical understanding of sustained participation in TVC. In particular, drawing on EVT and the notion of social learning, this study offers insights into why a number of solvers who are motivated to participate in online tasks no longer continue their participation in the community. This insight is</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intrinsic Motivation Continuance Intention</head><p>High Task Complexity Mid Task Complexity Low Task Complexity obtained by theoretically identifying and empirically examining the boundary conditions of the effects of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation (i.e., explaining when extrinsic and intrinsic motivation do or do not predict sustained participation in TVC by identifying renewed expectancy perceptions as being important moderating factors). Specifically, the results reconcile the mixed findings on the behavioral impact of extrinsic motivation by showing that extrinsic motivation strongly influences continued knowledge sharing in TVC only when task complexity is low. Equally important, is the fact that our findings add to the existing theory on the behavioral impact of intrinsic motivation by identifying self-efficacy as a moderator. Furthermore, this study contributes to the current understanding of the effect of intrinsic motivation on participation behavior by theorizing and empirically examining a non-linear moderating effect of task complexity. The results question the simple linear moderating effect of task complexity, stressing that the effect of intrinsic motivation on participation behavior will sharply decrease after task complexity reaches a threshold value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Practical implications</head><p>This study likewise provides important insights and practical strategies to practitioners who manage TVCs. First, Web sponsors should pay heed to the distinction between initial participation and sustained participation. Our results reveal that initial motivations may not be adequate to predict sustained participation, and the determinants of sustained participation differ from those of initial participation. This implies that, in practice, Web sponsors not only should develop strategies to motivate participants but also they should manage the participants' ongoing expectations of their ability to and probability of accomplishing given tasks. Second, the study suggests ways of setting the complexity of online tasks. Specifically, extrinsic rewards for task completion should be designed by considering the complexity of the task. Similarly, this study suggests that to best leverage the solvers' intrinsic motivation, tasks should not be of extremely high complexity. Third, the study likewise suggests that Web sponsors should implement various strategies to enhance the solvers' selfefficacy. The current practice in TVCs adopts the "winner-take-all" mechanism. In particular, only winners can obtain rewards while the rest receive none. However, this mechanism may discourage solvers who are competent in completing the task but are just not the best. This may force them to perceive low self-efficacy and quit from TVCs. A better mechanism should consider not only the winner but the one who effectively accomplishes tasks as well. For example, in addition to the winner, several other solvers who completed the task exceptionally well can be listed as finalists with proper recognition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>The findings of prior studies that explain initial motivation to participate in VCs in general may fail to explain sustained participation in TVCs. To address this research gap, a theoretical model explaining how the influence of motivational factors on participation is contingent on social learning factors is developed and tested. Task complexity and self-efficacy, which are associated with the social learning process, are considered to moderate the relationship between motivational factors and continuance intention. The confirmed interaction effects indicate that the effects of motivational factors on continuance intention are contingent on the level of task complexity and selfefficacy. This study contributes to theory building by adopting two moderators to capture the distinctions between initial participation and sustained participation. It also contributes to practice by providing suggestions for the mechanism design to post tasks appropriately and enhance solvers' self-efficacy.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

M2 was a trait-only model in which each item was loaded on its respective scale (χ 2 (67) = 176.42, RMSEA = .089). 3. M3 was a trait and method model in which a common factor linking to all the measurement items was added into M2 (χ 2 (53)= 105.93, RMSEA = .072).</p><p>Because M2 is highly better than M1, while M3 is only slightly better than M2, the trait rather than the common-method factor explains most of the variance.
