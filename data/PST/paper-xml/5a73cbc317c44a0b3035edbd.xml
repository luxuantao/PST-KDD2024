<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as communication platforms is of great significance in future wireless networks, especially for on-demand deployment in temporary events and emergency situations. Although prior works have shown the performance improvement by exploiting the UAV's mobility, they mainly focus on delay-tolerant applications. As delay requirements fundamentally limit the UAV's mobility, it remains unknown whether the UAV is able to provide any performance gain in delay-constrained communication scenarios. Motivated by the above, we study in this paper a UAV-enabled orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) network where a UAV is dispatched as the mobile base station (BS) to serve a group of users on the ground. We consider a minimum-rate ratio (MRR) for each user, defined as the minimum instantaneous rate required over the average achievable throughput, to flexibly adjust the percentage of its delay-constrained data traffic. Under a given set of constraints on the users' MRRs, we aim to maximize the minimum average throughput of all users by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and OFDMA resource allocation. First, we show that the max-min throughput in general decreases as the users' MRRs become larger, which reveals a fundamental throughput-delay tradeoff in UAV-enabled communications. Next, we propose an iterative parameter-assisted block coordinate descent method to optimize the UAV trajectory and OFDMA resource allocation alternately, by applying the successive convex optimization and the Lagrange duality, respectively. Furthermore, an efficient and systematic UAV trajectory initialization scheme is proposed based on the simple circular trajectory. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs.</p></div>

INTRODUCTION</head><p>As predicted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, will continue to surge over the next several years, with the global annual unit shipment increasing more than tenfold from 6.4 million in 2015 to 67.7 million by 2021. Such a dramatic increase is due to the steadily decreasing cost of UAVs and their fast-growing demand in applications such as surveillance and monitoring, aerial camera and radar, cargo delivery, communication platforms, etc. In June 2017, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Intel announced to use UAVs to enhance the future Olympic</p><p>The authors are with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, email:{elewuqq, elezhang}@nus.edu.sg. (Corresponding author: Qingqing Wu.) Part of this work has been presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This work was supported by the National University of Singapore under Research Grant R-263-000-B46-112.</p><p>Games experience, such as the drone light show <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Just in the same month, the "Safe DRONE Act of 2017" was proposed to the United States Congress for accelerating the development of the UAV technology, which requested 14 million dollars for funding a host of research projects on UAVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In fact, many prominent companies such as Google, Qualcomm, Amazon, and Nokia, have already launched their respective programs to advance the UAV research and conduct UAV field tests. In particular, the recent trial results released by Qualcomm have shown that the current fourth-generation (4G) cellular network can provide reliable communications for UAVs at an altitude up to 400 feet <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, which paves the way for realizing cellularenabled UAV communications in future. Besides being "drone clients" of wireless networks, UAVs can also be employed as various aerial communication platforms, to help improve the performance of existing wireless communication systems such as cellular networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Compared to the traditional terrestrial wireless communications, UAV-enabled communications mainly have the following three advantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. First, they are significantly less affected by channel impairments such as shadowing and fading, and in general possess more reliable air-to-ground channels due to the much higher possibility of having lineof-sight (LoS) links with ground users. Second, UAVs can be deployed more flexibly and moved more freely in the threedimensional (3D) space. Third, the high mobility of UAVs can be fully controlled to enhance desired communication links and/or avoid undesired interference via proper trajectory design. These features bring both opportunities and challenges in designing UAV-enabled wireless communications, which were not explored before in conventional terrestrial systems with fixed ground base stations (BSs). As UAVs are suitable to serve as airborne communication hubs such as aerial BSs and/or relays, they are especially useful for the practical scenarios that require on-demand deployment in temporary events or emergency situations (such as natural disaster), when the ground infrastructures are insufficient or even unavailable. However, there are also open challenges that need to be tackled before realizing the full potential of UAV-enabled communications, such as UAV deployment and trajectory design, communications resource allocation and multiple access, etc. In particular, three fundamental tradeoffs have been identified in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> for UAV-enabled wireless networks.</p><p>Recently, UAV deployment problems have been extensively studied in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The main design objective is to optimize the UAVs' altitude, horizontal positions, and/or spatial density to achieve the maximum communication coverage in a given area. However, the high mobility or trajectory design of UAVs is not considered in these works. An energy-efficient relaying scheme is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> where multiple UAVs cooperatively relay data packets from ground sensors to a remote BS based on time division multiple access (TDMA). Although the UAV mobility is considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the UAVs' trajectories are assumed to be pre-determined and not optimized, which simplifies the design to a UAV-packet matching problem. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, both the static and mobile UAVenabled wireless networks are studied which are underlaid with a device-to-device (D2D) communication network. Yet, the mobile UAV is only allowed to communicate at a set of stop points. As a result, the UAV trajectory is highly restricted and does not fully exploit the UAV's high mobility for performance optimization. As such, a joint UAV trajectory and adaptive communication design is more promising. Motivated by this, a general trajectory and communication joint optimization framework is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> for a UAVenabled mobile relaying system, which is also extended to the energy efficiency maximization in a point-to-point UAVground communication system <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The UAV trajectory designs in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> can be considered as a generalization of the UAV deployment problem, subject to practical constraints on the UAV's mobility, such as its initial/final locations, maximum speed and acceleration, etc. Thus, it is intuitive that a mobile UAV with optimized trajectory in general can achieve higher throughput than a static UAV, even with optimal deployment/placement. For UAV-enabled multiuser communication networks, a novel cyclical multiple access scheme is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> where the UAV periodically serves each of the ground users along its cyclical trajectory via TDMA. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, the capacity region of the UAV-enabled two-user broadcast channel is optimally characterized where it is proved that a simple "fly-hover-fly" trajectory is capacity achieving. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, a joint user scheduling, power control, and trajectory optimization problem is investigated for a multi-UAV enabled multiuser system. It is shown that with joint trajectory design and power control, the UAVs can cooperatively serve the ground users in a periodic manner with strong LoS links and yet avoiding severe interference. However, this is achieved by scheduling each user to communicate only when its associated UAV is sufficiently close to it in each UAV flight period, which implies that the user has to wait for the next UAV flight period to communicate again. As a result, the throughput gain brought by the UAV's mobility does not come for free but in fact at the cost of user communication delay <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Future wireless networks are expected to provide different quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees for a wide range of applications with diversified requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In fact, the delay requirements of wireless multimedia services may vary dramatically in a large scale from milliseconds such as for video conferencing and online gaming, to several seconds for file downloading/sharing and data backup. For example, when a user is downloading files which are delay-tolerant in general, some other users in the same area may be watching highdefinition (HD) movies on YouTube that require minimum rates at any time. In light of this, wireless networks with such mixed services should be optimized to not only maximize the system total throughput but also meet the heterogeneous delay requirements of different applications. Although the UAV trajectory design has been shown to significantly enhance the throughput of various wireless communication systems such as for mobile relaying channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, interference channel (IFC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, multiple access channel (MAC) and broadcast channel (BC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and wiretap channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, all these works consider only delay-tolerant applications where the users' instantaneous rates in general cannot be guaranteed <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Therefore, it remains unknown whether mobile UAVs are still able to provide throughput gains over static UAVs/ground BSs, when the users' delay or minimum-rate requirements are considered.</p><p>Motivated by such an open question, we study in this paper a UAV-enabled orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system, where a UAV is dispatched as a mobile BS to serve a group of users on the ground during a given finite period, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Besides having been standardized as the downlink multiple access scheme in the current 4G networks, OFDMA is also deemed as a promising candidate for the forthcoming fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. This is essentially attributed to its various advantages, e.g., flexible bandwidth and power allocation over users, which fits particularly well in our considered UAVenabled network with heterogeneous user delay requirements. For the purpose of exposition, we consider two different types of data traffic for each user: delay-constrained traffic where a minimum rate should be supported at any time during the UAV service period versus delay-tolerant traffic where no minimum rate is required and the transmission rate can be elastically allocated over the period. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> To this end, we introduce a minimum-rate ratio (MRR) for each user which is defined as the minimum rate required (for delay-constrained traffic) over the total achievable average throughput (for both delaytolerant and delay-constrained traffic) in a given period of interest. As such, the MRR can be flexibly adjusted by each user to specify the percentage of the delay-constrained traffic required versus that of the delay-tolerant traffic, depending on its applications. Our goal is to maximize the minimum average throughput of all ground users while meeting a given set of constraints on the users' MRRs, by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and OFDMA resource allocation. Compared to prior works <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, such a joint UAV trajectory and resource allocation design is more general and practically useful since the user communication delay requirements are taken into account. This thus leads to a more fair throughput comparison with the terrestrial BSs or static UAVs and also helps to reveal a better understanding of the fundamental throughput gain achievable by exploiting the UAV's mobility control subject to delay constraints. Intuitively, when the UAV flies towards some users to capture better channels with them, it gets farther away spontaneously from other users that are not in its heading direction and thus experiences degraded channels. As a result, more bandwidth and transmit power need to be allocated to those users so that their minimum rates can be achieved. This in turn would limit the potential rate increase of the users in the UAV's heading direction. Thus, there exists a new and non-trivial tradeoff in the UAV trajectory design for throughput maximization when minimum-rate or delay constraints are considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. First, we formulate a joint UAV trajectory and OFD-MA resource allocation optimization problem to maximize the minimum throughput of ground users while guaranteeing their specified MRR constraints. Next, we show that the system max-min throughput is non-increasing with respect to the users' MRRs, which implies that the throughput gain of mobile UAVs over static UAVs reduces as the delay constraints become more stringent. Although the formulated problem is non-convex and challenging to solve, we propose an efficient iterative block coordinate descent algorithm to solve the bandwidth and power allocation problem and the UAV trajectory optimization problem alternately, which is guaranteed to converge. Specifically, in each iteration, the bandwidth and power allocation problem is solved optimally by applying the Lagrange duality method with given fixed UAV trajectory. While for the UAV trajectory optimization problem with fixed OFDMA resource allocation, the successive convex optimization technique is applied to tackle its non-convexity. However, due to the MRR constraints, it is shown that the conventional block coordinate descent method which directly iterates between the OFDMA resource allocation and UAV trajectory design will very likely get stuck at the initial point, which leads to an ineffective update of the UAV trajectory. To overcome this issue, we propose a new parameter-assisted block coordinate descent method where each parameter is a temporary MRR set to be larger than the target MRR for a corresponding user. Then at each iteration, we gradually decrease the temporary MRRs before solving the UAV trajectory optimization problem, until they reach the target MRRs for all users. It is shown that this new method can effectively update the UAV trajectory in each iteration, thus resolving the issue of conventional block coordinate descent method. Furthermore, we propose a systematic and low-complexity UAV trajectory initialization scheme based on the simple circular trajectory. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the fundamental tradeoff between the sys-tem max-min throughput and the users' delay/MRR constraints and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the system model and the problem formulation for a UAV-enabled OFDMA network. In Section III, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm as well as a general UAV trajectory initialization scheme for the considered problem. Section VI presents the numerical results to demonstrate the proposed designs. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section V.</p><p>Notations: In this paper, scalars are denoted by italic letters, while vectors and matrices are respectively denoted by boldface lower-case and upper-case letters.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. System Model</head><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we consider a UAV-enabled OFDMA system where the UAV is employed as an aerial BS to serve a group of K users on the ground. The user set is denoted by K with |K| = K. In practice, the users that need to be served by the UAV can be either the terrestrial BSs that have no ground backhaul links or the ground mobile terminals in a geographical area that is poorly or not even covered by existing terrestrial BSs. At any time during the UAV flight period, denoted by T , the UAV can communicate with multiple ground users simultaneously by employing OFDMA, i.e., assigning each user a fraction of the total bandwidth/transmit power. In general, from the perspective of throughput maximization, it is intuitive that larger T is desirable since it will provide the UAV more time to fly closer to each ground user, leading to better air-to-ground links. The effect of T on the system performance will be investigated in detail in Section IV. Since we target for a centralized design, the proposed algorithm can be performed at a central controller (e.g., installed on the UAV) which is able to collect all the users' information such as their locations and MRRs. Then the obtained solutions can be programmed into the control and communication units of the UAV for realization. In practice, if the information of any user changes, the solution is accordingly updated by the controller and ground users will be served by the UAV with this newly updated solution. As T is practically large, we assume that the processing delay for implementing the proposed algorithm is much smaller than T and thus can be ignored.</p><p>We assume that the horizontal coordinate of each ground user is known in advance and fixed at</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">w k = [x k , y k ] T ∈ R 2×1 , k ∈ K.</formula><p>The UAV is assumed to fly at a fixed altitude H above ground and the time-varying horizontal coordinate of the UAV at time instant t is denoted by q(t) = [x(t), y(t)] T ∈ R 2×1 , with 0 ≤ t ≤ T . To serve ground users periodically, we assume that the UAV needs to return to its initial location by the end of each period T , i.e., q(0) = q(T ). In addition, the UAV trajectory is also subject to the maximum speed constraints in practice, i.e, || q(t)|| ≤ V max , 0 ≤ t ≤ T , where V max denotes the maximum UAV speed in meter/second (m/s). However, the continuous variable t essentially implies an infinite number of UAV speed constraints which are difficult to tackle in general. To facilitate our analysis and algorithm design, we apply the discrete trajectory approximation technique, which results in a finite number of variables and constraints. Specifically, we discretize the UAV flight period T into N equally-spaced time slots with step size δ t , i.e., t = nδ t , n ∈ N = {1, ..., N }. Note that with the given maximum UAV speed V max and altitude H, the number of time slots N for each given T can be chosen sufficiently large such that the UAV's location change within each time slot δ t can be assumed to be negligible as compared to the link distances from the UAV to all ground users. However, a larger value of N inevitably increases the complexity of the proposed design. Thus, the number of time slots N can be properly chosen in practice to balance between the accuracy and algorithm complexity. More discussions on the choice of N as well as its impact on the system performance can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Based on such a discretization, the UAV trajectory can be characterized by a sequence of UAV locations</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">q[n] = [x[n], y[n]] T , n = 1, • • • , N .</formula><p>As a result, the above constraints can be equivalently modeled as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">q[1] = q[N ],<label>(1) ||q</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">[n + 1] -q[n]|| 2 ≤ S 2 max , n = 1, ..., N -1,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where S max V max δ t is the maximum horizontal distance that the UAV can travel within one time slot. Note that by assuming that the UAV flies at a constant speed between any two consecutive locations, we can readily construct a continuous UAV trajectory by using line-segments to connect the locations in the discretized trajectory q[n], n = 1, • • • , N , obtained by our proposed design. Furthermore, the distance from the UAV to user k in time slot n is assumed to be a constant that can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">d k [n] = H 2 + ||q[n] -w k || 2 .</formula><p>(</p><p>The measurement results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> have shown that the air-to-ground communication channels are mainly dominated by the LoS links even when the UAV is at a moderate altitude. For example, for the UAV at an altitude of H = 120 m, the LoS probability of air-to-ground links in rural environment exceeds 95% <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Thus, we assume that the channel quality depends mainly on the UAV-user distance for simplicity. In addition, the Doppler effect induced by the UAV mobility is assumed to be perfectly compensated at the receivers. Following the free-space path loss model, the LoS channel power gain from the UAV to user k in time slot n can thus be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">h k [n] = ρ 0 d -2 k [n] = ρ 0 H 2 + ||q[n] -w k || 2 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where ρ 0 denotes the channel power gain at the reference distance d 0 = 1 m. Since the UAV's location change within each time slot is negligible compared to the link distance, <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">4</ref>) can be assumed to remain constant for each n and k. Denote the total available system bandwidth by B in Hertz (Hz). The fraction of bandwidth assigned to user k in time slot n is denoted by α k [n]. In a practical OFDMA system, α k [n] is in general a discrete value between 0 and 1, which increases linearly with the number of subcarriers assigned to user k in time slot n. It is known that when the number of subcarriers is sufficiently large, α k [n] can be approximated to a continuous value between 0 and 1. Thus, the bandwidth allocation constraint can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">h k [n] in (</formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">K k=1 α k [n] ≤ 1, ∀ n,<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">0 ≤ α k [n] ≤ 1, ∀ k, n.<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Denote the transmit power allocated to user k in time slot n by p k [n] ≥ 0. Then the total transmit power constraint of the UAV can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">K k=1 p k [n] ≤ P max , ∀ n,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where P max is the maximum allowed transmit power of the UAV in each time slot. Accordingly, the instantaneous achievable rate of user k in time slot n, denoted by r k [n] in bits/second/Hz (bps/Hz), can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">r k [n] = α k [n] log 2 1 + p k [n]h k [n] α k [n]BN0 = α k [n] log 2 1 + p k [n]γ0 α k [n](H 2 + ||q[n] -w k || 2 ) ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where γ 0 ρ0 BN0 , with N 0 denoting the power spectral density of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at the receivers. As a result, the average achievable throughput of user k over N time slots in bps/Hz, is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">R k = 1 N N n=1 r k [n].<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Motivated by the diversified user applications and heterogeneous delay requirements in the forthcoming 5G wireless networks, we consider both delay-constrained and delay-tolerant services for users in the system. Specifically, a parameter θ k , θ k ∈ [0 1], is introduced to denote the MRR of user k, which means that at any time slot, θ k fraction of its average throughput over N slots is delay-constrained and the remaining 1-θ k fraction is delay-tolerant. In particular, θ k = 0 and θ k = 1 indicate that all the services of user k are delaytolerant and delay-constrained, respectively. As such, the MRR constraint of user k in time slot n can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">r k [n] ≥ θ k R k , ∀ k, n,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>which implies that in any of the N time slots, at least θ k fraction of the average throughput needs to be satisfied for user k. Therefore, a system where some users' services are all delay-constrained while those of the others are delay-tolerant, i.e., θ k ∈ {0, 1}, ∀ k, is a special case of our general setup.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> </p></div>

This can be easily verified since otherwise the objective value of (11) can be further improved by allocating more transmit power and/or bandwidth to the user with a lower average throughput without violating the total transmit power and bandwidth allocation constraints (11d) and (11f). With such a transformation, we only need to focus on solving problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> in the rest of the paper. Although it is still non-convex, problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> facilitates the development of an efficient suboptimal algorithm. It is worth noting that due to the non-convexity as well as the large number of optimization variables and constraints, it remains an open problem to attain the optimal solution to problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> or even a tight upper bound of its objective value for evaluating the performance gap with the suboptimal algorithms Before proceeding to solve problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, we first show the effect of the users' MRRs on the maximum objective value of problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</p><p>Theorem 1: The maximum objective value of problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">12</ref>) is an element-wise non-increasing function with respect to {θ k }.</p><p>Proof: Denote the optimal solutions of problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">12</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">with θ * = {θ * k , k ∈ K} and θ = { θk , k ∈ K} by S * = {η * , α * k [n], p * k [n], q * [n], k ∈ K, n ∈ N } and Ŝ = {η, αk [n], pk [n], q[n], k ∈ K, n ∈ N },</formula><p>respectively. To prove Theorem 1, we only need to show that η * ≤ η holds when θ θ * , where indicates element-wisely less than or equal to, i.e., θk ≤ θ * k , ∀ k. Note that in problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, the MRRs are only involved in constraint (12b). Thus, we have the following inequalities</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">r * k [n] = α * k [n] log 2 1 + p * k [n]γ 0 α * k [n](H 2 + ||q * [n] -w k || 2 ) ≥ θ * k η * ≥ θk η * , ∀ k, n,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>which implies that S * is also a feasible solution of problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> with θ. Since η is the maximum objective value of problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">12</ref>) with θ, it follows that η * ≤ η, which thus completes the proof of Theorem 1. Theorem 1 sheds light on the fundamental tradeoff between the max-min average throughput and the user communication delay requirement: as the required MRR θ k increases for any user k, the max-min average throughput of the system decreases in general. This is because imposing more stringent minimum-rate requirements on users fundamentally limit the UAV's mobility to fly closer to any user to achieve a better channel since at the same time it needs to meet the minimumrate requirements of other users that are not in its heading direction and thus will have degraded channels with it. As a result, the degree of freedom for exploiting the UAV's mobility via its trajectory design is restricted by such delay/MRR constraints, thus leading to lower max-min average throughput.</p></div>

Furthermore, it can be verified that Slater's constraint qualification is satisfied for problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">14</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Therefore, strong duality holds and the duality gap between problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> and its dual problem is thus zero, which means that the optimal solution can be obtained efficiently by applying the Lagrange duality. The partial Lagrange function of problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">14</ref>) can be expressed as L(η, A, P, λ, µ, β, ν)</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">= 1 - K k=1 λ k - K k=1 N n=1 µ k,n θ k η - K k=1 N n=1 β n p k [n] + K k=1 N n=1 λ k N + µ k,n α k [n] log 2 1 + p k [n]g k [n] α k [n] - K k=1 N n=1 ν n α k [n] + N n=1 β n P max + N n=1 ν n ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">λ = {λ k , ∀ k}, µ = {µ k,n , ∀ k, n}, β = {β n , ∀ n},</formula><p>and ν = {ν n , ∀ n} are the non-negative Lagrange multipliers associated with constraints (14b), (14c), (14d), and (14f), respectively.

Accordingly, the dual function is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">f (λ, µ, β, ν) = max η,A,P L(η, A, P, λ, µ, β, ν) (16a) s.t. p k [n] ≥ 0, ∀ k, n, (16b) 0 ≤ α k [n] ≤ 1, ∀ k, n,<label>(16c)</label></formula><p>for which the following lemma holds.</p><p>Lemma 1: To make f (λ, µ, β, ν) bounded from the above in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_32">16</ref>), i.e., f (λ, µ, β, ν) &lt; +∞, it follows that</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">K k=1 λ k - K k=1 N n=1 µ k,n θ k = 1 must hold.

Specifically, one subproblem is for optimizing η and the other KN subproblems are for optimizing A and P, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">max η 1 - K k=1 λ k - K k=1 N n=1 µ k,n θ k η,<label>(18)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_37">max α k [n],p k [n] λ k N + µ k,n α k [n] log 2 1 + p k [n]g k [n] α k [n] -β n p k [n] -ν n α k [n] (19a) s.t. p k [n] ≥ 0, ∀ k, n, (19b) 0 ≤ α k [n] ≤ 1, ∀ k, n,<label>(19c)</label></formula><p>where each subproblem in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_37">19</ref>) is for user k in time slot n.</p><p>For problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>, since</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">K k=1 λ k - K k=1</formula><p>N n=1 µ k,n θ k = 1 holds as in Lemma 1, the objective value is zero which is independent of the value of η. This implies that we can choose any arbitrary real number as the optimal solution, denoted by η . Without loss of generality, we simply set η = 0 for the purpose of obtaining the dual function f (λ, µ, β, ν) and updating the dual variables 3 . Next, we consider problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. Since problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_37">19</ref>) is jointly concave with respect to p k [n] and α k [n], the solution that satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions is also the optimal solution. By taking the derivative of the objective function of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> with respect to p k [n], the optimal power allocation, denoted by p k [n], can be obtained as</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">p k [n] = α k [n] λ k + N µ k,n N β n ln 2 - 1 g k [n] + ,<label>(20)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">[x] + max{x, 0}.

For simplicity, we set a = 0 as for the case of η. In general, ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_43">23</ref>) cannot provide the optimal primal solution for problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">14</ref>) even with optimal dual variables. Nevertheless, with the above proposed solutions to problems ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_36">18</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_37">19</ref>), the dual function f (λ, µ, β, ν) is obtained.</p><p>2) Obtaining Optimal Dual Solution to Problem (17): After obtaining (η , A , P ) for given λ, µ, β, and ν, we next solve the dual problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> to find the optimal dual variables that maximize f (λ, µ, β, ν). Note that although the dual function f (λ, µ, β, ν) is always convex by definition, it is non-differentiable in general. As a result, the commonly used subgradient based method such as the ellipsoid method, can be used to solve problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. In each iteration, the dual variables λ, µ, β, and ν are updated based on the subgradients of both the objective function and the constraint functions in problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. Specifically, the subgradient of the objective function is denoted by s 0 = [∆λ T , ∆µ T , ∆β T , ∆ν T ] T where ∆λ, ∆µ, ∆β, and ∆ν are vectors with the elements respectively given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">∆λ k = 1 N N n=1 α k [n] log 2 1 + p k [n]g k [n] α k [n] , ∀ k, (<label>24</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_45">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_46">∆µ k,n = α k [n] log 2 1 + p k [n]g k [n] α k [n] , ∀ k, n,<label>(25)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_47">∆β n = P max - K k=1 p k [n], ∀ n,<label>(26)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_48">∆ν n = 1 - K k=1 α k [n], ∀ n.<label>(27)</label></formula><p>Furthermore, the equality constraint in (17b) is equivalent to two inequality constraints:</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">1 - K k=1 λ k - K k=1 N n=1 µ k,n θ k ≤ 0 and -1 + K k=1 λ k + K k=1 N n=1 µ k,n θ k ≤ 0.</formula><p>Thus, the subgradient of the former constraint function is denoted by s 1 = [∆λ T , ∆µ T , ∆β T , ∆ν T ] T where the corresponding elements are given by ∆λ k = -1, ∆µ k,n = -θ k , ∆β n = 0, ∆ν n = 0. In addition, the subgradient of the latter constraint function is given by s 2 = -s 1 . With the above subgradients, the dual variables can be updated by the constrained ellipsoid method toward the optimal solution with global convergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>3) Constructing Optimal Primal Solution to Problem (14): Based on the obtained dual optimal solution λ * , µ * , β * , and ν * , it remains to obtain the optimal primal solution {η * , A * , P * } to problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. It is worth pointing out that for a convex optimization problem, the optimal solution that maximizes the Lagrangian function is the optimal primal solution if and only if such a solution is unique and primal feasible <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. However, in our case, the optimal solutions η and A that maximize L(η, A, P, λ, µ, β, ν) are not unique given that <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. Therefore, additional steps are needed in order to construct the optimal primal solution. The key observation is that with given λ * , µ * , and β * , the optimal power spectrum density (the ratio of the optimal power allocation to the optimal bandwidth allocation), i.e., p * k</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">K k=1 λ k - K k=1 N n=1 µ k,n θ k = 1 and f ( p k ) = 0 as in</formula><formula xml:id="formula_51">[n] = p * k [n] α * k [n]</formula><p>, can be uniquely obtained from <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.

After obtaining the optimal bandwidth allocation A * , the corresponding power allocation P * can be obtained as</p><formula xml:id="formula_56">p * k [n] = p * k [n]α * k [n], ∀ k, n.</formula><p>The details of the procedures for obtaining the optimal solution to problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> are summarized in Algorithm 1. The computational complexity of Algorithm 1 consists of three parts. The first part is for solving problems ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_36">18</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_37">19</ref>), the second part is for updating the dual variables by the ellipsoid method, and the third part is for solving linear program problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. In step 3) of Algorithm 1, the complexity of solving problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> is O(1) and that of solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> is O(KN ). The complexities of step 4) and 5) are O(KN ) and O(K 2 N 2 ), respectively. Since the ellipsoid method takes O(K 2 N 2 ) to converge, the total complexity for step 2) to 6) is O(K 4 N 4 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The complexity of solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> is O(K 3 N 3 ). Therefore, the total complexity of Algorithm 1 is O(K 4 N 4 ).</p></div>

Thus, the freedom for optimizing the UAV trajectory is severely limited which can lead to ineffective update of the UAV trajectory in each iteration.</p><p>To tackle this issue, we propose a new parameter-assisted block coordinate descent method where each parameter is a temporary MRR for a corresponding user k, denoted by θ temp,k , which is set larger than the actual MRR target θ k , if 0 &lt; θ k &lt; 1. The main idea is to use the newly introduced temporary MRR θ temp,k &gt; θ k for solving problem (29) rather than directly using the target θ k . Specifically, θ temp,k for each user k is gradually decreased before solving problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> in each iteration, until the target MRR θ k is achieved for all users. As such, η will increase after each iteration, while the constraints in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> will be relaxed due to the decrease of θ temp,k 's, which thus permits a more effective UAV trajectory update in each iteration compared to the conventional block coordinate decent method. Furthermore, the proposed method also generates a feasible solution for the original problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> since θ k will be eventually achieved by gradually decreasing θ temp,k with a predefined step size, θ step,k &gt; 0. The details of the proposed method are summarized in Algorithm 2. The number of iterations required for starting from the initial MRR θ ini,k to the target MRR θ k is denoted by I max .</p><p>The convergence of the proposed Algorithm 2 can be analyzed as follows. From step 4, it can be seen that θ k , ∀ k, is non-increasing over the iterations. Recall that the objective value of problem ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">12</ref>) is element-wise non-increasing with respect to θ k , ∀ k. Thus, it can be shown that the objective value achieved by Algorithm 2 is non-decreasing in each iteration. Furthermore, the objective value of problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> is bounded from the above. Thus, the proposed Algorithm 2 is guaranteed to converge and the obtained solution is also feasible for the original problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. Although the obtained solution is generally suboptimal, we validate the effectiveness of Algorithm 2 in enhancing the user common throughput via simulations by comparing it with other benchmark schemes in Section IV. Denote by L the number of iterations needed in the outer loop for the convergence of Algorithm 2. Since in each iteration, both problems ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">14</ref>) and (33) need to be solved, which result in complexities of O(K 4 N 4 ) and O(K</p><formula xml:id="formula_67">3 2 N 7 2</formula><p>), respectively. Thus, the total computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is given by O(LK 4 N 4 ). 4   </p></div>

UAV Initial Trajectory and Users' MRR Initialization</head><p>In Algorithm 2, the initial UAV trajectory, Q 0 = {q 0 [n], ∀ n}, and the initial temporary users' MRRs, θ ini,k , ∀ k, need to be set. First, we propose in the following a general and systematic trajectory initialization scheme based on the simple circular UAV trajectory, which also includes the one 4 Although it is difficult to analyze the growth order of L with respect to K and N analytically due to the non-convexity of the considered problem, it is observed in the simulations that L at most increases linearly with K and is insensitive to N for a large value e.g., N = 540 as in Section IV.

For a circular UAV trajectory, we need to obtain the circle center c ini = [x ini , y ini ] T and radius r ini . For convenience, the circle center is set as the geometry center of all users, which is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_69">c ini = K k=1 w k K</formula><p>. The main idea for determining the circle radius of the initial circular trajectory is based on the following three observations. First, it is intuitive that as θ k increases, the area covered by the UAV trajectory shall decrease, as implied in Theorem 1. As such, the initial circle radius r ini should decrease with θ k , ∀ k. Second, when θ k = 0, ∀ k, the initial circle radius should be simplified to that for the case when the MRR constraints are not considered as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Third, it is also known that when θ k = 1, ∀ k, the UAV mobility does not provide any performance gain, which implies that the UAV should remain static. In such a case, the UAV trajectory becomes a point and the initial circle radius is thus zero. Based on the above observations, we propose to set the initial circle radius as</p><formula xml:id="formula_70">r ini = 1 - K k=1 θ k K r 0 ,<label>(35)</label></formula><p>where r 0 is the circle radius for the case when θ k = 0, ∀ k, or no MRR constraints are considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, r 0 is obtained as follows: 1) by using the user geometry center c ini as the circle center, we first calculate the radius of a minimum circle that can cover all ground users, denoted by</p><formula xml:id="formula_71">r min = max k∈K ||w k -c ini ||; 2)</formula><p>to balance the number of users outside and inside the UAV trajectory circle as well as satisfying the UAV speed constraint, we set r 0 = min{ VmaxT 2π , rmin 2 }. From <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>, it is easy to check that when θ k = 0, ∀ k, r ini = r 0 and when θ k = 1, ∀ k, r ini = 0, as expected. Let ϕ n = 2π n-1 N -1 , ∀ n. With c ini and r ini , the initial circular UAV trajectory Q 0 is given as follows,</p><formula xml:id="formula_72">q 0 [n] = [x ini + r ini cos ϕ n , y ini + r ini sin ϕ n ] T , ∀ n. (<label>36</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_73">)</formula><p>Next, we initialize the users' MRRs, θ ini,k , ∀ k. Note that if user k has no MRR constraint, i.e., θ k = 0, then there exists no constraint for user k in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>. Thus, user k will not cause the ineffective UAV trajectory update problem previously described in Section III-C and its initial MRR can be directly set as θ ini,k = 0. In contrast, as long as user k has a non-trivial MRR target, i.e., θ k &gt; 0, N corresponding MRR constraints in (34) will be imposed for user k which may cause ineffective updates of the UAV trajectory. Thus, the initial MRRs of users are set as</p><formula xml:id="formula_74">θ ini,k = 1, if θ k &gt; 0, 0, if θ k = 0, ∀ k.<label>(37)</label></formula><p>IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS In this section, numerical results are provided to validate the proposed joint OFDMA resource allocation and UAV trajectory design as well as the fundamental throughputdelay tradeoff in UAV-enabled wireless communications. We consider a system with K = 4 ground users that are located in a horizontal plane as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, marked by '×'s. The UAV is assumed to fly at a fixed altitude H = 500 m <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. The total available communication bandwidth is B = 10 MHz and the noise power spectrum density at the ground users is assumed to be identical and set as N 0 = -169 dBm/Hz. The channel power gain at the reference distance d 0 = 1 m is set as ρ 0 = -50 dB. Other parameters are set as P max = 0.1 W, V max = 50 m/s, T = 270 s, I max = 5, and N = 540, respectively, if not specified otherwise. For illustration, all the trajectories in the simulations are sampled every 4 s and the sampled points are marked by ' 's.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. UAV Trajectory and Max-min Throughput versus Homogeneous MRRs</head><p>We first consider the homogeneous delay requirement case when all ground users have the same MRR, i.e., θ k = θ, ∀ k. In Figs. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, the UAV trajectory and the max-min throughput are illustrated respectively under different MRRs. It can be observed from Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> that as the MRR, increases, the UAV's flight distance decreases and the UAV's trajectory shrinks gradually from a square to a smaller ellipse and finally a fixed point, given the same flight period T . In particular, when θ = 0, i.e., no MRR constraint is considered as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the UAV sequentially visits and stays above each of the ground users by maximally exploiting its mobility. As such, the best air-to-ground channel can be realized between the UAV and each ground user. However, when θ &gt; 0, the UAV's trajectory adaptively changes depending on the value of θ, as expected. Notice that in this setup, the closer the UAV flies to one particular user, the farther it is away from some other users inevitably. As a result, meeting the MRR constraints of these users will consume more resources (power, bandwidth) and thus becomes the bottleneck for improving the max-min throughput of the system. Such a situation becomes worse when the MRR and/or the inter-user distance becomes larger. Generally speaking, with more stringent MRR constraints, the UAV trajectory tends to be more restricted to avoid getting too far away from any of the users. Finally, as all ground users have the same MRR constraint as well as the same average throughput, the UAV trajectories are shown to be all symmetric over the users in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p><p>The effect of the MRR constraint on the max-min average throughput is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Specifically, we compare the following four trajectories: 1) Proposed trajectory which is obtained by applying Algorithm 2; 2) Fly-and-hover trajectory where the UAV flies with the maximum speed to visit all the users and hovers (with zero speed) above each of them by equally allocating the remaining time <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">5</ref> ; 3) Initial circular trajectory as described in Section III-D; and 4) Static UAV where the UAV remains static above the geometry center of the users. For all the four schemes considered, the bandwidth and power allocation is optimized by applying Algorithm 1 with the corresponding UAV trajectory. First, we observe that the max-min average throughput gradually decreases with the MR-R for the first three considered trajectories with a mobile UAV in general. This is due to the fundamental tradeoff between the system throughput and the user delay/MRR constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, which is in accordance with Theorem 1. Second, when the MRR is small, the proposed trajectory significantly outperforms the circular trajectory and static UAV. This is because a small MRR in general implies a large degree of for the UAV trajectory design, but the static UAV cannot exploit the UAV mobility while the circular trajectory does not fully exploit the UAV mobility. In contrast, the flyand-hover trajectory is observed to achieve the throughput very close to the proposed trajectory for small MRR values. However, when the MRR becomes large, the fly-and-hover trajectory suffers from a significant throughput loss compared to the proposed trajectory. This is expected since the fly-andhover trajectory results in highly asymmetric user channels over time and thus is inefficient for meeting increasingly more stringent users' MRR requirements. Finally, when the MRR reaches the maximum value of one, the max-min average throughput of the proposed trajectory becomes identical to that of static UAV as the trajectory converges to the same point as In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, the effect of the UAV flight period T on the max-min average throughput is shown under different values of the homogeneous MRR, θ. It is observed that the max-min throughput in the three cases with θ &lt; 1 all increases with T , while for the case of θ = 1, the max-min throughput remains constant, regardless of T . This suggests that as long as the users have delay-tolerant data traffic, i.e, θ &lt; 1, the UAV mobility indeed provides throughput gains over a static UAV with θ = 1 for any T &gt; 0. In addition, such a throughput gain generally increases with more flight time for the UAV, although the gain is more pronounced when θ is smaller or less strict delay/MRR constraints are applied. This is because in such cases, as T increases, the UAV has more time to get closer to each of the users and even be able to hover above them to enjoy the best channels to them. In contrast, if the services required by users are all delay-constrained, i.e., θ = 1, then the UAV is unable to achieve any throughput gain over the static case since the optimal UAV trajectory in this case is also a fixed point. The above observations further demonstrate the fundamental throughput-delay tradeoff.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. UAV Trajectory and Max-min Throughput versus Heterogeneous MRRs</head><p>Next, we consider the practical case when ground users have different MRRs in general. In this example, we fix θ 1 = θ 2 = 0.4 and vary θ 3 and θ 4 by assuming they are equal to show their effects on the proposed UAV trajectory and achievable max-min throughput. First, from Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, we observe that as the MRRs of users 3 and 4 become larger, the UAV tends to adjust its trajectory to get closer to these two users so as to meet their increasingly more stringent minimumrate requirements. Meanwhile, since the MRRs of users 1 and 2 are fixed, their priority is higher/lower than that of users 3 and 4 in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> (a) and Fig. <ref type="figure">5 (c</ref>)/(d), respectively, in the optimized UAV trajectory design. This thus results in asymmetric UAV trajectories for the four users in these cases, which is in contrast to the symmetric trajectory in Fig. <ref type="figure">5 (b</ref>) with the homogeneous users' MRR constraint. As such, users 1 and 2 in Fig. <ref type="figure">5 (c</ref>) and (d) on average have worse air-toground channels than users 3 and 4 along the UAV trajectory. Since the same average throughput needs to be achieved for all users, the UAV needs to lower its speed and even hover at some positions near users 1 and 2 to compensate their inferior channels caused by the asymmetric UAV trajectory. Similar to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, we compare in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> the max-min throughput versus the MRRs of users 3 and 4 under the aforementioned four UAV trajectories. As θ 3 and θ 4 increase, the max-min average throughput is observed to decrease gradually, similarly as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. However, different from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, since only two users, namely, users 3 and 4, rather than all users, increase their MRRs, the decreasing of the max-min throughput versus θ in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> is less significant as compared to that in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Large Size Network with Random User Locations and MRRs</head><p>Finally, we consider the case of a large size network with random user locations and MRRs when P max = 1 W. Specifically, we randomly and uniformly generate the user locations in the same area as in Figs. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and<ref type="figure">5</ref>. The users' corresponding MRRs are randomly generated based on the uniform distribution within [0, 0.7], as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>. All other parameters are the same as those in Figs. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and<ref type="figure">5</ref>. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, we make the following main observations. First, the UAV tends to fly closer to the areas with higher user densities. This is because in such areas, the UAV is able to simultaneously serve more users with superior air-to-ground channels and hence enhance the user common throughput. Second, it is observed that the UAV tends to adjust its trajectory to get closer to users with higher MRR requirements, such as users 3, 4, and 6. This is reasonable since flying far from these users will require much more bandwidth and/or power used to compensate the degraded air-to-ground channels, which is inefficient. Third, to further demonstrate the effect of MRRs on the UAV trajectory, we increase the MRR of user 1 from 0.2 to 0.75 while keeping the MRRs of all other users unchanged, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7 (b</ref>). Then, it is observed that the UAV trajectory shrinks towards the geometric center of all users as compared to in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> (a), to avoid getting too far away from user 1. Finally, it is observed that the users closer to the geometric center (e.g., users 9 and 10) of all the users are generally served by the UAV with shorter air-to-ground distances even when they have relatively lower MRR requirements. This is intuitive because they can be occasionally served when the UAV flies over them to serve other users that are farther away from the center. The above observations and results demonstrate that the proposed trajectory design is flexible and effective for any given user locations/MRRs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>Motivated by employing UAVs to provide both delayconstrained and delay-tolerant services in future wireless networks, we consider in this paper a UAV-enabled OFDMA network for serving multiple ground users with heterogeneous communication delay requirements. Specifically, by taking account the users' MRR constraints, the system minimum average throughput is maximized via jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and OFDMA resource allocation. We first show that the max-min throughput in general decreases with the MRR of any user, which implies that the throughput gain arising from the UAV's mobility is less significant as the user delay requirements become more stringent. Then, we show that directly applying the conventional block coordinate descent method to solve the formulated problem may fail to update the UAV trajectory effectively. To overcome this issue, we propose a new parameter-assisted block coordinate descent algorithm which is shown by simulations to perform satisfactorily. Simulation results are provided to characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the system throughput and the user communication delay under different MRR setups. We hope that the results of the paper can help assessing more practically the performance of UAV-enabled wireless systems with heterogeneous delay requirements. Since a single UAV is considered in this work, it may practically suffer from the reliability issue. As such, it is worth investigating a more general multi-UAV cooperative network <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> with the new consideration of heterogeneous user throughput-delay tradeoffs. In addition, a joint design by considering the UAV's data buffer and the queueing delay explicitly along with the UAV trajectory and physical-layer resource allocation is worthy of further investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Finally, as the UAV's energy consumption and endurance are crucial in practice, it is appealing to consider energy-efficient UAV trajectory design <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> under heterogenous user delay requirements.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
