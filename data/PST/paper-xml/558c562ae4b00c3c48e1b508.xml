In the considered application, the rotor windings are supplied by a static converter for the control of active and reactive power flows exchanged between the machine and the electrical grid. The proposed diagnosis approach is based on the use of wavelet analysis improved by a pre-processing of the rotor voltage commands under timevarying conditions. Thus, the time evolution of fault components can be effectively analyzed. This paper proves also the importance of the fault components computed from rotor voltages in comparison to those coming from rotor currents under closed-loop operation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>OWADAYS, for modern wind power generation systems, the use of Wound Rotor Induction Machines (WRIMs) is a well established technology. Among different alternatives for variable speed-constant frequency (VSCF) generation systems, the WRIM can provide a high energy output with a low rating of the power converter connected to the rotor side.</p><p>In this type of application, monitoring the WRIM is crucial to ensure the maximum availability of wind energy for the power grid. Investigations on different failure modes in variable speed induction machines have revealed that 45% of motor failures are related to the stator and rotor parts <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Some faults are not destructive and evolve from an incipient stage to a more severe condition. Specifically, each electrical fault that occurs in both stator and rotor sides of a WRIM, such as resistance variations or short-circuits, produce a phase dissymmetry because the phase impedances are not equal anymore <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The increase in a phase resistance, commonly referred to as "high resistance connection" in the literature, is a common problem that can occur in any power connections of industrial electrical machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Operating in aggressive environments offshore or onshore, winding connections of WRIMs are subjected to corrosion, abrasion and fretting, leading generally to local heating, which can propagate the insulation damages <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Consequently, the detection of the first anomalies, such as resistance changes and winding unbalances, can prevent serious damages from happening and avoid longer downtime periods.</p><p>Different diagnostic methods have been proposed for WRIM <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In particular, some authors have developed a comprehensive diagnostic technique based on the Fourier analysis (FA) of the rotor voltage set-points at constant speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Unluckily, induction machines operate mostly in time-varying conditions. In this context, slip and speed vary unpredictably and the classical application of FA for processing the voltage set-points or the measured currents fails as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In fact, the bandwidth of the fault frequency components is related to the speed variation. Among different solutions, the signal demodulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, the high resolution frequency estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and the discrete polynomial-phase transform <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> have been developed to reduce the effect of the non-periodicity of the analyzed signals, or to detect multiple faults <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. These FA-based techniques give high quality discrimination between healthy and faulty conditions but they cannot provide any timedomain information.</p><p>This shortcoming in the FA-based techniques can be reduced by analyzing a small interval of the signal by means of the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). This method has been widely used to detect both stator and rotor failures in induction motors. However, the fixed width of the window and the high computational cost required to obtain a good resolution still remain major drawbacks of this technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Based on the instantaneous frequencies issued from the intrinsic mode functions, the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) was proposed for motor diagnosis, and has shown quite interesting performances in term of fault severity evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Other quadratic transforms, such as the Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD), suffers from the same constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. This limitation can be overcome by new advanced time-frequency distributions such as Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville distributions (SPWVD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, Choi-Williams distribution (CWD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and Zhao-Atlas-Marks distribution (ZAMD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. But the removal of cross-terms leads generally to reduce the joint time-frequency resolution and the signal energy.</p><p>Being a linear decomposition, Wavelet Transform (WT) provides a good resolution in time for high frequency components of a signal and a good resolution in frequency for low frequency components. In this sense, wavelets have a window that is automatically adjusted to give the appropriate resolution developed by its approximation and detail signals. Motivated by the above proprieties, in recent years some authors have pointed out the effectiveness of WT for tracking fault frequency components under nonstationary conditions. WT was used with different approaches for monitoring motors. The related techniques are the un-decimated discrete WT <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the wavelet ridge method <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, the wavelet coefficients analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> or the direct use of wavelet signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> for stator and rotor fault detection. Recently, fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, providing an innovative graphical representation of rotor-fault components issued from discrete wavelet transform in time-frequency domain. More intensive research efforts have been focused on the usage of both approximation and detail signals for tracking different failure modes in motors such as broken bars <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> inter-turn short-circuits <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, mixed eccentricity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and increasing resistance in a stator phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> or in a rotor phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>Most of the reported contributions are based on wavelet analysis of currents during the start-up phase or during any load variation. In this context, the frequency components are spread in a wide bandwidth as the slip and the speed change considerably. The situation is more complex under rotor fault conditions due to the proximity of the fault components to the fundamental frequency. These facts justify the usage of multi-detail or/and approximation signals resulting from the wavelet decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Moreover, the different decomposition levels are imposed by the sampling frequency. However, the dependency on the choice of the sampling frequency and on the capability of tracking multiple-fault frequency components makes difficult to interpret the fault pattern coming from wavelet signals and increases the diagnosis complexity. Moreover, the usage of large frequency bandwidths exposes the detection procedure to erroneous interpretations due to a possible confusion with other frequencies related to gearbox or bearing damages <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p><p>In order to quantify the fault severity, the energy of approximation and/or detail signals resulting from wavelet decomposition has been already used <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. However, this attempt reduces each time-frequency band to a single value. In this way, the time-domain information could be lost. Inspired by the above discussion, possible improvements can be formulated as follows: -a low sampling frequency has to be used to reduce the memory requirement; -repeated sampling operation should be avoided in order to reduce latency in time processing; -higher accuracy in filtering frequency components around the fundamental one, or in proximity to other harmonics, is opportune; -the contribution of the most important fault frequency components under time-varying conditions should be clamped in a single frequency band; -monitoring the fault severity evolution over time is mandatory for variable-speed constant-frequency control strategies.</p><p>In the present paper, an effective method to solve the above open points in time-varying conditions is presented. The proposed technique has been already investigated in open-loop conditions and under different stator and rotor fault configurations <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>In closed-loop drives, the control itself has an impact on the magnitude of the fault frequency components in both voltages and currents <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. This issue was preliminary investigated under speed-varying conditions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, showing the effectiveness of the a technique based on the combined use of frequency sliding and Wavelet Transform.</p><p>In the present paper, a complete description which systematizes the use of the aforementioned technique is provided. The proposed approach is suitable not only in speed-varying conditions, but also for any time-varying conditions. A new contribution of this paper is the application of the proposed technique to the diagnosis of progressive stator and rotor unbalances, in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the technique and its ability to detect faults at incipient stages. In addition, a higher order mother wavelet is used to minimize the overlapping between adjacent bands and to obtain more accurate results.</p><p>The good agreement between simulation and experimental results for rotor and stator fault detection under speed and fault varying conditions proves the effectiveness of the developed technique. The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the WRIM control system when the machine is mounted as generator in a wind turbine. The analysis of rotor and stator fault frequencies is described in Section III. Simulation and experimental results are presented and commented in Sections IV. In Section V, the high sensitivity of the developed diagnostic technique is evaluated by means of several fault-varying condition tests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. WRIM CONTROL SYSTEM</head><p>In this paper the WRIM is supposed to be fed by a backto-back converter on the rotor side, whereas the stator side is directly connected to the power grid. This configuration is common in wind energy plants. An independent control of active and reactive powers on the stator side is achieved by using a stator flux oriented control <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The relationships between the active and reactive stator power and the rotor current components are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">qr s m s s i L L v P 2 3 - ≅ (1) 3 2 2 s m s s dr s m v L Q v i L f L π ⎛ ⎞ ⎜ ⎟ ≅ - ⎜ ⎟ ⎝ ⎠ .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Equations ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> show that the stator active power is proportional to -i qr , whereas the stator reactive power is proportional to -i dr since the stator voltage magnitude v s and the frequency f are imposed by the power grid. The complete control system consists of two cascaded control loops based on two proportional-integral (PI) controllers (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The outer loop controls the stator active and reactive powers, whereas the inner loop controls the d and q components of the rotor current.</p><p>The matrices D and D -1 represent the Clarke and the inverse Clarke transformations, which convert a three phase system into an equivalent two phase system and vice versa, whereas T and T -1 represent direct and inverse rotations of the reference frame. The angle θ denotes the phase angle of the stator flux vector, whereas θ r is the rotor position in electrical radians. Consequently, T(θ) is the transformation matrix from the stationary reference frame to the stator-flux oriented reference frame, and T(θ-θr) from the rotor reference frame to the stator-flux oriented reference frame <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The phase θ of the stator flux vector is computed by using the components of the magnetizing current vector,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ms i arg = θ</formula><p>(3) whereas the rotor angle θ r is measured by a mechanical sensor such as an incremental or an absolute encoder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. FAULT ANALYSIS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Fault Component Propagation</head><p>The WRIM is subject to both electromagnetic and mechanical stresses, which are symmetrically distributed. In healthy conditions, the three stator and rotor impedances are identical and the currents are balanced. Under these normal conditions, only the normal frequency components at f and sf exist respectively in the stator and rotor currents/voltages (f denotes the power grid frequency, s the slip).</p><p>If the stator is damaged, the stator symmetry of the machine is lost and a reverse rotating magnetic field is produced. Let us assume that the stator and rotor voltages are not altered by the fault and that the machine speed is free to vary. Then, a frequency component appears in the stator current at frequency -f. This inverse sequence is reflected on the rotor side and produces the frequency component (s-2)f, which induces a pulsating torque and a speed oscillation at frequency 2f. This frequency generates both a reaction current at frequency (s-2)f and a new component at frequency (s+2)f. The latter produces new components in the stator currents at frequencies ±3f, and the process starts again. In conclusion, it leads to a set of new components at frequencies (f kss =±(1-2k)f) k=0,1,2,… in the stator currents and (f krs =(s±2k)f) k=0,1,2,… in the rotor currents. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> gives a graphical interpretation of the aforementioned propagation mechanism of the fault harmonics. The periods of the fault harmonics are shown on the x-axis, ordered according to the propagation mechanism, whereas the corresponding frequencies are shown on the y-axis. It is worth noting that this interpretation is just qualitative and may help the reader to understand the effect of an unbalance, but does not provide either a quantitative or an accurate description of all the phenomena involved.</p><p>Similar considerations can be done for a rotor dissymmetry. In this case, an inverse rotating magnetic field is produced by an inverse sequence component at frequency -sf in the rotor currents. This inverse sequence is reflected on  the stator side and produces the frequency component (1-2s)f, which causes both electromagnetic and mechanical interactions between rotor and stator. As a consequence, a set of new components at frequencies (f ksr =(1±2ks)f) k=0,1,2,… appears in the spectrum of the stator currents and a set of new components at frequencies (f krr =±(1+2k)sf) k=0,1,2,… in the spectrum of rotor currents. The corresponding time propagation mechanism of the abovementioned components is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> and 3 are valid under the assumption of open-loop systems. The behavior of the machine may be different if it is controlled under closed loop. In this case, the control system is normally able to ensure the correct operation even under small unbalances in both stator and rotor windings. In fact, the presence of the current harmonics is usually detected and the current regulators tend to track the sinusoidal references and to drive to zero the residual errors. The capability of the control system to compensate the current harmonics depends mainly on the frequency of the fault harmonics. If this frequency is outside the bandwidth of the control system, the current regulators cannot affect the amplitude of current harmonics. On the contrary, if the frequency of the unbalance harmonics is within the bandwidth of the control system, the control system can sensibly reduce the amplitude of the fault harmonics according to the gain of the control loop at those frequencies. This behavior is due to the current regulators, that naturally applies suitable voltage harmonics to cancel the corresponding current harmonics. At the same time, torque and speed oscillations are accordingly damped.</p><p>Since the bandwidth of the current loops is usually quite wide, the reduction effect on the main fault frequencies may be remarkable, and the fault frequencies are expected to appear in the voltage set-points at the output of the current regulators <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>In the case of the WRIM-based system of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the rotor-current fault frequency components may become less notable due to the compensating action of the control system. However, these fault-related frequencies become clearly visible in the modulating signals of the rotor voltages, which can be considered as a new effective diagnostic index. In other words, a stator fault is expected to generate a relevant harmonic at (s-2)f in the spectrum of the rotor voltages, whereas a rotor fault is expected to generate a negative sequence harmonic at -sf. The detection of the inverse sequence frequency components at (s-2)f and -sf is possible only by analyzing the rotor voltage space vector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Wavelet Analysis</head><p>The main feature of the WT is its capability of multiresolution analysis. The wavelet analysis is a signal analysis based on a combination of approximation and detail coefficients, via a mother wavelet and scaling functions for J decomposition levels. The level of decomposition J is related to the sampling frequency f sam of the analyzed signal (Table <ref type="table">I</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p><p>Once f sam is chosen, the repartition of the frequency bandwidths cannot be changed unless a new acquisition with a different sampling frequency is performed. This dependency complicates the choice of the frequency bands in which the fault frequency components are supposed to be. This is true especially when the influence of the fundamental component has to be avoided because of its proximity to the fault frequency components <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, an efficient solution to improve the effectiveness and the flexibility of the discrete WT for fault detection under time-varying conditions has been proposed. Under speed-varying conditions, the fault frequency components identified in Section IV.A are spread in a frequency band [f low , f up ] related to the speed range, where f low and f up denote respectively the lower and upper limits of the fault frequency evolution. The direct application of the classical motor current signature analysis (MCSA) based on the FA and applied to the machine control variables is not effective in time-varying conditions. Luckily, a simple processing of the rotor current or voltage space vectors allows shifting the fault component at frequency f krs or f krr in a dedicated frequency band among those shown in Table <ref type="table">I</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">- =<label>2 , , ) ( Re ) ( π</label></formula><p>where rr rs</p><p>x , is the rotor current or voltage space vector, to be analyzed. Then, the discrete WT is applied to the resulting signal rr rs sl</p><p>x , to extract the fault signature in the frequency band that has been chosen.</p><p>As illustrated in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>, the discrete WT analysis divides the signal into logarithmically spaced frequency bands. The approximation a J and detail d J have the same frequency bandwidth, equal to f sam /2 J+1 .

However, since the stator voltages are measured quantities, false positive or negative fault detections could be potentially discerned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>The proposed detection technique was validated by simulation and experimental tests. For the computer simulations, an analytical three phase model of the WRIM and its control system has been implemented in Matlab-Simulink. As explained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, the model used for simulation does not use coordinate transformations, and is based on the voltage equations written for every stator and rotor phase. The model allows one to modify and manage all the machine parameters in order to simulate any unbalanced operating condition. A complete set of simulations, confirmed by experimental results, has been reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</p><p>The experimental set-up (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>) consists of a 5.5kW, 220V/380V, 50Hz, 4 poles WRIM connected to a PWM back-to-back power converter on the rotor side. The generator is driven by a 9kW DC motor fed by a commercial speed-controlled DC/DC converter.</p><p>The field oriented control for the WRIM has been implemented on a dSPACE DS1103 board. Since the speed of the WRIM is not fixed by the control system (because the WRIM set points are the active and reactive powers), the rotor speed is determined by the DC motor, and can be varied by acting on the corresponding set-point.</p><p>For the assessment of the fault diagnosis algorithm, the grid voltages, the rotor-side line currents, the reference rotor voltages, the rotor and stator currents, and the rotor speed are sampled at 3.2kHz with a data acquisition window of 10 seconds. Finally, the frequency bandwidth of the current loops has been set to 100 Hz. Other parameters of the experimental set-up, used also for the simulations, have been reported in Appendix.</p><p>Since the common effect of both stator or rotor faults is the unbalance of the corresponding winding impedances, the fault configurations have been emulated in a non-destructive way by increasing the stator or the rotor phase resistances with additive components (R add ). During the tests, active and reactive power set-points at the stator side are kept equal to 5.5 kW and 4.1 kVA respectively. Initially, the performance of the WRIM has been verified in healthy condition during a speed transient from 1395 rpm to 1305 rpm. With a sampling frequency f sam of 3.2 kHz, a 8 th level decomposition (J=8) has been chosen to track the components f rs =(s-2)f and f rr = -sf in the time domain. Assuming a tolerance factor of 1.3, the values rs sl f and rr sl f , computed according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, are respectively 98.125 Hz and 8.125 Hz.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Stator Dissymmetry Detection</head><p>The stator dissymmetry has been simulated by means of an additional resistance R add connected in series with one stator phase winding and equal to the phase resistance R s . Rotor currents and voltages, used for space vectors (i r ,V r ) rs computation under healthy (balanced) and faulty (unbalanced) conditions, have been recorded. Simulation results are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure">5</ref><ref type="figure">6</ref>, whereas Figs. <ref type="figure">7</ref> and<ref type="figure">8</ref> show the behavior of the WRIM during the experimental tests in the same operating conditions.</p><p>The contribution of the stator unbalance component at frequency (s-2)f must be extracted from both rotor current and voltage space vectors. The 8 th -level approximations coming from the discrete WT of ) (t I rs sl and ) (t V rs sl in balanced and unbalanced conditions have been computed under the assumption of a sliding frequency rs sl f equal to 98.125 Hz. In healthy condition, the approximation a 8 does not show any variation. This fact indicates the absence of any fault component at frequency (s-2)f, in both rotor currents and voltages, thus leading to diagnose the healthy condition of the WRIM even under speed-varying operation.</p><p>In the case of stator unbalance (R add =R s ), the approximation a 8 issued from rotor currents analysis does not show any significant change. This is mainly due to the compensating action of the control system under unbalanced operating condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. However, for the same stator unbalance, large oscillations appear in the approximation a 8 issued from the rotor voltages. These oscillations have a constant magnitude depending on the unbalance degree (R add =R s ). The frequency variations of the oscillations during the transient is due to the slip-dependency of the fault component at (s-2)f .</p><p>As can be seen, this behavior is confirmed not only by the simulation results, but also by the experimental tests (Figs. <ref type="figure">7</ref><ref type="figure">8</ref>), although in some cases the magnitude variations have been even greater in the experimental tests compared to simulations.</p><p>In particular, Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> shows that the ratio between the amplitude of the approximation signal a 8 (≅ 0.5A) and the amplitude of the current (≅ 29A) is less than 0.017, whereas the ratio between the amplitude of the approximation signal a 8 (1.2V) and the amplitude of the voltage (27V before the speed step and 40 V after the speed step) varies from 0.044 to 0.030. In other words, the effect of the unbalance is from two to three times more visible in the voltage signals than in the current signals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Rotor Dissymmetry Detection</head><p>The same process has been repeated for the analysis of a rotor unbalance simulated by an additive resistance connected in series with a rotor phase and equal to its own resistance. In order to detect such an unbalance, the contribution of the rotor component at frequency -sf has to be extracted from the rotor current and voltage space vectors. Rotor currents and voltages have been recorded for the computation of the space vectors (i r ,V r ) rr in balanced and unbalanced conditions, simulating respectively the healthy and the faulty operation. The simulation results in Figs. Under rotor unbalance (R add =R r ), the same conclusion as for a stator unbalance has been obtained. The approximation a 8 coming from the rotor voltages shows large amplitude variations reflecting the presence of the frequency component -sf. Despite the speed transient, the oscillations reproducing the fault frequency evolution -sf are still significant. On the contrary, the variation of a 8 calculated for the rotor currents is small compared to the amplitude of the currents (Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>). Experimental results under balanced and unbalanced (R radd =R r ) conditions have confirmed this behavior (Figs. <ref type="figure">11</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>). More accurately, the contribution of the negative sequence at the frequency -sf under a rotor unbalance coming from the rotor voltages is more important than the corresponding one coming from rotor currents.</p><p>In conclusion, the experimental results are in total   agreement with the simulation, thus proving the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the diagnosis of rotor dissymmetry in a WRIM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EVALUATION OF THE DIAGNOSTICS TECHNIQUE</head><p>The results obtained in Section IV prove that the wavelet signal a 8 is sensitive enough to diagnose either stator or rotor winding unbalances in any WRIM operating conditions. This fact confirms the validity of the proposed technique applied to rotor voltages even in presence of slip variations. In this section, the sensitivity of the proposed diagnostic technique is evaluated by the analysis of progressive stator and rotor winding unbalances. These operating conditions have been simulated through a resistance increment from R add =0 to R add =1.3R s or R add =1.3R r respectively under stator or rotor progressive unbalance. The experimental set-up has been designed to emulate these situations by inserting an external variable resistance in series to a stator or a rotor phase. For the above listed tests, the WRIM operates in steady-state condition at the rated speed of 1400rpm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Stator Dissymmetry</head><p>The stator resistance has been linearly varied in simulation from R add =0 to R add =1.3R s . At rated speed, and according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, the value of rs sl f used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> for the computation of ) (t V rs sl is -99.79 Hz. The simulation result of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">13</ref> has been confirmed by experimental tests in the same conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14</ref>). During the first time interval (from t=0s to t ≈ 2s) under healthy condition, the three-phase rotor voltages are balanced and sinusoidal. For this time interval, the 8 th approximation signal, representative of the stator fault component at the frequency (s-2)f, does not show any variation. During the ramp variation of the stator resistance emulating the winding fault, the rotor phase voltages are balanced, although progressive distortions appear, which indicate the increasing contribution of the fault component at frequency (s-2)f. As can be seen, the progressive stator unbalance is visible in the approximation signal a 8 , showing a proportional increase of its magnitude. Hence, the trend of the approximation signal is related to the fault component at frequency (s-2)f. The experimental tests corroborate the simulation results and prove the effectiveness of the proposed technique.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Rotor Dissymmetry</head><p>The rotor resistance has been progressively varied in simulation from R add =0 to R add =1.3R r . At rated speed, and according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>, the value of rr sl f given by (4) to compute ) (t V rr sl is -6.45 Hz. The simulation result (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">15</ref>) has been confirmed by the experimental tests in the same conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">16</ref>). As it can be seen, in healthy condition (from t=0s to t ≈ 2s) the three-phase rotor voltages are quite balanced and sinusoidal. The corresponding approximation signal a 8 does not show any particular oscillation during the two first seconds. When the rotor dissymmetry occurs, the threephase rotor voltages are almost sinusoidal but become progressively unbalanced as long as the contribution of the fault frequency component -sf increases. This is clearly reflected by the progressive distortion of the approximation a 8 , allowing to diagnose the rotor windings degradation. In conclusion, the experimental results are in good agreement with the simulations.    Copyright (c) 2011 IEEE. Personal use is permitted.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Fault Quantification</head><p>Once the state of the machine has been diagnosed, a quantitative evaluation of the fault degree is necessary. For this purpose, the fault indicator mPa j at different resolution levels j has been introduced:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">∑ Δ = Δ = n n j j n a n V I mPa 1 2 ) ( 1 ) , (<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where a j (n) is the approximation signal of interest (a 8 in our case), Δn denotes the number of samples and j the decomposition level. The fault indicator is periodically calculated over time, every δn sampling period and over a time interval including the latter Δn samples. This process is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">17</ref>.</p><p>During the experimental tests, the time interval between two consecutive calculations of the fault indicator was 125 ms and the length of the time window for the calculation of the fault indicator was 2000 ms. Since the sample frequency was 3200 Hz, the number of samples between two consecutive calculations of the fault indicator was δn = 125 10 -3 3200 = 400, and the length of the sequence of samples was Δn = 2000 10 -3 • 3200 = 6400. The values of δn and Δn were chosen according to the desired time sensitivity to observe the fault evolution.</p><p>When the fault occurs, the signal energy distribution changes due to the presence of the fault frequency component. Hence, the energy excess confined in the approximation signal may be considered as a fault indicator in case of stator or rotor unbalances.</p><p>The trends of the fault indicators mPa 8 (I) and mPa 8 (V) corresponding to the simulation results depicted in Figs. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and<ref type="figure">6</ref> were computed under healthy and faulty conditions and are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">18</ref>. In healthy conditions (R add =0), and under large range of speed variations, mPa 8 (I) and mPa 8 (V) are practically constant. Consequently, the indicator values for the healthy WRIM can be assumed as a baseline to set the threshold to discriminate healthy from stator unbalance conditions. Under unbalanced operating conditions (R add =R s ), mPa 8 (I) does not show any significant variation. As previously discussed, this is due to the compensating effect of the control system. However, mPa 8 (V) shows a significant increase. The large energy deviation observed in faulty condition proves the effectiveness of the proposed approach, since the WRIM speed transient does not affect the indicator accuracy. The trend of the fault indicators shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">19</ref>, V t under progressive stator unbalance is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">22a</ref>. When the stator asymmetry occurs progressively, the fault indicator clearly shows the fault evolution. In the same way, under a progressive rotor unbalance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">22b</ref>), the fault indicator related to ( ) rr sl V t shows a trend proportional to the fault severity. The discrepancy observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">22</ref> between simulation and experimental results is mainly due to the inherent motor asymmetry and to measurements errors that are not considered in the analytical model. However, once the proposed technique is implemented, there is no need to know the effect of the above non-idealities. In fact, a diagnosis criterion for the proposed technique typically consists in checking if the fault indicator exceeds a threshold value, which is chosen experimentally according to the accuracy of the measurements, the desired sensitivity and the behavior of the healthy machine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>''a j '' signal</head><p>In addition, the proposed fault indicator could be used also to build more complex diagnosis criteria. For example, datasets built by means of the proposed fault indicator may be used to train clustering or fuzzy techniques, neural networks or others AI methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>A new diagnostics procedure for rotor or stator electrical faults of WRIM drives in time-varying conditions has been proposed. This technique can be particularly useful for modern wind turbine generators. The proposed approach is based on the use of the discrete WT improved by a preprocessing of the variables that have to be analyzed. Both simulation and experimental results prove that, under closedloop operation, rotor voltages are more sensitive than rotor currents to both stator or rotor unbalances. The proposed method is a viable solution to overcome the limit of the classical MCSA under time-varying conditions.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig.2.
