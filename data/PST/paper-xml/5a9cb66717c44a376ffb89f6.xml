<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>NOMA is a promising radio access technique for next-generation wireless networks. In this article, we investigate the NOMA-based cooperative relay network. We begin with an introduction of the existing relay-assisted NOMA systems by classifying them into three categories: uplink, downlink, and composite architectures. Then we discuss their principles and key features, and provide a comprehensive comparison from the perspective of spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and total transmit power. A novel strategy called hybrid power allocation is further discussed for the composite architecture, which can reduce the computational complexity and signaling overhead at the expense of marginal sum rate degradation. Finally, major challenges, opportunities, and future research trends for the design of NOMA-based cooperative relay systems with other techniques are also highlighted to provide insights for researchers in this field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IntroductIon</head><p>The rapid development of wireless transmission and mobile communications techniques has led to an explosive increase in the data traffic of wireless networks. In order to support the tremendous demands on data traffic, the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique, which can be realized in the power domain, code domain, or other domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, is widely recognized as a key technique for the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</p><p>Recently, significant research efforts have been dedicated to applying NOMA techniques to various scenarios, motivated by the following benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Higher Spectrum Efficiency and Cell Edge Throughput: NOMA can serve an arbitrary number of users in each resource block by superimposing all users' signals, and according to the near-far effect, more power can be allocated to the nodes with poor channel quality to improve the cell edge throughput.</p><p>Good Backward Compatibility with Other Techniques: NOMA can easily be applied on top of orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) for downlink and single-carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA) for uplink, and can easily be combined with massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) techniques to further support better system performance.</p><p>Among those, the application of NOMA to cooperative relaying scenarios is becoming popular. By now, a class of dual-hop relay-aided NOMA systems has been developed, where no direct link exists and the relay adopts either decode and forward (DF) or amplify and forward (AF) protocol. For example, the cooperative X network <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and the diamond network <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> considering NOMA and the DF protocol have been constructed, where the decoding of the signals at the relay and user must follow the same manner, or the achievable sum rate will deteriorate dramatically. On the other hand, a study with the AF protocol was carried out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. A downlink communication system would become a cooperative relay network if the cell center users can act as relay nodes for cell edge users via successive interference cancellation (SIC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The superiority of NOMA over OMA in terms of achievable sum rate is highly dependent on the system's asymmetry. Therefore, configuring or selecting the relays to fully exploit the near-far effect is a goal to achieve better system performance with NOMA. However, how to realize effective configuration and optimization for such networks is still an open issue.</p><p>In this article, we develop a unified architecture for the power-domain NOMA cooperative relay network through a sophisticated combination of three basic communication structures. The system settings, decoding orders, system asymmetries, power allocation, and performance are discussed. Besides, a novel hybrid power allocation strategy is proposed for the composite architecture. The major challenges, opportunities, and future research trends are also discussed.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. We first illustrate the basic communication structures and then present the categories of cooperative relay networks accordingly. Then we briefly review the features of NOMA in uplink and downlink transmissions. Following that, we discuss the characteristics of system settings, decoding strategies, system asymmetries, and power allocation schemes for the cooperative relay systems. Besides, performance comparisons among the existing cooperative relay architectures are presented. We then propose an effective hybrid power allocation strategy for NOMA cooperative relay systems. Then the opportunities, challenges, and research trends are highlighted. Finally, we conclude this article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>structures of relAy-AIded WIreless netWorks</head><p>There are three basic modes for communications between source S and destination D, namely the one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-one modes, as shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-1c</ref>. Actually, there is another many-to-many mode, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>. However, such a structure can be constructed by the first three basic modes. For brevity, the manyto-many mode is not discussed in this article.</p><p>According to the basic communication modes, the cooperative relay networks, which comprise sources, relays, and users, can be simply divided into three categories, namely the uplink (manyto-one structure), the downlink (one-to-many structure), and the composite (both uplink and downlink) architectures, as shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-2d</ref>. Since the one-to-one mode can be subordinated to either uplink or downlink transmission, the cooperative relay system constructed by either the uplink or downlink architecture always includes a one-to-one mode. For the case in which there are direct links between the source and user nodes, this article only focuses on the classical three-node relay-aided wireless networks, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>. On the other hand, due to the orthogonality, a receiver in OMA can only decode the data by applying a single-user detector, such that the user node cannot act as a relay node to improve the system performance. However, for NOMA, since SIC can realize multi-user detection, the cell center user can act as a relay to improve the reception reliability for other users with poor connections, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref>.</p></div>

Without loss of generality, it is assumed that s i 2 is arranged in ascending order, that is, </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">s 1 2 ≤ … ≤ s N 2 ,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>processIng procedures</head><p>Uplink: For uplink transmission, the optimal multiple access strategy at the transmitter is that N users spread their signals across the entire bandwidth with different transmit powers. At the receiver, rather than decoding every user by treating the interference from other users as noise, the SIC technique, in which after one user is decoded, its signal is stripped away from the aggregate received signal before the next user is decoded, is applied to achieve a higher achievable rate. Specifically, first, the base station decodes the signal from the stronger user U i by treating the signals of {U n } as noise, where n  {1, … , i -1}. Then the signal of U i is subtracted from the received signal to decode the signals of {U n }. Finally, for U 1 , it is just corrupted by the noise as the other users' signals have been successively decoded and cancelled out.</p><p>Downlink: For downlink transmission, the SIC is applied at the receiver, the superposition coding (SC) is used at the transmitter, and more power is allocated to a weaker user, namely P i ≥ P i+1 . First, each user decodes the signals from other weaker users, that is, U i can decode the signals of {U n } with n &lt; i. Then the signals of weaker users are subtracted from the received signal to decode the signal of user U i by treating the signals of U m with m &gt; i as interference. Finally, for U N , it is just corrupted by the noise as the other users' signals have been successively decoded and cancelled out. Since a lower transmit power is assigned to a stronger user, the signal strength of a stronger user is not higher than that of a weaker user. Therefore, NOMA does not contradict the basic concept of SIC, in which decoding of the strongest signal should be performed first.</p><p>Differences: One of the key distinctions between the uplink and downlink transmissions is the decoding order. To be more specific, for downlink, strong users successively decode and cancel the signals of weak ones prior to decoding their own signals, whereas for uplink, the receiver successively decodes and cancels the signals of strong users prior to decoding the signals of weak ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>cApAcIty And AsyMMetry</head><p>Reports have said that NOMA generally outperforms OMA in the rate region in the two users case <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.

To characterize the effect of the channel difference for uplink transmission, we introduce the degree of asym-One of the key distinctions between the uplink and downlink transmissions is the decoding order.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>relAy-AIded noMA netWorks</head><p>For ease of exposition, Rayleigh fading channels are considered, and N = 2 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> is assumed in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>systeM settIngs</head><p>Relay with DF Protocol: For networks with DF protocol, where the SIC is utilized at relay and user ends, the decoding order for source to relay (S → R) and relay to user (R → U) transmissions should be organized in the same manner. Otherwise, the achievable sum rate will decrease dramatically because of the minfunction, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>. Note that for the composite architectures, such as Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>, the decoding orders for S → R (uplink or downlink) and R → U (downlink or uplink) transmissions are different. Consequently, the channel gains for the S → R link are configured as ascending (descending) and the one for the R → U link as descending (ascending). In fact, such settings for the composite architectures are reasonable since they can reach a higher achievable sum rate and balance the throughput fairness among all multiplexed users. Relay with AF Protocol: For networks with AF protocol, where the SIC is only utilized at the user end, according to the decoding order at the user, the power allocations for S → R and R → U transmissions should be performed in the same manner. Otherwise, the system performance, for example, the achievable sum rate and outage probability, will deteriorate significantly. A special case is that, for the uplink or downlink architecture, both S → R and R → U transmissions employ the same fixed power allocation scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.

Unfortunately, such setting is impractical because it will result in poor throughput fairness among all users. Therefore, an uplink or downlink architecture for the AF relay network could be a better choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>systeM AsyMMetry</head><p>The degree of asymmetry for the cooperative relay system can be defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">A r = σ h SR s 2 σ h SR w 2 ⋅ σ h RU s 2 σ h RU w 2</formula><p>where r denotes the relay networks, and s and w denote the strong and weak users for S → R and R → U links, respectively. Clearly, A r is the product of degrees of asymmetry for uplink and downlink transmissions. Once there is a one-to-one mode, namely</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">σ h SR s 2 = σ h RU w 2 or σ h RU s 2 = σ h RU w 2</formula><p>we will have</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">A r = σ h RU s 2 σ h RU w 2 or A r = σ h SR s 2 σ h SR w 2</formula><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3b</ref> shows the gaps of achievable sum rate between the NOMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and OMA Max-Min schemes under different A r , where the OMA Max-Min scheme denotes that the relay Rk is selected to transmit the message from the source to the destination with</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">k = arg max k∈{1,2} min{σ h SR k 2 ,σ h R k U 2 } { } .</formula><p>In general, the more severe the asymmetry is, the greater the advantages of NOMA are. Therefore, when A r is large enough (e.g., A r &gt; 3), it is better to apply NOMA than OMA in practice. However, for the diamond network <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, if the channel conditions satisfy k ≠ 2, the superiority of NOMA over OMA will weaken or even disappear, as the black curve in Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref> shows. This can be understood by the fact that since the source-relay-user channel selected by OMA is better than that for the symbol that is last decoded in NOMA, OMA achieves a larger achievable sum rate than NOMA. Hence, for the diamond network, we would prefer NOMA to OMA when not only A r is large enough, but also the source-relay-user channel selected by OMA is the same as that for the user who is last decoded in NOMA. For example, the channel conditions are set as (1)-( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) in the caption of Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>perforMAnce coMpArIsons</head><p>Uplink Architectures: It has been shown that NOMA can be applied in the uplink transmission. However, since different users are located in different positions and experience different channel conditions, we have to face some ticklish problems. On one hand, it is difficult to realize signal synchronization at both transmitting and receiving ends, and on the other hand, realizing effective control on the transmit power among different users to avoid interference is very challenging in practice.</p><p>Downlink Architectures: One of the most famous downlink architectures is the classical three-node relay network <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, where a source, a half-duplex DF relay, and a user are considered, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>. However, most existing NOMA schemes only put emphasis on the Rayleigh fading scenario <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. For this reason, a NOMA scheme over Rician fading channel is proposed to handle this problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> shows another downlink architecture for cooperative relay systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, where a half-duplex AF or DF relay assists the communication between the source and users. Since the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) with DF relaying is always higher than that with AF relaying, the DF protocol is preferred over the AF one. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, the outage probability and achievable sum rate can be significantly improved when the DF protocol is applied, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. This can be understood as follows. If more power is allocated to the weak user, the system's outage behavior will be improved, while the achievable sum rate of the NOMA system will decrease since less power is allocated to the stronger user, which has a full degree of freedom in the achievable rate. Therefore, there is a trade-off between the outage probability and achievable sum rate.</p><p>Composite Architectures: Figures 2c and 2d illustrate the composite architectures for DF relay systems. In general, such systems are asymmetric, where the channel gains for uplink transmission are sorted in ascending (descending) order, and those for downlink transmission in descending (ascending) order <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">3b</ref> shows the gaps of achievable sum rate between NOMA and OMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> with different degrees of asymmetry.</p><p>Since the channel conditions for uplink and downlink transmissions are different in general, power waste will result if the transmit powers for the two links are both fixed as P t . Without loss of generality, assume that the channel quality for the uplink is better than that for the downlink. In this case, we do not need to allocate full power to all symbols for the uplink, whereas for the downlink, P t must be fully allocated to all symbols. Therefore, with a central processing unit that can adjust the transmit power of the symbols according to the instantaneous CSI, the total power consumed by NOMA-DF, and TDMA schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, where the channel setting is s 2 SR = 8, s 2 RU1 = 2, and s 2 RU2 = 10. The power allocation coefficients for user 1 and user 2 in NOMA are 0.6875 and 0.3125 (solid lines), 0.8 and 0.2 (dash-dot lines), respectively, while the resources allocated to user 1 and user 2 in TDMA are average. The real power utilization of NOMA is much larger than that of OMA, which can be up to 30 percent. Although NOMA outperforms OMA in terms of achievable sum rate, the ratio between achievable sum rate and power consumption for NOMA is smaller than that of OMA, which means that the energy efficiency of the former is lower than that of the latter.</p><p>the system can be saved to less than 2P t <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. On the other hand, provided that the requirement of quality of service has been satisfied, the saved power can be allocated to the weak user so as to improve its data rate, outage probability, and fairness.</p><p>Assuming the knowledge of perfect CSIs, the achievable sum rate, energy efficiency, and normalized power utilization are chosen as performance metrics for comparison. We can see from Figs. 5a-1 and 5b-1 that NOMA shows significant superiority over OMA in terms of achievable sum rate. However, in contrast, as shown in Figs. 5a-2 and 5b-2, NOMA performs worse than OMA in terms of energy efficiency. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that NOMA can fully utilize the pre-allocated power according to the channel conditions, which results in a boost in achievable sum rate, whereas for OMA, the pre-allocated power cannot be used effectively since the near-far effect exists. As shown in Figs. 5a-3 and 5b-3, the real power utilization of NOMA is much larger than that of OMA, which can be up to 30 percent. Although NOMA outperforms OMA in terms of achievable sum rate, the ratio between achievable sum rate and power consumption for NOMA is small-er than that of OMA, which means that the energy efficiency of the former is lower than that of the latter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HybrId poWer AllocAtIon strAtegy</head><p>As discussed above, NOMA can be used for capacity improvement in cooperative relay systems. For the composite structures, however, design of a dynamic power allocation scheme for uplink transmission is very challenging. Fortunately, by borrowing the idea of "hybrid-NOMA" <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>, we can solve this problem with a hybrid power allocation strategy that uses both the knowledge of instantaneous CSI and statistical CSI.</p><p>Assume that the network has the knowledge of the statistical CSI of the S → R link and both the statistical and instantaneous CSIs of the R → U link. The hybrid power allocation strategy can be performed in two stages. In the first stage, the power allocation scheme in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> can be employed to maximize the system's achievable sum rate with the statistical CSIs of the S → R and R → U links, by which we can obtain fixed optimal power allocation coefficients for the S → R transmission. In the second stage, by fixing the power allocation coefficients for the S → R transmission as that obtained in the first stage, we can obtain new dynamic FIGURE 5.

Let ICSI and SCSI denote the power allocation schemes obtained with the knowledge of instantaneous CSI and statistical CSI for the NOMA scheme, respectively. Simulation results illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> show that the hybrid power allocation strategy (marked as HCSI in the figure) can achieve almost the same achievable sum rate as the one obtained under ICSI (marked as ICSI in the figure). On the other hand, it also shows superiority over the one obtained under SCSI (marked as SCSI in the figure), even when the near-far effect is not severe. Simulation results on the energy efficiency ratio and normalized power utilization are illustrated in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6b</ref> and<ref type="figure">c</ref>, where FDMA is chosen as the benchmark. It is shown that with the highest spectral efficiency and lowest power consumption, the hybrid power allocation strategy performs the best in terms of energy efficiency. To sum up, considering its lower computational complexity on power scheduling, effectiveness to combat the near-far effect, and superior performance, the hybrid power allocation strategy will be a promising solution for cooperative relay systems with NOMA.</p></div>

However, such a dynamic power allocation scheme is obtained under the condition that global instantaneous CSIs can be available, which means that the signaling overhead, used for CSI and power allocation feedback, is large and would bring huge computational complexity, especially when the number of users is very large. On the other hand, since the feedback delay will cause channel estimation error, and perfect time synchronization for the uplink is difficult to implement, obtaining perfect CSI is challenging. To circumvent this problem, new power allocation solutions, which can reduce the feedback overhead at the expense of  marginal performance degradation, are demanding, such as the hybrid power allocation strategy proposed in the earlier section, and the strategy that uses limited feedback to obtain CSI <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>coMMunIcAtIon securIty</head><p>Attracted by the advantages of NOMA, recently, the secrecy issue of NOMA has been studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. However, how to realize secure communications with NOMA is still an open issue, especially in NOMA cooperative relay networks, since relays re-transmit a copy of the information symbols that are summed up via SC and transmitted over the same frequency band, which means that once the carrier frequency is successfully located by the eavesdropper, all users' messages may be intercepted. An effective solution is that the system should first gather CSIs and then choose an appropriate relay to perform secure communications with other relays releasing cooperative jamming. Specifically, once the appropriate relay is confirmed, the other relays should release jamming during the two phases. However, the aforementioned discussions assume that the relay works as a trusted transmitter. In fact, scenarios with untrusted relays exist, especially in the cases of untrusted relays with DF protocol, where all users' symbols must be decoded first before they are retransmitted. Therefore, how to perform security communications for NOMA cooperative relay networks in the presence of untrusted relays is an interesting issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HArdWAre developMent</head><p>Although NOMA significantly outperforms conventional OMA in application to cooperative relaying, the corresponding hardware implementation associated with NOMA is more complex. For example, because of limited processing capability, it is difficult to perform multi-user detection and interference cancellation for the mobile user <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Moreover, one of the reasons why NOMA outperforms OMA is that it allows more users to access the network simultaneously. Therefore, a high-performance SIC unit for the mobile receiver is a key enabler for implementation of NOMA in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>noMA cooperAtIve relAy systeMs WItH MMWAve</head><p>It has been reported that the mmWave with NOMA can achieve higher spectrum and energy efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. On the other hand, since the wavelength of mmWave bands is very short, effective communications generally require the transmitter and the corresponding receiver to be located in line-of-sight (LOS) range. Due to the mobility of users and surrounding obstacles, blockage and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channels are inevitable.</p><p>In order to apply the mmWave technique to 5G systems while guaranteeing effective coverage, anti-blockage mechanisms are required through which the mmWave system is able to adaptively switch from LOS transmission mode to NLOS transmission mode. Thus, the incorporation of cooperative relay techniques into the mmWave communication system will bring many new possibilities and challenges for the deployment of mmWave cellular networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>; for example, how to place or select the optimal relay nodes for the network will become very important.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>conclusIons</head><p>In this article, we have discussed and compared the NOMA cooperative relay schemes from the aspects of basic principles, key features, criterion for system construction, and engineering feasibility. Three typical structures of cooperative relay systems have been investigated, and simulation results have demonstrated the advantages of cooperative relaying with NOMA, especially for the composite structures. Furthermore, a hybrid power allocation strategy, which can provide lower computational complexity and reduce signaling overhead at the expense of marginal sum rate degradation, has been proposed for NOMAbased cooperative relay networks. We have also highlighted key challenges, opportunities, and future research trends for the design of NOMA cooperative relay systems.</p><p>The incorporation of cooperative relay techniques into the mmWave communication system will bring many new possibilities and challenges for the deployment of mmWave cellular networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, for example, how to place or select the optimal relay nodes for the network will become very important.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1.
