<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Course recommendation systems are applied to help students with different needs select courses in a large range of course resources. However, a student's needs are not always determined by their personal interests, they are also influenced by teachers, peers etc. Unlike online courses, user behavior and user satisfaction of offline courses often have serious sparse and cold start issues, which cause overfitting problems in previous neural network and matrix factorization (MF) models. Additionally, the interpersonal relations, evaluation text and existing ''user-item" formatted rating matrix constitute a multi-source and multi-modal data structure, so a systematic data fusion method is needed to establish recommendations based on these heterogeneous characteristics. Therefore, a hybrid recommendation model by fusing network structured feature with graph neural networks and user interactive activities with tensor factorization was proposed in this paper. First, a graph structured teaching evaluation network is proposed to describe students, courses, and other entities by using the students' rating, commentary text, grading and interpersonal relations. Then, a random walk based neural network is employed to generate the vectorized representation of students by learning their own relational structure. Finally, by recognizing these personalization features as the third dimension of the rating tensor, a Bayesian Probabilistic Tensor Factorization-based tensor factorization is applied to learn and predict students' ratings for classes they have not taken. Experiments on a real-world evaluation of teaching system including 532 participants with 7,453 rating records show that the proposed method outperforms other existing neural network and matrix factorization models including xSVD++, RTTF and DSE with a smaller predictive error as well as better recommendation accuracy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>As a typical type of learning objects and resources, educational courses are an important element in the dissemination of knowledge in online and offline educational scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Currently, both e-learning systems (e.g. Massive Open Online Courses) and conventional teaching departments are suffering from the problem of information overload, that is, a platform often has a large amount of course resources, while students who have just entered the platform do not have a way to quickly and accurately select the most suitable courses due to the lack of overall assessment of self-preferences, skills and learning objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Therefore, recommending courses based on the behavior and attribute characteristics of students to overcome such a problem has been the focus of several academic communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>In recent years, although the current course recommendation research has been remarkably focused on both academic and industrial areas as a novel perspective of smart city studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. However, key implied information which helps to improve the accuracy of the recommendation, such as the relations between courses, teachers and students are not fully utilized. Especially in the offline teaching environment, the collection of students' learning information and the extraction of students' relationship network information become more challenging <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. For instance, the students' choice of courses will not only depend on their own interests and skills, but will also be influenced by suggestions from their peers and teachers. Therefore, an unified representation paradigm for aforementioned text as well as network structure formatted multi-sourced heterogeneous data is significantly required <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>From a technical point of view in the course recommendation area, data from teaching evaluations provide stable information to relieve the above issue, where students submit their ratings and comments to express their opinion on courses they have taken <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>. These ratings build a basic user-course format rating matrix which can be decomposed to student and course vectors to profile students and courses, thereby enabling the ratings of courses which have not yet been taken to be predicted by performing calculations on these vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. However, traditional matrix factorization (MF)-based recommendation models only consider information such as the user's selection preferences and cannot integrate the above multi-modal heterogeneous network features into the existing rating matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Faced with the aforementioned problems and issues, in this paper, we propose a course recommendation model based on an embedding teaching evaluation network and Bayesian Probabilistic Tensor Factorization (BPTF). In particular, we first construct a teaching evaluation network to describe each student's profile relations including academic grade, supervisor, gender and their lexical style in commenting on different courses. Then, the node2vec algorithm is utilized to embed students into vectors, and the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is utilized to categorize these vectors into different degrees of personalization. Third, we extend the original rating matrix into a three-dimensional rating tensor which includes students, courses and a category of personalization, and conduct rating prediction based on the BPTF method. We compare and analyze our proposed method with other existing matrix and tensor factorization-based models using a real-world teaching evaluation dataset by selecting the courses with the highest predicted ratings as the recommended list.</p><p>In brief, the proposed method has the contributions in the following aspects: (1) First, a heterogeneous graph was constructed for modeling the teaching evaluation with six types of entities and five kinds of relations. (2) Afterwards, by transforming student information, interpersonal relationships, and evaluation text into a network structure, we realized the unified expression of multiple heterogeneous data in the field of course recommendation problems, thereby achieving more accurate and effective course recommendations through tensor factorization technologies. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that these multimodal and heterogeneous course information have been integrated into a graph based network for depicting students' personalization. Compared to other course recommendation model, our proposed hybrid method has an advantage potential in both rating prediction and top-N recommendation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related works</head><p>The innovation of the Internet and online e-learning systems have resulted in a huge increase in the volume of course-related information available to students. Early course recommendations have two salient features: using specific rules and using explicit student feedback to make recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. With the development of related technologies in the fields of data science and artificial intelligence, and the advancement of modern learning technologies such as intelligent tutor systems, the data sources that can be used for analysis purposes are wider and the analytical approaches are more diverse. Currently, the existing methods for course recommendation can be briefly divided into the following types: collaborative filtering-based, content-based, graph/ ontology-based, sequence mining-based, semi-supervised and hybrid methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Collaborative filtering based methods</head><p>Collaborative filtering-based methods are widely used in the area of recommendation. These methods make the assumption that if a user has the same opinion as another user on the same item, these two users tend to have more similar opinions on different items than two users chosen randomly. In the area of course recommendation, several studies have focused on collaborative filtering-based methods. Durao et al. built an e-learning system, namely Atepassar.com, and proposed a course-based recommendation system based on calculating the distance between the user matrix and courses <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Elbadrawy and Karypis introduced matrix factorization into course recommendation and proposed a neighborhood-based user collaborative filtering method to generate top-n course recommendation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. This MF-based method was enhanced by Thanh-Nhan et al. who implemented a knearest neighborhood (kNN) collaborative filtering method to improve the performance of the matrix factorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Khorasani et al. proposed a Markov-based collaborative filtering model to recommend courses to students each semester, based on the sequence of courses they have taken in the previous semesters without any prior knowledge of the institution, course prerequisites, curriculum or degree requirement <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. In addition, twostep collaborative filtering based method is proposed by Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. This study divided Bayesian Personal Ranking Matrix Factorization into a two-stage algorithm to solve the problem where students of different grades are different in the choice of public electives. Recently, the Probability Matrix Factorization (PMF) model was introduced into the course recommendation scenario by Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Huang et al. proposed a Cross-User-Domain collaborative filtering method using the course score distribution of the most similar senior students to achieve a better prediction performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Recently, Lin et al. presented a convex optimization-based framework with one L0 regularization and the constraint on the learners' characteristics. It leveraged a machine-learning process to automatically extract formatted and un-formatted data consisting of both global and local features of the courses <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Content based methods</head><p>Content based methods are based on a description of the recommended item and a profile of the user's preferences. Apaza et al. utilized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to calculate the topic of courses, thereby recommending them to students with similar topic preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. To understand the features of a course better, a deep course content analysis method is performed. Dai et al. also employed LDA to predict how the content of a course is distributed over different categories in the domain, after which they utilized the syllabus as course content and curriculum guidelines as domain knowledge to build the recommender system <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Graph based methods</head><p>As a learning resource object, courses in a cyber and physical educational system contain a series of entities and relations, which can constitute an entity-relations network of the graph structure. Also known as a knowledge graph and ontology, graph based approaches can make efficient use of this natural data structure advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Antony et al. proposed an short message service based survey program to collect students' opinion on courses, and combined these opinions with their pre-defined course ontologies to support fuzzy-based course recommendation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. An ontology-based course recommender application is deployed by Ibrahim et al. with a more detailed definition of course ontology <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Their study and application are further refined by the kNN algorithm which is reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Sequence mining based methods</head><p>In addition, several studies focus on the use of each student's course sequence for sequence mining to obtain recommendations. Aher and Lobo exploited an Apriori + kmeans method to recommend courses in an e-Learning system based on historical data <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Xu et al. exploited a forward-search backward-induction algorithm to optimally select a course sequence and used multiarmed bandits to optimally recommend a course sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Zhang et al. implemented the classical Apriori algorithm to mine a frequent itemset in a Hadoop parallel computing environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Hou et al. also proposed a novel online learning algorithm based on hierarchical bandits with known smoothness to face the problems of the heterogeneity of large-scale user groups, sequence problems in courses and the foreseeable quantitative explosion of courses and users <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Based on the Markkov chain framework, Polyzou et al. proposed a random-walk-based approach that captures the sequential relations between the different courses and recommended a short list of courses using a crowdsourcing approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Semi-supervised methods</head><p>Recommending courses to students does not necessarily require the use of fully supervised methods. For example, Aditya et al. gave a unique insight from the linear program which their goal was to recommend courses to students that not only satisfy constraints, but that are also desirable <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. As another example, Hoiles and van der Schaar gave a novel view from Reinforcement Learning. They proposed a regression estimator for contextual multi-armed bandits with a penalized variance term <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In addition, a taxonomy-based solution inspired by the domain of library science was proposed by Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Recently, based on the advantages of reinforcement learning, Zhang et al. proposed a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning method for mass user learning data on their e-learning platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Hybrid methods</head><p>Several studies propose a recommendation approach by combining at least two of the aforementioned methods. Hybrid methods have received attention since the beginning of research into course recommendation. For example, in earlier periods, scholars used collaborative filtering as a complement to the rule-based method to reduce invalid recommendations due to missing rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Additionally, the collaborative filtering method can also be improved by the immune algorithm which was reported by Chang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Ng et al. proposed a college-oriented course recommendation system, namely CrsRecs which combines LDA, tag and sentiment methods to extract students' opinions on courses and uses them with the matrix factorization method to make recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Jing et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> also utilized ''collaborative filtering + content based" methods to recommend courses to relieve the issue of sparsity, anti-interest and the cold start problem. Lin et al. proposed a sparse linear method based top-n course recommendation system with artificial expert knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Krstova et al. made a combination of SimRank and matrix factorization method to implement course recommendations. Recently, Esteban et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> presented a Genetic Algorithm based recommendation system configuration which combines collaborative filtering and contentbased filtering by using multiple criteria related both to student and course information. They performed an experimental study by using real-world data from University of Cordoba to exhibit the practicability of their proposed model. Additionally, our previous studies also proposed several hybrid models to recommend learning objects including courses based on concept mapping and the immune algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, sequence pattern mining and ontology <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, as well as collaborative filtering and self-organization-based knowledge propagation network <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> with fuzzy rules enhanced solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>To summarize, the current research on course recommendation utilizes different features from students' historical behaviour, review content, sequence characteristics, ontologies, etc. Based on the materials used in these studies and their results, we can assert that the behavior of student in selecting courses is related to data with multiple modalities from multiple channels. Therefore, seeking a uniform quantitative representation of these multi-source heterogeneous data and relying on as many data features as possible will help to improve the accuracy of the recommendation. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are few solutions which investigate merging the network structured student profile (graph feature), review style (content feature) and student similarity (collaborative filtering feature).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head><p>In this section, we introduce our proposed method for rating prediction and course recommendation. Our proposed method consists of two major parts: (1) measuring the degree of similarity of a student with other students when evaluating a course according to their teaching evaluation network as well as the level of the student's mastery of knowledge of courses, thereby categorizing them into different classes; (2) proposing a rating prediction method by applying BPTF to the student evaluation of teaching (SET) tenor which consists of ratings, students, courses, and students' personalization measured as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. The entire schema of this study is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Unified representation of students' personalization in teaching evaluation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">Establishing heterogeneous student evaluation of teaching network</head><p>For student s i ði ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; mÞ and course c j ðj ¼ 1; 2; . . . nÞ, the corresponding rating record (re i;j ) can be described as a quadruple: re i;j :¼&lt; s i ; c j ; r i;j ; mk i;j &gt; ð1Þ where r i;j denotes the review/rating the student gives to the course and mk i;j is the teaching result (e.g. final grades) the student achieves in this course. In this study, to avoid the introduction of potential retaliatory ratings, we adopt a static game-like assumption where students can only view their grades after completing the evaluation of the course. On the other side, the teacher can only view the students' evaluation of the courses they have taught after uploading the students' grades.</p><p>Based on the precondition mentioned in the introduction, r i;j is made up of text-based comments (rt) as well as score-based evaluation questionnaires (rs), i.e. r i;j :¼&lt; rt i;j ; rs i;j &gt; ð2Þ</p><p>In this paper, we further extract lexical features from textual comments. Based on a previous finding <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, adjectives, verbs, and nouns after the removal of stop words reflect more commentary themes, therefore after the comment sentences are processed through word segmentation and the removal of stop words, only adjectives, verbs, and nouns are saved as nodes in the review network. In this way, the original student-course one-on-one evaluation can be transformed into a student-keyword cooccurrence-course network structure. In other words, the original relation &lt; s i ; c j ; rt i;j &gt; is split into: &lt; s i ; c j ; rt i;j &gt;) f&lt; s i ; w k ; choose word &gt;g; f&lt; w k ; c j ; describe &gt;g ð3Þ where w k is each theme word in all theme words W i;j given by s i to c j , and W ¼ S m;n i¼1;j¼1 W i;j . From another aspect, there are also structured relations between students outside of this field of teaching evaluation. These relations have the potential to affect a student's course choice, because it has been proven that the course selection preferences are not expected to be independent from others choices, as students may follow trends of similar behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Additionally, the influence on the choices is not only made by peers, but also their supervisors because the supervisors tend to advise students to choose courses that are relevant to their research field so that they can lay the foundation for future research work more quickly <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. For example, different graduate students directed by the same supervisor often choose similar courses considering the research interests of the supervisor. Thus, three additional relations are introduced to construct the teaching evaluation network: gender: the gender relation is used between students and entity male/female; supervision: the supervision relation is used between students and their supervisors. grade: the grade relation is used between students and their corresponding grade.</p><p>Combining the two comment-based relations and the direct review relations mentioned above, we present an illustration of these six intrinsic relations and different entities in the teaching evaluation network as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. In short, different students can be reflected in the teaching evaluation network because of the differences and commonalities in relationships with supervisors, grades, genders, comment styles and profile of courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">Generating embedded representation of student entity in the SET network</head><p>To quantitatively measure the differences between each student, a graph-based presentation method is utilized to vectorize each student entity into numeric vectors.</p><p>Inspired by the word embedding model word2vec (specifically the skip-gram model) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, DeepWalk uses the cooccurrence between nodes in the graph to learn the vector representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. A RandomWalk algorithm is utilized by Deep-Walk to sample the nodes in the graph, thereby generating access sequences which work like a word sequence in sentences. Then, the skip-gram model can be applied to generate the vector representation of nodes in a similar way to its original application on words. However, when generating a node sequence, the choice of the next node from the currently resident node is determined by a uniform random sampling on all possible edges. This operation neglects the local structural properties and similarity between the adjacent nodes in a graph while these two attributes can be derived by a classical breadth-first search and depth-first search. Based on this, node2vec develops a flexible biased random walk procedure that can explore neighborhoods in a breadth-first search as well as a depth-first search fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>.</p><p>Let G ¼ ðV; EÞ be the teaching evaluation network, where V denotes the set of all named objects (i.e. entities) including grade, supervisor, gender, student, keyword, and course. E denotes the set of all relations between the aforementioned entities. Given a node u, let c i denote the i th node in the walk with c 0 ¼ u. Nodes c i are generated by the distribution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Pðc i ¼ xjc iÀ1 ¼ vÞ ¼ 1 Z x v;x ðv; xÞ 2 E 0 Otherwise (<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>Note that x v;x is the unnormalized transition probability between nodes v and x, and Z is the normalizing constant. A 2 nd order random walk method with two hyperparameters p and q is selected to guide the walk: Assume a random walk resides at node v which traversed through edge ðt; vÞ from node t, the next edge the walk will traverse is decided on the transition probabilities</p><p>x v;x on edges ðv; xÞ leading from v, which is defined by: x v;x ¼ a p;q ðt; xÞ ¼</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">1 p d tx ¼ 0; ðv; xÞ 2 E 1 d tx ¼ 1; ðv; xÞ 2 E 1 q d tx ¼ 2; ðv; xÞ 2 E 0 Otherwise 8 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>where d tx denotes the shortest path distance between nodes t and x.</p><p>The hyperparameter p controls the probability of repeatedly accessing the node that has just been accessed, while q controls whether the walk is outward or inward. If q &gt; 1, the random walk tends to access nodes close to t (biased to breadth-first search), and if q &lt; 1, the walk tends to access nodes away from t (biased to depth-first search). For the sake of simplicity, we use the symbol Ns to represent the aforementioned strategy for walking. Let d denote the dimension of each entity in the teaching evaluation network and let f ðxÞ denote the mapping from node (i.e. entity) to the corresponding feature representation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Feature construction with SET Tensor</head><p>After assessing the students' personalization in teaching evaluation, we transfer the original heterogeneous quadruple into a quantitative one:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">re 0 i;j :¼&lt; s i ; c j ; tðs i ; c j Þ; rs i;j &gt;<label>ð8Þ</label></formula><p>Combining the above re 0 in three dimensions: student, course, and personalized type, we get a three-dimensional tensor, namely the SET tensor. Compared with the ''user-item" rating matrix for probabilistic matrix factorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> and other matrix factorization methods, the SET tensor introduces review preferences and structural differences as a third dimension to extend the feature space, thereby reforming the original hypothesis that user vectors and item vectors are independent and identically distributed <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. In other words, the introduction of the SET tensor solves a problem not previously considered by the MF-based methods, which is a contribution that can be made by correctly modeling the user's profile and reviewing text. By using the first three elements of quadruple re 0 i;j as a dimension and the last dimension as a value, We construct the SET tensor to prepare the data for evaluation prediction and further recommendation. Hence, the traditional rating matrix can be arranged in a three-dimensional tensor whose three dimensions correspond to student, course, and user personalization type with sizes m; n, and K, respectively (R mÂnÂK ), which can be expressed as: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R k</head><formula xml:id="formula_5">i;j %&lt; S i ; C j ; T k &gt;¼ X D d¼1 S di C dj T dk<label>ð9Þ</label></formula><p>where S i ; C j and T k are D-dimensional vectors decomposed from the SET tensor and rsi; j k is the rating rs s i ;c j from the student s i to course c j under a degree of personalization tðs i ; c j Þ. In addition, Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">9</ref>) can be interpreted as that a rating depends not only on the student and course, but also the classroom performance, semantic meaning in the review text, as well as the personal relations with colleagues, supervisor, etc. Additionally, in a probabilistic model, the issue of randomness should be considered. The conditional distribution R k i;j</p><p>given by U; V; T is a Gaussian distribution with mean &lt; S i ; C j ; T k &gt; and variance a À1 , i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">R k i;j jS; C; T $ Nð&lt; S i ; C j ; T k &gt;; a À1 Þ ð<label>10Þ</label></formula><p>For example, under the extreme condition that all users' personalization are very similar, T k in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">10</ref>) are all-one vectors and the model is equivalent to the common PMF model. However, this condition may cause overfitting due to the sparseness of the rating tensor (missing entries in R). Therefore, to avoid the overfitting problem caused by rating tensor R, we apply a Bayesian treatment to the PMF model based on our introduced similarity of personalization. This is derived by imposing a zero mean and independent Gaussian priors on the entities' feature vectors, which is proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">S i $ Nð0; r 2 S IÞ i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; m<label>ð11Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">C j $ Nð0; r 2 C IÞ j ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n<label>ð12Þ</label></formula><p>where Iis D-by-D identity matrix. By adding structural and semantic similarity (i.e. similarity of personalization) between the students' reviews as an additional factor, we hypothesize that different structural and semantic similarity has a different influence on teaching evaluation scores. On this basis, we assume each similarity of a particular student review on a course is conditioned on that the similarity of the remaining reviews on the same course excluding this one. In other words, the applied conditional prior is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">T k $ NðT 0 k ; r 2 dT IÞ i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; K<label>ð13Þ</label></formula><p>where T 0 k is the personal similarity of the reviews excluding the k th review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">BPTF-based rating prediction and recommendation</head><p>Based on the above constraints, the stochastic gradient descent method (SGD) is applied to learn the model parameters automatically with regularization and is combined with the sparse observations to estimate the unknown ratings by maximizing the logarithm of posterior distribution. This is equal to minimizing the following loss function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">LðS; C; TÞ ¼ X m i X n j X K k I k i;j ðR k i;j À hS i ; C j ; T k iÞ 2 þ X m i¼1 k S S 2 i 2 þ X n j¼1 k C C 2 i 2 þ X K k¼1 k dT T k ÀT 0 2 k 2<label>ð14Þ</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">k S ¼ ðar 2 S Þ À1 ; k C ¼ ðar 2 C Þ À1 and k dT ¼ ðar 2 dT Þ À1 .</formula><p>Finding only one point to estimate the parameters of the learning model instead of inferring the full posterior distribution largely contributes to the efficiency of training a tensor-based PMF model <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. However, the maximum a posteriori scheme which was utilized to compute such point estimates often suffers from overfitting if hyper parameters are not set properly. The problem becomes more probable when the dataset is relatively large but sparse. Given a dataset D and parameters h, the MAP finds the parameter estimates hÃ which maximizes PðDjhÞ, and finally the model predicts unseen samples based on such learnt hÃ. Such estimation is sensitive to random variations of data which may lead to overfitting <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Therefore, in this paper, a complete Bayesian treatment is applied to our model to avoid overfitting. The treatment establishes priors on parameters, and thus proper averages over different models and eventually guarantees the fine tuning of parameters. In particular, Markov Chain Monte Carlo is used as sampling-based approximation method <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. To summarize, the process of the proposed unified feature representation requires node2vec which occupied the most computational time complexity. Thus the time complexity of the this part is OðMNKÞ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experimental results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Dataset</head><p>We perform our experimental evaluation on a real-world data set from the Graduate School, Beijing Institute of Technology which is collected from a graduate teaching evaluation system named BIT-UASET <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The online system requires graduate students to review and evaluate each course they have taken each semester. The reviews of the participating students are anonymously shown to the teachers as well as the Department of Teaching Quality Control. In order to avoid irresponsible and random scoring, the system adopts a bidirectional static game-based scoring rule where students can only check their final grades after completing the teaching evaluation, and the teacher can only view the students' evaluation after submitting the students' final scores. The whole dataset consists of student IDs, course IDs, course names, scored ratings, final grades, and text reviews. It should be noted that these scores are between 0-100, which is different from the common five-level scale scheme. To collect information to construct the profile network illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, we obtain the student's grade, supervisor and gender from the School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology to complete whole teaching evaluation network we designed. Eventually, by selecting the rating records without missing data in the School of Computer Science and Technology during the academic year of 2017-2018 and 2018-2019, a total of 7,453 rating records from 532 students in relation to 201 courses are extracted as the raw dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Experiment setup and preprocessing of data 4.2.1. Preprocessing teaching evaluation data</head><p>We further filter the rating records in the dataset for the purpose of reducing the sparsity of the rating tensor. In the experiment, we only keep students who reviewed at least 5 courses throughout the academic year and the courses which had at least 10 ratings. Under these constraints, there are 7,453 records from 706 students in relation to 76 courses which are utilized in the experiment. A train-test approach is utilized in the following experiment. Therefore, we randomly sample 20% students (i.e. 141 students) from the dataset as the test set. For the 141 students in the test set, we used the last five courses evaluated by each person as the evaluation labels for rating prediction and course recommendations. Thus, there are 565 students with 5,842 ratings in the training set and 141 students with 1,611 ratings (in which 705 ratings are used for measuring the recommendation performance) in the test set (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>In terms of lexical features, the students' textual reviews with stop words removed are segmented by the Jieba word segmentation tool <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">1</ref> . Then, we extracted all theme and sentiment-related content words according to our previously proposed method <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Finally, a total of 5,001 words including 2909 theme-related words and 2,092 sentiment-related words are extracted to construct the teaching evaluation network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Implementation of the proposed method</head><p>For the sake of simplicity, we name the proposed model as TENFT (Teaching Evaluation Network-Tensor Factorization) and use this abbreviation in the rest of this paper. The entire experiment is performed on a computer with an Intel i7-7700 K CPU, 16 GB of memory and a Nvidia GTX1080Ti GPU. As discussed in the previous section, we use node2vec to embed the teaching evaluation network. In this experiment, OpenNE<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">2</ref> is utilized to establish the embedding process. During the training process, the hyperparameters of node2vec are set as follows: The number of random walks started at the same node is 10, the length of random walk started at each node is 50, the window size of skip-gram model is 5 and the p and q are all equal to 1.0. As a result, we get the embedding of the entities in the teaching evaluation network with a dimension size of 200. Furthermore, we implement SET tensor factorization by modifying Candecomp-Parafac factorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> function so that it is compatible with the missing values contained in the rating tensor based on Tensorly framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. The learning rate is set to 0.001. Additionally, we tested different number of latent features to evaluate model behavior, and determine this parameter according to the optimal performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Evaluation metric and baselines</head><p>To valid the feasibility and performance of the proposed model, we compare our model with the following methods: SVD++ <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>: SVD++ is a classic rating prediction model which introduces an implicit feedback mechanism on the basis of Singular Value Decomposition. It uses the user's historical browsing data, user historical rating data, item's historical browsing data, and item's historical rating data as new implicit parameters to be passed during matrix factorization. In this experiment, we trained the SVD++ model with 30 epochs with learning rate c ¼ 0:004 and regularization parameter k ¼ 0:13. RTTF <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>: RTTF model considers the linguistic similarity between review texts as an additional factor in rating prediction. It establishes the rating prediction based on tensor factorization which involves review text semantic similarity. Their proposed tensor factorization model supplements the central task of factorization methods of finding similar users, uncovering underlying characteristics of the data and predicting user preferences by introducing text semantic similarity. In this experiment, we set the model with the recommended hyperparameter that Wishart W0 ¼ 2, learning rate c ¼ 0:001 and regularization parameter k ¼ 0:015.</p><p>xSVD++ <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>: The xSVD++ focuses on user's preferences which are not expected to be independent from others choices on the online educational platform. The proposed xSVD++ is a multi-dimensional Matrix Factorization model combined with collaborative filtering algorithm, which exploits information from external courses' characteristics to predict course trends and to perform rating predictions. In this experiment, we set the model with the recommended hyper-parameter that c ¼ 0:001 and regularization parameter k ¼ 0:1. DSE <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>: DSE is a hybrid approach to learn and represent users' preference knowledge from review texts and utilize the acquired representation to support rating prediction. The DSE utilizes Long Short-Term Memory architecture to learn users' preference knowledge along with item aspects and the PV-DM model to convert the acquired knowledge to embedded representation, and establish the rating prediction by aggregating such knowledge through PMF model. In this experiment, we set the model with the original recommended hyperparameter that learning rate = 0.1 (halved after every third epoch), batch size = 128, source and target sequence length equal to 300 and 30, respectively.</p><p>Additionally, to valid the effectiveness of the proposed SET Tensor, we further compare the performance between the proposed TENTF model and its variants which eliminated certain type of feature: TENTF-Profile: This model deletes the Profile Network described in Section 3.1, leaving only the Commentary Network for the further network embedding. TENTF-Commentary: Contrary to the previous item, the TENTF-Commentary deletes the Commentary Network, while leaving only the Profile Network for the further network embedding. TENTF-Mastery: This model removes the numeric feature of the final grades student get from the course.</p><p>Considering that the intent of this paper is to use previous evaluation results to predict the students' reviewing rate on a course they have not yet taken (i.e. a rating prediction task), the commonly used root mean squared error (RMSE, Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">15</ref>)) and mean absolute error (MAE, Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">16</ref>)) are computed to measure the error between the predicted rating and the real one for the different models.</p></div>

In this paper, we use the top-N recommendation scenario to measure the performance of the different models. In particular, we select the ten largest ratings of each student in the test set as the labels, then we measure the Precision@N (Eq. ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>)), Recall@N (Eq. ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>)) and and F1@N (Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">19</ref>)) between the top N predicted courses which have the largest predicted ratings (N = 1,2,3,4,5). </p><formula xml:id="formula_14">F1 ¼ 2 Â Precision Â Recall Precision þ Recall<label>ð19Þ</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Results</head><p>As previously discussed, we split the BIT-UASET data into a training set and a test set. The ratings in the test set are marked as a missing value in the SET tensor. We compare the RMSE and MAE between the predicted rating and the real rating for the different models, and the performance of the rating prediction for educational course recommendation is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and the influence of a different selection of latent factors is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. It can be observed that our proposed model achieves the smallest prediction error(MAE: 6.9133, RMSE: 9.9017) compared with other PMF inspired approaches (RTTF and DSE) and SVD based methods (xSVD++ and SVD++). Additionally, by eliminating different feature parts, the performance of our proposed model has declined to varying degrees, which shows that our proposed features provide positive contributions to the realization of the final prediction. It can be observed that the personal profile network and commentary network both play a significant role in the rating prediction of the model with a performance loss at 16.10% and 25.09%, respectively. However, the performance loss caused the student's course grades is relatively minor (3.23%).</p><p>As described in the experimental setup, we further explored the impact of different number of latent factors on the predicitng errors. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, the model compared in the experiment obtains the smallest prediction error when D is between 5 and 7. In particular, the proposed model derives the smallest prediction error when the number of the latent factors D equals to 6.</p><p>Furthermore, by converting the course corresponding to the largest top-N prediction ratings into a recommendation list, we measure the degree of accuracy with the list of courses produced by the actual ratings. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, our proposed model has outperformed other baselines as well as its own variants, which derived the optimal performance in Precision@N, Recall@N and F1@N. In particular, the proposed model can keep the precision rate almost above 70% when N changes from 1 to 5 (Precision@5 = 0.6978), which is superior to other baseline models. On the other side, the recall indicator has shown that the proposed model derived the optimal performance (Recall@5 = 0.3489) compared with baseline models. In terms of the variants of the proposed model, the results  are similar to the rating prediction task, indicating our proposed features all have contribution to the recommendation model. The result also indicates that the removal of students' profiling or commentary information leads major performance loss to the current model while eliminating the students' mastery of knowledge has a minor contribution to the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>Based on the above experimental results, the following points are worth noting and discussion.</p><p>First, it should be noted that the objective function is not unique. According to previous studies, a stochastic gradient ascent method can be utilized to replace the SGD which is used in our experiments with the following objective function:</p><p>Objective ¼ log pðS; C;TjRÞ / log pðRjS; C;TÞ þ log pðS; C;TÞ</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">¼ X m i¼1 X n j¼1 X K k¼1 I k i;j log pðR k i;j jS i ;C j ;T k Þ þ X m i¼1 log pðS i Þ þ X n j¼1 log pðC j Þ þ X K k¼1 log pðT k jT 0 k Þ ¼ À X m i¼1 X n j¼1 X K k¼1 I k i;j ðR k i;j ÀhS i ;C j ;T k iÞ 2 2a À1 þ tnR loga 2 À X m i¼1 kS i k 2 2r 2 S À m log r S À X n j¼1 kC i k 2 2r 2 C À n logr C À X K k¼1 kT k ÀT 0 k k 2 2r 2 dT À K log r dT þ /<label>ð20Þ</label></formula><p>where I k i;j ¼ 1 if R k i;j is available and zero otherwise, tnR is the total number of ratings and / is a constant. By fixing a; r S ; r C and r dT and maximizing the log-posterior with respect to S; C; T, this objective function is equivalent to using SGD in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">14</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Second, the impact of using different vector lengths to encode/ embed the evaluation network on the recommendation results should also be further considered. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>, we test the rating prediction results with embedding vectors of five different lengths, which are 25, 50, 75, 100 and 125. The result suggests the variation of the prediction error is generally stable, and the optimal performance can be derived when the length is set to 50.</p><p>Third, our experiment results show that the proposed method has made progress in recommending new courses based on the teaching evaluation data compared to the other four models. However, we also observed some specific results of these baseline models. For example, the performance of DSE is overall worse than RTTF which is contrary to the previous report <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. We speculate that the reason for this phenomenon is that the evaluation data characteristics used in this experiment are different from the original application scenarios. By comparing the two data sets, we find that the number of Chinese evaluation texts used in this paper is significantly smaller than the English Amazon product comment used in the original experiment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6(a)</ref>). Therefore, the method of using the teaching evaluation network for such a situation can  obviously obtain more information than using only the comment text. Similarly, since Chinese course names are significantly shorter than English course names (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6-b</ref>), the use of only the words in the course name to enhance the implicit habits of SVD++ is somewhat reduced. In summary, the use of common structural features in different cultural backgrounds and language habits in the field of education may be a way to achieve the better generalization of a model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we propose a course recommendation model based on heterogeneous teaching evaluation data. We first construct a teaching evaluation network to embed the students' degree of personalization into vectors, and then we cluster the students according to these vectors. By using a BPTF based rating prediction model for course recommendation, our proposed method shows that it is practical compared with the other models on a real-world teaching evaluation dataset. Future work will include the following directions: First, this study focuses on profiling students but profiling work on courses and instructors should be further studied; Second, more behavior and attributes can be added to achieve a more accurate description of the selves of students, thereby providing a more available basis for recommending models. Third, considering the most unlabeled or semi-labeled features and strong sequential patterns in the discussed application scenario, the use of semi-supervised and reinforced learning systems may provide a more accurate application <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. Finally, as the current method relies on offline training and recommendation, a simplified computation method is also needed in future investigation, or an optimization is required to reduce the time span during training and predicting <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
