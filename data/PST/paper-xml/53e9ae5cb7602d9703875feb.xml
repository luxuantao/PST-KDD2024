In the multiple attribute decision making (MADM), the decision makers supply their preferences on alternatives in different preference representation structures. Among these structures, the preference relation is the most common one. According to element forms in preference relations, there are often two kinds of preference relations: linguistic preference relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> and numerical preference relations (i.e., multiplicative preference relations and fuzzy preference relations) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</p><p>Recently, many researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> pay attention to group decision making (GDM) using linguistic preference relations, following a common resolution scheme composed by two phases: the aggregation phase and the exploitation phase.

It is performed to ensure that the decision maker is being neither random nor illogical in his or her pairwise comparisons. The lack of consistency in decision making with preference relations can lead to inconsistent conclusions.

Similar to the numerical preference relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, some traditional definitions to characterize consistency of linguistic preference relations are to use transitivity such as the three-way transitivity, the max-min transitivity and the additive transitivity. However, these consistency definitions using transitivity are unable to measure the consistency degree of an inconsistency linguistic preference relation, and are also unable to identify whether the consistency degree is acceptable. The main aim of this paper is to present a consistency index of linguistic preference relations, and develop a more flexible consistency measure method. Using this consistency measure, we also plan to discuss how to deal with inconsistency in linguistic preference relations, and investigate the consistency properties of collective linguistic preference relations.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces some basic notations and operational laws of linguistic variables. Section 3 develops a consistency measure of linguistic preference relations. In Section 4, on the basis of this consistency measure, we discuss how to deal with inconsistency in linguistic preference relations. Section 5 shows the consistency properties of collective linguistic preference relations. In Section 6, two illustrative examples are provided. Concluding remarks are made in Section 7. Finally, all the proofs are presented in Appendix A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Preliminary knowledge: Linguistic variables</head><p>Xu introduced some basic notations and operational laws of linguistic variables in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Let S ¼ fs a ja ¼ Àt; . . . ; À1; 0; 1; . . . ; tg be a linguistic label set with odd cardinality. The label s a represents a possible value for a linguistic variable, and it is required that the linguistic label set should satisfy the following characteristics:</p><p>(1) The set is ordered: s a &gt; s b if and only if a &gt; b.</p><p>(2) There is a negation operator: neg(s a ) = s Àa .</p><p>We call this linguistic label set S as the linguistic scale. For example, S can be defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S ¼ s À4 ¼ extremely poor; s À3 ¼ very poor; s À2 ¼ poor s À1 ¼ slightly poor; s 0 ¼ fair; s 1 ¼ slightly good s 2 ¼ good; s 3 ¼ very good; s 4 ¼ extremely good 8 &gt; &lt; &gt; : 9 &gt; = &gt; ; :</formula><p>To preserve all the given information, we extend the discrete linguistic label set S to a continuous linguistic label set S ¼ fs a ja 2 ½Àq; qg, where q (q P t) is a sufficiently large positive integer. If s a 2 S, then we call s a the original linguistic label; otherwise, we call it the virtual linguistic label. In general, the decision maker uses the original linguistic labels to evaluate alternatives, and the virtual linguistic labels can only appear in operations.</p><p>Consider any two linguistic terms s a ; s b 2 S, and l; l 1 ; l 2 2 ½0; 1 , Xu introduced some operational laws as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(1) s a È s b = s a+b ; (2) s a È s b = s b È s a ; (3) ls a = s la ; (4) (l 1 + l 2 )s a = l 1 s a È l 2 s a ; (5) l(s a È s b ) = ls a È ls b .</formula><p>Let s 2 S, we denote I(s) as the lower index of s, and call it the gradation of s in S. For example, if s = s a , then I(s) = a.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Consistency measures of linguistic preference relations</head><p>There is a finite set of alternatives, X ¼ fx 1 ; x 2 ; . . . ; x n gðn P 2Þ, as well as a linguistic pre-establish label set, S ¼ fs a ja ¼ Àt; . . . ; À1; 0; 1; . . . ; tg. The decision maker provides his/her opinions on X as a linguistic preference relation, A ¼ ða ij Þ nÂn X Â X , with a membership function u A : X • X ! S, where u A ðx i ; x j Þ ¼ a ij denotes the linguistic preference degree of the alternative x i over x j . We assume, without loss of generality, that A is reciprocal in the sense that a ij È a ji ¼ s 0 (s 0 is the median label in S). Similar to GDM using numerical preference relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the consistency problem of linguistic preference relations also has two problems: (i) When can a decision maker, considered individually, be said to be consistent and, (ii) When can a whole group of decision makers be considered consistent.</p><p>In this paper we focus on the first problem. Furthermore, we tackle the first problem from the following two aspects:</p><p>(1) When can a linguistic preference relation be said to be perfectly consistent.</p><p>(2) For an inconsistent linguistic preference relation, how to measure the degree of consistency, and when can its consistency degree be considered acceptable.</p><p>In the following subsections, we firstly introduce the concepts of transitive linguistic preference relations and the consistent linguistic preference relations. Then we present the consistency index of linguistic preference relations for measuring consistency degree of linguistic preference relations. Finally we establish the thresholds of the consistency index to identify whether the linguistic preference relations provided by decision makers are of acceptable consistency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">The consistency index of linguistic preference relations</head><p>Definition 1. A ¼ ða ij Þ nÂn is called a transitive linguistic preference relation if there exists a ik &gt; s 0 and a kj &gt; s 0 , then a ij &gt; s 0 for i; j; k ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n. Consider a linguistic label set S. We say S is the arithmetic progression linguistic label set in the sense that if the alternative x i is ''s a '' over the alternative x j , and x j is ''s b '' over the alternative x k , then x i is ''s a+b '' over x k for any s a , s b 2 S. In other words, if the preference intensities of all gradations in S form an arithmetic progression, we call S the arithmetic progression linguistic label set. In this paper, we assume that S is an arithmetic progression linguistic label set. Under this assumption, we define the consistency of linguistic preference relations as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Definition 2. A = (a ij ) n•n is called a consistent linguistic preference relation if there exists a ik È a kj = a ij for i, j, k = 1, 2, . . . , n.</formula><p>We also call this consistency definition as the additive transitivity of linguistic preference relations. We can easily obtain Theorem 1.</p><p>Theorem 1. A = (a ij ) n•n is a transitive linguistic preference relation under the condition that A is a consistent linguistic preference relation.</p><p>The Proof of Theorem 1 is provided in Appendix A. Theorem 1 shows that consistency is a stronger condition than transitivity. However, it is hard to obtain perfect consistency using the linguistic preference relations, especially when the number of alternatives is large. In the rest of the subsection, we will present a consistency index of linguistic preference relations, by defining the distance (i.e., the deviation degree) of a linguistic preference relation to the set of consistent linguistic preference relations. This consistency index can be used to measure consistency degree of linguistic preference relations.</p><p>Let s a , s b 2 S be two linguistic variables, Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> defines the distance between s a and s b as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">dðs a ; s b Þ ¼ ja À bj T ;<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where T is the number of linguistic terms in the set S.</p><p>Definition 3. Let A ¼ ða ij Þ nÂn and B ¼ ðb ij Þ nÂn be two linguistic preference relations, then we define the distance between A and B as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">dðA; BÞ ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2 nðn À 1Þ X n j¼iþ1 X n i¼1 ðdða ij ; b ij ÞÞ 2 v u u t :<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, Xu defined a different distance metric (i.e., deviation degree) between two linguistic preference relations, and obtained a very important property on GDM using linguistic preference relations (see Corollary 1 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>). When using our distance metric, we can obtain the same property (see <ref type="bibr">Theorem 6)</ref>. Moreover, this distance metric will bring us the additional advantages in establishing the consistency thresholds (see Theorem 3). This is the reason that we adopt the new distance metric in this paper. Definition 4. Let A = (a ij ) n•n be a linguistic preference relation and M p n be the set of n • n consistent linguistic preference relations, then we define the distance between A and M p n as follows:</p><p>dðA; M p n Þ ¼ min</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P 2Mp n dðA; P Þ:<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>We set dðA; M p n Þ as the consistency index (CI) of the linguistic preference relation A, namely</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">CIðAÞ ¼ dðA; M p n Þ:<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>The above consistency index has a definite physical implication and reflects the deviation degree between the linguistic preference relation A and the consistent linguistic preference relations.

In order to avoid the limitation, we may also allow the decision maker to adjust the linguistic preference relation more freely.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>The consistency measure is a basic problem in GDM using preference relations. This paper mainly contribute to developing a more flexible consistency measure method for individual linguistic preference relations. This consistency measure method is based on the additive transitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> of preference relations, and the deviation measure of linguistic preference relations presented in Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. By defining the deviation measure of a linguistic preference relation to the set of consistent linguistic preference relations, and setting it as the consistency index of linguistic preference relations, we propose the consistency measure method. Compared with the traditional consistency definitions using transitivity, this consistency measure is more flexible. It can further measure the consistency degree of an inconsistency linguistic preference relation and test whether the inconsistency linguistic preference relation is of acceptable consistency. On the basis of this consistency measure method, we propose two techniques to deal with the inconsistency in linguistic preference relations, and also discuss the consistency properties of collective linguistic preference relations. The results in this paper are very important for the application of linguistic preference relations in GDM.</p><p>In our future research, we plan to discuss how to solve the optimization model introduced in Section 4.1.
