George Zubal Absh-act-We propose a Bayesian method whereby maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of functional (PET and SPECT) images may be reconstructed with the aid of prior information derived from registered anatomical MR images of the same slice. Our prior information consists of significant anatomical boundaries that are likely to correspond to discontinuities in an otherwise spatially smooth radionuclide distribution. Our algorithm, like others proposed recently, seeks smooth solutions with occasional discontinuities; the contribution here is the inclusion of a coupling term that influences the creation of discontinuities in the vicinity of the significant anatomical boundaries. Simulations on anatomically derived mathematical phantoms are presented. Although computationally intense in its current implication, the reconstructions are improved (ROI-RMS error) relative to filtered backprojection and EM-ML reconstructions. The simulations show that the inclusion of position-dependent anatomical prior information leads to further improvement relative to Bayesian reconstructions without the anatomical prior. The algorithm exhibits a certain degree of robustness with respect to errors in the location of anatomical boundaries.</p></div>

INTRODUCTION N BOTH positron emission tomography (PET) and single</head><p>I photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging, there is a significant information loss in going from object to projection data through the projection imaging process. In an attempt to improve reconstructions, probabilistic frameworks incorporating object priors have been proposed by several workers [1]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In most of these previous works, the model for the object priors was motivated by assumptions of object smoothness with occasional discontinuities. These smoothness assumptions are generic in that they apply to the general class of objects under consideration. One might well suppose that prior information concerning the smoothness and discontinuities of the speciJic object being imaged should provide some additional advantage relative to generic information.</p><p>An opportunity to obtain such prior information is provided by recent results in the registration of anatomical (computerized tomography-CT or magnetic resonance imaging-MRI) images with functional (SPECT or PET) images from the same patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>. More recently, these registration techniques have been applied to brain SPECT perfusion images for registration with MRI anatomy [ll],</p><p>[12]. To the extent that boundaries of some anatomical objects correspond to edges in the spatial distribution of radiopharmaceuticals, we indeed get just the sort of nongeneric smoothness information mentioned above. Previous work incorporating anatomical priors has been reported in [ 131- <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we first comment in Section I1 on the use of anatomical images as priors, then offer a Bayesian reconstruction model in Section 111. Results on simulated SPECT reconstructions utilizing a mathematical phantom derived from an MRI brain image are presented in Section IV. Our conclusions are presented in Section V.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">THE ANATOMICAL IMAGE A S PRIOR</head><p>The utility of anatomical priors depends on the degree of spatial correlation of anatomical structure with radionuclide distribution. In the cases where the correlation is good, we may expect the anatomy to serve as a useful prior. Below, we give one example of good correlation obtained from a study' (unrelated to the present work) involving neuroreceptor seeking radiopharmaceuticals. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows an autoradiograph, obtained from thin physical slices of a monkey brain, after injection of a neuroreceptor-seeking pharmaceutical. The autoradiograph, with a spatial resolution of less than 1 mm, shows the receptor density distribution immediately after sacrificing the animal. The correlation to anatomy is striking. The boundary between white and gray matter is distinct, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN-round structure in the center) is clearly demonstrated as is the striatum (structure above the LGN). Furthermore, the distribution within certain regions, such as white and gray matter, is reasonably uniform. Since these and other regions can be delineated on anatomical images, there is some hope that selected boundaries obtained from CT or MRI can indeed serve as priors in a reconstruction.</p><p>In the present work, we model the prior information obtained from the anatomical image by an "edge map" e ( i , j ) , 0 5 e ( i , j ) 5 1, whose value reflects our confidence that a correlated functional edge exists at location ( z , j ) . A value of unity corresponds to the highest confidence. Specifically, we have two edge maps, eh (2, j ) for horizontal edges and e" (2, j ) for vertical edges, though for brevity we shall use e(z, j ) except where necessary. A diagonal line can be approximated as a  2) An anatomical edge may not be localized within the pixel resolution of the functional image reconstruction. This may be due to slice thickness effects in the anatomical image acquisition; i.e. an otherwise distinct three-dimensional boundary is reconstructed as a blurred two-dimensional boundary since averaging occurs in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the slice. In addition, there may not exist a highly localized boundary in the first place. For instance, at the level of resolution in a histological image, the anatomical boundaries are rarely distinct. For some region boundaries, this transition from one tissue type to another may occur over several resolution distances (in the anatomical image). 3) There may be small-scale misalignments due to intermodality registration error. By small-scale, we mean a greater than single pixel distance but no more than a few pixel distances in the functional image. In this work, we model the effects of 1) by including extra and missing edges in our simulations. The effects of 2) are crudely modeled by blurring the anatomical edges so that they occur along a thin band rather than a thin line. A proper model for 3) might include random misalignments, by a few pixels, of sections of anatomical boundary. A detailed study would include an assessment of the effects on the reconstructions of shifting an anatomical edge in a controlled manner away from lump the effects of 2) and 3) into our blur model. staircase of vertical and horizontal edge segments. The values of the edge map cannot be derived simply by running an edge operator over the anatomical image; instead, the value of e ( i , j ) may depend on the particular anatomical boundary under consideration. We need both a strong anatomical edge and a reasonable expectation that the edge is likely to correspond to a functional edge in order to set e ( i , j ) to a high value. On the other hand, we demand that the edge map not overrule the data-an edge in the functional image should be reconstructed even if it is not promoted by the edge map, and a strong vote by the edge map should not create a false edge in the functional image. We address this question further in the next section.</p><p>Our edge map is derived by hand tracing only those anatomical boundaries that are likely to correlate with functional boundaries and assigning values to those boundaries. A "-e the use of a segmentation procedure on the anatomical image that is able to correctly label all anatomical regions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Formulation With Line Processes</head><p>We first formulate our problem with the aid of line processes as proposed by Geman and Geman [16], though we shall eventually dispense with the line processes. The unobservable line processes correspond to discontinuities in the 2-D source f . A value P ( i , j ) = 1 corresponds to the presence of a vertical line process located between pixel locations (i, j ) and ( i , j + 1). A similar argument obtains for the horizontal line process l h ( i , j ) = 1. For brevity, we shall use the quantity 1 with no superscripts except when necessary.</p><p>We may now write Bayes theorem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P r ( F =f, L = 1IG = g) Pr(G = glF = f , L = 1) P r ( F = f , L = 1) Pr(G = g) '<label>( 2 )</label></formula><p>Given the posterior distribution in (2), one possible estimator is the maximum a posteriori estimate (MAP).

The second term is the prior corresponding to our knowledge of constraints on f and 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. An Energy Function With Line Processes</head><p>In this section, we describe the process by which an energy function can be obtained from the three terms in (7)  constituting the posterior distribution. Note that by (l), maximizing a probability expression is the same as minimizing the corresponding energy function, hence, MAP estimation reduces to energy minimization. In this section, we derive an energy function for MAP estimation. The role of line processes is made explicit in this formulation of the energy function. In Section 111-C, we modify the energy function in several ways to derive the final energy function used in this paper.</p><p>We model the first term, the likelihood, in a conventional way. Since the dominant noise source in our model for functional imaging is photon noise, we use the well-known fact that for pure photon noise, the detector noise is Poisson and the detector bin counts are independent of one another. With our approximation of pure photon noise, the likelihood becomes where (9) 8 ) is the number of counts in bin t at projection angle 8 and g ( t , 8) as defined in ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) is the expected number of counts for a particular source f and a forward projection matrix 'H(t, 8; z,j). Note that 'H(t, 8; i, j ) can model the measurement physics (scatter, attenuation, geometrical factors, and detector response) for PET and SPECT. 'H(t, 8; i, j ) can be defined as the probability of detection of a photon in detector bin t at angle 8 emanating from the source at location (i, j ) ; however, the linear model of 'H cannot model the nonlinear effects of random coincidences and detector dead time in PET. For the simulations reported in this paper, 'H is restricted to modeling the Radon transform. The likelihood energy function is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">In (8), g ( t ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">+ terms independent of f . (10)</formula><p>The latter two terms in (7) constitute the prior. The first of these attempts to smooth the functional image everywhere except across discontinuities where l ( i , j ) = 1. The second of these imposes constraints on the discontinuities and in particular incorporates anatomical boundary information.</p><p>The smoothness prior is defined over the intensities and the line processes. We model this distribution as Gibbs. The associated energy function is</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Es(f,l) = -logPr(F = flL = 1) = (f:(i,d(l -W l j ) ) ) i,j + (fZ(i,j)(l -W d ) ) (11) i,j</formula><p>where we take for our definitions of partial derivatives 1) -f(Z,j). The two terms involving f v and fh encourage smoothness except where discontinuities occur.</p><p>The discontinuity prior on the line process is once again modeled as Gibbs. The energy EL(^) is formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">f v ( i , j ) = f ( i + Lj) -f ( i l j ) and fh(i,j) = f ( i , j + EL(^) = -logPr(L = 1) = 61 ( l " ( 2 , j ) + P ( i , j ) ) i,j -(61 -~2 ) = EL1 (1) + E L 2 ( 1 )</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>( Z v ( i , j ) e v ( i l j )</head><p>+ P ( i , j ) e h ( i , j ) )</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">i,j 0 5 6 2 5 K 1 (12)</formula><p>where, for convenience, we define EL^ (1) and EL,(^) as the first and second terms in (12), respectively. The term EL,(^)</p><p>penalizes the creation of discontinuities. The penalty for creating a discontinuity is proportional to the constant tel. In fact, the combination of the smoothness prior on the intensities and the first penalty term introduced above ( E s +EL,) is none other than the popular weak membrane prior which is widely used in the computer vision literature [17], [18] and [19]. It assumes that the image f is composed of smooth patches which are occasionally broken by discontinuities (line processes 1). As ~1 is increased, fewer discontinuities are obtained. The thrust of this paper is to utilize information from the anatomical image in the following way: we would like to influence the breaking of smoothness in the reconstruction by using anatomical information. Specifically, smoothness should be broken more easily in those regions of the image corresponding to locations in the registered anatomical image where significant anatomical boundaries (high values of e ( i , j ) ) occur. This effect can be seen by rewriting (12) in the following form: Equation (13) interpolates between two fixed constants nl and using e. The net effect is to use the anatomical information e to spatially modulate the creation of discontinuities in the reconstruction. For example, if e h ( i l j ) is close to unity, then the energy is reduced by turning on a line process l h ( i , j ) = 1 only if f:(i,j) &gt; 6 2 . Conversely, if e h ( i , j ) is close to zero, an edge is created only if f:(i,j) &gt; ~1 .</p><p>Since 61 &gt; I E Z , the threshold for creating an edge is reduced at locations where we have high confidence (large e ( i , j ) ) . A coupling term of this sort has been proposed by Poggio et al. [20] and Gamble et al. [21] in the context of data fusion for computer vision. In their work, an attempt was made to fuse edges from registered intensity, stereo, texture, color, and motion images.</p><p>In principle, the parameters ~1 and 6 2 should be estimated from a given object or the class of objects under consideration.</p><p>We have now defined the three components of the energy function, ED, Es and EL corresponding to the three terms in (7). The latter two can be combined into one term E p that represents an energy function associated with the prior distribution. We may thus write an overall energy function as and X is a parameter which weights the prior with respect to the likelihood energy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. The Final Energy Function With Implicit Line Processes</head><p>Though the energy function, (14), embodies the problem, its minimization requires much computation. The energy function requires a hybrid optimization technique since the source intensities f can essentially be treated as a continuous field and subject to gradient-based optimization whereas the binary line processes 1 are subject only to combinatorial optimization. Instead of proceeding with such a hybrid optimization, we show that the binary line processes can be eliminated from the energy function leading to a new, equivalent energy function which depends only on the source intensities f. This new energy function has the same global minima as the original one. But the new energy function itself needs modification due to two drawbacks which we will show below. In this section, we describe the process of modification from the original energy function (14) to the final energy function which we eventually utilize.</p><p>The first step is to eliminate the line processes in (14) from the prior. Since the line processes are independent of each other, the optimization with respect to the line processes can be performed separately at each location. We now show that this reduces to a simple solution for each line process. Examine, for example, the term in (1 5 ) corresponding to the horizontal line process Zh(ilj). When f,"(il j ) L nl(1 -e h ( z l j ) ) <ref type="figure">+ n z e h ( i ,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref> ) , the term is minimized when the line process Ih(i, j ) is equal to zero. Similarly, when f : ( i , j ) &gt; ~~l ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 -e h ( i , j ) ) + n z e h ( i l j</ref> ) , the term is minimized when the line process l h ( i l j ) is equal to unity. The solution for the line process f h ( i , j ) , (the MAP estimate), can thus be written as <ref type="figure">+ n z e h ( i ,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref> )</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">i h ( i , j ) = { o f,2(ilj) 5 nl(1 -e h ( z l j ) )</formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">1 f;(z,j) &gt; n l ( 1 -e h ( i , j ) ) + nzeh(ilj)</formula><p>(16) with a similar expression for the vertical line process Zu(zlj). This is a modified version of line process elimination found in [17]. When the MAP estimate for 1 is substituted back into the energy function ( <ref type="formula">14</ref> + w h ( i , j )</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">+meh ( i , j )<label>(18)</label></formula><p>with a corresponding expression for d * ( f h ( i , j ) ) . (For the sake of convenience, we shall henceforth write expressions for q5* and related functions in terms of fv(i,j) only-the dependence on f h ( i , j ) should then be obvious). Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a</ref> which corresponds to the image estimation or surface reconstruction problems in early vision [17]. Our situation in { image reconstruction (Poisson likelihood) is considerably more complex despite the fact that the log-likelihood is concave. We speculate that the combination of the Poisson likelihood with the broken parabola is indeed non-convex. However, a smoother choice of such a Gibbs prior may alleviate this problem. For example, in the aforementioned early vision case, Blake and Zisserman [ 171 show that a smoother version of the broken parabola does make the whole energy function convex. Indeed, a number of researchers [l], [2], [61, [7], [221 have implicitly incorporated smooth Gibbs priors of this kind into the medical reconstruction problem, but with generic rather than intermodality priors.</p><p>To this end, consider the following, which is a modified form of the Gibbs prior due to Geman and McClure [l]: local, high-intensity, single-pixel hot spot (due to the vagaries of a particular noise realization) which causes the magnitudes of Af at that location to become quite large. Ordinarily, the hot spot would be eliminated in subsequent iterations by the smoothing action of the prior. However, if the gradients at that spot (Af) happen to be large enough, so that the flat region of the $GM function applies, then smoothing is again suspended and the hot spot remains. Thus the small derivatives of $GM at both the origin and flat segments conspire to create hot spots.</p><p>One way to overcome this conspiracy is to eliminate the vanishing derivative of $GM at the origin. This does not permit the likelihood to create hot spots by the above mentioned mechanism. Consider the following modification of $GM to a cusp-like form (see Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(e)</ref> and<ref type="figure">(f</ref>)) where the derivative is non-vanishing at the origin: This Gibbs prior is displayed at different resolutions in Figs. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>This functional form (not including the coupling term) has</head><p>Reynolds in <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref> for reasons similar to the ones detailed above.</p><p>The transition from 4G'f to $GR can be seen by considering the following modification of the prior from  <ref type="figure">( P ( i ,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref> ) ) 2 in the unit interval [0,1]. With this form of the prior, the line process can be eliminated as shown in <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref> to obtain the functional form in (19). Thus the modification from 4* to $GM is not totally ad hoc and corresponds to a modification of the original prior from a binary to a continuous line process. Note that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and [13], the problem of non-convexity induced by the digital line process is circumvented by evaluating the expected value of the line process in the Gibbs distribution yielding values in the unit interval [0, 11.</p><p>The second drawback which was first pointed out in [24] in the context of image restoration is characteristic of the broken parabola and still persists in the $GM formulation. Qualitatively speaking, the drawback is manifested as local high-intensity "hot spots" in the reconstruction. The manifestation of hot spots can be understood by examining the structure of the $ G M ( A f ) function (see Figs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2(c) and (d)). Note that as</head><p>A f approaches zero, the derivative of $GM ( Af) approaches zero. In addition as Af approaches infinity, the derivative again approaches zero as seen in the flat region of the 4G1'4</p><p>function. In between, the derivative is positive. The degree of smoothing depends on the magnitude of the derivative of the qhGM(Af) function. In the two regions, close to the origin, and far from the origin, the derivative of 4GM(Af) is very small. In pixel neighborhoods, where the derivatives are very small, the prior is small, and the reconstruction is driven solely by the likelihood term. The likelihood term may then create a with the line process l h ( i , j ) still assuming continuous values in the unit interval [O, 11. The only change from the previous prior is the use of the absolute value of the spatial derivative instead of the squared form. The line process can be eliminated from this modified energy function in a manner similar to the earlier eliminations <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>. When this is done and the solution substituted back into the energy function, we retrieve <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(20)</ref>.</p><p>Thus the modification from 4Gh* to dGR is not totally ad hoc but corresponds to a modification of the prior from the squared gradient form to the absolute value form. This is the prior used in the final energy function.</p><p>After including the likelihood and our prior, we can now write the final energy function. <ref type="figure">,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref> ) ) + K 2 e h ( i 1 j ) ) + Ifu(i,j)l )</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">E(f) = [g(t. 0) -d t , 0) logMt. 0))l (21) t , o ) +AX( 2</formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">( K l ( 1 -e h W ) + ~2eh(i1~))lfv(i,j)l (.1(1 -e V ( i , j ) ) + W " ( i , j ) ) l f h ( i , j ) l +hC( 2 , J ( K i ( 1 -e V ( i l j ) ) + K z e v ( i , j ) ) + Ifh(i,j)l</formula><p>This is the energy function which is used in our simulations. The energy function highlights two aspects of our approach. The first is the use of an intermodality term that modulates the creation of discontinuities according to anatomical as well as functional information. The second is the use of a cusp-like potential which alleviates the problems of non-convexity and hot spots.</p><p>So far, we have not mentioned an actual algorithm that minimizes (21). The cusp-like potential used here is not differentiable and, hence, gradient-based minimization methods are ruled out. Instead we use a quenching algorithm which is identical to the zero temperature limit of simulated annealing. The details are presented in the next section. We note here that the concern in the paper is in the incremental improvement in reconstruction due to the intermodality prior and we are not concerned at present with issues of efficiency in the minimization algorithm. Nevertheless, in Section IV, we report some relative execution times of this quenching algorithm relative to an EM-ML update algorithm.</p><p>We note that it is common in image processing and computer vision problems to include line process clique potentials to enforce higher level constraints that encourage discontinuities to occur along smooth, unbroken contours. Furthermore, the clique potentials discourage the formation of discontinuities along parallel, closely-spaced contours ("thick" contours). In particular, a previous effort [ 131, in anatomical-functional correlation have made use of clique potentials. Our results, however, show that the anatomical edge information e serves the above purposes.</p><p>In our formulation, the formation of smooth, unbroken contours is encouraged by the anatomical information e through the lowering of the penalty for creating a discontinuity. High values of e occur on a band of smooth contours and discontinuities tend to follow the locus of e. However, the intrinsic properties of the weak membrane promote the formation of smooth, thin contours (see for example, in [17] on pages 87-88) rather than on a bund of contours. These intrinisic properties, "hysteresis" (formation of smooth contours) and "non-maximum suppression" (formation of thin contours), are discussed extensively in [17].</p><p>Note also that in the absence of cliques, the line processes are independent and can thus be eliminated resulting in an equivalent energy function that depends only on the source intensities. This simplifies the search since we do not have to minimize the energy function with respect to the line processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. SIMULATION RESULTS</head><p>The optimization was carried out via a quenching procedure. In our implementation, individual pixels are visited sequentially following a raster scan. One iteration corresponds to a single raster scan. At each pixel, the source intensity is altered and the change in energy is calculated. A move that reduces energy is always accepted, and a move that increases energy is always rejected. Pixels are altered according to the following scheme: a new value is sampled from a Gaussian probability density whose mean is equal to the current pixel intensity and whose standard deviation is fixed at 55. This analog value is added to the current pixel intensity and the result discretized to the nearest integer. The parameter space for F is thus discretized to 256 levels. Note that the allowed intensity range varies from 0 to 255, and when a sampled pixel value falls out of this range, we use a wraparound scheme wherein 255 is added to values less than 0 and subtracted from values greater than 255. The algorithm is run until the number of pixels whose values change in an iteration reaches a plateau of less than a suitably chosen threshold. By plateau we mean that the number of pixel changes per iteration is less than or equal to the threshold for 100 consecutive iterations.</p><p>Following [ 11, we form an initial estimate using the conventional expectation-maximization, maximum-likelihood (EM-ML) algorithm. In general, the EM-ML estimate is expected to get us close to the answer, thus saving an excessive number of iterations.</p><p>The first set of results is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>(a) shows a 64 x 64 brain phantom that was obtained from hand tracing selected anatomical edges of an actual MRI image of a human brain. The phantom has three regions that represent gray matter, white matter, and a generalized internal structure. The outer region (gray matter) was completely and homogeneously filled with an equivalent radioisotope density of concentration 100; the intermediate region (white matter) was similarly filled with values of 25; and the two inner regions with values of 50. These regions crudely approximate the expected radioisotope density of a brain perfusion agent. Projection data was mathematically generated by calculating the Radon transform using 64 equiangular projections around 360 degrees with 64 detector bins per projection. Independent Poisson noise was added to each detector bin. The total counts were 3322400.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>(b) shows the result obtained using filtered backprojection (FI3P) with a ramp filter with no lowpass cutoff. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>(c) shows the result obtained useing EM-ML after 90 iterations where the total RMS error was least.</p><p>The next result, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3(d</ref>), shows a weak membrane reconstruction. This is essentially an implementation of our reconstruction algorithm without benifit of the anatomical information and is obtained simply by setting e ( i , j ) = 0 everywhere in our energy function (21). A value of tcl = 13.0 and X = 0.69 was used. The energy function no longer depends on K Z once e ( i , j ) is set to zero. The initial estimate was obtained with 25 iterations of the EM-ML algorithm. The weak membrane reconstruction is obtained using our quenching algorithm after 369 iterations. The plateau threshold for the quenching algorithm was 14.</p><p>The next result, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>(e), demonstrates the improvement in the reconstruction due to the anatomical information. Here, we used our energy function (21) with tc1 = 15.0 and tc2 = 5.0, and X = 0.69. The anatomical information, illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>(g), displays the combined vertical and horizontal edge maps. The value of e ( i , j ) is set to unity along the depicted boundaries and is zero elsewhere. Again, the initial estimate was obtained with 25 iterations of the EM-ML algorithm and the same plateau was used for the quenching algorithm, resulting in a total of 400 iterations.</p><p>In order to be useful, the reconstruction algorithm should be robust with respect to uncertainties in the correlation between function and anatomy. The uncertainty can occur in several ways: 1) an anatomical edge is present but has no corresponding functional edge (extra edge), 2) a functional edge exists with no corresponding anatomical edge (missing edge), and 3) there is a misregistration error between the two types of edges. Note that extra edges can arise in two ways: either an anatomical edge is erroneously drawn, or the anatomical edge is correct, but there is simply no corresponding functional edge at that location. Also, a missing edge can occur in two ways; either a significant anatomical edge is missed, or a strong functional edge occurs at an unexpected location.</p><p>The initial foray into testing this sort of robustness is depicted in the modified edge map of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3(h)</ref>. Here there is an extra (diagonal) edge in the lower right corner, and an obvious band of missing edge information in the upper region. In addition, a general blurring of the edge map reflects our uncertainty in registration between the modalities. (For a real SPECT study, this blurring would translate into a misregistration error of about f 3 mm). A discussion of our model of this uncertainty is found in Section 11. In particular, e v ( i , j ) = 1 at the same locations as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>(g) and for each such non-zero pixel, the horizontally adjacent pixels e " ( i , j + l ) and e v ( z , j -l ) are set t o 0 5 Similarly, e h ( i , j ) = 1 at the same locations as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>(g) with vertically, adjacent pixels e h ( i + l , j ) and e h ( z -l , j ) set to0.5. The corresponding reconstruction using this incomplete information is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>(f) with the same initial estimate as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3(e)</ref>. The energy function parameters tc1, tcZ and X for this case are the same for the reconstructions displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>(e). The plateau threshold remained the same (14) and the total number of iterations was 409. We now discuss the subjective quality of our results; later we present a quantitative assessment. Our best result using anatomical information, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>(e), shows good image quality even in regions of low contrast. Detailed spatial structures appear well defined. The effect of a large band of missing edges as well as an extra diagonal line (lower right) is seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3(f)</ref>. Overall, the image quality in the region corresponding to the band of missing edges degrades slightly with some detail lost in the low-contrast structures. There was no visible degradation due to the extra diagonal line. In addition, there is a slight loss of detail due to the blumng of the anatomical edges. Comparatively speaking, the weak membrane results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3(d</ref>) are more patchy, especially in regions where the phantom was uniform (e.g. gray matter). Small details, such as the border between the gray and white matter of the brain are not as well preserved in the weak membrane reconstruction. Not surprisingly, both the FBP and EM-ML reconstructions (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3(b</ref>) and (c)) are noisier than the MAP reconstructions. Compared to the best intermodality reconstructions, the small, detailed structures in FBP and EM-ML are not as clearly resolved.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">(d)<label>(e) (f)</label></formula><p>The RMS error relative to the phantom was evaluated for selected ROIs in order to quantitatively assess the efficacy of our algorithm. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref>(a) displays RMS error vs. iteration number for a ROI corresponding exactly to the bright, outer region of the phantom. As seen, the Bayesian reconstructions result in improved quantitations in this region; the addition of prior anatomical information results in further improvement relative to the Bayesian reconstruction obtained without the anatomical information (weak membrane). Note also that the RMS error obtained with the modified (with blurred, missing and extra edges) edge map is nearly identical to the result obtained with the perfect edge map. This illustrates a robustness of the algorithm to slight errors in the edge map. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref>(b) shows a similar plot for the ROI corresponding to the intermediate (white matter, value equal to 25) region. Once again, the Bayesian reconstructions show considerable improvement over FBP and EM-ML, and the addition of anatomical prior information is clearly beneficial.</p><p>We also ran the algorithm on a second phantom shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5(a)</ref>. This 32 x 32 phantom consists of three regions of values 75, 130 and 150 against a background of 100. Projection data was mathematically generated by calculating the Radon transform using 32 equiangular projections around 180 degrees with 32 detector bins per projection. Independent Poisson noise was added to each detector bin.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref>(b) shows the result obtained using FBP with a ramp filter. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref>(c) shows the result obtained using EM-ML after 50 iterations, where the number of iterations was selected to correspond to the minimum RMS error relative to the phantom.</p><p>As with the previous phantom, we ran the Bayesian reconstructions with weak membrane and anatomical priors. For the anatomical priors, we used an edge map with missing and extra lines but without blur. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5(f)</ref> shows the anatomical edge map used in the intermodality reconstruction. Comparison with the phantom in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref>(a) shows a missing edge (upper right) and false edges constituting an extra region (center). The parameters for the weak membrane reconstruction were X = 0.77 and 1c1 = 17.0 with e ( i , j ) set to zero everywhere. The energy function no longer depends on 1c2 once e ( i , j ) is set to zero. The parameters for the intermodality reconstruction were X = 0.7, 1c1 = 15.0 and K~ = 5.0. The plateau thresholds for both reconstructions were equal to 4.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref>(d) shows the weak membrane reconstruction after 617 iterations. The reconstruction is generally smoother than FBP or EM-ML but note the error in the reconstruction of the boundary of the upper left region. When anatomical information is employed as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref>(e), the error is corrected and the resulting reconstruction is qualitatively superior. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref>(e) shows the result after 682 iterations.</p><p>As before, in order to quantitatively assess the performance of our algorithm, we plot the RMS error vs iteration for two ROIs. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref>(a) displays RMS error vs. iteration number for an ROI corresponding exactly to the bright upper right region of the phantom; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref>(b) shows the RMS error for an ROI corresponding exactly to the background (i.e. the region in the phantom with value 100). As seen, the Bayesian reconstructions result in improved quantitations in these regions; the addition of prior anatomical information results in further improvement relative to the reconstruction obtained without the anatomical information (weak membrane).</p><p>V. CONCLUSION We have proposed a Bayesian model that incorporates prior knowledge of correlated anatomical discontinuities into reconstructions of functional images. Initial results, obtained by using two mathematical phantoms with a single noise realization in each case, are encouraging and show that the anatomical information leads to improved reconstructions. Also, the algorithm appears robust to errors such as missing or incorrectly placed anatomical boundaries.</p><p>Our approach is distinguished by two features. The mechanism for incorporating anatomical information is expressed as a space varying modulation of the potential that controls the creation of a discontinuity. The second feature involves our justification of the use of a cusp-like potential. The discussions in Section I11 argue for two advantages of the cusp-like potential.</p><p>While these initial tests are encouraging, they are limited. As is common in phantom testing of reconstruction algorithms, the source distribution in the phantom is spatially piecewise constant. This feature crudely reflects an assumption that radionuclide is uniformly distributed in certain anatomical regions. However, in the case of Bayesian approaches with priors (such as the weak membrane) that favor such piecewise constant solutions, it may be important to more accurately model underlying source distributions, particularly in the vicinity of boundaries (edges) in the source. If, for example, the underlying source has edges that roll off gradually, the advantage of a Bayesian solution with weak membrane priors may be diminished. An effort in accurate modeling of underlying source distributions is needed. In addition, several outstanding problems remain before the use of anatomical information as priors can be practicable. Validation studies showing the correlation of anatomical structures with function for different types of radiopharmaceutical studies are necessary, of course. Given reliable knowledge of anatomy-function correlation, there still remains the problem of analyzing a given anatomical image to derive only those boundaries that are significant in the sense of likely correlation to function. A prerequisite for this analysis task is a sophisticated segmentation algorithm that can reliably identify different tissue types within the anatomical slice. In addition, accurate 3-D registration is required along with an improved means of modeling residual registration errors into the reconstruction procedure.</p><p>In sum, we have explored one possible avenue for incorporation of anatomical information into a reconstruction problem.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
