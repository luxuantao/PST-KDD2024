<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>A supply chain is a network of facilities (e.g. manufacturing plants, distribution centers, warehouses, etc.) that performs a set of operations ranging from the acquisition of raw materials, the transformation of these materials into intermediate and finished products, to the distribution of the finished goods to the customers (see e.g. Bramel and Simchi-Levi <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a supply chain network with suppliers, plants, distribution centers (DCs) and customers. The arrows indicate the transportation channels that are available to ship products. In addition to inbound and outbound transportation, products may flow between facilities of the same type and from customer locations to other facilities (e.g. plants, DCs). The latter material flows describe product recovery activities for the purposes of recycling, remanufacturing, and reuse. Such activities are an integral part of reverse logistics, an area which has attracted considerable attention over the last decade (see e.g. Fleischmann <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>).</p><p>The optimization of the complete supply chain is accomplished through efficient planning decisions. In the strategic planning level, typical decisions concern the location of manufacturing and/or warehousing facilities. Although facility location and configuration of production-distribution networks have been studied for many years (see Bender et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> for a review of models, company-specific case studies, and decision support systems), a number of important real world issues has not received adequate attention. These include, among others, the external supply of commodities, inventory opportunities for goods, storage limitations, availability of capital for investments, and relocation, expansion or reduction of capacities. In addition, the supply chain network typically consists of arborescent structures usually limited to at most two echelons of facilities (e.g. plants and DCs), a system of distribution channels between these echelons and the demand points, and a relatively simple cost structure. Even though some of these issues have been treated individually in the literature, our extensive experience with a variety of industrial projects in the supply chain planning area indicates that companies wish them all to be explicitly incorporated in the design of their supply chain networks (see e.g. Bender et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, Kalcsics et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and the website of Fraunhofer ITWM <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for an overview of recent projects). Clearly, the structure of a network is strongly affected by the simultaneous consideration of these and other practical needs. One observes a lack of reasonably simple, yet comprehensive, models which illustrate the effect of such factors on network configuration decisions. This paper attempts to fill this gap. Our main contribution is to provide a mathematical modeling framework for assisting decision-makers in the design of their supply chains.</p><p>The establishment of new facilities as well as the expansion, reduction, and relocation of existing facilities are typically long-term projects involving time-consuming activities (e.g. facility constructing) and substantial investment capital (e.g. installation of an adequate infrastructure, equipment supply, and employee training). As a result, companies are faced with the task of planning their supply chains in such a way that plans are carried out smoothly without disrupting supply chain activities. For example, in many manufacturing environments, the setup or relocation of a production facility is a lengthy project which requires time-phased planning. A smooth transition to a new network configuration allows better coordination of all operational aspects involved in this process, and better management of the required investment capital. Hence, to abate the financial burden put on the company by such a comprehensive project, capital expenditures as well as network design decisions should be planned over several time periods. Another practical situation to which a relocation scenario applies concerns the merger of companies. In this case, formerly separated supply chains are consolidated and a joint logistics structure needs to be planned. This entails shutting down some of the existing facilities and concentrating capacities in new locations.</p><p>In this paper, we address the dynamic location and relocation of facilities, and propose a mathematical modeling framework to tackle such problems. As will be shown, our approach not only deals with the gradual relocation of existing facilities but also comprises capacity expansion and capacity reduction scenarios. Furthermore, our model includes many dynamic facility location problems, which have appeared in the literature, as special cases. Our primary concern is to provide a comprehensive modeling framework which explicitly captures many practical aspects that play an important role in shaping the optimal structure of supply chain networks. In particular, our models focus on the following strategic issues:</p><p>‚Ä¢ Where and when should a partial or total relocation of existing facilities take place?</p><p>‚Ä¢ Using the available investment capital and considering the capacity limitations, how gradually should the capacity of existing facilities be reduced and when should the transition to newly established facilities be made without disrupting the supply chain activities? ‚Ä¢ How should the supply chain be operated in each planning period with respect to the provision of materials, storage, and shipment of products so that demand requirements are satisfied at least cost?</p><p>Before concluding the introduction, a few remarks are in order concerning how our modeling framework fits into the existing literature. The literature devoted to dynamic facility location in a multi-commodity, multi-level (or multi-echelon) supply chain network is relatively scarce. However, a great deal of research has been dedicated to some of these aspects individually and to specific combinations of them.</p><p>Since the pioneering work by Ballou <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, many papers addressing the dynamic facility location problem have appeared. The uncapacitated case was studied, amongst others, by Chardaire et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, Galv√£o and Santiba√±ez-Gonzalez <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Kelly and Marucheck <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Khumawala and Whybark <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, Roodman and Schwarz <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, and Van Roy and Erlenkotter <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Furthermore, Canel and Khumawala <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> considered the dynamic location of international facilities, while Saldanha da Gama <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> incorporated budget constraints in his models. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> also introduced a budget constraint into a static location problem.</p><p>Concerning the capacitated version of the problem, the possibility of expanding/reducing the operating capacity is often considered. One of the earliest attempts to incorporate capacity constraints is due to Sweeney and Tatham <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Erlenkotter <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, Fong and Srinivasan <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, Jacobsen <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and Lee and Luss <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> analyzed the problem of deciding in which periods the capacity of a given set of facilities should be extended to meet increasing demand patterns. Antunes and Peeters <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and Shulman <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> addressed the case of modular capacities. Melachrinoudis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> studied a multi-objective version of the capacitated multi-period location problem.</p><p>The problem of deciding where to locate a set of intermediate facilities (such as DCs) was examined by Elson <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Geoffrion and Graves <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and, more recently, Hormozi and Khumawala <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> studied the same problem. These models were later extended leading to the problem of locating more than one echelon of facilities. Barros <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, Barros and Labb√© <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, Kaufman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, Pirkul and Jayaraman <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and Tcha and Lee <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> have dealt with the static version of this problem.</p><p>The combination of dynamic and multi-commodity aspects in the problem of deciding the best location for a set of intermediate capacitated facilities was addressed by Canel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Melachrinoudis and Min <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and Min and Melachrinoudis <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> focused on the relocation of one single intermediate facility in a multi-objective context. Finally, Hinojosa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> studied a problem combining dynamic aspects with multi-level facility location in a multi-commodity distribution network. This problem was later extended by Velten <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> to integrate inventory considerations. Inventories were also explicitly considered by the dynamic model proposed by Gue <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> for combat logistics.</p><p>The models to be presented in Sections 3 and 4 go beyond the literature described above by considering a broader context for facility location and relocation. This means that many issues that are likely to occur in practical settings (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>) are explicitly taken into account. These include a dynamic planning horizon, a generic network structure, the planning of supply chain activities (i.e. production, inventory, distribution) in addition to facility location/relocation, and capacity and budget constraints. As mentioned before, we will focus on modeling rather than on algorithmic aspects.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the general settings and assumptions used in our modeling approach. In Section 3, a mixed integer linear programming formulation is presented for the dynamic relocation of facilities. Section 4 is dedicated to extensions of this base model. We address capacity expansion and reduction scenarios as well as the case of discrete capacity sizes. To ease the exposition, it is shown in the appendix that our modeling framework also includes the simple dynamic facility location problem (of the type e.g. analyzed by Van Roy and Erlenkotter <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>) as a special case. Section 5 emphasizes the way in which the new framework generalizes models widely known from the literature, and also gives a brief review of the techniques that have been used to deal with them. Section 6 reports on the computational experience with the proposed models using commercially available mathematical programming software. In particular, useful insights on the impact of various factors on network design decisions are provided. Finally, Section 7 presents some concluding remarks and suggests directions for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Problem settings and description</head><p>To provide a setting for our modeling framework, we consider a general supply chain network where different products are delivered to satisfy the requirements of several demand points (henceforth also called facilities). The network may accommodate different types of facilities (e.g. plants, DCs, warehouses), which are already operating at the beginning of the planning project. No restrictions are imposed on the number of different facility types and on the transportation links used by the company for shipping its products. In other words, commodities can be transported between any type of facility as illustrated in</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Existing facilities Potential new facilities</head><p>Existing facilities New facilities</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">t -1 t i 1 i 2 i 3 j 1 j 2 j 3 i 1 i 2 i 3 j 1 j 2 j 3</formula><p>Period Period Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The effect of capacity relocation.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Moreover, supply chain operations in such a network are mainly dedicated to distribution activities with the purpose of satisfying known demand requirements. Therefore, due to the general structure of the supply chain model, to ensure that products will flow through the network, a source for their distribution needs to be set. As a result, either products are produced in certain pre-specified facilities or purchased from outside suppliers. In the former case, and due to the strategic nature of the problem, a complete description of the underlying production system in each facility is not considered. In other words, only production decisions regarding end products are taken into account. Hence, requirements for components, subassemblies, and raw materials as commonly described by the bill-of-materials of end products are not included in our models. In addition to production and procurement, inventory activities are also considered. Observe that fluctuations in production, procurement, and transportation costs along with capacity constraints may justify holding products in stock for later distribution. We assume that a company is considering relocating part or all of the capacity of some of its existing facilities during a certain time horizon. Prior to the planning project, the company has selected a set of candidate sites where new facilities can be established. Furthermore, the existing capacities as well as the capacities of the prospective sites are known in advance. In many applications, management does not wish to open a facility unless its projected output is some minimum level. Therefore, when capacity transfers occur, they must ensure that both existing and new facilities operate at least at a meaningful level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Capacity relocation</head><p>To illustrate the conditions under which capacity may be transferred from existing locations to new sites, consider the situation depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. At the end of a given period, say t -1, the company operates facilities i 1 , i 2 , and i 3 . Potential sites for setting up new facilities are denoted by j 1 , j 2 , and j 3 . It is assumed that if capacity is to be shifted then this will occur at the beginning of period t, and will have a relatively short duration compared to the period length. On the right-hand side of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, a possible scenario for capacity shifting is displayed. At the beginning of period t new facilities will be operating in all three potential sites. The capacity of the existing facility i 1 is distributed among the sites j 1 , j 2 , and j 3 . As a result, facility i 1 will neither operate in period t nor in any subsequent period. Thus, we assume that the facility is closed at the end of period t -1, and its total capacity is moved to the new sites at the beginning of period t. Part of the capacity of the existing facility i 2 is transferred to the new site j 2 . Facility i 2 remains in operation but with reduced capacity. Note that the new facility j 2 has attained its maximum capacity, while facilities j 1 and j 3 can still have their capacity extended in later periods. Finally, the existing facility i 3 retains all its capacity.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, an existing facility may be partly or completely relocated to one or more new sites. Capacity transferred to a new facility cannot be removed in later periods, that is, capacity reductions are only allowed at existing facilities. Under increasing demand patterns during the planning horizon, it may be necessary to extend the total capacity available in the system at the beginning of the relocation project. This is accomplished by permitting capacity expansions in both existing and new facilities. Section 4.1 will be dedicated to this scenario. The opposite case will be treated in Section 4.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Cost factors</head><p>The majority of facility location models seeks to minimize the total distribution costs, both inbound (e.g. from plants to DCs) and outbound costs (e.g. from DCs to demand points) plus fixed facility operating and setup costs. In our case, costs are divided into two categories: the so-called business costs, which result from operating the supply chain, and investment costs for facility relocation, which are constrained by the available budget.</p><p>The first category comprises time-dependent costs for the purchase of products from external suppliers, production costs, transportation costs, inventory holding costs, and fixed facility operating costs, e.g. fixed overhead and maintenance costs. The objective is to find the relocation plan that minimizes the sum of the business costs under given side constraints.</p><p>As mentioned above, relocation decisions are constrained by budget limitations. We assume that in each time period a given budget is available for investing not only in capacity transfers but also in the setup of new facilities and shutdown of existing facilities. Relocation costs incurred by capacity shifts are assumed to depend on the amount moved from an existing facility to a new site, and account, for example, for workforce and equipment transfers. Since the setup of a new facility is usually a time-consuming process, we assume that it takes place in the period immediately preceding the start-up of operations. Hence, if a new facility starts operating in some period t, fixed costs are charged with respect to its setup in period t -1. These costs account for the installation of a new infrastructure and include, for instance, property acquisition, facility construction, and traffic access. On the other hand, when an existing facility ceases operating at the end of some period t, we assume that shutdown costs are incurred in the following period. These are related to disposal activities but may also cover other aspects such as employee re-training. Observe that in certain situations shutdown costs may be negative, that is, may correspond to revenues obtained, for example, due to the termination of leasing contracts or the selling of property.</p><p>In view of the assumptions made on the time points for paying fixed facility costs, it follows that a new facility can never start operating in the first period since that would force the company to invest in its setup before the beginning of the planning horizon. As a result, capacity transfers are only allowed in periods after the first. Similarly, an existing facility cannot be closed at the end of the last period since the corresponding fixed shutdown costs would be incurred in a period beyond the planning horizon. Finally, any capital available in a period but not invested then is subject to an interest rate and the returned value can be used in subsequent periods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Problem formulation</head><p>Before presenting a mixed integer linear programming model (MIP) for the dynamic relocation problem described in Section 2, we first introduce the notation that will be used throughout the paper. We assume that prior to the relocation project, all relevant data (costs, capacities, and other factors) were collected using e.g. appropriate forecasting methods and company-specific business analyses. Set L contains all types of facilities. These are categorized in so-called selectable and non-selectable facilities. Selectable facilities form the set S, a subset of L, and include existing facilities (S c ) as well as potential sites for establishing new facilities (S o ). At the beginning of the planning horizon, all the facilities in the set S c are operating. Afterwards, capacity can be shifted from these facilities to new facilities located at the sites in S o . Note that S c ‚à© S o = ‚àÖ and S c ‚à™ S o = S.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Notation and definition of decision variables</head><p>The second category of facilities, the so-called non-selectable group, forms the set L\S and includes all facilities that exist at the beginning of the planning project and which will remain in operation. Examples of such facilities include plants and warehouses which should continue supporting supply chain activities, that is, are not subject to relocation decisions. Non-selectable facilities may also have demand requirements, that is, they may correspond to customers.</p><p>The planning horizon is partitioned into a set of consecutive and integer time periods which may not necessarily have equal size. In total, there are n planning periods. Since each existing facility belonging to the selectable set S c may have its capacity transferred to one or more new facilities, it is assumed that its maximum capacity is non-increasing during the planning horizon, that is,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">Costs</head><formula xml:id="formula_1">K t i K t+1 i , i ‚àà S c , t ‚àà T\{n}.<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Without loss of generality, it is assumed that K 1 i denotes the actual size of an existing selectable facility i ‚àà S c at the beginning of the planning horizon. Condition (1) permits to impose capacity transfers in specific periods or even complete shutdowns. One simply needs to decrease the maximum allowed size of the existing facility for which a reduction is desired or even set the capacity equal to zero in the case of a shutdown.</p><p>Similarly, potential new facilities must have non-decreasing capacities during the planning horizon, that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">K t j K t+1 j , j ‚àà S o , t ‚àà T\{n}.<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Clearly, at the beginning of the planning project we have that K 1 j =0 for every new site j ‚àà S o . In addition, by allowing time-dependent capacity levels, seasonal demand fluctuations can easily be modeled. For example, in the beverage sector, demand usually grows during the summer, thus leading to an increase in the required number of working shifts or in the floor space hired for storing products.</p><p>Finally, we note that since non-selectable facilities will remain in operation over the time horizon, independent of their product flow, a minimum throughput is not specified for them. However, this feature can easily be added to our model.</p></div>

Since capacity transfers are not permitted at the beginning of the planning horizon, it follows that z 1 i,j = 0 for every i ‚àà S c and j ‚àà S o (recall Section 2.2).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Alternative formulation</head><p>The decision variables t describing the state of the selectable facilities ‚àà S in each period can be found in many dynamic facility location models in the literature (e.g. Canel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, Chardaire et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and Roodman and Schwarz <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>).

In Section 6, we will look closely at the benefits of such a variable redefinition.

Moreover, the two models are equivalent, which is a direct consequence of the relations between the two different types of location variables as described by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_32">25</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. For certain dynamic facility location problems, Hinojosa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, Saldanha da Gama <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Van Roy and Erlenkotter <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and Velten <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> showed that it is advantageous to use the new variables.

The procedure was improved and extended by Velten <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> to include inventory decisions. Using standard mathematical programming software, Saldanha da Gama <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> showed that with the new variables it is much less time consuming to obtain the optimal solution or the lower bound provided by the linear relaxation of the simple dynamic location problem with budget constraints of the type of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">14</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. Van Roy and Erlenkotter <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> took advantage of the new variables to develop a dual-based procedure for solving the simple dynamic location problem. In Section 6, our computational experience will also indicate a preference for using the alternative model over (P ) for certain network configurations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Extensions</head><p>To cope with changing demand patterns, two extensions of the base model (P ) are introduced in this section, namely, the capacity expansion (see Section 4.1) and capacity reduction scenarios (see Section 4.2). Furthermore, the special case of modular capacity transfers will be discussed in Section 4.3. To ease the exposition, we show in the appendix that our base model includes many well-known dynamic facility location problems in which network design decisions are restricted to opening new facilities and closing existing ones. The reduction to a simple dynamic location problem makes use of elements of the extensions described in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Capacity expansion</head><p>When a company anticipates a growth in its sales volumes (e.g. based upon customer demand forecasts), it needs to adopt additional restructuring measures. This entails expanding the supply chain network to respond to increasing demand patterns. Expansion plans may result in extending the capacity of existing facilities and/or establishing additional facilities. In our base model (P ), the total capacity available at the beginning of the planning project does not change over the time horizon. However, it is relatively easy to extend (P ) to an expansion scenario.</p><p>We consider a fictitious facility, denoted by i 0 , which concentrates the total additional capacity, K 1 i 0 , required to cope with increasing demands. This facility has a similar status to that of selectable facilities in S c , although it cannot satisfy any demand requirements. Its capacity can be shifted to both existing and new facilities. As a result, either an existing facility will have its capacity expanded or it will be (partly) relocated to one or more new sites. Both operations are not permitted. Regarding the new facilities, they can receive capacity not only from existing (selectable) facilities, but also from the fictitious facility i 0 .</p><p>As in the base model, new facilities cannot be downgraded.</p><p>Observe that the capacity variations described in (1) for each facility i ‚àà S c do not permit the expansion of existing selectable facilities. Therefore, condition ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">1</ref>) is now dropped for at least one facility in the set S c . With respect to the potential sites for new facilities, assumptions (2) also hold here.</p><p>Under the new problem settings, the following decision variables are required in addition to those defined in Section 3.1.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1.">Additional decision variables</head><p>z t i 0 , = amount of capacity shifted from the fictitious facility i 0 to a facility ‚àà S at the beginning of period t ‚àà T, i = 1 if the existing facility i ‚àà S c has its capacity extended during the planning horizon, 0 otherwise.</p><p>Regarding the moving costs, we extend them to the new situation by defining MC t i 0 , as the unit variable capacity acquisition cost in facility ‚àà S and period t ‚àà T. No other costs are charged to the fictitious facility i 0 . At the end of Section 2.2 we mentioned the reasons why capacity transfers were not allowed in the first period. However, since for existing selectable facilities an infrastructure already exists at the beginning of the planning horizon, we will relax this assumption and also permit the expansion of existing facilities in the first period. In other words, capacity shifts from the fictitious facility i 0 to any facility i ‚àà S c are allowed in t = 1, i.e., z 1 i 0 ,i 0. With respect to new facilities, we keep the initial assumption that z 1 i 0 ,j = 0 for every j ‚àà S o . The new MIP formulation has the same objective function (3) as the base model. Regarding the constraints, the following modifications are required. The term t =1 z i 0 ,i is added to the left-hand side of constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, and to the right-hand side of constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. Furthermore, the term i‚ààS c z i,j in constraints ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">9</ref>) is replaced by i‚ààS c ‚à™{i 0 } z i,j . Regarding the budget constraints, we need to add the moving costs i‚ààS c MC 1 i 0 ,i z 1 i 0 ,i to the left-hand side of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">14</ref>). In Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">15</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">16</ref>), the term describing the capacity moving costs is replaced by i‚ààS c ‚à™{i 0 } j ‚ààS o MC t i,j z t i,j + i‚ààS c MC t i 0 ,i z t i 0 ,i for every t ‚àà T\{1}. In addition to constraints (4), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">7</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">10</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">17</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">22</ref>), the following new conditions are required.</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">i n i , i ‚àà S c (<label>28</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_38">) t‚ààT z t i 0 ,i K 1 i 0 i , i ‚àà S c (<label>29</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_39">) t‚ààT j ‚ààS o z t i,j K 1 i (1 -i ), i ‚àà S c (30) t‚ààT i‚ààS c z t i 0 ,i + t‚ààT j ‚ààS o z t i 0 ,j K 1 i 0 , (<label>31</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_40">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_41">z t i 0 , 0, ‚àà S, t ‚àà T (<label>32</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_42">) i ‚àà {0, 1}, i ‚àà S c .

The opposite also holds, that is, in the case that facility i ‚àà S c is not operated in the last period n, this means that it must have been closed in one of the previous periods and therefore could not have its capacity expanded. Constraints (29) together with <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> ensure that an existing facility can either have its capacity expanded or relocated to new sites, but both operations cannot take place during the planning horizon. Observe that if the size of an existing selectable facility is not increased (i.e., i = 0, i ‚àà S c ), then by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> any capacity transfers from the fictitious facility i 0 are prevented. If capacity is extended (i.e., i = 1, i ‚àà S c ) then by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> no part of it can be later transferred. Constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> states that the capacity of the fictitious facility cannot be exceeded.</p><p>Compared We conclude this section by remarking that, if desired, capacity expansions can easily be imposed by varying the capacity of the fictitious facility according to (1), and replacing constraint (31) by the appropriate conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Capacity reduction</head><p>As opposed to the situation discussed in the previous section, we now address a capacity reduction scenario. Products approaching the end of their life cycles are faced with declining demand patterns, and as a result, capacity that was initially reserved for them becomes redundant. Also during periods of economic downturns, demand patterns tend to be very volatile and excess capacities need to be reduced.</p><p>Again we consider a fictitious facility, denoted by j 0 , which can be established with all excess capacity from existing facilities. This implies that j 0 has a similar status to that of the potential new facilities in S o , but cannot satisfy any demand requirements. We introduce an upper bound K t j 0 on the overall capacity that can be reduced until period t ‚àà T. Condition (2) may be also imposed here. Under these new problem settings, the following decision variables are required in addition to those defined in Section 3.1.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Additional decision variables</head><p>z t i,j 0 = amount of capacity shifted from an existing facility i ‚àà S c to the fictitious facility j 0 , at the beginning of period t ‚àà T.</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">t j 0 =</formula><p>1 if facility j 0 ‚àà S is operated during period t ‚àà T, 0 otherwise.</p><p>Analogous to the capacity expansion case, we will allow existing facilities to have their capacities decreased already in the first period, i.e., z 1 i,j 0 0 for i ‚àà S c . The required changes in the base model (P ) correspond to replacing S o by S o ‚à™ {j 0 } in constraints ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">8</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">13</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">15</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. Moreover, the capacity moving costs i‚ààS c MC 1 i,j 0 z 1 i,j 0 are added to the left-hand side of the budget constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> for the first period. The integrality conditions t j 0 ‚àà {0, 1} for every t ‚àà T are also added. As a result, the extended formulation has 2|T| -1 constraints, |S c | ‚Ä¢ |T| continuous variables, and |T| binary variables in addition to those in model (P ). Finally, we observe that, if desired, it is easy to impose a minimum capacity reduction level per period by defining a lower bound K t j 0 for every t ‚àà T, and adding the constraints t =1 i‚ààS c z i,j 0 K t j 0 t j 0 , t ‚àà T. It should be noted that in many situations the fixed setup costs F C t j 0 and the operating costs OC t j 0 of the fictitious facility may be zero, while the unit variable costs of moving capacity to this facility (MC t i,j 0 , i ‚àà S c ) may be negative. This corresponds, for instance, to the situation where a return is obtained by selling infrastructures. In this case, reducing capacity is profitable. If the capacity reduction costs are positive then two scenarios may still lead to a decrease of the available capacities. The first has to do with the maximum allowed capacities. If, in some period, the overall sum of these capacities is below the total initial capacity then, whatever the capacity reduction costs, capacity reduction will necessarily occur. The second scenario regards the magnitude of the costs. It may be worth reducing the capacity when its cost is lower than the cost one would have to pay for having that capacity operating. In fact, due to the minimum throughputs, the total cost for having a certain capacity operating may be high.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Modular capacity transfers</head><p>Until now we modeled capacity relocation through the continuous variables z t i,j , i ‚àà S c , j ‚àà S o , t ‚àà T. This is a good approximation for many applications in which the size of the capacity shifts is large. However, there are cases in which the possible transfer sizes are restricted to discrete amounts. Applications can be found in telecommunications and production settings, where the facilities (e.g. various types of concentrators, production equipment) are manufactured in a limited set of sizes. In addition, the modular case also permits to model economies of scale in the costs of setting up new facilities and relocating existing facilities. Hence, in this section we focus on modular capacity transfers. Newly established facilities obtain capacity by adding modules chosen from those available at existing locations. Let M denote the set of module types and let us define S m as the size of a module of type m ‚àà M. We assume that S m &lt; S m+1 for every m ‚àà M\{M}, with M denoting the largest module. Hence, the size of an existing facility i ‚àà S c at the beginning of the planning horizon (i.e. K 1 i ) is given by the sum of the sizes of the modules that are operating in that facility. Under these new problem settings, the following decision variables are required in addition to those already defined in Section 3.1.4.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Relation with existing literature</head><p>The modeling framework presented in Sections 3 and 4 generalizes many of the models proposed in the literature (see also the appendix). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref> presents a classification of facility location problems. The table is not intended to provide an exhaustive review but rather to illustrate in which way this generalization occurs. Each column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref> represents one of nine criteria: type of planning horizon, type of objective function, number of commodities, number of facility levels in addition to the customer level, number of echelons to be located, consideration of relocation and inventory decisions, and finally, inclusion of capacity and budget constraints. As far as capacity constraints are concerned, one finds essentially three situations: the usual type of constraints, the possibility of expanding or reducing operating capacity, and modular capacities. For each analytical study in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref>, which explicitly considers capacity constraints, we detail the corresponding case(s).</p><p>Observing Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref>, one realizes that none of the existing models deals simultaneously with all the aspects considered in Sections 3 and 4.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Computational experience</head><p>In this section, we present the results of our numerical tests. The MIP formulations described in the previous sections were implemented using the modeling language ILOG OPL Studio 3.6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, and a variety of test problems were solved with standard mathematical programming software, namely with the branch-and-bound algorithm of ILOG CPLEX 8.0 [41], on a Pentium III PC with 2.6 GHz processor and 2 GB RAM. Our computational experiments were guided by three objectives:</p><p>‚Ä¢ to identify the most effective formulation between the two different models described in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, and to measure the quality of the lower bounds produced by their linear relaxations; ‚Ä¢ to analyze the impact of gradually relaxing certain assumptions in the original model such as excluding budget restrictions on investments, and reducing the decision space by removing facility relocation decisions and thus coming closer to location models with exclusively opening and closing decisions; ‚Ä¢ to analyze the impact of various problem characteristics such as the size and configuration of the networks, and the number of periods, products and customers.</p><p>We randomly generated three classes of problems corresponding to different network configurations as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. The generated problems vary from single to tri-echelon networks with various alternatives for the flow of products such as inter-facility transportation, direct deliveries from the plant to the customer level, and reverse arcs for the return of goods. For each problem class, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref> indicates the number of facilities selected. The second column gives the number of problems considered in each class. Observe that not every combination was tested (for details about the problem characteristics we refer the reader to Melo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>). Five instances were randomly generated for each problem, thus yielding a total of 95 instances. The generated problems cover small and medium-scale networks. In an attempt to generate problems related to realistic cases, the amount of arcs available for the transportation of goods in the networks is restricted to 50% -70%. Also, only a given number of product types can actually flow through each generated arc. In this way, we can constrain the volume of traffic in the networks.</p><p>In all the problems, the relocation decisions involve the distribution centers. Furthermore, all data (costs, capacities, demands, etc.) were drawn at random from a uniform distribution over given intervals. These intervals were selected in such a way that a large variety of instances was created that differ by the number of periods, products and facilities, the availability of transportation arcs, the range of fixed and  Central Regional Central Regional 1 variable costs, and the range of capacities and capital for investments. Accordingly, the transportation costs are neither based on distances between facilities nor satisfy the triangle inequality. This aspect contributes to an increase in the difficulty of solving the generated problem instances. For the demands, costs, capacities and minimum throughputs, the methodology was to randomly generate a value for the first period. For each subsequent period, the previous parameter value was increased or decreased by a certain percentage which was randomly selected over a given interval. For example, customer demands for the first period were drawn following a uniform distribution in the interval [0, 25]. In the second period, the percentage increase compared to the first period was randomly generated between 5% and 10%. This procedure was repeated until the last period of the planning horizon was attained, thus creating an increasing demand sequence. As mentioned above, all the details can be found in Melo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>.</p><p>The first experiments aimed at determining the most effective formulation for capacity relocation. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref> gives an overview of the number of variables and constraints in formulations (P ) and (AP ). As expected, the size of the models is largely influenced by the bulk of variables which in turn is dominated by the number of transportation arcs (i.e., variables x t , ,p ). Regarding the constraints, and as mentioned in Section 3.3, small savings are made with the alternative formulation.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">4</ref> displays the average, minimum, and maximum CPU times (in seconds) required to attain optimality in each problem class for various variants of the original model. All test instances could be solved within the pre-specified time limit of 5 h. The relative percentage deviation ("LP-gap") between the optimal solution value and the lower bound given by the linear relaxation serves as a measure of tightness of the MIP formulations. The first two blocks of rows in Table <ref type="table">4</ref> refer to formulations (P ) and (AP ), which, as it can be seen, could be solved optimally in less than 40 min. Although the linear relaxations of both models are equally tight, the computation time required to solve the various instances varies from class to class. At first sight it may be peculiar that the problems in the first class are more difficult to solve than those in the second class. Although the networks of the problems in the latter class have an additional facility level relative to the plant level, the number of plants is considerably smaller than the number of DCs (the location level). Since not every plant is linked to every DC for each product, the choice to operate a given DC is not so difficult to take as in class 1. Consequently, the flow of products from the DCs to the customers is further restricted by a subset of the existing transportation arcs. This leads to a general decrease in the total computational effort. Nevertheless, the alternative formulation seems to be more efficient for class 2. This observation is in part supported by Hinojosa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, Saldanha da Gama <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and Velten <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> who developed formulations such as (AP ) for problems where the underlying network configuration is similar to that of class 2 (excluding the inter-facility arcs). Compared to the other classes, problem class 3, which has more facility levels and a wide variety of transportation arcs (including some reverse arcs), requires considerably more computational effort with formulation (AP ) than with (P ). A close analysis of the CPU times in this class reveals that 17 out of 20 problem instances were solved in less than 10 min. Hence, only three problem instances (i.e. 15%) with CPU times varying between 1364.5 and 2358.6 s are responsible for the large average given in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>.</p><p>The last three blocks of rows in Table <ref type="table">4</ref> show the results obtained with simplified versions of the relocation model. We analyzed the effect of removing the budget constraints ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">14</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">16</ref>) from the formulation. In this case, the fixed facility opening and closing costs along with the variable capacity relocation costs are included in the objective function <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. We denote this variant of our model by (AP -B) (with AP indicating that the changes were made in the alternative formulation). Furthermore, using the transformations described in the appendix, which are based on the extensions presented in Section 4, facility relocation decisions were also excluded from the decision space. In the new model, denoted by (AP -R), new facilities can only be opened at their full capacity in one single period, while existing facilities can only be closed by having their capacities reduced to zero at once. Finally, we further simplified the "pure" opening/closing variant by excluding the budget constraints. The results obtained are shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref> under (AP -RB).</p><p>We observe that having a given capital for investing on facility location and relocation has a large impact on the time required to attain optimality. The exclusion of budget constraints leads to much easier problems independent of the network configuration and problem size. This is not surprising since in some of the test problems the budget constraints are occasionally binding. However, the quality of the lower bounds of the linear relaxation deteriorates in class 3. It is also interesting to observe the effect of using our model without capacity relocation decisions. While the CPU times in the first two classes clearly decrease compared to models (P ) and (AP ), the impact on class 3 is considerable. A closer look to this class showed that one single instance required considerable more computational effort (15654.6 s ‚âà 4.3 h) than the others. By removing this instance from the class, the CPU times are closer to the results obtained with (AP ) (on average 416.4 s and a maximum of 2239.7 s). In this instance, and using the alternative formulation (AP ), many capacity relocations take place to three new regional DCs without closing any existing DCs since the relocation costs are relatively low and the available budget is large. This strategy avoids paying fixed costs for shutting down facilities. In model (AP -R), only two new regional DCs are established and several existing DCs (both regional and central) are closed. It seems that in this case the abrupt decision to close and open DCs is harder to take, while the option of gradually moving capacity between facilities is easier to manage. This observation seems to be confirmed by the results obtained with the variant (AP -RB). The experiments conducted with this simplified model yielded both larger CPU times and LP-gaps than those with (AP -B). When budget limitations are disregarded, adding the facility costs (opening, closing, and capacity relocation costs) to the objective function leads to the search for the configuration with least total cost. Usually, less combinations with respect to changes in the status of each facility need to be assessed to find the best configuration, while more combinations for investments are considered especially when the available budget is not too tight, thus increasing the overall computational effort. Concerning the LP-relaxation, the quality of the lower bounds clearly decreases with the models restricted to opening and closing facilities (i.e. (AP -R) and (AP -RB)). This is particularly striking for model (AP -RB) when applied to class 3. For this class of more complex supply chain networks, the linear relaxation of 18 out of 20 problems yields gaps not larger than 15%. The remaining two problems have gaps of 83% and 89.8%. Such significant deviations are caused by the fact that our formulation is not adequate to model the classic case where the configuration decisions are not restricted by budget limitations and network design decisions are confined to opening new facilities and closing existing ones. Note that our base formulations(P ) and (AP ) were explicitly developed for capacity relocation and not for this case. A closer examination of the LP-solutions of the two outlier test instances indicates that almost all facility configuration variables are fractional over all time periods. In other instances with significantly lower gaps, some of the relaxed variables are already binary. In order to strengthen the LP-relaxation, valid inequalities would have to be added to the formulation (AP -RB).</p><p>The next experiments aimed at analyzing the impact of the number of periods, products, and customers on the solution times when using each of the five model variants described above. The results obtained are summarized in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref>. Each bar corresponds to the average CPU time over five problem instances. As expected, the length of the time horizon has the largest effect as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref> for selected problems of class 1 (single echelon networks). This is particularly striking for the formulations (P ) and (AP ) where the computational effort almost explodes when the planning horizon increases from 4 to 6 periods. This is caused by a large increase in the number of transportation variables.</p><p>The impact of the number of products was explored using three problems of class 1. As expected, a gradual increase in the CPU time is observed. However, we note from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref>  Finally, using four problems of class 2 (two-echelon networks) we studied the effect of increasing the number of customers. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref> shows that the problems are easier to solve when the networks grow with respect to the demand market. This is not surprising, since all other factors remain unchanged, in particular the capacities of the existing facilities. Hence, increasing the demand requirements induces larger product flows, and as a result a higher utilization of the DCs. Since almost every facility is needed to serve (directly or indirectly) customer demands, the decisions on which facilities to operate are easier  to take. In other words, the number of possible facility configurations becomes smaller when the number of customers increases, and consequently the problems can be solved in less time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions and further research</head><p>We described a mathematical modeling framework for dynamic facility location that captures important features of strategic supply chain planning problems. The aspects considered include the relocation of existing facilities through capacity transfers to new locations, integration of inventory, transportation and supply decisions, the availability of a given budget for investments in facility location and relocation, and the generic structure of the supply chain network. We have shown that capacity expansion and reduction scenarios as well as modular capacity shifts can easily be incorporated into our model, thus extending its already broad scope. Furthermore, an extensive comparison to other models that appeared in the literature has shown that our framework generalizes many aspects that have been considered individually. Using standard mathematical software, we solved to optimality a number of randomly generated test problems in less than 5 h. Moreover, we analyzed the impact of gradually relaxing certain assumptions, thus bringing the model closer to well-known dynamic facility location problems. We observed that the quality of the lower bound provided by the linear relaxation deteriorates when budget limitations and capacity relocation decisions are disregarded. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted on a number of individual problem components.</p><p>The problem investigated in this paper was motivated by our work in planning and designing supply chain networks for a variety of industrial projects. Despite its practical nature, it is a relatively unstudied problem for which efficient solution methods need to be developed. Promising approaches include decomposition techniques and meta-heuristics such as variable neighborhood search. The structure of our formulations could be exploited by primal Benders decomposition, since there is a natural separation of the binary facility configuration variables and the continuous material flow variables. Recently, Cordeau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref> reported on the successful development of such a primal decomposition approach for a static supply chain design problem.</p><p>In the problem addressed in this paper, fixed costs for opening and closing facilities are charged in the period prior to or following a facility configuration change. This aspect could easily be relaxed to include the payment of such costs in several consecutive periods and thus strengthening the model. In addition, economies of scale arising in transportation could also be considered. Another important extension would be to relax the assumption of deterministic demand, costs, and other factors in the problem and treat them as stochastic. However, such modifications would certainly have a strong impact on the complexity of the problem.</p><p>Clearly, the above variations and extensions of the problem will provide additional challenges to develop efficient solution methods to this very realistic and strategically significant practical problem.</p><p>When facility relocation is excluded from the decision space, a new facility can only be established with its total capacity in one single period, while an existing facility can only be closed by reducing its total capacity at once. Hence, capacity is now "transferred" in modules with size equal to the full capacity of a given facility.</p><p>To install a new facility j ‚àà S o in some period t, it is required to "move" the desired capacity K t j from a fictitious facility i 0 , similar to the capacity expansion scenario discussed in Section 4.1. This fictitious facility i 0 concentrates all the possible sizes of new facilities, that is, K t i 0 = j ‚ààS o max ‚ààT K j for t ‚àà T. The shutdown of an existing facility is modeled by "moving" its total capacity to a fictitious facility j 0 in a similar way as described in Section 4.2 for the capacity reduction case. Naturally, the capacity of an existing facility can no longer vary over time and thus, K t i = K i for every i ‚àà S c and t ‚àà T. Since the fictitious facility j 0 contains the total capacity of the facilities that are closed during the planning horizon, it follows that K t j 0 = i‚ààS c K i for t ‚àà T.We note that i 0 and j 0 are not involved in any supply chain activities.</p><p>Using the location variables ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_28">23</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">24</ref>) of the alternative model (AP ), the continuous variables z t i,j</p><p>for relocating capacity are now transformed into modular shifts:</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">z t i,j 0 = K 1 i t-1 i , i ‚àà S c , t ‚àà T\{1}<label>(34)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_52">z t i 0 ,j = K t j t j , j ‚àà S o , t ‚àà T.<label>(35)</label></formula><p>It is easy to see that constraints ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">7</ref>) are now redundant. Constraints (6) do not apply here since gradual capacity shifts to new facilities are no longer allowed. The modification of the capacity, minimum throughput, and budget constraints (8), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">9</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">11</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">14</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">16</ref>) is straightforward. Observe that since capacity transfers are restricted to opening and closing decisions, the moving costs MC t i 0 ,j and MC t i,j 0 are set to zero. Finally, constraints (4) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> remain unchanged, as well as the facility configuration conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> (recall that the latter replace <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> and (13) of formulation (P )).</p><p>Classical facility location models consider in their objective functions fixed charges for installing and removing facilities, and activity-dependent costs (e.g. transportation costs). Although the former costs are taken into account in our budget constraints, it is easy to incorporate them in the objective function by redefining the operating costs OC t of each selectable facility ‚àà S. For each existing facility i ‚àà S c , let OC t i = SC t+1 i for every t ‚àà \{n}. Similarly, for a new facility j ‚àà S o , we have OC t j = F C t-1 j with t ‚àà \{1}. If desired, operating costs can also be incorporated in the new fixed costs by adding the terms t =1 OC i and n =t OC j , respectively. We conclude this section by observing that it is relatively easy to further reduce our model to a simple dynamic location problem of the type analyzed, for example, by Van Roy and Erlenkotter <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. A single echelon of uncapacitated facilities S, comprising both locations at which facilities may be opened and closed, is considered. Customers, corresponding to our non-selectable facilities, have demands for a single commodity. Since supply chain operations are restricted to transportation activities from facilities to customers, the flow conservation relations (4) reduce to demand satisfaction constraints. Furthermore, as it is usual in location models, fixed opening and closing costs are charged in the periods in which a facility starts operating or is shutdown, respectively. This entails allowing the facilities to be established or to be closed in the first and/or last periods of the planning horizon. Therefore, the time points marking the shutdown of an existing facility must be set at the beginning of each period t, in contrast to the definition given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. As result, the superscripts in the above definition of the new "operating costs" must be</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

Finally, our problem (P) is NP-hard since for |T| = 1 and using the transformations described above it reduces to a static uncapacitated facility location problem which was shown to be NP-hard by Jacobsen <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix: Reduction to well-known location problems</head><p>As mentioned in Section 1 (see also Table <ref type="table">1</ref> in Section 5), in a vast majority of the dynamic location literature, network design decisions are restricted to opening new facilities. Some authors also address the possibility of closing existing facilities (e.g. Van Roy and Erlenkotter <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>). Melachrinoudis and Min <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref> are among the few authors who explicitly incorporate relocation decisions in their models. By making use of elements of the extensions introduced in Sections 4.1-4.3, we will show next that our general modeling framework also includes pure opening and closing facility scenarios. Furthermore, we will describe how to transform the base model into a simple dynamic location problem.</p></div>			</div>
