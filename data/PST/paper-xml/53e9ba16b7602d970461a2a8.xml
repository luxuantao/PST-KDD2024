<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging with 201 Tl or 99m Tc agent is used to assess the location or the extent of myocardial infarction or ischemia. A method is proposed to decrease the effect of operator variability in the visual or quantitative interpretation of scintigraphic myocardial perfusion studies. To effect this, the patient's myocardial images (target cases) are registered automatically over a template image, utilizing a nonrigid transformation. The intermediate steps are: 1) Extraction of feature points in both stress and rest three-dimensional (3-D) images. The images are resampled in a polar geometry to detect edge points, which in turn are filtered by the use of a priori constraints. The remaining feature points are assumed to be points on the edges of the left ventricular myocardium. 2) Registration of stress and rest images with a global affine transformation. The matching method is an adaptation of the iterative closest point algorithm. 3) Registration and morphological matching of both stress and rest images on a template using a nonrigid local spline transformation following a global affine transformation. 4) Resampling of both stress and rest images in the geometry of the template. Optimization of the method was performed on a database of 40 pairs of stress and rest images selected to obtain a wide variation of images and abnormalities. Further testing was performed on 250 cases selected from the same database on the basis of the availability of angiographic results and patient stratification.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>• There are one or more regions with abnormally low count rate densities in both rest and stress images. The abnormality is said to be fixed, and this has been considered to connote a myocardial infarction, or in some cases a very narrow stenosis, with resting hypoperfusion and a hibernating or stunned myocardium. • There are one or more regions of low count rate densities in the stress image, but the densities are normal in the rest image. The abnormality is said to be transient and connotes stress ischemia. This encoding subsumes two comparisons: the patient's image is compared to a virtual image of what the normal distribution of densities should be (external comparison). This virtual image accommodates normal variations. The stress image is also compared to the rest image (internal comparison).</p><p>In both visual and quantitative analysis the images need to be realigned in some way, at least sufficiently to allow the comparison of equivalent myocardial segments. Classically, this analysis splits into three steps:</p><p>1) centering and reorientation, in order to resample the thoracic image in the geometry of the LV; 2) registering the pair of images by comparing the shapes in different slices; 3) comparison of the images to detect intensity differences. Various steps have been automated in a the following ways.</p><p>• For the centering and reorientation, the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and of those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> define automatic methods to segment the myocardium directly from the transaxial original images, or to define a center and a long axis as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Once the long axis is identified, the other walls are fairly easy to segment in the thoracic geometry and the reorientation is complete. • For the registration, the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, show an automatic method to compute the rigid Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The heart is laying on the diaphragm. The small cube which defines the volume of the heart is extracted from the whole thorax transaxial image reconstructed from the projections. A part of the liver is often included in the extracted cube.</p><p>registration between the stress and rest images using correlation-based techniques. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, the authors also use a correlation-based technique with a stochastic sign change criterion to match the images. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the authors also use correlation techniques to find a nonuniform scaling transformation to match different hearts. A template is built by normalizing and averaging the resampled images. Some more complicated (free-form) transformations may be found with the intensity-based method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. All those methods use the intensity information, which may be problematic since the aim of the myocardial perfusion study is to detect intensity differences that those methods tend to minimize. The aim of the method proposed in this paper is to provide a reproducible, robust, and highly automatic way of comparing the stress and rest perfusion images of the same patient, or images of different patients. To this end, we introduce a robust 3-D matching procedure by which stress and rest images are matched to each other and morphologically aligned to a "template" image of the heart.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. DATA ACQUISITION, RECONSTRUCTION, AND PREPROCESSING</head><p>The acquisition is in tomographic mode, step and shoot, with 32 projections over 180 or 64 over 360 . The image format is 64 64 with size of 6.25 mm 6.25 mm, and an acquisition time of 15-25 s/step. The learning set, consisting of 32 paired stress and rest images were selected from a clinical database to obtain a mixed group of image abnormalities and variations, with a more important proportion of "difficult" cases than an average database should contain in order to test the robustness of the registration algorithm. The method and the parameters were set with this database. An additional set of eight cases (chosen for their disparity in size and shape) were added to the database to make a crude validation of the parameters. The "optimized" algorithm was then tested on 250 cases, selected from the same database on the basis of the availability of angiographic information, or a clinical validation for low probability of coronary artery disease. The images were acquired with both and tracers. A 3-D isometric image was reconstructed from the projection data by filtered back-projection and prealigned manually by an expert and the image is zoomed by a factor of 2-2.5 (linear). This alignment ensures that the center of the image is inside the cavity of the LV and that the direction in the image is parallel to the apico-basal vector (Figs. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). These constraints are crucial for our edge-extraction step, but they are not hard to satisfy. Where necessary and to avoid including other structures or organs such as the liver or the kidneys (which are very close to the heart and which readily fix the radioactive tracer), the image is masked. The mask is an ellipsoid whose three axes can be enlarged or reduced individually, and which can be displaced in the image volume. This mask is centered and sized to cover the myocardium in its entirety and exclude high-density regions adjacent but not belonging to it. Sizing and location is performed under visual control, while the three orthogonal slices intersecting in the center of the ellipsoid are visualized. All voxel values outside the mask are set to zero.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE MORPHOLOGICAL MATCHING METHOD</head><p>The method that we propose splits into two major steps.</p><p>• The stress/rest pair of images is matched using a featurepoints-based method, yielding an affine transformation which defines a correspondence between a point in the stress image and a point in the rest image. • A "template" heart is matched to the stress image using local spline transformations (defined in Section II-B) and both stress and rest images are resampled in its geometry.</p><p>In the method, this template is only defined by its shape. In our experiments, a morphological normal case is chosen as the template (see Section II-A). After this transformation of the images (the output is a new stress/rest pair in a new geometry), the coordinates of a 3-D voxel in any image (stress, rest, template) correspond to the same part of the myocardium and allows quantitative intrapatient and interpatient comparison.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Extraction of Feature Points 1) Edge Detection in a 3-D Polar Map:</head><p>The feature points we want to extract from the image are supposed to feature edges of the heart wall. It would be useless to try to find the precise location of the true limit of the heart wall, since the existence of discrete boundaries of the myocardium in the images is compromised by blurring, due to cardiac and respiratory motion and by the relatively poor spatial resolution of the imaging system. Therefore, the points we are looking for should be a rough, but stable, approximation to the myocardial edges.</p><p>To detect such feature points, we use an algorithm based on the first derivative of the image by detecting the edges with a Canny-Deriche recursive filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> in a particular 3-D polar geometry. The 3-D polar map is defined as the original image resampled in spherical coordinates : in the resampled image and are defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(1)</formula><p>Since the angular sampling is perfomed in 128 steps for and and over 32 steps for , from a 64 64 64 image, a 128 128 32 image is constructed. In this image, the plane contains the central voxel value 128 128 times. Oversampling decreases with increasing values of Since the heart is roughly spherical around the apex and roughly cylindrical around the base, in the 3-D polar map, the myocardium has the shape of an irregular pancake. (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>). The advantage of this transformation lies in the fact that radial sampling can now occur in coordinates: a radius is a segment along the axis and is supposed to cross the myocardial wall orthogonally.</p><p>Extracting edges in this map with a 3-D edge detector provides a smooth definition of edge points. Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows intensity profiles along two different radii.</p><p>Because the mask is sometimes used to hide noncardiac areas, some artificial edges are created, with a very high gradient value (the background noise intensity decreases sharply from roughly 0.1 (normalized value) down to zero in a one-pixel shift). In order to eliminate such artificial extrema, the intensity profile along the radius is modified after the point before the last nonzero intensity point: intensity is set constant after this point. The last nonzero intensity point has a biased value due to partial volume effect and resampling, this is why its value is not used (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref>).  Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Intensity profiles along two different radii starting from the center of the image. The black dots show on both curves the edges detected with the Canny-Deriche filter. Curve 1 shows an ideal situation, the radius crosses a healthy and well contrasted myocardial area. For curve 2, the radius crosses a hypoperfused myocardial area and another "hot" organ, yielding a non cardiac edge. The rays are sampled in any direction but a 15 cone around the apico-basal direction.</p><p>2) Filtering the Edge Points: Some detected edges do not correspond to the heart wall, as shown on the dotted curve in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>: an edge of another organ has been detected. Therefore, a final step is required, using a priori constraints: along a radius, on the intensity profile, the first significant increasing gradient extremum is likely to belong to the endocardium and the first following significant decreasing gradient extremum is likely to belong to the epicardium. Based on this empirical description, we define some constraints to filter incorrect edge points.</p><p>a) Any edge point in a 15 cone around the apico-basal vector is eliminated. This angle value is very low and it is difficult to set correctly for a large database. Such points almost certainly do not belong to the myocardial edge. b) The filling procedure removes gradients along the radii, but it yields gradients orthogonal to the radii. Such extrema are detected on the deepest plane (32) of the polar map (a high radius value, for which we are sure that no cardiac structure is represented). If there is an edge point for , all the neighboring edge points which have the same gradient norm as this one (with a 10% margin due to smoothing during edge detection) are eliminated. Experiments on our database have shown that around 80% of those artificial edge points are removed. c) The remaining points are sorted with respect to the absolute value of the coordinate of the gradient. Thresholding is performed on the contour image in order to eliminate the lowest 20%, and only large connected components are retained (minimum requested size of the component is 500 points). d) An ordering constraint is applied: we insist on configurations fitting our empirical description and reject edges for which we are sure are noncardiac: we reject every edge point after the first descending gradient extremum which is not too close to the center (a minimum radius of five is fixed as a threshold). In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>, different configurations of intensity profiles are listed with the corresponding algorithmic decision. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref> illustrates differents steps of the filtering procedure on a real image. Finally, the points are converted back into cartesian coordinates. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref> shows the results of feature extraction for different hearts. The proportion of good points is satisfying, as the robust matching algorithm is able to cope with remaining outliers.</p><p>3) Special Edges for the Template: As said in introduction, the template is only defined as its shape. The template image is a single selected normal image, characterized by good contrast and low densities on all noncardiac features. The parameters described in the previous paragraph are adapted in an ad-hoc manner to obtain an almost perfect set of points, with no gaps between edge points and no spurious edges. Those edges define the shape we use for the registration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Registration</head><p>Edges are detected in both images (stress and rest, or stress and template). We assume that a first derivative extremum in the first image can be matched with a first derivative extremum in the second image. Because in abnormal cases there are likely to be fewer edge points in the stress image than in the rest image, we defined the transformation which deforms the stress edge points to the rest edge points (matching stress on rest).</p><p>The matching method is an enhancement <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> of the iterative closest point (ICP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, adapted to our problem.  what the function calculates). The criterion is the sum of all residual distances extended to , a subset of the feature points in Image 1 for which the matching is considered as being reliable.</p><p>2) Minimizing the Criterion: The minimization process is iterative, given an initial transformation This initial transformation is chosen in our experiments to be a simple uniform scaling without rotation: assuming that the images to be registered are approximately aligned, it only adjusts the sizes of the objects to be registered (see Section II-B). Each iteration splits into three steps. a) For each point , we calculate and we identify its closest feature point in Image 2. We, therefore, end up with a list of possible matched pairs of points. b) We calculate the residual distance for each pair, and we decide whether a pair is reliable or not: we first eliminate pairs for which the residual distance exceeds a fixed threshold. Second, we compute the mean and the standard deviation attached to the remaining pairs. We then eliminate the points for which the distance is greater than another threshold depending on the distance distribution , where can be easily set using a table <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>). We get for this iteration a list of reliable pairs of matched points. Notice that if a point is not matched in this iteration, it may be matched in one that follows. c) With the filtered list of pairs of points, we calculate which is the best least squares fit for the pairs of points. This new transformation is calculated within a class of acceptable functions (rigid, then affine and, finally, local spline). The iterative process stops when a maximum number of iterations is reached, or when . For further details about this adaptation of the ICP algorithm, for instance about the convergence properties, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>3) Definition of the Closest Point: For each point, the matching function takes its geometric position and the local direction of the intensity gradient into account. Considering two points and and their intensity gradient vectors and , respectively, the distance between them is calculated as follows:</p><p>where is a weighting coefficient.</p><p>This double definition of a point (location direction) refines the matching criterion and makes it more robust for instance in the presence of a crude initialization (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref>).</p><p>4) The Class of Transformations: The least square fit is calculated separately for three volume transformations: a rigid, defined by six parameters, an affine defined by 12 parameters, and a local spline.</p><p>For the local spline, the transformation is a 3-D tensor product of cubic B-splines. If are the coordinates of where we use the following notation (for the coordinate, for instance). of control points in the direction. This controls the accuracy of the approximation (eight in our experiments). Three-dimensional matrix of the control points abscissae. These are the parameters which define the transformation. th B-spline basis function. Its degree is The generate the vector space of piecewise th degree polynomials (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>).</p><p>is then a piecewise th degree polynomial in each variable and . We choose cubic B-splines in our experiments because of their regularity properties. For the knots, we used the classic regular mesh for where and are the boundaries of the definition domain (bounded by the border of the image or the organ).</p><p>In the definition of the criterion, a smoothing energy is added in order to control the regularity of the solution. This energy is expressed as a second-order Tikhonov stabilizer and the same for the other coordinates and This smoothing energy is weighted in the global definition of the least square criterion. A more complete description of the local spline transformation can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The transformation is defined given a number of parameters ( 512 in our experiments).</p><p>As the rigid transformation is a particular affine transformation, the affine transformation itself is a particular local spline transformation, with a special distribution of control points.</p><p>To match the stress to the rest image, the transformation is an affine, the rigid transformation is used as an initialization to the affine, applied serially with ten iterations for each. In the case of the template to stress match, the transformation is a local spline, applied serially with six iterations after the rigid (ten iterations) and affine (ten iterations) transformations.</p><p>5) The Initial Transformation: The images are supposed to be reoriented in an approximately right position. The initial transformation for the ICP is a uniform scaling without rotation, the goal is to crudely adjust the positions and sizes of the lists of points. For that purpose, we define a "size" of the list of points as the medial distance of the points to the centroid of the list of points.</p><p>Lists of points and are extracted from Image 1 and Image 2 from polar centers and The sizes and are computed for and , respectively. We define a transformation which puts in the geometry of (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">12</ref>) so that the registration is processed with ICP on and (the deformed : as and are comparable in sizes and position, they are more likely to match than and Writing the scaling factor as , is defined as so that and the size of be The ICP algorithm is processed on and calculating a transformation . The matching transformation between and is, therefore, defined as , with</p><p>Depending of the type of , is calculated as follows:</p><p>• is rigid or affine: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Resampling the Rest and Stress Images</head><p>After the matching step, we get a transformation from Image 1 to Image 2. With this transformation, it is possible to build an image Image which is Image 2 resampled in the geometry of Image 1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">13</ref>).</p><p>Having computed the transformations from the template geometry to the stress, and from the stress geometo the rest, it is possible to resample the stress image in the geometry of the template, and by composition o , we resample the rest image in geometry of the template after registration on the stress.</p><p>The resampling is a purely geometric transformation, the integral count density information is not preserved. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. First Steps to Automatic 3-D Quantification of Pathologies 1) Two-Dimensional Normalization and Its Limitations:</head><p>The quantification of scintigraphic myocardial perfusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> images is generally based on some form of a polar transformation. In this approach the myocardial densities are sampled from an origin in the center of the cavity, along (evenly spaced) radii.</p><p>In one particular application <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, the 3-D images are sampled along rays or radii (radial sampling), originating in the center of the left ventricular cavity. The maximal intensity along the radii are reported on the 2-D polar image (just as if the 3-D polar image used for the segmentation was projected on the with maximal intensity projection. In this image, central points represent apical locations, peripheral points represent the basal locations. The anterior wall is mapped on top, the inferior wall at the bottom, the septum in the left-hand side of the image. This image is comparable to the bull's eye maps described in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>, except for the fact that the distance from the center represents an elevation in three dimensions, rather than a short axis plane position: the bull's eye map approach interrogates the volume as if it were a set of planes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</p><p>The effect of a polar transform amounts to a normalization of size and shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, since all morphological attributes of the image are reduced to angular coordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. This is also true for the polar component in bull's eye mapping, in which the third axis is divided in a set number of parallel "thick slices" between the apex and the base of the heart. This normalization allows the comparison between target cases and a population of normal cases, and the intercomparison of target cases.</p><p>2) Three-Dimensional Normalization: Having normalized the shape of the LV's, we define 3-D images of mean and standard deviation of the intensity over a normal population. We also define 3-D images of mean and standard deviation of the "rest-stress" difference over the same population. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> for the 2-D polar mapping, we define two normal inferior limit images as the mean image minus two standard deviations (this factor two depends on the number of images used to define the average population).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Matching and Alignment</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14</ref> shows vertical long axis (VLA) slices of the stress and rest images of a normal study (RIDOMPA). From top to bottom, the anterior wall down to the inferior wall. The septum is on the left, the lateral wall is on the right. From left to right, columns 1 and 2 show the original images, the edges are overlaid in white. Columns 3 and 4 show the stress and rest images after matching and alignment on the template, displayed column 5. In the interpretation of the images in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14</ref>-16 one should remember that the edges do not necessarily correspond to iso-density lines. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">15</ref> is organized as Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14</ref>, showing a pathological study (RYALMPA): the LV is affected by a large antero-lateral stress ischemia. In this figure, we can appreciate the robustness of the edge extraction procedure in the stress image with respect to hypoperfusion (curve #2 in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). Despite the fact that the intensity in the ischemic area is low (but not as low as the background noise), it is possible to detect the cardiac edges. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">15</ref> also illustrates the point that the morphological transformation leaves density differences unaffected.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">16</ref> is organized as Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14</ref> and 15, each line show a different study (one slice per image). On the slices, we can appreciate in the left two columns (the original rest and stress images) the differences in sizes and shapes of the patient LV's. In the next two columns, the morphological differences are removed whereas the perfusion information (the intensity level) is conserved. Of course, there is no pointto-point correspondence between slices of same number in the original images and in the realigned images: therefore, a pathological area may appear or disappear in this display because, after matching and resampling, it is located in other slices vicinous to the displayed slice. This artefact is illustrated by the LOJUMPA study (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">16</ref>, line 7), an apical hypoperfused area looks normally perfused in the aligned images.</p><p>As far as an expert can appreciate the result of the matching, 80% of the treated cases give satisfying results: in those cases, the feature points of the template deformed with the matching transformation define a plausible boundary for the LV to an expert eye. For the remaining 20% (which are difficult cases, according to an expert), some parts of the ventricle are not included in the volume or, on the contrary, some noncardiac areas are included in the volume. It appears that these errors are due, first, to some defects in the segmentation (the basis is not well defined, as for patient LEDOMPA, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">16</ref>, line 5) and second, because the local spline function does not deform sufficiently. However on the testing set of 250 cases (a routine database) the success rate was 243/250 (97%). The discrepancy is partially due to a larger prevalence of normal cases, and the fact that aberrant cases were not over represented.</p><p>The average time of the whole treatment (edge extractions matchings resamplings) is roughly 1 min for one study on a DEC Alpha 500 400-MHz workstation. We are currently working on some optimizations of the source code which could reduce the computational time by at least 50%.</p></div>

This surface has been obtained by deforming an isosurface of the template image to the edge points with our method. This closed surface can be a definition of the volume of the LV. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">17</ref> shows 3 different LV's at stress (LOJUMPA, RIDOMPA, and RYALMPA) from two different views. These surfaces were obtained by deforming the surface of the template with the deformation . Some slices of those images are displayed in Figs. <ref type="bibr">14-16.</ref> With this method, it is possible to define a volume of the LV for any SPECT heart image, which is a key-point in cardiac SPECT image quantification and analysis.</p><p>Fig. 17 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Three-Dimensional Quantification of Pathologies</head><p>For the "stress" images and "stress-rest" images populations, we compute both mean and standard deviation images. The size of the population is set to ten, the patients are chosen among the training data set. The target cases can thus be quantitatively compared to these references.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">18</ref> shows a 3-D display of the largest ischemic area of the RYALMPA study using this definition. The 3-D display shows a better representation than the 2-D polar mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, avoiding limitations inherent to the approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. The quantification of pathologies using this procedure is currently under evaluation with the routine database (250 cases).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>We presented an automated method to register and align images from myocardial perfusion SPECT studies. To reconstruct "better" images, feature points are extracted in stress and rest images, the stress and rest points are matched together using an affine transformation (this gives the stress-rest registration) and the stress points are matched with a template using a local spline transformation (which gives the alignment). New images are resampled in the geometry of the template.</p><p>The method has been tested and implemented on a database of 32 stress-rest studies specifically selected to obtain a sample of image variability and abnormalities. An additional set of eight cases was used to check the parameters, giving a first appreciation of the validation of the method.</p><p>In as much as the testing population of 250 can be accepted as representative, and if there is any validity to the visual interpretation of the "goodness" of the match, the method seems indeed to be a reliable morphological normalization method.</p><p>In the future, we will define a clinical validation protocol of the process which will include an experimentation of the  method on a large cohort of patients. The method will be validated by demonstrating that after polar sampling, the standard deviation around the mean of the normal-case stress polar maps is smaller when this registration method is used, than if the alignment is performed by an experienced operator or the alignment which was performed in routine clinical practice prior to the design of this study. In addition, the method will be validated if, while the normal values are clustered closer around the mean, the abnormal cases remain distinct from the normal cases (that is, if the reduction of normal variation does not result in the reduction of the difference between normal and abnormal).</p><p>After having validated the method, in a second step, we will work on a more sophisticated statistical analysis of the quantification of SPECT myocardial images, inspired by the works of Houston et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> or Strother et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> using principal components analysis.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
