Each agent is modeled by a continuous-time linear time-invariant dynamics and the fixed communication topology is described by a digraph. The proposed consensus protocol is composed of two parts: the agent's own state feedback and the relative states between agent and its neighbor agents. Due to the existence of communication noises, the relative states cannot be obtained accurately. To attenuate the noise effect, a time-varying gain vector is applied to the inaccurate relative states. It is proved that: 1) if the communication topology has a spanning tree and every node has at least one parent node, then the proposed protocol can solve the mean square consensus problem if and only if satisfies and ; and all roots of the polynomial whose coefficients are the elements of vector are in the left half complex plane; 2) if the communication topology has a spanning tree and there exists one node without any parent node, then the condition is only sufficient but not necessary; and 3) if the communication topology has no spanning tree, then the proposed protocol cannot solve the mean square consensus problem.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Recently, the distributed consensus of multi-agent systems (MASs) has attracted considerable attention from the control community due to its fundamental role in other coordination applications. However, most existing papers assume that MASs work in an ideal communication environment, i.e., each agent can receive the information accurately. In practice, communication channels are inevitably interfered by stochastic noises. In the literature, there is a growth of interest in designing proper consensus protocols to reduce the noise effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[8]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[3]</ref>, Huang and his collaborators first proposed several stochastic approximation type consensus protocols for first-order integral MASs with communication noises under fixed topologies and switching topologies, respectively. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[5]</ref>, Li and Zhang further investigated these stochastic approximation type protocols and presented the necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring the mean square/almost sure average consensus. Based on these results, Liu and Xie studied the mean square consensus of first-order integral MASs with consideration of both communication noises and communication delays <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[6]</ref>. Hu and Feng also provided some results on the mean square leader-following consensus of first-order integral MASs with communication noises <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[7]</ref>. It is noted that the above papers all concentrate on the study of communication topologies and assume that the agent is modeled by a simple dynamics (single integrator). For a comprehensive understanding on the consensus of MASs with communication noises, the effect of agent's dynamics cannot be neglected. Under this research direction, the consensus problem of second-order integral MASs with communication noises was studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[8]</ref>. Extensions to the sampled-data based MASs with switching communication topologies were made in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[9]</ref>. However, there is still a huge gap between the second-order integral agent and the real-world agent (see a bird-flocking example in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[11]</ref>). To address this problem, many results were published in the literature to study the consensus of general linear multi-agent systems in the noise-free settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[14]</ref>, and it is reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[11]</ref> that these results can find applications in the coordination of multi-vehicle systems. Therefore, it is of great importance to investigate the consensus of general linear multi-agent systems with communication noises.</p><p>Motivated by the above discussions, this note studies the mean square consensus of linear MASs with communication noises. Each agent is modeled by a continuous-time linear time-invariant dynamics, and the communication topology of MASs is modeled by a fixed digraph. The proposed consensus protocol employs the information from two aspects: the agent's own state and the relative states with its neighbor agents. Since the relative states are interfered by communication noises, a stochastic-approximation type gain vector is applied to attenuate noise effects, which results in a time-varying stochastic dynamical system. By obtaining the solution to this particular system, it is found that: 1) if the communication topology has a spanning tree and every node has at least one parent node, then the proposed protocol can solve the mean square consensus problem if and only if satisfies and ; and all roots of the polynomial whose coefficients are the elements of vector are in the left half complex plane; 2) if the topology has a spanning tree and there exists one node without any parent node, then the condition is only sufficient but not necessary; and 3) if the topology has no spanning tree, then the proposed protocol cannot solve the mean square consensus problem. This paper is an extension to the previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[8]</ref>. The main improvements lie in that: 1) the agent is modeled by the general linear time-invariant dynamics which includes the second-order integral dynamics considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[8]</ref> as its special case; 2) the consensus protocol is designed in a novel way which cannot be obtained directly from the one proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[8]</ref>; and 3) although some analysis ideas follow the one proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[8]</ref>, the proof here is much more sophisticated.</p><p>The following notations are used throughout this note: ; ; denotes the dimensional identity matrix; denotes the zero matrix with rows and columns; denotes the Kronecker operator; denotes the differential operator with respect to time; denotes the field of complex numbers; denotes the set of natural numbers. For a given variable , denotes the real part of . For a given matrix , denotes its transpose; denotes its determinant. denotes a block diagonal matrix formed by its inputs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. MAIN RESULTS</head><p>In this note, the following protocol is proposed to solve the mean square consensus problem:</p><p>(2) where , , are control parameters to be determined, and , namely the consensus gain, is a piecewise continuous function.</p><p>Substituting (2) into (1) obtains that</p><p>where . Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">3</ref>) can be rewritten in the following form: <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(4)</ref> where , .</p><p>According to the theory of Itô stochastic differential equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[17]</ref>, (4) can also be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(5)</ref> where is an -dimensional standard Brownian motion, and . Before further discussions, the following polynomial whose coefficients are the elements of is introduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(6)</ref> Let be the roots of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(6)</ref>. Without loss of generality, it is assumed that ( , , ), and . It is noted that these roots are solely determined by the control parameters . By choosing properly, they can be placed at any point in the complex plane.</p><p>The following lemma solves a linear time-varying differential equation and gives the limit property of its transition matrix, which is the basis of the convergence analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(5)</ref>.</p><p>Lemma 3: Consider the following linear time-varying differential equation: <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(7)</ref> where , , , and and and If , then can be explicitly determined.

If , has a negative real part, and all roots of the polynomial defined by ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) are in the left half complex plane, then . Proof: See it in the Appendix. Based on the above lemma, the following part analyzes the consensus-solving capability of the proposed protocol under different topology conditions.</p><p>Theorem 1: Assume that the communication topology has a spanning tree and every node has at least one parent node. The proposed protocol defined by (2) can solve the mean square consensus of any linear MASs defined by (1) if and only if the following three conditions hold: C1) ; C2)</p><p>; C3) all roots of the polynomial defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(6)</ref>  </p><p>It is noted that where ( ) is defined in Lemma 3. Then the state transition matrix of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">8</ref>) is <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(9)</ref> where is the state transition matrix of the linear system ( ), and ( ) is the state transition matrix of the differential equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(7)</ref> with and . Since , the eigenvalues of are . Then, there exists a matrix with the first column being such that is the Jordan canonical form of . It can also be calculated that the first row of is . If Condition C3) holds, by the knowledge of the linear differential equation, it can be obtained that <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(10)</ref> According to Lemma 3, if Conditions C1) and C3) hold, it can be obtained that ( ). Then,</p><p>By Itô integral formula, (5) can be solved as follows:</p><p>If Conditions C1) and C3) hold, by the proof of Lemma 3, all entries in are uniformly bounded functions. If Condition C2) holds, by Cauchy's Criterion, is proved to be convergent in mean square to a random vector (see a similar proof in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[8]</ref>). By Corollary 4.2.5 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[18]</ref> By <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(10)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(11)</ref>, it follows that and . Hence, is jointly determined by the agents' initial states and the communication topology graph. By the analysis given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[8]</ref>, it can be similarly proved that Then it can be calculated that , , and (</p><p>). Therefore, it can be obtained that (</p><p>). This means that the proposed protocol defined by (2) can solve the distributed mean square consensus problem of linear MASs.</p><p>Necessity: Firstly, let be any nonzero eigenvalue of and be the left eigenvector associated with . Then . Multiplying at both sides of (5) leads to , where . Then</p><p>If the proposed protocol can solve the mean square consensus problem, then . However, if , then , , which causes the contradiction. Hence, Condition (1) is necessary.</p><p>Second, let where is the left eigenvector of associated with the zero eigenvalue. By <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(5)</ref>, it follows that . Then . If the proposed protocol can solve the mean square consensus problem, then there exists a random variable with finite second-order moment such that . From the other side,</p><p>Because the topology has a spanning tree and every node has one parent node, there must exist at least two nodes and such that nodes and belong to the strongly connected component of in whom there is no edge terminated. Then there exist at least two other nodes and such that and . In addition, by Lemma 2, it follows that . In this case, if , then , which contradicts that has an finite second-order moment. Therefore, Condition C2) is necessary.</p><p>Finally, if some roots of ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) are not in the left half plane, then they can only be at the following places: the origin; the imaginary axis; and the right half plane. It is noted that the eigenvalue set of is a combination of zero and the roots of polynomial <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(6)</ref>. If polynomial (6) has zero roots, the zero eigenvalue of has the different geometric multiplicity and algebraic multiplicity because of . Therefore, if <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(6)</ref> has zero roots or roots in the right half plane, according to the Lyapunov direct method, there exists at least one initial state such that the corresponding solution is unbounded. If <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(6)</ref> has conjugate imaginary roots, by the knowledge of linear systems, there exists at least one initial state such that the corresponding solution is a periodical function (a combination of sine functions and cosine functions). If the proposed consensus protocol can solve the mean square consensus problem, then for any , , where . From the other side, let . Then by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(12)</ref>, it follows that This implies that is oscillatory with certain initial state, which contradicts , . Therefore, Condition C3) is necessary. Remark 1: In the noise-free case, ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">12</ref>) becomes . Then, by the proof of Theorem 1, the linear MAS reaches a consensus on the vector When the communication noises exist, Theorem 1 shows that this consensus value cannot be deterministically reached. However, it can still be "unbiasedly estimated" by the proposed protocol after several trials because the linear MAS reaches a mean square consensus on the random vector whose mathematical expectation is exactly .</p><p>Corollary 1: If the communication topology has a spanning tree and there exists one node without any parent node, then Conditions C1), C2), and C3) are still sufficient for ensuring that the proposed protocol can solve the mean square consensus problem. In addition, the necessities of Conditions C1) and C3) hold as well. However, Condition C2) is not necessary.</p><p>Proof: The first part can be directly obtained by the proof of Theorem 1.</p><p>To show that Condition C2) is not necessary, one counter example is given as follows. Consider a network composed of two double-integrator agents ( and in (1)). Let the weighted adjacency matrix be and . The noise intensity is set to be . Let and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(2)</ref>. Then which does not satisfy Condition C2). However, the state transition matrix of this closed-loop multi-agent system can be calculated by Lemma 3 that , , , . Then : , , , and the other elements of are all 0. By L' Hopital law, it can be calculated that . According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(12)</ref> and the proof of Theorem 1, it can be obtained that the states of both agents are convergent in mean square to the same random vector with , and . This implies that the mean square consensus can still be achieved.</p><p>Theorem 2: If has no spanning tree, then the proposed protocol cannot solve the mean square consensus problem of linear MASs.</p><p>Proof: If has no spanning tree, by Lemma 1, it follows that the zero eigenvalue of has at least two different left eigenvectors and such that . Let and . If the proposed protocol can solve the mean square consensus problem, then However, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(5)</ref>,</p><p>. Then , which leads to . In the same way, we can prove that . Therefore, must hold, which contradicts . Hence, the proposed protocol cannot solve the mean square consensus problem.</p><p>In the following part, a simulation example is given to test the proposed protocol. The linear MAS is composed of four agents described by the third-order integral dynamics. The weighted adjacency matrix of the communication topology graph is set as: and all other entries are zero. All noise intensities are 1. The initial state of each agent is set as: , , and . and in the consensus protocol are set as: . According to Theorem 1, states of all agents can reach a mean square consensus. The simulation result is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, which validates the theoretical analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSION</head><p>This note considers the mean square consensus of linear multi-agent systems with communication noises and fixed topologies. The contributions of this note lie in that 1) the dynamics of agents is described by a continuous-time linear time-invariant system rather than a firstorder/second-order integral dynamics; 2) a novel distributed consensus protocol is proposed to attenuate the effect of noises based on a timevarying consensus gain; and 3) the capability of the proposed protocol on solving the mean square consensus problem is theoretically guaranteed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chao Huang and Xudong Ye</head><p>Abstract-In this note, the cooperative output regulation problem of heterogeneous linear multi-agent systems is investigated. Our approach is based on internal model and dynamic error feedback among the agents. Under some standard assumptions, the problem is solved by an internal model and a stabilizing controller. We showed that the exo-signal-free system is stabilized if each controlled agent is robust (in the sense of norm) to resist the disturbance measured by the second largest eigenvalue of the graph adjacency matrix. Then the synthesis problem is solved using algebraic Riccati equation. Furthermore, we showed that this condition is a generalization of existing results.</p><p>Index Terms-Cooperative control, control, multi-agent systems, output regulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Coordination of multi-agent systems has been a hot topic of research over the past decades due to its broad applications in physics, biology, engineering, etc. Fruitful achievement has been made in areas such as consensus <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[11]</ref>; formation control of multi-vehicles, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref>; distributed control of multiple robotics, etc. The key point of such problem is that, in order to accomplish complicated tasks or reach common goals, groups of dynamic agents need to interact with each other and eventually reach an agreement on certain quantities of interest. As a powerful tool in handling such problems, cooperative output regulation of multi-agent systems has attracted broad attention among control groups, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>.</p><p>It is well known that there are generally two types of philosophy in tackling output regulation problem in the linear case: the feedforward control and the internal model principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[5]</ref>. The feedforward control technique, employed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[16]</ref>-[19], requires a feedback gain to make the closed-loop system matrix Hurwitz, and a feedforward gain to drive trajectories of the closed-loop system toward a subspace that renders the regulated output zero. The feedforward gain, as a linear function of the solution of the regulator equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(1)</ref> where all plant parameters here are defined in the next section, is dependent on these parameters. As a result, the desired feedforward control has to vary as plant parameters vary. Besides, this method involves introducing a "distributed observer" to asymptotically estimate the state of the exo-system for the agents, thus full state measurement of the exo-system is required in such a framework.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
