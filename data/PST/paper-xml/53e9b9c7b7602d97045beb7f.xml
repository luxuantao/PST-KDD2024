<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper is concerned with the robust control problem of linear fractional representation (LFT) uncertain systems depending on a time-varying parameter uncertainty. Our main result exploits a linear matrix inequality (LMI) characterization involving scalings and Lyapunov variables subject to an additional essentially nonconvex algebraic constraint. The nonconvexity enters the problem in the form of a rank deficiency condition or matrix inverse relation on the scalings only. It is shown that such problems, but also more generally rank inequalities and bilinear constraints, can be formulated as the minimization of a concave functional subject to LMI constraints. First of all, a local Frank and Wolfe (FW) feasible direction algorithm is introduced in this context to tackle this hard optimization problem. Exploiting the attractive concavity structure of the problem, several efficient global concave programming methods are then introduced and combined with the local feasible direction method to secure and certify global optimality of the solutions. Computational experiments indicate the viability of our algorithms, and in the worst case, they require the solution of a few LMI programs.</p></div>

A closely related algorithm, referred to as the cone complementary linearization algorithm is elaborated in <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[11]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[25]</ref>, we developed a global optimization technique based on difference of convex functions/sets (DC) optimization techniques exploiting the fact that the reverse convex constraints are of relatively low rank, which is of primary importance to ensure practicality of the algorithm. The contribution of this paper is twofold.</p><p>â€¢ It is first shown that several important problems in robust control theory that involve bilinear constraints, equality and inequality rank constraints, or matrix inverse constraints, can be recast as finding zero optimal solutions to generalized concave programs. These generalized concave programs consist in the minimization of a concave functional subject to convex constraints consisting of LMI's. A distinguished characteristic of these problems is that only zero solutions are of interest, which significantly reduces the difficulty of the search and thus makes the problems much more computationally attractive and painless than the conventional concave programs that seek an arbitrary minimum of a concave function over a convex set. A sample list of control applications of this new formulation includes robust control and robust multiobjective problems based on any kind of scalings or multipliers, robust fixed-or reduced-order control problems, multiobjective linear parameter-varying (LPV) control, reduction of linear fractional transformation (LFT) representations and, more generally, combinations of such problems. Starting from this viewpoint, the work here provides first a full generalization of the technique in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[11]</ref> to handle robust control problems for plants subject to time-varying LFT uncertainties. More precisely, we show that the robust synthesis problems involving either pairs of symmetric and skew-symmetric scalings or full generalized scalings as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[22]</ref> are equivalent to zero-seeking concave programming problems in which the convex constraints express in terms of LMI's. Although, this is not the central object of this paper, we reveal that bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) problems can also be formulated in the same fashion, so that in this respect, concavity appears to be the most prominent feature of a vast array of problems in control theory.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[27]</ref>, we have exploited several key basic concepts for developing efficient and practical algorithms suitably generalized to the matrix context of our problems. Namely, we have paid special attention to developing extensions of the simplicial and conical branch and bound (BB) concave minimization methods that work with matrices and over the positive semidefinite cone. These methods, respectively, divide the feasible set into matrix simplices and matrix cones of decreasing sizes. Their main thrust is that they rely heavily on our specific matrix structures and on concavity and convexity geometric concepts that make them particularly appropriate for our problems. Therefore, an important target of this paper is to maintain a reasonable computational cost by combining local and global techniques. Hence, the global concave programming techniques are used either to refine a local solution issued from the FW algorithm until global optimality is achieved or to provide a certificate of global optimality. Because of space limitation, details on algorithms and experiments can be found in an extended version <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>.</p><p>The following definitions and notations are used throughout the paper. For Hermitian or symmetric matrices, M &gt; N means that M 0N is positive definite and M N means that M 0N is positive semidefinite. The notation cofp1; 1 11;pLg stands for the convex hull. The notation j(P) is used to denote the set of vertices of a polyhedron P . In long matrix expressions, the symbol ? replaces terms induced by symmetry. Finally, in algorithm descriptions, the notation X k is used to designate the kth iterate of the variable X. The notations int S and @S are used for the relative interior and the boundary of the set S.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROBLEM PRESENTATION AND MOTIVATIONS</head><p>This section provides a brief review of a basic result that will be exploited throughout the paper. We are concerned with the robust control problem of an uncertain plant subject to LFT uncertainty. In other words, the uncertain plant is described as </p><p>where 1(t) is a time-varying matrix-valued parameter and is usually assumed to have a block-diagonal structure in the form 1(t) = diag(1 1 1; i (t)I; 111 ; 1 j (t); 11 1) 2 R R R N2N</p><p>(2)</p><p>and normalized such that 1(t) T 1(t) I; t 0:</p><p>(3)</p><p>Blocks denoted iI and 1j are generally referred to as repeated-scalar and full blocks according to the analysis and synthesis literature <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. Hereafter, we are using the following notation: u for the control signal, w for exogenous inputs, z for controlled or performance variables, and y for the measurement signal.</p><p>For the uncertain plant (1)-( <ref type="formula">3</ref>), the robust control problem consists in seeking a linear time-invariant (LTI) controller</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">_ x K = A K x K + B K y u = CKxK + DKy (4)</formula><p>such that</p><p>â€¢ closed-loop system (1)-( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) is internally stable;</p><p>â€¢ L 2 -induced gain of the operator connecting w to z is bounded by ; for all parameter trajectories 1(t) defined by <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref>.</p><p>The characterization of the solutions to the robust control problem for LFT plants requires the definitions of scaling sets compatible with the parameter structure given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(2)</ref>. Denoting this structure as 1, the following scaling sets can be introduced. The set of symmetric scalings associated with the parameter structure 1 is defined as S 1 := S: S T = S; S1 = 1S; 8 1 with structure 1 :</p><p>Similarly, the set of skew-symmetric scalings associated with the parameter structure 1 is defined as T 1 := T : T T = 0T; T 1 = 1 T T; 8 1 with structure 1 :</p><p>Equivalently, it is easily verified that, with S &gt; 0, the uncertain matrix 1 satisfies the quadratic constraints 1 (</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">)<label>5</label></formula><p>With the above definitions and notations in mind, it is now well known that such problems can be handled via a suitable generalization of the Bounded Real Lemma <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[19]</ref>, which expresses as the existence of a Lyapunov matrix X c`&gt; 0 and scalings S and T such as that shown in the equation at the bottom of the page, where the state-space data A c`; B c`; C c`, and D c`d etermine the closed-loop system (1)-( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) with the loop w 1 = 1(t)z 1 open.</p><p>Then, using the Projection Lemma <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref> as the basic tool for reducing nonconvex terms and variables the following algebraically constrained LMI characterization for the solvability of the problem can be established.</p><p>Theorem 2.1: Consider the LFT plant governed by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>)</p><p>with 1 assuming a block-diagonal structure as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(2)</ref>. Let N X and NY denote any bases of the null spaces of [C2; D21; D21; 0] and [B T 2 ; D T 12 ; D T 12 ; 0], respectively. Then, a controller exists such that the (scaled) Bounded Real Lemma conditions hold for some L 2 gain performance if and only if pairs of symmetric matrices (X; Y ); (S; 6), and a pair of skew-symmetric matrices (T; 0) exist such that the structural constraints S; 6 2 S 1 and T; 0 2 T 1 <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref> hold and the matrix inequalities as shown in ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">10</ref> Note that because of the algebraic constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(11)</ref>, the problem under consideration is nonconvex and has been even shown to be NP-hard. See <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> and the references therein. This feature is in stark contrast with the associated linear parameter-varying control problem for which the LMI constraints ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) are the same, but the nonlinear conditions (11) fully disappears.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. RANK CONSTRAINTS, BMI'S, AND CONCAVE PROGRAMS</head><p>For tractability reasons, it is interesting to find alternate formulations that are amenable to numerical computations. A potential technique A T c`Xc`+ X c`Ac`? was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[11]</ref> and amounts to constructing a nonlinear functional whose feasible optimal points satisfy the algebraic constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(11)</ref>. Hereafter, we develop different extensions of this technique that is applicable to structured -scalings <ref type="bibr">(5)</ref>, to full-block generalized scalings as considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[22]</ref>, but also more importantly to bilinearly constrained LMI problems. We begin the presentation by a more general result that reveals the close connections between BMI's, rank constrained LMI problems, and concave programming. Hereafter, we shall use L; R; W to denote a subset of matrix variables that are involved in LMI constraints. Lemma 3.1-Concave Representation: Let C be a matrix with minimal rank factorization of rank r, that is, C = UV T , where the column dimension of U is r, and let L; R, and W be matrices of suitable dimensions, where without loss of generality it is assumed that W 2 R R R l2c</p><p>with l c.</p><p>The bilinear constraint</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">W = LCR (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>is equivalent to the existence of a symmetric (slack) matrix Z satisfying the following LMI</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Z := Z1 Z3 Z T 3 Z 2 ; Z1 Z3 W T R T V Z T 3 Z2 U T L T I W LU I 0 V T R I 0 I 0 (13)</formula><p>with the additional Schur complement constraint</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Tr Z 1 0 Z 3 Z 01 2 Z T 3 = 0:<label>(14)</label></formula><p>Moreover, the trace function in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">14</ref>) is over the cone of semidefinite and bounded below by zero.

We infer by a Schur complement argument with respect to the identity term in the inequality (13) that W LU V T R I r N = 0: Because N , however, is a full rank matrix, we deduce that The concavity of the trace function in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">14</ref>) is easily seen by looking at its hypograph.

These problems, however, exhibit a high degree of nonconvex dimensionality and consequently are generally harder to solve than the problems investigated in this paper. Important advantages lie in the simplicity of this new formulation, but also in the fact that matrix structures are preserved in the concave program. This is an important factor for efficient implementation of algorithms that we shall consider in the sequel. Because of the special properties of concave programs, it is possible to develop algorithms local or global that take advantage of the problem properties to enhance efficiency. A discussion on concave programs is provided in Sections IV and V. Before going further, we would like to note that feasibility problems involving LMI's and rank inequalities can be handled in the same fashion. The Then, any feasible point to Pb1 that further satisfies</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">LMI[1]: N T X A T X + XA XB 1 + C T 1 T T XB 1 C T 1 S C T 1 B T 1 X + T C1 0S + T D11 + D T 11 T T T D11 D T 11 S D T 11 B T 1 X D T 11 T T 0I D T 11 S D T 11 SC1 SD11 SD11 0S 0 C 1 D 11 D 11 0 0I N X &lt; 0 (7) LMI[2]: N T Y AY + Y A T Y C T 1 + B 1 0 T Y C T 1 B 1 6 B 1 C 1 Y + 0B T 1 06 + 0D T</formula><p>Tr Z 1 0 Z 3 Z 01</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">2 Z T 3 = 0 (<label>18</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><p>is optimal and is a solution to the problem described in Theorem 2.1 and conversely. Note that without loss of generality, it can be assumed that the matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Z := Z 1 Z 3 Z T 3 Z 2</formula><p>has a structure conformable with that of the particular block-diagonal structure of the scalings. This simple observation reduces the number of "nonconvex variables" Z1; Z2, and Z3 and avoids a wasteful search in an unduly large space. The number of nonconvex variables is also reduced when some subblocks T i and 0 i in the skew-symmetric matrices T and 0 vanish. This is the case in which the corresponding 1i in 1 is scalar or is considered as a complex block. In such case, we can remove this block from both LMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(17)</ref> and the objective functional One advantage of the formulation of the problem as in Corollary 3.2 is that we completely get rid of the hard set constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(11)</ref> and the nonconvexity is reflected in the functional to be optimized. A central target of this paper is to point out and discuss adequate algorithms for solving this class of problems. Before going into the details of the algorithm, we must stress that the proposed concave reformulations apply with the same degree of simplicity to other classes of scalings, such as the full block scalings introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[23]</ref>, and to dynamic scalings or multipliers, hence, providing a complete concave formulation of the -synthesis problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. A LOCAL SEARCH: FRANK AND WOLFE ALGORITHM</head><p>In this section, we discuss a Frank and Wolfe algorithm for finding solutions to the Problem Pb1 in Corollary 3.2. Analogous algorithms can be derived in the context of any of the control problems mentioned previously. Such algorithms are of local nature in the sense that they cannot guarantee global optimality, but have proven very efficient in practice <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Consider the minimization problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">minimize f(Z) subject to Z 2 X (<label>20</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>where the function f has continuous first-order partial derivatives on X and is bounded below on the matrix set X , a convex subset of the space of symmetric matrices. The general algorithm of Frank and Wolfe (FW) <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> can be detailed as follows. </p><p>Interestingly, the concavity of the objective function ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) yields the following benefits in the implementation of FW.</p><p>â€¢ The line search can be completely bypassed because k 2 f0; 1g.</p><p>Thus, we can perform a full step size of length one (Z k+1 = D k ), hence, reducing the overall computational overhead.</p><p>â€¢ As f(Z)0f(Z k ) Tr(rf(Z k )(Z0Z k )); 8 Z 2 X, it can be shown that the algorithm generates strictly decreasing sequences (f(Z k+1 ) &lt; f(Z k )) that can only terminate to a point satisfying the minimum principle local optimality conditions. For the problem examined in this paper, the gradients are given as subject to LMI[i] &lt; 0; i = 1; 2; 3; 4; LMI <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> 0:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">G 1 := @J @Z1 = I G 2 := @J @Z2 = Z k 2 01 Z k 3 T Z k 3 Z k</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. GLOBAL CONCAVE PROGRAMMING-BASED METHODS</head><p>Concave programming constitutes a class of well-developed methods in global optimization whose foundations were mostly layed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[26]</ref>. It offers a wealth of practically efficient techniques for solving difficult problems that seem, however, to have been overlooked by the control community. Reasons for this disinterest lie in the fact that most successfully developed concave programming algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[27]</ref> deal with (linear) polytopic constraints, thus having a finite number of extreme points, and are restricted to the usual vector space R R R n . In this section, we shall show that several important basic concepts of concave programming carry over matrix spaces and the positive semidefinite cone of symmetric matrices and that these generalizations can be exploited to handle our problems. The discussion here is deliberately very short and avoids the abstract convergence theory that can be found in textbooks. The reader is referred to the recent book of Tuy <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[27]</ref> for further details on concave programming.</p><p>Return to the problem of checking whether there exists Z 3 2 X = f(Z 1 ; Z 2 ; Z 3 ): 9(X; Y; S; T; 6; 0) s.t. LMI[i] &lt; 0; i = 1; 1 11; 4; LMI <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> 0g</p><p>satisfying f(Z 3 ) = 0, where f(Z) := Tr(Z1 0 Z3Z 01 2 Z T 3 ) is concave. Such a Z 3 when it exists will be called a zero of f. It is important to note that because f satisfies f(Z) 0; 8Z 2 X, any zero of f is also a global optimal solution of (20), and consequently, our problem is much more computationally attractive than conventional concave programs in which minimal values of the cost function are unknown. In the methods presented hereafter, we can stop the search as soon as either such a zero is found, in which case global optimality is ensured, or the minimum cost value is strictly positive, in which case our problem has no solution.</p><p>In view of the recent developments in global optimization, it seems that a BB method is the most suitable for our global search. Our intention in the present work is to maximally exploit the structure and properties of the problem to make our search algorithms much more efficient than general BB schemes. The overall scheme is as follows.</p><p>1) Branching: The function f is not only concave in (Z1; Z2; Z3), but it is also linear in Z 1 with (Z 2 ; Z 3 ) held fixed; i.e., only (Z 2 ; Z 3 ) are the "complicating" variables, responsible for the noncon- vexity/hardness of the problem. The global search thus is concentrated on the reduced-dimensional space Z of variables (Z 2 ; Z 3 ). Accordingly, the feasible set can be interpreted as the projection of the convex set defined by the LMI's ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) on the space Z. This space is partitioned into finitely many matrix polyhedrons of the same kind (simplices, cones, etc.). At each iteration, a partition polyhedron M is selected and subdivided further into several subpolyhedrons according to a specified rule.</p><p>2) Bounding: With the branching strategy determined and given a partition set M , the convexity of X , the concavity of f and its linearity in Z 1 are further exploited in the search of a zero of over 2 Z 3 ) 2</p><p>M . This is carried out through computing a lower bound (M) of f on M by a convex program such that (M) (M) := infff (Z 1 ; Z 2 ; Z 3 ): (Z 1 ; Z 2 ; Z 3 ) 2 X; (Z 2 ; Z 3 ) 2 M g: <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(23)</ref> Clearly, the partition sets M with (M) &gt; 0 cannot contain any zero of f and therefore are discarded from further consideration. On the other hand, the partition set with smallest (M) &lt; 0 can be considered the most promising one. To concentrate further investigation on this set, we subdivide it into more refined subsets. With a given tolerance &gt; 0, the stop criterion of the BB algorithm is min M (M) :</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">(24)</formula><p>3) Stopping Rule: The branching operation is devised for speeding the convergence. The optimal solution Z(M) of the problem for com- puting (M) is used for the stopping test developed above to reduce the time of global search.</p><p>Based on the kind of polyhedrons used in branching, we develop two different BB algorithms called the simplicial and conical algorithms, which use different characterizations of concave functionals. As we may see, each of them has its own advantage depending on the more specific structure of the objective f(Z). It is important to mention that all branching and bounding operations must be developed consistently to secure global convergence of the search to a global solution. Global convergence is often a delicate issue in BB techniques. Proofs are provided in <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Simplicial Algorithm</head><p>In the simplicial algorithm, the space Z is partitioned into simplices. From now on, N will denote the dimension of Z. For every simplex M with vertices u 1 ; u 2 ; 1 11;u N +1 in Z, the affine function M (Z) defined for every Z 1 and x = (Z 2 ; Z 3 ) = N +1 i=1 i u i ; i 0; </p><p>Of course, we can use the optimal solution Z1(M) and !(M) = N +1</p><p>i=1 i (M )u i of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">26</ref>) for updating the best current value (upper bound).

Z2 + I with Z2 0 instead of Z2 &gt; 0.</p><p>As a consequence, problem Pb1 can be reduced to minimizing the objective function f(Z 2 ; Z 3 ) = L 0 Tr Z 3 (Z 2 + I) 01 Z T 3</p><p>and LMI's ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) are changed accordingly using the substitution Z 2 ! Z 2 + I. The function f in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_21">27</ref>) is concave in the cone C m + 2 C m , where C m + is the cone of nonnegative definite matrices with the same structure as Z2 and C m is the space of symmetric matrices having the same structure as Z 3 . It is sufficient to take Z as a large enough finite family of canonical cones approximating C m + 2 C m with some tolerance. Perhaps, the most essential property of a concave function f is that its level sets C0 = fZ = (Z2; Z3) 2 Z: f(Z) 0g are convex, and therefore, an alternative formulation of our problem is to find Z 2 XnintC 0 or else prove that X int C 0 , where both X; C 0 are convex sets.</p><p>All of these facts are taken into account in the following search based on the so-called concavity cut or Tuy cut <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[26]</ref>. In what follows, by a cone, we mean a cone with vertex at zero and exactly N edges.</p><p>Consider an initial family P0 of cones covering Z and with pairwise disjoint interiors. For each initial cone in P 0 , take a fixed hyperplane cutting all its edges. Then, the intersection of each subcone of this initial cone with the above-mentioned hyperplane is a simplex with N vertices and called the base of the subcone. Let M be a cone with base [u 1 ; u 2 ; 1 11;u N ]. Because f(0) = L &gt; 0, we have 0 2 int C 0 , and by the convexity of C0, the ray from zero through u i meets the boundary of C0 at a unique point u i = iu i with i &gt; 0 determined by i = sup &gt; 0: f u i 0 :</p><p>(28)</p><p>Then, because the convex set C 0 is closed, u i 2 C 0 and co 0; u i ; i = 1; 2; 1 11;N C 0 : i) (M ) &lt; 1: Then it easily follows that M \X int C 0 ; i.e., no zero optimal solution in M \X exists and so M can be discarded from further consideration.</p><p>ii) !(M) 2 XnintC0 [i.e., f (!(M)) = 0]: Then, we have ob- tained a zero optimal solution.</p><p>iii) (M ) 1 and !(M) 2 C 0 : In this case, !(M) does not lie on any edge of M [so that the subdivision of M by the ray through !(M) is possible]. Indeed, if !(M) lies on some edge u i of M , then we must have !(M) = (M )u i = (M ) i u i with (M )i &gt; i and f ((M)iu i ) = f (!(M)) 0, which contradicts the definition (28) for i .</p><p>Actually, (M ) is not a lower bound for f (x) on M \ X, but because of the above property, 1 0 (M ) plays essentially the same role as a lower bound for eliminating portions of the constraint set. Therefore, with cone partitioning via the ray through a point in its simplex base defined according to the normal subdivision rule, the conical algorithm can be described. Its convergence proof is similar to that of the simplicial algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Tradeoff of Two Global Searches</head><p>Clearly, by concentrating the search on the boundary of the feasible set, the conical algorithm better exploits fact that the global minimum is attained at an extreme point and therefore is more efficient than the simplicial algorithm in the case of problem Pb.1.</p><p>The simplicial algorithm, however, is convenient for exploiting the partial linearity of the objective. For instance, in the case in which all skew-symmetric matrices T and 0 vanish, the objective for <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(19)</ref>   which means that it is concave in 6 and linear in S. The simplicial algorithm can then be applied directly, with branching operations in the reduced 6-space as previously. Thus, in this case, the simplicial algorithm might be preferred.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS</head><p>Because of space limitation, details on algorithms and experiments are provided in the extended version of the paper <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Here is a brief summary of our observations. As mentioned in Section I, the overall algorithm can be detailed as follows. The FW algorithm is computationally cheaper than simplicial and conical global techniques and, hence, is used first to find a good suboptimal value . Then, the simplicial/conical algorithms are employed to further reduce , or to certify global optimality. In realistic and randomly generated examples, the FW algorithm is able to locate a suboptimal solution, up to 8% of the global optimal value, after only a few iterations. The simplicial/con-ical algorithms starting from this good initial guess find a global optimal solution very quickly, less than five iterations when the problem is feasible. For infeasible problems, they obtain a positive lower bound of Pb.1 after less than ten iterations. It is also important to emphasize that, for feasible , the use of stopping criteria (see <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>) substantially reduces the computational cost because only an approximate solution is required for termination. This fact and the power of simplicial/conical techniques explains why so few iterations (LMI runs) are needed and thus the relatively cheap cost of our global algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS</head><p>In this paper, we show that many important problems in robust control theory can be formulated as the minimization of a concave functional over a convex set determined by LMI constraints. In this respect, concavity appears to play a central role in a broad class of problems. This is the departure point that motivates the development of a comprehensive technique that provides a global solution of robust control problems admitting scaling-based characterizations. Although we do not pursue the vein further, it appears that the technique is applicable with only modest changes to many other difficult problems encompassing fixed-order robust control, multiobjective LPV control, and any aggregation of these problems. We also derive new results, interesting in their own, which clarify the equivalence between BMI's, rank-constrained LMI problems, and zero-seeking concave programs. Extensive numerical experiments indicate that the algorithms behave well as theoretically expected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The problem of constructing control algorithms that allow us to handle time delays is an important issue in system theory. It is a key issue in process control. In fact, time-delay systems can be used to model a large number of phenomena occurring, for example, in engineering <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[17]</ref>, and biology <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Dead-time compensation methods are available in the literature for linear systems modeled by a transfer function. These methods have been motivated by the pioneering work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[18]</ref>, in which the wellknown Smith predictor is developed. The control of linear time-delay systems represented in state-space form has also been addressed since the early 1970's by considering the input-output decoupling problem <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[19]</ref>. In the same manner, the disturbance decoupling problem (DDP) for time-delay systems has been treated using the geometric approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[21]</ref>. At the same time, the stability and stabilization of linear time-delay systems has been studied using Lyapunov-like functions <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Only very recently has the control of time-delay nonlinear systems been considered. In <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[11]</ref>, a Smith predictor is used to control nonlinear chemical processes with an input time delay. Despite these contributions, a general theory for nonlinear time-delay systems remains to be developed.</p><p>In this paper, the DDP for a class of single-input-single-output (SISO) nonlinear systems with multiple delays in the input and the state is tackled. The contributions of the paper are as follows:</p><p>â€¢ pioneering mathematical frame for time-delay nonlinear systems whose viability is shown for solving control problems, such as disturbance decoupling; â€¢ classification of various causal compensators (static and dynamic); â€¢ necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the DDP by so-called bicausal compensators; â€¢ introduction of geometric concepts that are claimed to embody the insight of the structure of time-delay nonlinear systems. This paper is organized as follows. The notations and basic assumptions on the time-delay systems under investigation are stated in Section II as well as some preliminary definitions related to their inherent structure. Section III is devoted to the classification of various causal compensators. In Section IV, the DDP is stated. In Section V (respectively, Section VI), pure shift dynamic solutions (respectively, dynamic solutions) are given to the problem. Finally, some conclusions are presented in Section VII.</p></div>
