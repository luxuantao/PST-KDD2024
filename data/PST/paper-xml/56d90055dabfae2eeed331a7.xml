			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Accurate and timely traffic flow prediction is crucial to proactive traffic management and control in datadriven intelligent transportation systems (D 2 ITS), which has attracted great research interest in the last few years. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Weighted K-Nearest Neighbor model, named STW-KNN, in a general MapReduce framework of distributed modeling on a Hadoop platform, to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of short-term traffic flow forecasting. More specifically, STW-KNN considers the spatial-temporal correlation and weight of traffic flow with trend adjustment features, to optimize the search mechanisms containing state vector, proximity measure, prediction function, and K selection. Furthermore, STW-KNN is implemented on a widely adopted Hadoop distributed computing platform with the MapReduce parallel processing paradigm, for parallel prediction of traffic flow in real time. Finally, with extensive experiments on real-world big taxi trajectory data, STW-KNN is compared with the state-of-the-art prediction models including conventional K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and C4.5. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to existing models on accuracy by decreasing the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) value more than 11.59% only in time domain and even achieves 89.71% accuracy improvement with the MAPEs of between 3.34% and 6.00% in both space and time domains, and also significantly improves the efficiency and scalability of short-term traffic flow forecasting over existing approaches.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>It has witnessed the big data era <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> for transportation coming in recent years, and the prediction of traffic condition (e.g., traffic flow, travel time) has attracted great research interest for various D 2 ITS <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref> applications such as advanced traffic management systems (ATMS), advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) and advanced public transportation systems (APTS). Timely and accurate traffic flow prediction plays an increasingly essential role in regional traffic management and control, which can provide design infrastructures, schedule interventions for government agencies, inform traffic conditions for travelers, and offer mobility services for passengers in real time. Moreover, it also assists road users to anticipate traffic congestion, save energy consumption, reduce environment pollution, and improve traffic operation efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4]</ref>. Owing to the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of traffic with nonlinear interactions between drivers and environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>, traffic flow conditions are extremely uncertain in a transportation network. Furthermore, the traffic state of a specific location is highly affected by its upstream and downstream traffic conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref>, thus making it difficult to be accurately predicted, particularly for short-term traffic flow forecasting (STFF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. However, improving predictive accuracy of short-term traffic flow would be vitally important in this context.</p><p>Clearly, short-term traffic flow prediction is a challenging issue, and thus many models and systems have been proposed for addressing this problem over the past several decades. Prominent short-term prediction approaches utilize different empirical and theoretical techniques <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, which can be broadly classified into three categories: (i) parametric techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11]</ref>, including historical average (HA) model, time-series models (e.g., moving average (MA), autoregressive MA (ARMA), autoregressive integrated MA (ARIMA), and seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)), state space models (e.g., kalman filter (KF)), dynamic-traffic-assignmentbased (DTA) models, smoothing methods, and so forth. (ii)</p><p>Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/neucom Nonparametric techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13]</ref>, such as neural networks (NNs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, artificial neural networks (ANNs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16]</ref>, k-nearest neighbor (KNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18]</ref>, support vector regression (SVR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, Bayesian <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. (iii) Hybrid integration techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>, combining the parametric technique(s) and the nonparametric technique(s) (e.g., graphical lasso and NNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, SARIMA and SVM <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>, seasonal SVR with chaotic simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, statistical and NNs models <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>). Certainly, these approaches can also be divided into statisticalbased methods and computational intelligence (CI)-based methods, and their similarities and differences have been discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>. The aforementioned famous studies focus on making forecasts about the likely traffic flows changes in the short-term, typically within 5-10 min ahead <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, heavily depending on historical and real-time traffic flow data which are treated as time series data. The traffic condition data are often captured through presence-type detectors (or a set of on-road sensors) deployed at a single location in consistent intervals, and then the collected data are usually used as inputs to a prediction model for forecasting short-term traffic parameters. Thus, most of existing approaches can only process regularly spaced time series data.</p><p>In recent years, given that it is totally impractical to equip each lane with presence-type detectors in a town <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> or to cover the whole urban network for traffic state estimation by traffic camera <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>, some alternative ways of generating information on traffic conditions have been developed with emerging floating car data (FCD) technologies, such as floating cars that upload global positioning system (GPS) data. Hence, the data collected based on these approaches are irregularly spaced time series data, which are unfit for most of existing methodologies of time series traffic flow forecasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. Moreover, for big GPS data, the computational and storage demands for traffic flow prediction would be prohibitive using existing approaches, and the determination of the amount of past traffic flow conditions used as input patterns of the models is very much time-consuming based on a trial and error method <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. In particular, taxicabs are commonly equipped with GPS sensors for dispatching and safety in most modern cities, and thus a large number of GPS trajectories of taxicabs with their present location, geo-position, time stamp and occupancy information are being generated to a data center in a certain frequency per day <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. For example, we employ large-scale GPS trajectory data used in this paper, to form the road network of Beijing (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) which is nearly consistent with the real traffic map, based on a Hadoop platform with ArcGIS. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the density distribution of the GPS points (1,232,048 records) generated by 12,000 taxicabs in Beijing during 1 h (00:14:35-01:14:34) on 1 November 2012. However, with the explosive growth of taxi trajectories, the existing prediction models in a sequential processing framework still have limitations in the field of short-time traffic flow forecasting, such as high memory consumption and I/O cost, low performance, poor reliability and other problems. Intuitively, the serial prediction algorithms based on the stand-alone learning model are not good at processing big taxi trajectory data on a single platform.</p><p>As a typical methodology of nonparametric techniques, NNs is widely adopted to predict traffic conditions, but it may not overcome the inherent limitations in empirical risk minimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> due to the versatility, which has the low prediction accuracy with the limited samples, and the over-fitting with large sample data. Naturally, KNN can be very competitive with the state-of-the-art classification methods 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>. For instance, the results reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref> showed that KNN outperformed other comparable models containing HA, ARIMA, SARIMA, and ANNs. In particular, KNN can mine direct information from the historical data and keep the random characteristics of the data change with the remarkable advantage of the robustness to noise; nevertheless, it is very suitable for short-term traffic flow forecasting. If the sample data are too large and complicated, KNN will not be able to meet the needs of real-time applications due to the great computational costs. However, recently the research of KNN for short-term traffic flow prediction mainly focused on improving the accuracy of prediction, and reducing the searching time of nearest neighbors to enhance the efficiency of prediction. To the best of our knowledge, except in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>, only a few works have been done on distributed modeling for short-term traffic flow prediction with big traffic data processed in a MapReduce framework on a Hadoop platform. Particularly, using optimal KNN with large-scale taxi trajectories, this paper may be an early feasible work on forecasting short-term traffic flow in a "Big Data" environment. Furthermore, existing KNN models have not considered the spatial-temporal correlation and weight of traffic flow with trend adjustment features on traffic pattern, to the field of short-term traffic flow prediction. It should be mentioned that the spatial-temporal correlation of traffic flow is the inherent features of the traffic pattern.</p><p>This paper focuses on the accuracy and efficiency of traffic flow forecasting for 5 min ahead, and aims to establish a distributed Spatial-Temporal Weighted K-Nearest Neighbor (STW-KNN) model. This work optimizes and extends the classical nonparametric KNN approach to meet the aforementioned challenges in a parallel processing framework, MapReduce, on a distributed computing platform, Hadoop, using large-scale irregularly spaced trajectory data captured from GPS-equipped taxis. Real-world data sets analysis and experiments help us to conclude that it is possible to solve accurate and timely traffic flow prediction problem, with the proposed model having highly accurate prediction capability and reasonable execution time.</p><p>The contributions of this work are summarized as follows:</p><p>A general MapReduce framework of distributed modeling for traffic flow forecasting (MF-TFF) is developed to satisfy the computation and storage requirements of big traffic data for a particular application. More specifically, the developed framework is general enough that can be utilized for other datadriven traffic prediction methods as well.</p><p>A distributed K-nearest neighbor optimization model (STW- KNN) is presented to improve the accuracy of short-term traffic flow forecasting based on the MF-TFF framework. STW-KNN considers the spatial-temporal correlation and weight in terms of the upstream-downstream and past-future of traffic flow by modifying the state vector, proximity (distance/similarity) measure, prediction function and choice of K. In particular, STW-KNN not only considers the signs of changes but also includes the magnitudes of changes in traffic flow on proximity measure and prediction function, based on the state vector of both space and time domains.</p><p>A MapReduce-based parallel prediction algorithm (MBSTW- KNN) is put forward to reduce the computational costs of large-scale traffic flow data on a Hadoop platform, which is the parallelism of STW-KNN. MBSTW-KNN implements the parallel prediction of traffic flow through the Mapper, Combiner and Reducer functions, respectively, in big data environment. More importantly, it can offer a practical reference for the parallelism of the same type of algorithms.</p><p>The above-mentioned approach is applied to forecast short- term traffic flow of Sanlihe E. Rd. in the city of Beijing. Particularly, our extensive performance evaluation indicates that the proposed model outperforms other comparable models with robust accuracy, and its MapReduce implementation significantly improves the efficiency and scalability of short-term traffic flow prediction over conventional serial approaches on a single machine.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly review related work and provide the preliminaries, and then the motivation with solution and the developed MF-TFF framework are shown in Section 3. The proposed STW-KNN model and its MapReduce implementation are described in detail, respectively, in Sections 4 and 5. In Section 6, we give the effectiveness validations of STW-KNN and the performance evaluations of MBSTW-KNN to verify the accuracy, efficiency and scalability of our approach, respectively, and then discuss the experimental results. Section 7 concludes the paper, and then presents the direction of future work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Short-term traffic flow forecasting</head><p>Short-term traffic forecasting concerns the traffic condition predictions in the future on the basis of current and past traffic information, and the area of that was first studied by Ahmed and Cook <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. Most of the researches have focused on developing methodologies to model traffic characteristics (e.g., volume, density and speed) and produce anticipated traffic conditions, and existing literatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38]</ref> provided a critical review of the short-term traffic prediction. More recently, a special issue presented state-of-the-art research works in the field of short-term traffic flow forecasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>, such as literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> reviewed existing challenges of short-term traffic forecasting and offered suggestions for future work, and so on. Furthermore, Lv et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> proposed a novel deep-learningbased traffic flow prediction method based on a stacked autoencoder model, which uses autoencoders as building blocks to represent traffic flow features for prediction. Moretti et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> proposed a hybrid modeling approach which combines ANNs and a simple statistical method, to provide a 1 h forecast of urban traffic flow rates. Huang <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> introduced a v-SVR model with the Gaussian loss function, namely v-GSVR, combining the Chaos map, Cloud model and Genetic algorithm (CCGA), to predict short-term traffic flow. Jeong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> presented an online learning weighted support vector regression (OLWSVR) model for short-term traffic flow prediction. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref> applied an SVR model with Gauss loss function, namely Gauss-SVR, coupling chaotic cloud particle swarm optimization (CCPSO) algorithm to forecast urban traffic flow, and the feasibility and the availability of the forecasting model were verified by numerical examples. Chan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> developed a procedure for selecting significant on-road sensor data to forecast short-term traffic flow using the Taguchi method. Tchrakian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> proposed an algorithm for real-time traffic flow prediction using spectral analysis. Chan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> adopted a neural-network-based model for short-term traffic flow forecasting based on a hybrid exponential smoothing and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Hong <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> put forward a traffic flow forecasting model, named SSVRCSA, which combines the seasonal SVR (SSVR) model with chaotic simulated annealing (CSA) algorithm, to forecast inter-urban traffic flow. Sun and Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> suggested a new variational approximation method for infinite mixtures of Gaussian processes using a Dirichlet process prior, and presented its applications to traffic flow prediction.</p><p>To sum up, all the aforementioned methods have many desirable properties in different disciplines, and thus it is hard to conclude that which one of these is significantly superior to other methods in any situation. One of the best essential reasons is that the accuracy of prediction models which are developed with small-scale separate specific traffic data depends on the traffic flow features embedded in the collected traffic data <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. Furthermore, most of existing models are performed in stand-alone modes, and thus the computational effort is "expensive" <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> and the capability of data processing and storage is restricted. However, in this work, we develop a general architecture of distributed modeling in a MapReduce framework for traffic flow forecasting (MF-TFF), to efficiently process large-scale traffic data (e.g., big taxi trajectory data) on a Hadoop platform.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">KNN nonparametric regression model</head><p>K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44]</ref> is a data driven approach that does not need to build a complicated mathematical model without a priori knowledge, while has a good portability. Therefore, it is one of the widely applied techniques in nonparametric methods for traffic flow prediction, which is first utilized by Davis and Nihan <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Recently, Zheng and Su <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> proposed a two-step method with the ability of forecasting multiple steps to enhance KNN approach via constrained linearly sewing principle component algorithm for short-term traffic volume forecasting, and the improved KNN method is superior to the computing algorithms in most cases. Chang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref> employed a dynamic multi-interval traffic volume prediction model for addressing inefficient predictions when current or future time-series data either exhibit fluctuations or abruptly change, based on the KNN non-parametric regression. In addition, KNN was commonly applied to the prediction of other traffic conditions such as travel time. Bustillos and Chiu <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref> presented a methodology for freeway travel time prediction with only count data using the N-curve and KNN methods. Myung et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref> put forward a model to predict travel time on the basis of the KNN method using data provided by the vehicle detector system and the automatic toll collection system. Zou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref> presented a hybrid travel-time prediction model that consists of an enhanced K-NN model and a multitopology NN model.</p><p>In summary, all the above efforts have significantly improved the performance of short-term traffic flow forecasting for various practical applications. Different from existing works, this paper proposes a distributed KNN optimization model (STW-KNN) to enhance the accuracy of KNN for forecasting short-term traffic flow based on a MapReduce framework. In addition to the pastfuture of traffic flow on the targeted road segment, the enhanced STW-KNN considers the spatial-temporal correlation and weight in terms of the upstream-downstream and the past-future of traffic flow by optimizing state vector, distance measure, prediction function and K selection. Moreover, the computation of the traditional KNN algorithm on a single machine can be costly if the number of training samples is large. And efficient parallel computing techniques based on distributed platform are available to reduce the amount of computations needed to fast find the nearest neighbors of a testing sample. However, we present a parallel prediction algorithm (MBSTW-KNN) which is the implementation of STW-KNN in a MapReduce framework on a Hadoop platform, for the parallelization of searching the nearest neighbors from a large amount of traffic flow data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">MapReduce framework</head><p>The open-source Apache Hadoop<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> provides a distributed computing framework for reliable, scalable and distributed computing, including Hadoop Common, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Hadoop YARN, Hadoop MapReduce, etc. HDFS <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref> and MapReduce <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51]</ref> are the key components of Hadoop. MapReduce is a parallel processing paradigm that allows for massive scalability across hundreds or thousands of servers on a Hadoop cluster <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53]</ref>. The processing of MapReduce jobs contains the Map phase and the Reduce phase. Each phase has keyvalue pairs as an input and output, the types of which may be selected by the programmer which specifies the Map function and the Reduce function <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>. More details about MapReduce can be found in the Apache Hadoop website. 2  As a typical methodology, MapReduce provides an efficient processing framework for traffic flow prediction with large-scale traffic data in parallel. Hence, we develop a general MapReduce framework of distributed modeling for traffic flow forecasting (MF-TFF) as described in Section 3.4 in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Motivation and MF-TFF</head><p>In this section, we describe the motivation of this work, then analyze the existing problem in short-term traffic flow forecasting and give the problem definition, and finally provide an overview of our solution and a general MapReduce framework of distributed modeling for traffic flow forecasting (MF-TFF) developed in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Problem analysis</head><p>In urban traffic networks, each road segment is not isolated with the dynamic nature of traffic flow, and one of the most common approximation approaches is to adopt time parameter to prediction models for forecasting traffic flow. That is, only considering the time domain, the traffic flow prediction uses the current and past (historical) traffic flow data at time intervals to forecast future traffic flow for the next time interval on the same road segment. In this work, we consider the spatial-temporal correlation of traffic flow (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) in both time and space domains for STW-KNN. Temporal correlations refer to the correlations of the current and past traffic flows at time intervals and the future traffic flow at the next time interval on the same targeted road segment (i.e., time domain), whereas spatial correlations refer to the correlations of the traffic flow of targeted road segment and that of its upstream and downstream road segments at the same time interval (i.e., space domain).</p><p>As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, in the time domain, it is obvious that the traffic flow of road segment</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">r j at time interval t þ 1, V r j t þ 1 , is closely related to that of the same road segment at n þ 1 previous time intervals, V r j t À n .</formula><p>Meanwhile, we can easily learn that the traffic flow of a particular road segment is highly affected by its upstream and downstream traffic conditions. In other words, in the space domain, the traffic flow of road segment r j at time interval t, V r j t , is correlated with that of upstream road segment, V r j À 1 t , and downstream road segment, V r j þ 1 t , at the same time interval. If a prediction model only takes into account the relationships of traffic flow between the past and future periods on the targeted road segment while ignoring its upstream and downstream traffic conditions, the accuracy of prediction will be inevitably decreased. Moreover, according to the feature of recurring traffic patterns, the magnitudes of changes in traffic flow should be included besides the signs of changes considered. Therefore, with the trend adjustment features of traffic flow, we consider the spatialtemporal correlations in STW-KNN to enhance the accuracy of prediction. In addition, the traffic conditions vary greatly in different historical periods on the same road segment due to the strong time-varying of traffic system, and thus the degree of importance is not identical in forecasting future traffic conditions. The approximation degree of describing the nearest neighbor metric distance is measured by the weighted methods, searching the real-time input data may be more similar and higher quality neighbor. Thus, we also utilize the weighted distance measure in STW-KNN to analyze the different influence degrees of traffic flow for different components.</p><p>On the other hand, it is desirable that as large a database as possible is provided to improve the accuracy of the model, while the size of the database has significant implications on the timeliness of model execution <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. Especially for KNN, the computational and storage issue is a major critical problem. The traditional KNN requires the storage of the whole training set which may be an excessive amount of storage for large data set and leads to a large computation time in the classification stage. Furthermore, KNN is a lazy learning method, which usually involves storing the training data in memory and finding relevant data to answer a particular query. To reduce computational cost and save memory consumption of big traffic flow data processing, we employ MapReduce to implement the parallel prediction of STW-KNN on Hadoop.</p><p>Motivated by the above-mentioned discussions, we study the distributed modeling of short-term traffic flow prediction considering the spatial-temporal correlation and weight of traffic flow with the trend adjustment features in STW-KNN, and then implement it in a MapReduce framework on a Hadoop platform.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Problem definition</head><p>In this work, the historical traffic flow data captured by GPSequipped taxis are utilized as input patterns of prediction models to predict future traffic flow conditions. In terms of problem analysis combining with Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, some terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> used in this study are introduced in the following. Definition 3.1. (Road segment): A road segment r is a directed (one-way or bidirectional) edge that is associated with a direction symbol (r.dir), two terminal points (r.s, r.e), and a list of intermediate points describing the segment using a polyline. If r. dir ¼bidirectional, drivers can start from both terminal points, i.e., r.s-r.e or r.e-r.s; otherwise, r can only be traveled from r.s to r.e. Definition 3.2. (Route): A route R is a set of connected road segments, i.e., R : r 0 -r 1 -⋯-r n À 1 , where r j :s ¼ r j À 1 :e; 1 r j on. That is, the upstream road segment of r j is r j À 1 while r j þ 1 denotes the downstream road segment of that, and the r j :s is the end point of the road segment r j À 1 while r j :e represents the start point of the road segment r j þ 1 . The start point and end point of a route can be represented as R:s ¼ r 0 :s and R:e ¼ r n À 1 :e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Definition 3.3. (Road network): A road network G r is a directed graph, G r ¼ ðV r ; E r Þ,</formula><p>where V r is a set of nodes representing the terminal points of road segments, and E r is a set of edges denoting road segments. The time needed for traversing an edge is dynamic during the time of day. Definition 3.4. (Taxi trajectory): A taxi trajectory T ra is a sequence of GPS points pertaining to one trip, i.e., T ra : p 0 -p 1 -⋯-p n À 1 . Each point p contains a longitude, latitude, and a time stamp t p , where 0 o t p i À t p i À 1 ; 1 r io n. Definition 3.5. (Time interval): A time interval in a moving trajectory between any two trajectory locations ðx p i ; y p i ; t p i Þ and ðx p j ; y p j ; t p j Þ is defined as Δt ¼ t p j À t p i , where 0 r io j o n. In this study, we select 5 min as prediction time interval (i.e., Δt ¼ 5 m), and take T continuous time intervals as a combined group, t ¼ 1; 2; …; T. Definition 3.6. (Traffic flow): The traffic flow V r j t is the total number of taxis running on a road segment r j at time interval t. If the traffic information of a taxi is recorded as many times by GPS equipment on the same road segment at a time interval, we will delete the duplicate records and only compute one time to the total number of traffic flow.</p></div>

Furthermore, we implement STW-KNN in a MapReduce framework on Hadoop to solve the final issue (see <ref type="bibr">Section 5)</ref>.</p><p>For a more intuitive illustration, the overview of the proposed solution is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Based on the developed MF-TFF Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Overview of our approach. Naturally, the key issue of the solution is the accuracy, efficiency and scalability of traffic flow forecasting, and thus the main works are composed of the STW-KNN model and its MapReduce implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Developed MF-TFF framework</head><p>In this section, we develop a general architecture of distributed modeling on a MapReduce framework for traffic flow forecasting (MF-TFF).</p><p>As mentioned above, inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref>, a general MapReduce framework of distributed modeling for traffic flow forecasting (TFF) is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, which is composed of following four steps:</p><p>Step 1: In terms of different traffic flow prediction algorithms, a Map-Reduce engine will start to process the task of distributed modeling (see Step 1). Clearly, besides the proposed STW-KNN model, the MF-TFF framework can also be generally used for other data-driven traffic prediction models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Proposed STW-KNN model</head><p>In this section, we propose a spatial-temporal weighted Knearest neighbor (STW-KNN) model to enhance the accuracy of short-term traffic flow forecasting based on the MF-TFF framework.</p><p>In the STW-KNN model, to find the best nearest neighbors, we aim to optimize the search mechanisms of the traditional KNN model, including the state vector, proximity measure, prediction function and the choice of k which are crucial to the accuracy of forecasting. On the one hand, according to the spatial-temporal correlation of traffic flow, we consider the correlations of both time and space domains in terms of defining state vector. Furthermore, we employ a trend adjustment exponent weighted measure method to compute the neighborhood similarity, and then give the corresponding distance function for the similarity measure of four types of state vectors. On the other hand, we adopt the combined weights between the weighted average of the nearest neighbors and the trend adjustments of each nearest neighbor in building prediction function. Moreover, the Distance Weighted Voting scheme is used to determine the class label for reducing the impact of k selection which is sensitive to the algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">State vector</head><p>It is worthwhile to note that there are an infinite number of possible state vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> for specific applications in practice. To improve the accuracy of traffic flow prediction, in STW-KNN, we need to sufficiently and simply define the reasonable state vector which can more accurately describe traffic conditions.</p><p>Based on the definition of this problem and the spatial-temporal correlation of traffic flow, for forecasting the traffic flow of targeted road segment r j at future time interval t þ 1, we can build four types of state vectors, i.e., time domain (TD), time domain and upstream road segment (TDU), time domain and downstream road segment (TDD), and time domain and upstream-downstream road segments (TDUD), which are illustrated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, TD only considers temporal correlation, and TDU and TDD respectively consider temporal correlation and upstream road segment or downstream road segment, whereas TDUD considers the correlations of both time and space domains simultaneously (i.e., spatial-temporal correlations). The prediction accuracy of different state vectors is compared in Section 6. According to the comparative analysis, we employ the state vector of spatial-temporal correlations, TDUD, in the proposed STW-KNN model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Proximity measure</head><p>The term proximity is utilized to refer to either similarity or dissimilarity, and the proximity between two objects is a function of the proximity between the corresponding attributes of the two objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref>. A successful application of KNN relies on a suitable distance (similarity) function, which is the key to any KNN approach. Many distance functions are available in the literature, such as the Euclidean, Camberra, Mahalanobis, Hamming and Quadratic, but no distance function is known to perform consistently well, even under some conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref>.</p><p>Different from existing approaches, in STW-KNN, the definition of distance function are not only the signs of changes considered, but also the magnitudes of changes in traffic flow included, based on the state vector of spatial-temporal correlations (TDUD). In other words, we consider the traffic flow trends both quantitatively and qualitatively to accomplish the traffic flow prediction. Based on the traditional KNN model, the trend adjustment feature is merged into our model in order to improve the accuracy of prediction by capturing recurring traffic patterns. Furthermore, obviously historical states closer to current states have more prior information and, therefore, should have a more critical impact on future states. However, the STW-KNN model is designed to follow the basic KNN model, coupling the exponent weighted (EW) Euclidean distance in the first part and the trend effect of traffic flow in the second part. In particular, the differences of every adjacent pair between the current record and the historical record are computed in the neighborhood similarity.</p><p>In our STW-KNN model, the trend adjustment exponent weighted (TAEW) measure method with Euclidean distance is defined via the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">d i ðx; yÞ ¼ α ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi X T t ¼ 1 β T À t þ 1 x t À y i t À Á 2 v u u t þð1 À αÞ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi X T t ¼ 2 X t À 1 δ ¼ 1 ðx t À x δ ÞÀ y i t À y i δ h i 2 v u u t ;<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where 0 rα r 1, 0 oβ o1, and T A N þ denotes the total number of continuous time intervals included; d i ðx; yÞ represents the distance between the current traffic flow data and the ith components in the historical traffic flow database, and x t is the value of the tth time intervals in the current traffic flow data; i represents the sequence number of the historical traffic flow data, and y i t is the value of the tth time intervals of the corresponding traffic flow record (i.e., the ith components) in the historical database. Here, obviously we utilize a weighted combination of both similarity schemes in searching the nearest neighbors, and the optimal weight parameters α; β will be discussed in Section 6 through extensive experiments.</p><p>Moreover, the distance function (1) of our TAEW approach can be extended to consider the similarity measure of four types of state vectors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Prediction function</head><p>Based on the aforementioned analysis, for the accurate traffic flow forecasting, we define the prediction function of STW-KNN through taking the combined weights between the weighted average of the nearest neighbors and the trend adjustments (between T and t) of each nearest neighbor. It can be formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">X T þ 1 ¼ γ X K k ¼ 1 d À 1 k P K k ¼ 1 d À 1 k X k T þ 1 þð1 À γÞ X T þ 1 KT X K k ¼ 1 X T t ¼ 1 X k T þ 1 À X k t " # ;<label>ð6Þ</label></formula><p>where 0 r γ r 1, d k denotes the distance between the current data and the kth nearest neighbors, K A N þ represents the total number of the selected nearest neighbors from the training samples; X T is the current traffic flow at the time intervals T, X T þ 1 is the predicted traffic flow at the next time intervals T þ 1, and X k T þ 1 is the traffic flow of the kth nearest neighbors searched from the historical traffic flow database at the corresponding time intervals.</p><p>Traditionally, the approaches to forecasting traffic flow for the next time intervals usually employ two types of prediction functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, i.e., the average of the neighborhoods and the weighted average. The basic KNN model utilizes the average of the nearest  neighbors, which is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">X T þ 1 ¼ 1 k X K k ¼ 1 X k T þ 1 :<label>ð7Þ</label></formula><p>Additionally, some previous works improve the prediction accuracy by adopting the weighted average of the nearest neighborhoods, which is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">X T þ 1 ¼ X K k ¼ 1 d À 1 k P K k ¼ 1 d À 1 k X k T þ 1 :<label>ð8Þ</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Choice of K</head><p>To the best of our knowledge, no value of k is known to be consistently good, even under some circumstances <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>(a), (b) and (c) illustrates 1 À , 4À , and 5-nearest neighbors of a data point located at the center of each circle. As seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>(a), (b) and (c), if k is too small, then the nearestneighbor classifier may be susceptible to over-fitting because of noise in the training data. On the other hand, if k is too large, the nearest-neighbor classifier may misclassify the testing instance, because its list of merest neighbors may include data points that are located far away from its neighborhood (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6(d)</ref>).</p><p>According to the analysis mentioned above, every neighbor has the same influence on the classification in the Majority Voting approach which is used in the traditional KNN model, and thus makes the algorithm sensitive to the selection of k. That is, the algorithm calculates the similarity between each testing sample te ¼ ðx 0 ; y 0 Þ and all the training samples ðx; yÞ A Tr to determine its nearest-neighbor list, Tr te . Once the nearest-neighbor list is obtained, the testing sample is classified on the basis of the majority class of its nearest neighbors via the Majority Voting approach.</p><p>In STW-KNN, to reduce the impact of k is to weight the impact of each nearest neighbor x i according to its distance:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">ω i ¼ 1=dðx 0 ; x i Þ 2 ,</formula><p>we employ the Distance Weighted Voting scheme, and the class label can be determined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">y 0 ¼ argmax c X ðx i ;y i Þ A Trte ω i Â Iðc ¼ y i Þ;<label>ð9Þ</label></formula><p>where c is a class label, y i is the class label for one of the nearest neighbors, and IðÁÞ is an indicator function that returns the value 1 if its argument is true and 0 otherwise.</p><p>Moreover, the choice of the best k is greatly affected by the finite sample nature of the problem, and thus the value of k is usually assigned by experimental tests. In this work, the range of k value is set between 1 and 50, and the reasonable k will be evaluated in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">STW-KNN with MapReduce implementation</head><p>In this section, to improve the scalability and efficiency of STW-KNN in "Big Data" environment, we implement it in a MapReduce framework on a Hadoop platform. For convenience, STW-KNN with MapReduce implementation is denoted as MBSTW-KNN (MapReduce-based STW-KNN).  As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>, in the Map phase, the Mapper function receives each line in the training and testing sets with the corresponding state vectors (see Section 4.1) as a different key-value pair, then measures the similarity (calculates the distance) between each testing sample and the training samples using our distance function Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">1</ref>), and finally outputs the intermediate data to the Combiner function. To reduce the computational complexity of MapReduce job and save the limited bandwidth available on a Hadoop cluster, the Combiner function is employed to cut down the amount of data shuffled between the Map tasks and the Reduce tasks, and sorts the intermediate results by the distance and then selects the local k nearest neighbors in the Combine phase. In the Reduce phase, the Reducer function is designed to determine the global k nearest neighbors and the class label is determined through the Distance Weighted Voting scheme Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">9</ref>). Then it judges whether the classification result is accurate, accordingly returns the value 1 or 0 to indicator function which is written to the main program, and finally outputs the global k nearest neighbors. Lastly, we adopt real-time traffic flow data to predict traffic flow for next time interval by our prediction function Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">6</ref>), based on the selected k nearest neighbors outputted from MapReduce jobs after the Map, Combine and Reduce tasks.</p><p>The data flow of MapReduce with a simple example of 4-nearest neighbors regarding the MBSTW-KNN algorithm is described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>, after uploading the training and testing sets to HDFS.

Finally, we build historical traffic flow database according to the statistical results.</p><p>In the forecasting step, based on the historical traffic flow database, we apply the proposed STW-KNN model with MapReduce implementation to predict short-term traffic flow of the Sanlihe E. Rd. 2 in the city of Beijing. Especially, we employ the implemented MBSTW-KNN algorithm to fulfill the parallel search of the historical traffic flow database for matching neighbor pattern efficiently.</p><p>In the performance evaluation step, we first validate the effectiveness of STW-KNN on proximity measure, prediction function, state vector and K selection, and then verify the performance of MBSTW-KNN on speedup and scaleup. In particular, to find the best combination of parameters k, α, β, γ for gaining prediction results with the highest accuracy, each combination of these four parameters is evaluated for the lowest MAPE value within the reasonable range where k ¼ 1; 2; …; 50, α ¼ 0; 0:1; …; 1, β ¼ 0; 0:1; …; 1, γ ¼ 0; 0:1; …; 1, and the optimal combinations are generated for KNN(k), KNN-CCW(k), KNN-EW ðk; βÞ, KNN-TAEW ð k; α; βÞ and STW-KNN ðk; α; β; γÞ.</p><p>Moreover, the STW-KNN model is compared with the state-ofthe-art models in terms of the following error indices and then the results will be discussed next.</p></div>

Four different performance metrics are widely used to measure the effectiveness of prediction models, i.e., (1) mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), (2) root mean square error (RMSE), (3) mean absolute error (MAE), and (4) maximum error (ME). All of the measures help demonstrate the extent to which the predicted value approaches the actual value observed. They provide not only a fair comparison of the performance for different models, The MAPE, RMSE, MAE, and ME metrics can be formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">MAPE ¼ 1 n X n t ¼ 1 j X t À X t j X t Â 100%;<label>ð10Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">RMSE ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi 1 n X n t ¼ 1 ðX t À Xt Þ 2 v u u t ;<label>ð11Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">MAE ¼ 1 n X n t ¼ 1 j X t À Xt j ;<label>ð12Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">ME ¼ max t ¼ 1;…;n j X t À X t j ;<label>ð13Þ</label></formula><p>where X t is the actual value of traffic flow observed at time interval t, X t is the predicted value for the same time interval, and n is the total number of traffic flow observations processed during the time intervals provided.

The lower the MAPE presents the higher the prediction accuracy, and the prediction capability of the model can be defined by a range of MAPE (i.e., MAPE r 10%: highly accurate prediction capability, 11% o MAPE r 20%: good prediction capability, 20%o MAPE r 50%: reasonable prediction capability, and MAPE 451%: inaccurate prediction capability).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Accuracy evaluation</head><p>To evaluate the performance of the proposed distance and prediction functions, with the time domain (TD) state vector, the MAPE values of our models and existing KNN models are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, and the comparison of their average MAPEs is illustrated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.1.">Validation on proximity measure and prediction function</head><p>Notice that for the validation of the modified proximity measure method and prediction function, both the proposed model and existing KNN models only select TD state vector for prediction without considering the space domain. The conventional KNN(T,k), KNN-CCW(T,k), and KNN-EW(T,k,β) models use the basic Euclidean distance method equation (3), the correlation coefficient weighted (CCW) method equation (4), and the exponent weighted (EW) method equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5)</ref> for proximity measure, respectively, based on the weighted average of the nearest neighborhoods in terms of prediction function equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8)</ref>. Our KNN-TAEW(T,k,α,β) model utilizes the trend adjustment exponent weighted (TAEW) method given by the distance function equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(1)</ref> with the same prediction function as existing KNN models, and specifically the proposed STW-KNN(T,k,α,β,γ) model employs the prediction function equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(6)</ref> with the same distance function as KNN-TAEW.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows the lowest MAPE value of each model with the best combination of parameters for 8 days selected from the experimental results due to the space limit, and the average MAPEs of each model for all days are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>. As seen from Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>, the MAPE values of KNN-TAEW are much lower than that of KNN, KNN-CCW and KNN-EW with the same prediction function, while being much higher than that of STW-KNN with the same distance function for every day. More specifically, our KNN-TAEW model achieves more accurate predictions than existing KNN models by decreasing the MAPE values between 3.0694% and 6.2810% on an average. In particular, the proposed STW-KNN model decreases the average MAPEs of the KNN-TAEW model by approximately 5.6648%, and that of existing KNN models from 8.5603% to 11.5899%, respectively. Furthermore, the MAPE values of STW-KNN are between 28.2594% and 49.8643%, and the average MAPEs of KNN-TAEW and STW-KNN are respectively 50.3597% and 47.5069%. It could be found that only considering temporal correlations of traffic flow, the proposed STW-KNN model still has a "reasonable prediction" capability.</p><p>Based on Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>, we can conclude that with the distance function equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(1)</ref> and the prediction function equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">6</ref>), STW-KNN displays better prediction performance than KNN-TAEW, which significantly outperforms existing KNN models on  prediction accuracy. However, the above results demonstrate that the proposed TAEW method combining with its corresponding prediction function is a promising alternative for the STW-KNN model in this case.</p><p>On the other hand, to further evaluate the prediction performance of the proposed STW-KNN model, we compare it with the state-of-the-art forecasting models consisting of KNN, ANNs, NB, RF, and C4.5. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref> gives a complete comparison of the MOEs values for each model with TD on 8 days selected from the experimental results due to the space limit, and then the average comparison of the MOEs values for all days is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref>.</p><p>As illustrated in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref>, we can observe that the MOEs values of STW-KNN are much lower than other models for every day in most cases, and especially the average MAPE, RMSE and MAE values are the lowest for all days. The RF model produces the lowest prediction accuracy among all models with an average MAPE of 64.7819%, whereas the proposed STW-KNN model provides the best overall performance with an average MAPE of 47.5069%. More specifically, the proposed STW-KNN model achieves more accuracy than KNN by decreasing the MAPE value more than 11.5899% for all days.</p><p>Furthermore, the average MAPE of STW-KNN is much lower than C4.5, RF, NB, and ANNs (e.g., the MAPE values of STW-KNN are 28.2580%, 26.6663%, 20.4543%, and 14.6584% lower than C4.5, RF, NB, and ANNs on an average, respectively). Thus, our STW-KNN model can provide more accurate predictions than existing models KNN, RF, NB, C4.5, and ANNs without going through the complicated model calibration and computations, based on the available and sufficient historical sample data.</p><p>Additionally, in order to see more clearly the nature of the evaluation, the morning peak and the evening peak traffic flow prediction results generated by the STW-KNN model and five state-of-the-art models are illustrated in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref>, respectively. From these figures, we can find that the predicted values of our STW-KNN model are closer to the actual values, which demonstrates that the proposed STW-KNN model performs better than other models in most cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.2.">Validation on state vector</head><p>As discussed previously, we present four types of state vectors including TD, TDU, TDD and TDUD (see Section 4.1). For the evaluation of different state vectors, we study the prediction accuracy of the proposed state vectors based on our STW-KNN model which utilizes the distance function equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">2</ref>) and the prediction function equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(6)</ref>, and present the experimental results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">8</ref>. For a more intuitive explanation, the percentage values  <ref type="table">9</ref>.</p><p>From these results, we can observe that STW-KNN with TDUD obtains better prediction performance than TD, TDU and TDD, with the MAPE values which are from 3.3397% to 6.0073%, particularly with the average MAPE of 5.5290%. The prediction performance is relatively stationary, and the prediction accuracy is robust and comparable with the reported results. It is demonstrated that the STW-KNN model with TDUD has the "highly accurate prediction" capability, and can produce more prediction accuracy than three other state vectors by decreasing the average MAPEs over 49.8627% for all days. More specifically, TDUD used in STW-KNN outperforms TD 88.3616%, TDU 52.4693%, and TDD 49.8627% in MAPE on an average. It also could be found that the MAPE values   In addition, to illustrate well the prediction performance of different state vectors, Figs. 12 and 13 show the prediction results for the STW-KNN model with four types of state vectors in the morning peak period and the evening peak period, respectively. It could be observed that the predicted values produced by the STW-KNN model with TDUD are closest to the actual values.</p><p>Based on the aforementioned results, we can conclude that it is extremely significant to consider the state vector of spatial-temporal correlations in both space and time domains for the accurate traffic flow prediction, and particularly TDUD is the best selection strategy of state vectors. Therefore, the proposed STW-KNN model with TDUD is desired in this paper.</p><p>Overall, the experimental results on large real-world data sets have shown that with the optimization of search mechanisms, the accuracy of the optimized KNN model (STW-KNN) is significantly improved over existing KNN models and the state-of-the-art prediction approaches. Thus, the effectiveness of the STW-KNN model for short-term traffic flow forecasting is promising and manifested. Specifically, in STW-KNN, one of the most successful combinations is the state vector of spatial-temporal correlations TDUD combining the proximity measure method TAEW which is given by distance function equations (1) and (2), and the prediction function equation (6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5.">Efficiency and scalability evaluations</head><p>To further evaluate the efficiency and scalability of STW-KNN with MapReduce implementation (i.e., the MBSTW-KNN algorithm), we validate the speedup and scaleup of MBSTW-KNN using the above-mentioned data set, which is processed into six groups (i.e., T_data sets1 with 64 MB, T_data sets2 with 128 MB, T_data sets3 with 256 MB, T_data sets4 with 512 MB, T_data sets5 with 1 GB, and T_data sets6 with 2 GB) and three groups (i.e., T_data sets1 ranging from 64 MB to 512 MB, T_data sets2 ranging from 128 MB to 1 GB, and T_data sets3 ranging from 256 MB to 2 GB), respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5.1.">Validation on speedup</head><p>To verify how much the parallel algorithm MBSTW-KNN is faster than the corresponding sequential algorithm, we conduct respectively the speedup experiments on a Hadoop cluster of nodes varying from 1 to 8, by keeping six groups of data sets constant (64 MB, 128 MB, 256 MB, 512 MB, 1 GB, and 2 GB). The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">14(a)</ref>.</p><p>The speedup metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref> is given by  where T s is the execution time of an algorithm on one node (i.e., the sequential execution time) for forecasting short-term traffic flow with the given data sets, and T p is the execution time of an algorithm for addressing the same problem using the same data sets on a Hadoop cluster with p nodes (i.e., the parallel execution time), respectively. As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">14</ref>(a), the speedup of MBSTW-KNN increases relative linearly with an increasing number of nodes. More specifically, larger data sets achieves a better speedup, such as the speedup of the data sets with 2 GB size reaches 6.722, which is 84.03% (6.722/8 ¼84.03%) of the ideal speedup, when the number of nodes is 8. Generally, it is very hard to achieve linear speedup because of the communication cost and the skew of the slaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref>. The results demonstrate that STW-KNN in a MapReuce framework on a Hadoop platform has a very good speedup performance, which is almost the same for data set with very different sizes. In other words, MBSTW-KNN on MapReduce has good scalability over big data and performs better with a larger data set.</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">Speedup ¼ T s T p ;<label>ð14Þ</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5.2.">Validation on scaleup</head><p>To evaluate how well the MBSTW-KNN algorithm processes larger data sets when more nodes are available, we perform scaleup experiments where we increase the size of data sets (varying from 64 MB to 512 MB, from 128 MB to 1 GB, and from 256 MB to 2 GB) in direct proportion to the number of nodes (ranging from 1 node to 8 nodes), and then plot the results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">14(b)</ref>.</p><p>The scaleup metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref> is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">Scaleup ¼ T s T p ;<label>ð15Þ</label></formula><p>where T s denotes the execution time of an algorithm for handling the given data sets on one node, and T p represents the execution time of an algorithm for processing p-times larger data sets on ptimes larger nodes. As depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">14</ref>(b), the scaleup values of MBSTW-KNN are in the vicinity of 1, even less, with the proportional growth of both the number of nodes and the size of data sets. Clearly, MBSTW-KNN has a very excellent scaleup and the adaptability of largescale data sets based on a Hadoop cluster with MapReduce.</p><p>To sum up, the experimental results indicate that MBSTW-KNN in "Big Data" environment has better scalability and higher efficiency than STW-KNN on a single machine, especially achieving the results the same as that of STW-KNN with significantly superior performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions and future work</head><p>This paper aims to develop a distributed spatial-temporal weighted model and implement it in a MapReduce framework on a Hadoop platform, for solving accurate and timely traffic flow forecasting problem. Specifically, to enhance the accuracy of traffic flow prediction, based on the developed MF-TFF framework, the spatial-temporal correlation and weight of traffic flow with trend adjustment features are incorporated into the optimal KNN model, STW-KNN. It employs the correlations of both time and space domains on state vector, the trend adjustment with the exponent weighted Euclidean distance on proximity measure, the combined weights between the weighted average of the nearest neighbors and the trend adjustments of each nearest neighbor on prediction function, and the distance weighted voting scheme on the choice of k. Moreover, STW-KNN is parallelized in "Big Data" environment, named MBSTW-KNN, which adopts the Mapper, Combiner and Reducer functions to improve the efficiency and scalability of traffic flow prediction in three phases, respectively.</p><p>In particular, the experimental results indicate that STW-KNN with state vector TD outperforms C4.5 28.2580%, RF 26.6663%, NB 20.4543%, ANNs 14.6584%, KNN 11.5899% in MAPE on an average. Also, STW-KNN with state vector TDUD yields more accurate predictions than other state vectors (TD, TDU, and TDD) by decreasing the average MAPEs over 49.8627%, and especially performs well by displaying 89.7105% decrease in MAPE compared to the basic KNN model for all days. Most importantly, the MAPE values of STW-KNN with TDUD are between 3.3397% and 6.0003% (with an average MAPE of 5.5290%), it is shown that the proposed STW-KNN model has "highly accurate prediction" capability. Furthermore, MBSTW-KNN produces the accurate prediction results the same as that of STW-KNN on a single machine, especially having favorable efficiency and scalability with a good speedup and excellent scaleup in a MapReduce framework on a Hadoop platform. As a conclusion, all the performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed model and its MapReduce implementation significantly improve the accuracy, efficiency and scalability of KNN over existing approaches, and has the potential to accurately and efficiently predict short-term traffic flow in real time. Particularly, it can provide valuable decision for proactive traffic management and control on account of the accurate and timely traffic flow forecasting.</p><p>For the directions of future work, the more comprehensive comparison of the proposed model will be researched with some other prediction models <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[62]</ref> (e.g., support vector regression (SVR)) in accuracy, and the performance of the implemented algorithm also can be validated on more segments and longer periods. On the other hand, we will further study some other neighborhood proximity measure approaches (e.g., Mahalanobis distance metric) and prediction functions (e.g., the median of the nearest neighbors) for a great improvement in terms of prediction accuracy.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
