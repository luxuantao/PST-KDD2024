We apply this model to MT tasks with soft lexical constraints. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, when decoding with soft lexical constraints, user preferences for lexical choice in the output language are provided as an additional input sequence of target words in any order.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>Non-Autoregressive MT While autoregressive models that decode from left-to-right are the de facto standard for many sequence generation tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cho et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chorowski et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Vinyals and Le, 2015)</ref>, non-autoregressive models offer a promising alternative to speed up decoding by generating a sequence of tokens in parallel <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gu et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">van den Oord et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ma et al., 2019)</ref>. However, their output quality suffers due to the large decoding space and strong independence assumptions between target tokens <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Ma et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wang et al., 2019)</ref>. These issues have been addressed via partially parallel decoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Wang et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Stern et al., 2018)</ref> or multi-pass decoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lee et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ghazvininejad et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gu et al., 2019)</ref>. This work adopts multipass decoding, where the model generates the target sequences by iteratively editing the outputs from previous iterations. Edit operations such as substitution <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ghazvininejad et al., 2019)</ref> and insertion-deletion <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gu et al., 2019)</ref> have reduced the quality gap between non-autoregressive and autoregressive models. However, we argue that these operations limit the flexibility and efficiency of the resulting models for MT by entangling lexical choice and reordering decisions.</p><p>Reordering vs. Lexical Choice EDITOR's insertion and reposition operations connect closely with the long-standing view of MT as a combination of a translation or lexical choice modelwhich selects appropriate translations for source units given their context -and reordering model -which encourages the generation of a target sequence order appropriate for the target language. This view is reflected in architectures ranging from the word-based IBM models <ref type="bibr">(Brown et al., 1990)</ref>, sentence-level models that generate a bag of target words that is reordered to construct a target sentence <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bangalore et al., 2007)</ref>, or the Operation Sequence Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Durrani et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Stahlberg et al., 2018)</ref>, which views translation as a sequence of translation and reordering operations over bilingual minimal units. By contrast, autoregressive NMT models <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bahdanau et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref> do not explicitly separate lexical choice and reordering, and previous non-autoregressive models break up reordering into sequences of other operations. This work introduces the reposition operation which makes it possible to move words around during the refinement process, as reordering models do. However, we will see that reposition differs from typical reordering to enable efficient oracles for training via imitation learning, and parallelization of edit operations at decoding time (Section 3).</p><p>MT with Soft Lexical Constraints NMT models lack flexible mechanisms to incorporate users preferences in their outputs. Lexical constraints have been incorporated in prior work via 1) constrained training where NMT models are trained on parallel samples augmented with constraint target phrases in both the source and target sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Song et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dinu et al., 2019)</ref>, or 2) constrained decoding where beam search is modified to include constraint words or phrases in the output <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hokamp and Liu, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Post and Vilar, 2018)</ref>. These mechanisms can incorporate domain-specific knowledge and lexicons which is particularly helpful in low-resource cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arthur et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Tang et al., 2016)</ref>. Despite their success at domain adaptation for MT <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hokamp and Liu, 2017)</ref> and caption generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson et al., 2017)</ref>, they suffer from several issues: constrained training requires building dedicated models for constrained language generation, while constrained decoding adds significant computational overhead and treats all constraints as hard constraints which may hurt fluency. In other tasks, various constraint types have been introduced by designing complex architectures tailored to specific content or style constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abu Sheikha and Inkpen, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mei et al., 2016)</ref>, or via segmentlevel "side-constraints" <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Sennrich et al., 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ficler and Goldberg, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Scarton and Specia, 2018)</ref>, which condition generation on users' stylistic preferences, but do not offer fine-grained control over their realization in the output sequence. We refer the reader to Yvon and Abdul Rauf (2020) for a comprehensive review of the strengths and weaknesses of current techniques to incorporate terminology constraints in NMT.</p><p>Our work is closely related to Susanto et al. (2020)'s idea of applying the Levenshtein Transformer to MT with hard terminology constraints. We will see that their technique can directly be used by EDITOR as well (Section 3.3), but this does not offer empirical benefits over the default EDITOR model (Section 4.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Approach</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The EDITOR Model</head><p>We cast both constrained and unconstrained language generation as an iterative sequence refinement problem modeled by a Markov Decision Process (Y, A, E, R, y 0 ), where a state y in the state space Y corresponds to a sequence of tokens y = (y 1 , y 2 , ..., y L ) from the vocabulary V up to length L, and y 0 ∈ Y is the initial sequence For standard sequence generation tasks, y 0 is the empty sequence ( s , /s ). For lexically constrained generation tasks, y 0 consists of the words to be used as constraints ( s , c 1 , ..., c m , /s ).</p><p>At the k-th decoding iteration, the model takes as input y k−1 , the output from the previous iteration, chooses an action a k ∈ A to refine the sequence into y k = E(y k−1 , a k ), and receives a reward r k = R(y k ). The policy π maps the input sequence y k−1 to a probability distribution P (A) over the action space A. Our model is based on the Transformer encoder-decoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref> and we extract the decoder representa- Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>: Applying the reposition operation r to input y: r i &gt; 0 is the 1-based index of token y i in the input sequence; y i is deleted if r i = 0.</p><p>tions (h 1 , ..., h n ) to make the policy predictions. Each refinement action is based on two basic operations: reposition and insertion.</p><p>Reposition For each position i in the input sequence y 1...n , the reposition policy π rps (r | i, y) predicts an index r ∈ [0, n]: if r &gt; 0, we place the r-th input token y r at the ith output position, otherwise we delete the token at that position (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). We constrain π rps (1 | 1, y) = 1, π rps (n | n, y) = n to maintain sequence boundaries. Note that reposition differs from typical reordering since 1) it makes it possible to delete tokens, and 2) it places tokens at each position independently, which enables parallelization at decoding time.</p><p>In principle, the same input token can thus be placed at multiple output positions. However, this happens rarely in practice as the policy predictor is trained to follow oracle demonstrations which cannot contain such repetitions by design. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref>The reposition classifier gives a categorical distribution over the index of the input token to be placed at each output position:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">π rps (r | i, y) = softmax(h i • [b, e 1 , ..., e n ]) (1)</formula><p>where e j is the embedding of the j-th token in the input sequence, and b ∈ R d model is used to predict whether to delete the token. The dot product in the softmax function captures the similarity between the hidden state h i and each input embedding e j or the deletion vector b.</p><p>Insertion Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gu et al. (2019)</ref>, the insertion operation consists of two phases: (1) placeholder insertion: given an input sequence y 1...n , the placeholder predictor π plh (p | i, y) predicts the number of placeholders p ∈ [0, K max ] to be inserted between two neighboring tokens (y i , y i+1 ); 3 (2) token prediction: given the output of the placeholder predictor, the token predictor π tok (t | i, y) replaces each placeholder with an actual token.</p><p>The Placeholder Insertion Classifier gives a categorical distribution over the number of placeholders to be inserted between every two consecutive positions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">π plh (p | i, y) = softmax([h i ; h i+1 ] • W plh ) (2)</formula><p>where Kmax+1) .</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">W plh ∈ R (2d model )×(</formula><p>The Token Prediction Classifier predicts the identity of each token to fill in each placeholder:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">π tok (t | i, y) = softmax(h i • W tok ) (3)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">W tok ∈ R d model ×|V| .</formula><p>Action Given an input sequence y 1...n , an action consists of repositioning tokens, inserting and replacing placeholders. Formally, we define an action as a sequence of reposition (r), placeholder insertion (p), and token prediction (t) operations: a = (r, p, t). r, p, and t are applied in this order to adjust non-empty initial sequences via reposition before inserting new tokens. Each of r, p, and t consists of a set of basic operations that can be applied in parallel:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">r = {r 1 , ..., r n } p = {p 1 , ..., p m−1 } t = {t 1 , ..., t l }</formula><p>where m = n i I(r i &gt; 0) and l = m−1 i p i .

The key idea is to construct a roll-in policy π in to generate sequences to be refined and a roll-out policy π out to estimate cost-to-go for all possible actions given each input sequence. The model is trained to choose actions that minimizes the cost-to-go estimates. We use a search-based oracle policy π * as the roll-out policy and train the model to imitate the optimal actions chosen by the oracle.</p><p>Formally, d π in rps and d π in ins denote the distributions of sequences induced by running the roll-in policies π in rps and π in ins respectively.

By minimizing the cost function, the model learns to imitate the oracle policy without access to the reference sequence.</p><p>Next, we describe how the reposition operation is incorporated in the roll-in policy (Section 3.2.1) and the oracle roll-out policy (Section 3.2.2).</p></div>

As a result, we can use dynamic programming to find the optimal action sequence in O(|y||y * |) time. By contrast, the Levenshtein Transformer restricts the oracle and model to insertion and deletion operations only.

Before computing the scores, we tokenize the German and English outputs using Moses and Japanese outputs using KyTea.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">10</ref> For lexically constrained decoding, we report the constraint preservation rate (CPR) in the translation outputs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">MT Tasks</head><p>Since our experiments involve two different toolkits, we first compare the same Transformer AR models built with Sockeye and with fairseq: the AR models achieve comparable decoding speed and translation quality regardless of toolkit -the Sockeye model obtains higher BLEU than the fairseq model on Ro-En and En-De but lower on En-Ja (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). Further comparisons will therefore center on the Sockeye AR model to better compare EDITOR with the lexically constrained decoding algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Post and Vilar, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> also shows that knowledge distillation has a small and inconsistent impact on AR models (Sockeye): it yields higher BLEU on Ro-En, close BLEU on En-De, and lower BLEU on En-Ja.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_9">11</ref> Thus, we use the AR models trained without distillation in further experiments.</p><p>Next, we compare the NAR models against the AR (Sockeye) baseline. As expected, both EDI-TOR and LevT achieve close translation quality to their AR teachers with 2-4 times speedup. BLEU differences are small (∆ &lt; 1.1) as in prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gu et al., 2019)</ref>. The RIBES trends are more surprising: both NAR models significantly outperform the AR models (Sockeye) on RIBES, except for En-Ja, where EDITOR and the AR models significantly outperforms LevT. This illustrates the strength of EDITOR in word reordering.</p><p>Finally, results confirm the benefits of EDI-TOR's reposition operation over LevT: decoding with EDITOR is 6-7% faster than LevT on Ro-En and En-De, and 33% faster on En-Ja -a more distant language pair which requires more reordering but no inflection changes on reordered words -with no statistically significant difference in BLEU nor RIBES, except for En-Ja, where ED-ITOR significantly outperforms LevT on RIBES. Overall, EDITOR is shown to be a good alternative to LevT on standard machine translation tasks and can also be used to replace the AR models in settings where decoding speed matters more than small differences in translation quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">MT with Soft Lexical Constraints</head><p>We now turn to the main evaluation of EDITOR on machine translation with soft lexical constraints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Conditions</head><p>We conduct a controlled comparison of the following approaches:</p><p>• NAR models: EDITOR and LevT view the lexical constraints as soft constraints, provided via the initial target sequence. We also explore the decoding technique introduced in Susanto et al. ( <ref type="formula">2020</ref>) to support hard constraints.</p><p>• AR models: they use the provided target words as hard constraints enforced at decoding time by an efficient form of constrained beam search: dynamic beam allocation (DBA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Post and Vilar, 2018)</ref>.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_10">12</ref> Crucially, all models, including EDITOR, are the exact same models evaluated on the standard MT tasks above, and do not need to be trained specifically to incorporate constraints.</p><p>We define lexical constraints as <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Post and Vilar (2018)</ref>: for each source sentence, we randomly select one to four words from the reference as lexical constraints. We then randomly shuffle the constraints and apply BPE to the constraint sequence. Different from the terminology test sets in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dinu et al. (2019)</ref> which contain only several hundred sentences with mostly nominal constraints, our constructed test sets are larger and include lexical constraints of all types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows that EDITOR exploits the soft constraints to strike a better balance between translation quality and decoding speed than other models. Compared to LevT, EDITOR preserves 7-17% more constraints and achieves significantly higher translation quality (+1.1-2.5 on   with beam = 4, EDITOR yields significantly higher BLEU (+1.0-2.2) and RIBES (+4.1-6.9) with 3-4 times decoding speedup. After increasing the beam to 10, EDITOR obtains lower BLEU but comparable RIBES with 6-7 times decoding speedup. 13 Note that AR models treat provided words as hard constraints and therefore achieve over 99% CPR by design, while NAR models treat them as soft constraints.</p><p>Results confirm that enforcing hard constraints increases CPR but degrades translation quality compared to the same model using soft constraints: for LevT, it degrades BLEU by 2.2-3.9 and RIBES by 5.0-6.6. For EDITOR, it degrades BLEU by 1.6-4.3 and RIBES by 3.1-4.4 (Table 3). By contrast, EDITOR with soft constraints strikes a better balance between translation quality and constraint preservation.</p><p>The strengths of EDITOR hold when varying the number of constraints (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>). For all tasks and models, adding constraints helps BLEU up to a certain point, ranging from 4 to 10 words. When 13  <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Post and Vilar (2018)</ref> show that the optimal beam size for DBA is 20. Our experiment on En-De shows that increasing the beam size from 10 to 20 improves BLEU by 0.7 at the cost of doubling the decoding time.</p><p>excluding the slower AR model (beam = 10), EDITOR consistently reaches the highest BLEU score with 2-10 constraints: EDITOR outperforms LevT and the AR model with beam = 4. Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Post and Vilar (2018)</ref>, as the number of constraints increases, the AR model needs larger beams to reach good performance. When the number of constraints increases to 10, EDI-TOR yields higher BLEU than the AR model on En-Ja and Ro-En, even after incurring the cost of increasing the AR beam to 10.</p><p>Are EDITOR improvements limited to preserving constraints better? We verify that this is not the case by computing the target word F1 binned by frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Neubig et al., 2019)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref> shows that EDITOR improves over LevT across all test frequency classes and closes the gap between NAR and AR models: the largest improvements are obtained for low and medium frequency words -on En-De and En-Ja, the largest improvements are on words with frequency between 5 and 1000, while on Ro-En, EDITOR improves more on words with frequency between 5 and 100. EDITOR also improves F1 on rare words (frequency in [0, 5)), but not as much as for more frequent words. now conduct further analysis to better understand the factors that contribute to EDITOR's advantages over LevT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impact of Reposition</head><p>We compare the average number of basic edit operations (Section 3.1) of different types used by EDITOR and LevT on each test sentence (averaged over the 5 runs): reposition (excluding deletion for controlled comparison with LevT), deletion, and insertion performed by LevT and EDITOR at decoding time.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We introduced EDITOR, a non-autoregressive transformer model that iteratively edits hypotheses using a novel reposition operation. Reposition combined with a new dual-path imitation learning strategy helps EDITOR generate output sequences that flexibly incorporate user's lexical choice preferences. Extensive experiments showed that ED-ITOR exploits soft lexical constraints more effectively than the Levenshtein Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gu et al., 2019)</ref> while speeding up decoding dramatically compared to constrained beam search <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Post and Vilar, 2018)</ref>. Results also confirm the benefits of using soft constraints over hard ones in terms of translation quality. EDITOR also achieves comparable or better translation quality with faster decoding speed than the Levenshtein Transformer on three standard MT tasks. These promising results open several avenues for future work, including using EDITOR for other generation tasks than MT and investigating its ability to incorporate more diverse constraint types into the decoding process.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure3: Our dual-path imitation learning process uses both the reposition and insertion policies during roll-in so that they can be trained to refine each other's outputs: Given an initial sequence y 0 , created by noising the reference y * , the roll-in policy stochastically generates intermediate sequences y ins and y rps via reposition and insertion respectively.
