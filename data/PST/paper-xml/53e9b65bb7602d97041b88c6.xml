<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Spiking neural P systems (SN P systems) have been well established as a novel class of distributed parallel computing models. Some features that SN P systems possess are attractive to fault diagnosis. However, handling fuzzy diagnosis knowledge and reasoning is required for many fault diagnosis applications. The lack of ability is a major problem of existing SN P systems when applying them to the fault diagnosis domain. Thus, we extend SN P systems by introducing some new ingredients (such as three types of neurons, fuzzy logic and new firing mechanism) and propose the fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems (FRSN P systems). The FRSN P systems are particularly suitable to model fuzzy production rules in a fuzzy diagnosis knowledge base and their reasoning process. Moreover, a parallel fuzzy reasoning algorithm based on FRSN P systems is developed according to neuron's dynamic firing mechanism. Besides, a practical example of transformer fault diagnosis is used to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed FRSN P systems in fault diagnosis problem.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The fault diagnosis of electrical machines have moved in recent years from traditional techniques to artificial intelligence techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. In order to guarantee the secure and stable operation of electrical equipment, it is very important to diagnose its faults rapidly and accurately. More recently, a large number of methods or models using artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering have been addressed, such as expert system, Bayesian networks, artificial neural networks, and genetic algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. Unfortunately, however, most of the existing methods are capable of dealing with simple diagnosis reasoning. Consequently, their reasoning processes are often difficult when complex diagnosis are shown.</p><p>Membrane computing is a class of distributed parallel computing models inspired by the structure and functioning of living cells, as well as from the way the cells are organized in tissues or higher order structures, which was introduced by Gh. Pa ˘un in 2000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In the membrane computing domain, this kind computing systems (devices) are commonly called P systems. The main ingredients of a P system are (i) the membrane structure (a rooted tree), delimiting compartments where (ii) multisets of objects evolve according to (iii) (reaction) rules of a bio-chemical inspiration <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. According to their structures, these models can be divided into three categories: cell-like P systems, tissue-like P systems and neural-like P systems. Spiking neural P systems (SN P systems) firstly introduced by Ionescu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, as main forms of neural-like P systems recently investigated, are incorporated into membrane computing from the way that biological neurons communicate through electrical impulses of identical form (spikes). An SN P system can be viewed as a set of neurons placed in the nodes of a directed graph whose arcs represent the synaptic connections among the neurons. The flow of information is inherently realized by the exciting of pulse potentials, which are encoded by the so-called spikes. The spikes are objects of a unique type and are placed inside the neurons and can be sent from presynaptic to postsynaptic neurons according to specific firing/spiking rules and by means of forgetting rules which are associated with neuron. By applying a firing/spiking rule some spikes are consumed and new spikes are produced. The spikes produced are sent to all neurons linked by a synapse to the neuron where the rule is used. By applying a forgetting rule, spikes are removed from neurons. Currently, SN P systems and a number of variants have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. However, only a few results applied to practical problems have been addressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</p><p>This paper focuses on the application of SN P systems paradigm to the fault diagnosis problem. In addition to distributed and parallel computing advantage, the following features can be summarized from inherent mechanism of SN P systems: (i) high understandability (due to their directed graph structure), (ii) dynamically (neuron's firing and spiking mechanisms make them suitable to model dynamic behaviors of a system), (iii) synchronization (that makes them suitable to describe concurrent events or activities), (iv) non-linearly (that makes them suitable to process non-linear situation), (v) nondeterministically. As we know, fault diagnosis problem can refer to the handling of the uncertainty and incompleteness, the representation of diagnosis knowledge and reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. These features and advantage of SN P systems seem to be suitable to model diagnosis knowledge and reasoning to fault diagnosis. However, major drawback of existing SN P systems and their variants is not capable of handling incomplete and uncertain information.</p><p>In this paper we propose a class of extended SN P systems, called fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems (FRSN P systems). Some new ingredients are introduced to extend original SN P systems, including three types of neurons (proposition neurons, ''AND''-type and ''OR''-type rule neurons), fuzzy truth value, fuzzy logic and new firing mechanism. The FRSN P systems can well model and visualize fuzzy production rules in a diagnosis knowledge base due to their graphical nature. Combination of neuron's new firing mechanism and fuzzy logic ensures to automatically accomplish dynamic fuzzy reasoning. Furthermore, a fuzzy reasoning algorithm based on matrix operations is developed, which can give full play to maximally parallel computing advantage of the FRSN P systems.</p><p>The present paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews some concepts of SN P systems, and then describes the proposed FRSN P systems. Section 3 describes a modeling method of fuzzy production rules based on the FRSN P systems. A fuzzy reasoning algorithm based on the proposed FRSN P systems is presented in Section 4. A fault diagnosis example is provided in Section 5, and conclusions are discussed in Section 6.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">SN P systems</head><p>Here, we briefly review the basic concepts of SN P systems in the computing form (i.e., able to take some inputs and provide some outputs) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>). Definition 1. A SN P system of degree m P 1, is a construct of the form P ¼ ðA; r 1 ; . . . ; r m ; syn; I; OÞ where (1) A = {a} is the singleton alphabet (the object a is called spike);</p><p>(2) r 1 , . . . , r m are neurons, of the form r i = (n i , r i ) with i 2 {1, . . . , m}, where (i) n i P 0 is the initial number of spikes contained by neuron r i ;</p><p>(ii) r i is a finite set of rules of the form E=a c ! a p ; d where E is a regular expression over a, c P 1 and p, d P 0, with c P p; if p = 0, then E is the empty string, d = 0, and a s belongs to the language generated by expression E for no rule E/a c ? a p ; d(c P p P 1) from r i . (3) syn # {1, 2, . . . , m} Â {1, 2, . . ., m} with ij for all (i, j) 2 syn, 1 6 i, j 6 m (synapses between neurons). (4) I and O are input neuron set and output neuron set, respectively.</p><p>In the above definition, the rule E/a c ? a p ;d with p P 1 is called firing/spiking rule; the rule E/a c ? a p ;d with p = d = 0 is written in the form a c ? k and is called forgetting rule. The firing mechanism of neurons can be explained as follows: if a neuron r i contains k spikes, a k belongs to the language generated by expression E (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> for further details about language theory), and k P c, the firing/spiking rule E/a c ? a p ; d 2 r i (with p P 1) in neuron r i is enabled and can be applied. This means that c spikes are consumed, k À c spikes remain in the neuron, the neuron is fired, and then it produces p spikes after d time units. If d = 0 the spikes are emitted immediately. In the case d P 1, if the rule is used at step t, the neuron is ''closed'' or ''blocked'' at steps t, t + 1, . . . , t + d À 1, and it cannot receive new spikes from other neurons. At step t + d, the neuron emitts spikes and becomes again open, hence it can receive spikes. The p spikes emitted by the neuron r i are replicated and they go to all neurons r j such that (i, j) 2 syn (each such neuron r j of them receives p spikes). A forgetting rule a c ? k is applicable to a neuron wheteher the neuron contains exactly c spikes and then all c spikes are removed. SN P systems are synchronized because a global clock is assumed, marking the time for the whole system. Besides, SN P systems are non-deterministic because two rules E 1 =a c 1 ! a p 1 ; d 1 and E 2 =a c 2 ! a p 2 ; d 2 can have L(E 1 ) \ L(E 2 ) -;. Therefore, it is possible that two or more rules of the system can be enabled in a neuron. In this case, one of them is non-deterministically chosen to be used. Moreover, in each time unit, if a neuron can use a rule, the rule must be used. Each neuron deals with its spikes in the sequential manner, only using one rule in each time unit, but the rules are used in parallel for all neurons of the system.</p><p>An instantaneous description or a configuration at any instant of a SN P system is described by both the number of spikes in each neuron and the state of the neuron, more precisely, by the number of steps to count down until it becomes open (this number is zero if the neuron is already open). The initial configuration is described by the number of spikes initially placed in each neuron, n 1 , n 2 , . . . , n m , with all neurons being open. A configuration is a halting configuration if all neurons are open and no rule of the system is applicable to it. Using the rules described above, one can define transitions among configurations. We say that configuration C 1 yields configuration C 2 in one transition step, denoted by C 1 ) P C 2 , if we can pass from C 1 to C 2 by applying the rules from the system following the previous remarks.</p><p>A computation of P is a (finite or infinite) sequence of configurations such that:</p><p>1. the first term of the sequence is the initial configuration of the system; 2. each non-initial configuration of the sequence is obtained from the previous configuration by a transtion step; and 3. if the sequence is finite (called halting computation) then the last term of the sequence is a halting configuration.</p><p>A computation in a system as above starts in the initial configuration. In order to compute a function f:N k ? N we introduce k natural numbers q 1 , . . . , q k in the system by ''reading'' from the environment a binary sequence z ¼ 10 q 1 À1 10 q 2 À1 1 . . . 10 q k À1 1 This means that the input neuron of P receives a spike in each step corresponding to a digit 1 from the string z and no spike otherwise. Note that we input exactly k + 1 spikes, i.e., after the last spike we assume that no further spike is coming to the input neuron.</p><p>With any computation (halting or not) we can associate a spike train, sequence of symbols 0 and 1 describing the behavior of the output neuron: if the output neuron spikes, then we write 1; otherwise we write 0. Besides, we also associate other forms of computation results according to different computing purposes, such as, the distance between two consecutive steps when there are spikes which exit the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">FRSN P systems</head><p>The goal of this paper is to develop a new modeling method for fault diagnosis inspired by SN P systems. As stated above, fault diagnosis can involve such a problem, that is, representation of fuzzy diagnosis knowledge and fuzzy reasoning. However, current forms of existing SN P systems and their variants cannot deal with the problem. In order to make them able to handle fuzzy diagnosis knowledge and fuzzy reasoning, we will extend the definition of SN P systems and propose a new class of extended SN P systems, called fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems (FRSN P systems, in short). Definition 2. A FRSN P system of degree m P 1, is a construct of the form P ¼ ðA; r 1 ; . . . ; r m ; syn; I; OÞ where (1) A = {a} is the singleton alphabet (the object a is called spike);</p><p>(2) r 1 , . . . , r m are neurons, of the form r i = (a i , s i , r i ) with i 2 {1, . . . , m} where (i) a i 2 [0, 1] and it is called the (potential) value of spike contained in neuron r i (also called pulse value); (ii) s i 2 [0, 1] is the truth value associated with neuron r i ;</p><p>(iii) r i is a firing/spiking rule contained in neuron r i , of the form E/a a ? a b , where a, b 2 [0, 1].</p><p>(3) syn # {1, 2, . . . , m} Â {1, 2, . . . , m} with ij for all (i, j) 2 syn, 1 6 i, j 6 m (synapses between neurons); (4) I and O are input neuron set and output neuron set, respectively. Now, we explain how the FRSN P systems are extended from SN P systems. First of all, content of neuron is denoted by a fuzzy truth value in [0, 1] instead of the number of spikes in SN P systems, which can be interpreted as the (potential) value of spike from the view point of biological neuron. For a neuron r i , if a i &gt; 0, we say the neuron contains a spike with (potential) value a i ; otherwise, the neuron contains no spike. Secondly, each neuron in FRSN P systems will associate with either a fuzzy proposition or a fuzzy production rule, and s i 2 [0, 1] will be used to express the truth value of the fuzzy proposition or confidence factor (CF) of the fuzzy production rule. Thirdly, each neuron contains only one spiking (firing) rule, of the form E/ a a ? a b , where E = a n is called the firing condition and n is the number of input synapses from other neurons to the neuron. The firing condition E = a n indicates that if the neuron receives n spikes the spiking rule can be applied; otherwise the rule cannot be enabled until n spikes are received. When the number of spikes received by a neuron is less than n, value of the spikes received will be updated according to logical ''AND'' or ''OR'' operations. Fourthly, the firing mechanism of neurons in FRSN P systems can be described as follows. For the neuron r i , if its firing rule E/a a ? a b can be applied, this means that its pulse value a &gt; 0 is consumed (removed), the neuron fires, and then it produces a spike with value b. Once the spike with value b is excited from neuron r i , all neurons r j with (i, j) 2 syn will immediately receive the spike. Further, three types of neurons are defined (see Definitions 3-5 below). The three types of neurons use different ways to handle both a and b, and b is relative with both a and s i . Finally, time delay is ignored in FRSN P system, thus all neurons are always open.</p><p>As stated above, neurons in FRSN P system are classified into three classes: proposition neuron, ''AND''-type rule neuron and ''OR''-type rule neuron. These types of neurons are defined as follows.</p><p>Definition 3. The proposition neurons are a class of neurons, which are associated with propositions in a fuzzy knowledge base.</p><p>A proposition neuron can be denoted by r = (a, s, r), where a is its pulse value, s is the truth value of the proposition associated with it, and r is its spiking rule of the form E/a a ? a a . If a proposition neuron r is an input neuron in P, then we have a = s; otherwise, a equals to logical ''OR'' operation of all pulse values received from other neurons. After the neuron updates its content, the truth value of the corresponding proposition will be equal to its pulse value, i.e., s = a. When the neuron fires and applies its firing rule, it will produce a spike with pulse value a. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a proposition neuron. Definition 4. The ''AND''-type rule neurons are a class of neurons, which are associated with fuzzy production rules with ''AND''-type antecedent part, where confidence factor (CF) of each the rule is denoted by s.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows a ''AND''-type rule neuron, which is labeled by the symbol ''AND''. When a ''AND''-type rule neuron receives n pulse values from other neurons, a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a n , it uses logic operator ''AND'' to combine its all inputs, i.e., a = min (a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a n ), where a i 2 [0, 1], 1 6 i 6 n. If its firing condition E is satisfied, it fires and applies its spiking rule E/a a ? a b to produce a spike with value b = a Ã s, hence b = min(a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a n ) Ã s; otherwise, it only updates its content by using pulse values of the received pikes.</p><p>Definition 5. The ''OR''-type rule neurons are a class of neurons, which are associated with fuzzy production rules with ''OR''-type antecedent part, where confidence factor (CF) of each the rule is denoted by s.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows a ''OR''-type rule neuron, which is labeled by the symbol ''OR''. When a ''OR''-type rule neuron receives n pulse values from other neurons, a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a n , it uses the logic operator ''OR'' to combine its all inputs, i.e., a = max (a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a n ), where a i 2 [0, 1], 1 6 i 6 n. Similarly, when E is satisfied, it fires and applies its spiking rule E/a a ? a b to produce a spike with value b = a Ã s, hence b = max(a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a n )Ãs; otherwise, it only updates its content by using pulse values of the received pikes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Fuzzy production rules</head><p>In fault diagnosis application, diagnosis knowledge extracted from real-world data are usually expressed by fuzzy production rules. To date, fuzzy production rule is a widely used tool for fuzzy knowledge representation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>). Usually, a simple fuzzy production rule is of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R i : IF p j THEN p k ðCF ¼ s i Þ<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where R i indicates ith fuzzy production rule of a fuzzy diagnosis knowledge base and s i 2 [0, 1] is its confidence factor. p j and p k are two propositions and their truth values are real numbers in [0, 1].</p><p>In addition to above simple fuzzy production rule, composite fuzzy production rules are widely used in fuzzy diagnosis knowledge base, where their antecedent part or consequence part usually contain ''and'' or ''or'' connectors. Generally, composite fuzzy production rules can be classified as the following three types.</p><p>Type 1 R i : IF p 1 and p 2 and . . . and</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p kÀ1 THEN p k ðCF ¼ s i Þ ð 2Þ</formula><p>The type rule is a composite conjunctive fuzzy production rule, where p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p kÀ1 are propositions in the antecedent part of the rule, and s i 2 [0, 1] is a real number and it expresses the confidence factor of the rule. Suppose truth values of propositions p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p kÀ1 are a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a kÀ1 respectively. Then, truth value of proposition p k can be evaluated as a k = min(a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a kÀ1 ) Ã s i . where s i 2 [0, 1] is the confidence factor of the rule and p 1 is alone proposition in the antecedent part of the rule.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">FRSN P system model for fuzzy production rules</head><p>In order to model fuzzy production rules of a fuzzy diagnosis knowledge base, we need map them into a FRSN P system model. The basic principle can be described as follows. Each proposition in the fuzzy diagnosis knowledge base is represented by a proposition neuron, while each fuzzy production rule is expressed by a rule neuron (''AND''-type neuron or ''OR''-type neuron). At the initial stage, each input proposition neuron contains a spike and its pulse value is assigned to the truth value of the proposition associated with it. Moreover, value s i of each rule neuron is assigned to the confidence factor of the fuzzy production rule associated with it. Consequently, fuzzy production rules of a fuzzy diagnosis knowledge base can be modeled by FRSN P systems, and their dynamic reasoning process can be realized by the firing mechanism of neurons.</p><p>According to the above principle, simple fuzzy production rule (1) can be modeled by the following FRSN P system P 0 . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref> shows the model P 0 and its reasoning result.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Reasoning algorithm based on FRSN P systems</head><p>In this section, we will present a fuzzy reasoning algorithm based on FRSN P systems. Suppose all fuzzy production rules in a fuzzy diagnosis knowledge base have been modeled by a FRSN P system model P. The model P consists of m neurons, where r = {r 1 , r 2 , . . . , r n } are its n proposition neurons, r ¼ f r 1 ; r 2 ; . . . ; r k g are its k rule neurons (''AND'' type neurons or 'OR'' type neurons), m = n + k. Usually, we should provide the fuzzy truth values for a part of the fuzzy propositions before reasoning, and proposition neurons associated with the part of fuzzy propositions are indeed input neurons of P. The goal of the reasoning algorithm is to reason out the fuzzy truth values of other unknown fuzzy propositions (proposition neurons) from known fuzzy propositions (input neurons). These unknown fuzzy propositions are often associated with output neurons of P. The reasoning algorithm developed here is based on neuron's firing and uses matrix operation. a result, The reasoning algorithm give full play to the advantages parallel computing of FRSN P systems.</p><p>In the following, in order to succinctly illustrate the fuzzy reasoning algorithm, we introduce some matrix and vector notations as follows.</p><p>(1) U = (u ij ) nÂk is a binary matrix, where u ij 2 {0, 1}. u ij = 1 if there is a directed arc (synapse) from proposition neuron r i to rule neuron r j . u ij = 0 if there is no directed arc (synapse) from proposition neuron r i to rule neuron r j .</p><p>(2) V = (v ij ) nÂk is a binary matrix, where v ij 2 {0, 1}. v ij = 1 if there is a directed arc (synapse) from rule neuron r j to proposition neuron r i . v ij = 0 if there is no directed arc (synapse) from rule neuron r j to proposition neuron r i .</p><p>(3) K = diag(s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s k ) is a diagonal matrix, where s i represents confidence factor of ith production rule associated with rule neuron</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">r i ; 1 6 i 6 k.

Thus, initial truth value vector a 0 p ¼ ð0:8; 0:2; 0:8; 0:8; 0:9; 0:8; 0:2; 0:9; 0:1; 0:2; 0; 0; 0; 0Þ T and initial spike vector a 0 p ¼ ð1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 0; 0; 0; 0Þ T .

According to reasoning algorithm described above, we have (1) a 1 p ¼ ð0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0Þ T ; a 1 r ¼ ð0:16; 0:64; 0:08; 0:16Þ T , a 1 p ¼ ð0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0Þ T ; a 1 r ¼ ð2; 4; 4; 3Þ T .

These reasoning results indicate the following possible faults: general overheating fault (confidence = 0.16), serious overheating fault (confidence = 0.64), partial discharge (confidence = 0.08) and spark discharge (confidence = 0.16). In the fault diagnosis system, the threshold value of fault occurrence is set to be 0.6. Thus, we can conclude that the transformer shows a serious overheating fault, which is consistent with the actual situation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we present a novel model for fault diagnosis, called fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems (FRSN P tems). The FRSN P system can visually represent fuzzy production rules of a fuzzy diagnosis knowledge base and effectively model the corresponding dynamic reasoning behavior because of its nature of directed graph and firing mechanism of neurons. Based on parallel computing feature of FRSN P systems and dynamic firing mechanism of neurons, a parallel fuzzy reasoning algorithm is developed. Moreover, a practical example of transformer fault diagnosis is used to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of FRSN P systems in the fault diagnosis area. From another point of view, FRSN P systems are new extended forms of SN P systems, which can handle fuzzy information and express fuzzy knowledge. This will open a door for more practical applications that need to deal with fuzzy information.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
