<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In order to make good decisions about the design of information systems, an essential skill is to understand process models of the business domain the system is intended to support. Yet, little knowledge to date has been established about the factors that affect how model users comprehend the content of process models. In this study, we use theories of semiotics and cognitive load to theorize how model and personal factors influence how model viewers comprehend the syntactical information of process models. We then report on a four-part series of experiments, in which we examined these factors. Our results show that additional semantical information impedes syntax comprehension, and that theoretical knowledge eases syntax comprehension. Modeling experience further contributes positively to comprehension efficiency, measured as the ratio of correct answers to the time taken to provide answers. We discuss implications for practice and research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, the documentation of business processes and the analysis and design of process-aware information systems has gained attention as a primary focus of modeling in information systems practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The so-called practice of process modeling has emerged as a key instrument to enable decision making in the context of the analysis and design of process-aware enterprise systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, service-oriented architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, workflow operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and web services <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> alike.</p><p>Process models typically capture in some graphical notation the tasks, events, states, and control flow logic that constitute a business process. Process models may also contain information regarding the data that is processed by the execution of tasks, which organizational and IT resources are involved, and potentially capture other artifacts such as external stakeholders and performance metrics, see e.g. Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p><p>Many benefits are associated with business process modeling. For instance, practitioners have identified process improvement, communication and shared understanding as the most important process modeling benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. A prerequisite for realizing these benefits, however, is that the quality of process models are perceived as good by their audience, making the understandability of process models an important topic for research relevant to all potential uses of process models <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Several studies support this view. For instance, the perceived quality of a process model is a key factor contributing to organizational re-design project success <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Accordingly, our interest in this paper is to examine how analysts develop an understanding of process models.</p><p>More specifically, we study (a) factors characterizing the process model in terms of the activity labels used in the models, (b) factors characterizing the person interpreting the models in terms of relevant modeling expertise, and (c) how these factors affect process model comprehension. The relevance of this research stems from companies making significant investments in process modeling training, with the view of developing a body of process modeling expertise. Indeed, modeler expertise has been established by surveys as an important factor for process modeling success <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and modeling grammar usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Furthermore, prior experiments demonstrate that model factors (e.g., an increase in model complexity) affect understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>. Notably, these experiments use abstract activity labels (A, B, C, etc.) in their process models, which, in turn, raises the question whether the usage of activity labels that carry real domain semantics leverages or impedes understanding.</p><p>The aim of the research reported here is to combine these preliminary insights in the definition of a series of experiments. Accordingly, the contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we build on the cognitive load theory to conjecture that real activity labels should decrease syntactical process model understanding. This hypothesis is confirmed in our experiments. Second, we argue in line with prior research that higher modeling expertise results in better understanding performance. This hypothesis is generally confirmed, too. Third, we define different measures of expertise including theoretical knowledge, prior modeling experience, and intensity of modeling. The experiments show that theoretical knowledge is most significant with its impact on performance. Our findings have implications for research on model understanding, in particular regarding cognitive load considerations, and for practice by demonstrating the relevance of theoretical knowledge of process modeling to understanding these models. This insight, in turn, is relevant to informing a staged teaching strategy that educates practitioners about how to read process models.</p><p>The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the theoretical foundations of process model comprehension. We identify matters of process model understanding and respective challenges. This leads us to factors of understanding. Section 3 describes the research design and Section 4 the results along with a discussion of threats to validity. Section 5 highlights implications for research and practice. Section 6 concludes the article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background</head><p>In this section, we discuss the background of our research. Section 2.1 summarizes which formal conclusions can be drawn from a process model and how understanding performance can be measured. Section 2.2 formalizes our hypotheses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Process model comprehension</head><p>Process modeling has emerged as an important practice to guide decisions in systems analysis and design. In fact, process modeling is the number one reason to engage in conceptual modeling altogether <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and also considered the number one skill demanded from IT graduates. 1 Analysts develop process models to capture relevant information about a business process they seek to re-design, analyze, or support with an appropriate information system. A business process that is in place to deal with a book order may, for example, contain a task to receive the order, which is followed by another one specifying that the book is to be sent to the customer who ordered it. A model of this process would, therefore, include sequences of graphical elements to describe these tasks and the order in which they have to be performed. Process models can be elicited through interviews with relevant stakeholders, or derived from organizational documents such as business policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> show two variants of a typical process model, conveying information about important tasks and the control flow that specifies the execution of these tasks.</p><p>In reaching an understanding about how individuals comprehend the content of process models, we realize that there is a broad spectrum of matters that can be understood from a process model. The SEQUAL model by Lindland et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, for instance, distinguishes syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic dimensions of model quality. Consider Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, which show two structurally equivalent process models. The model of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> contains activities that are labeled with capital letters. Therefore, this model can only be analyzed from a syntactical point of view. On the other hand, the model of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> includes German language activity labels. As these labels point to a specific real-world application domain (i.e., they describe which activities in the realworld domain specifically are to be executed), they enable the discussion of the model from a semantic point of view. If now this model is communicated in a particular context, e.g. it is communicated as a normative model, then we can also investigate its pragmatics. In this way, a process model can represent knowledge for action <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Semiotic theory postulates that comprehension, and consequently, communication, can be understood as a ladder: syntax (how do I faithfully combine grammatical elements in a process model? <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>) must be clear before semantics can be discussed, and semantics (what do the grammatical elements in a process model mean? <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>) must be clear before pragmatics can be considered. In this regard, it is a primary interest to analyze in how far stakeholders are able to understand process models on a syntactical level. Other interpretations are flawed if syntax is not correctly understood. This is also acknowledged by prior studies that focus on formal and syntactical aspects of process models <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>.</p><p>Looking at which factors influence the comprehension of the syntactical content of process models, prior research has discussed several factors of process model understanding including model purpose <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, problem domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, modeling notation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>, visual presentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>, and process model complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Personal factors, on the other hand, have been less intensively researched to date. This is not to say that no research has been conducted. The experiment by Recker and Dreiling, for instance, operationalized the notion of process modeling expertise through a measure of familiarity with a particular modeling notation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. In an experiment by Mendling, Reijers, and Cardoso, participants were characterized based on the number of process models they created and the years of modeling experience they had  achieved <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. This study, furthermore, also indicated the specific importance of theoretical process modeling knowledge. In the latter experiment the participants from TU Eindhoven with strong Petri net education scored better than other participants with less theoretical education in process modeling. These studies emphasize the value of looking into more details for the impact of expertise, in a sense of previous experience with modeling, and in a sense of knowledge of fundamental process modeling concepts, which is the intent of our study.</p><p>Aside from these important personal factors, we also aim to examine model factors that have not received much attention in prior studies. Specifically, we aim to investigate the effect of semantical information on formal syntactical process model understanding. Therefore, we consider model semantics as expressed in the textual labels, which are used to annotate the graphical activity constructs in a process model (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), and which are important to the usefulness of the models <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. While one may expect that people might be able to better recall a model with textual information due to a broader activation of different concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, there is an opposite effect to be expected when only questions about syntax are asked. The theoretical rationale for this expectation stems from the cognitive load theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. The main assumptions of the cognitive load theory are limited working memory and its interaction with a practically unlimited long-term memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. When individuals study new material (e.g., information about a business process from a process model) they increase their cognitive load, i.e., the burden on their working memory. This is important because working memory has the capacity to process approximately seven items of information at any given time <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Clearly, a long text label in comparison to a single letter implies a higher cognitive load. Textual labels might accordingly distract persons from drawing correct conclusions about formal and syntactical aspects of a process model because a larger share of the working memory is required to process the textual information and the domain information they represent. In this way, a variation of activity labels is an interesting treatment as it should be more detrimental to inexperienced model readers due to the implied cognitive load <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</p><p>On the basis of these theoretical arguments, we define the following research objective: analyze business process models for the purpose of understanding with respect to their syntactical and semantic content from the point of view of model readers in the context of varying prior experience with modeling. Now we formalize our expectations in a set of testable hypotheses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Hypotheses</head><p>In theorizing anticipated effects of the factors discussed above on process model understanding, we first define our operationalization of process model understanding. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, we investigate syntactic understanding from two angles, these being comprehension task performance (how faithfully does the interpretation of the process model allow the reader to comprehend the formal content of the model?) and comprehension task efficiency (what resources are used by the reader to comprehend the process model?). Both factors are important elements in Norman's theory of action <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, and relate to what Norman calls "the gulf of interpretation" (a difference between what the model tries to convey and what is interpreted by the model reader). The gulf of interpretation is an important measure of the performance of modeling efforts, because model comprehension by relevant stakeholders is a necessary prerequisite for various model application tasks, such as systems analysis, communication, design, organizational re-engineering, project management, end user querying and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. In other words, for a model to be useful for any modeling-related task, it is imperative that the stakeholders doing these tasks are able to comprehend the model well (performance) and timely (efficiency).</p><p>We now draw hypotheses regarding the effects of personal and model factors on model readers' comprehension task performance and efficiency. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows our research model. The model proposes that process model understanding (in terms of comprehension accuracy and comprehension efficiency) is a function of the characteristics of the model of the process, and of the characteristics of the user interpreting the model.</p><p>Our first hypothesis addresses model factors. While prior studies have examined model characteristics such as model structure and complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, our interest is in the textual labels that are used in process models to annotate the graphical constructs. Graphical constructs, and their relationships, are used to convey information about the structure of a process and its formal behavior.  performed, what is an important document, who within an organization is responsible for execution, and so forth). Based on this distinction, we expect that model readers will be able to more easily understand the formal, syntactical aspects of a process model, as expressed in the grammatical constructs and their relationships, when they are not presented with additional, semantic information about the application domain (in the textual labels). This is because the textual labels increase the cognitive burden on the model viewer in that the textual labels are an additional set of information material that needs to be processed by the working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, but which is largely irrelevant to the comprehension of the formal content of a process model, which is the interest in our study.</p><p>We further expect that comprehension occurs quicker for people working with process models featuring abstract textual labels, because they require less effort to retrieve and assemble pieces of information in their working memory, when only having to consider graphical constructs but not additional textual information. We formalize these observations in the first two hypotheses:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H 0 1</formula><p>. The use of abstract labels will have no impact on comprehension task performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H a</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1</head><p>. The use of abstract labels will have a significant positive impact on comprehension task performance.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">H 0 2</formula><p>. The use of abstract labels will have no impact on comprehension task efficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H a</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2</head><p>. The use of abstract labels will have a significant positive impact on comprehension task efficiency.</p><p>Next, we consider personal factors. First, we theorize that individuals with higher levels of knowledge about formal process model concepts such as deadlocks, soundness, concurrency and so forth will achieve better comprehension task performance and efficiency. This is because, when interpreting a process model, these individuals can make use of prior knowledge, i.e., relevant knowledge material stored in long-term memory can be applied to reduce the cognitive load on their working memory, which will ease, and improve their understanding of the material (the process model) presented to them. Accordingly, we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">H 0 3</formula><p>. Users with higher levels of process knowledge will not have higher comprehension task performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H a</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3</head><p>. Users with higher levels of process knowledge will have significantly higher comprehension task performance.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">H 0 4</formula><p>. Users with higher levels of process knowledge will not have higher comprehension task efficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H a</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4</head><p>. Users with higher levels of process knowledge will have significantly better comprehension task efficiency.</p><p>Second, we realize that modeling expertise is an important factor in process modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. Experienced modelers often possess a repertoire of workarounds for challenging modeling situations, and can often refer to their previous experiences and knowledge about modeling when attempting to interpret complex models. Less experienced modelers, on the other hand, often lack such knowledge, which, in turn, can be expected to affect their comprehension accuracy and efficiency.</p><p>The resource allocation theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> suggests that when users build up experience in modeling, their demand for cognitive attentional effort required to perform the model-related tasks is reduced, thereby freeing cognitive resources that can be allocated to improving task performance and outcome production (i.e., better and faster understanding). This situation would suggest that experienced modelers can read process models better and with less effort. We distinguish between modelers that have modeled for a long time (i.e., that have modeling experience) and those that model often (i.e., that have  modeling intensity), to be able to examine modeling experience in a more detailed manner. We state the following hypotheses:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">H 0 5</formula><p>. Users with higher levels of modeling experience will have equal comprehension task performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H a</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5</head><p>. Users with higher levels of modeling experience will have significantly higher comprehension task performance. H 0</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6</head><p>. Users with higher levels of modeling experience will have equal comprehension task efficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H a</head></div>

Users with higher levels of modeling experience will have significantly better comprehension task efficiency.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">H 0 7</formula><p>. Users with higher levels of modeling intensity will have equal comprehension task performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H a</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7</head><p>. Users with higher levels of modeling intensity will have significantly higher comprehension task performance.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">H 0 8</formula><p>. Users with higher levels of modeling intensity will have significantly better comprehension task efficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H a</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>8</head><p>. Users with higher levels of modeling intensity will have significantly better comprehension task efficiency.</p><p>In the following, we describe design and results of a series of experiments we conducted to test these hypotheses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experiment description</head><p>For investigating the hypotheses, we define an experiment following established guidelines for experimental software engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>. Because there is only limited research on cognitive load effects in the process modeling domain, we chose an experimental method as it affords a higher internal validity than other methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. With this experiment definition, we aim to analyze process models for the purpose of understanding with respect to comprehension task performance and comprehension task efficiency. In particular, the analyses are conducted from the perspective of a reader of the model, and the experiment's context is given through persons with process modeling skills answering questions about the meaning of a process model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Experiment design</head><p>To test our hypotheses, we selected a 2 × (4× 4 × 4) mixed balanced experimental design that allowed us to focus on personal factors and model characteristics while eliminating potentially confounding other variables (e.g., domain knowledge). Our experimental design featured one between-subjects factor and three within-subjects factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">Experimental condition and tasks</head><p>The between-subjects factor, Label Type, had two levels. We provided participants with process models that contained either abstract or concrete labels. To operationalize this factor, we gathered a set of six process models from practice that capture business processes in two different domains, order processing and price calculation. The models were provided by a partner organization, which has these models in real use for process documentation purposes. The models were randomly selected from their collection of process models. The models could all be displayed on an A4 page and ranged from nine to twenty activities, and contained between six and fifteen connectors. These characteristics are similar to those found in process model collections in practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Therefore, we deemed these models to be adequate experimental treatments given that the cases reflect modeling scenarios typically encountered in real-life process modeling practice. Based on the observation in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> that EPCs appear to be easier to understand than Petri nets, we chose an EPClike notation without events. The participants received a short informal description of the semantics similar to ([29], p. 25). Finally, we drew all models in the same top-to-bottom style with the start element at the top and end element at the bottom. Altogether, each participant was challenged with four tasks (see Appendix A):</p><p>(1) self-assess process modeling intensity, (2) self-assess process modeling experience, (3) answer theoretical knowledge test, and (4) answer process model comprehension questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">Independent variables</head><p>To operationalize the between-subjects factor Label Type as an independent variable, for each of the process models used we constructed a variant where the activity labels were replaced by abstract capital letters as identifiers. Figs. 1 and 2 depict model number 4 of the models we used in our experiment. For the 6 models we identified 6 yes/no questions related to the structure and the process flow specified by the model. These questions together with questions on personal experience and knowledge of process modeling were packed into two variants of the questionnaire, one for models with original activity labels (textual labels), one for models with letters (abstract labels).</p><p>Aside from the between-subjects factor Label Type, we also defined three within-subject factors. The first within-subjects factor Knowledge had four levels. The participants had to answer twelve theoretical yes/no questions before seeing the models about selected topics related to process modeling such as choices, concurrency, loops, and deadlocks (see Appendix A). These questions concern grammatical rules of process model logic, derived from fundamental work in this area <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and as previously used in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. We transformed the knowledge score into an ordinal knowledge scale with four levels: very low (0-3 correct answers), somewhat low (4-6 correct answers), somewhat high (7-9 correct answers) and very high (10-12 correct answers). This ordinal measure served as a second independent variable. The second within-subjects factor Experience had four levels. The participants were asked for how long they have been involved with business process modeling. The variable was measured on an ordinal scale with four levels: less than one month, less than a year, less than three years, and longer than three years. This measure served as a third independent variable. Finally, the third within-subjects factor Intensity also had four levels. The participants had to indicate how often they work with process models. We used an ordinal scale with four options to answer: daily, monthly, less frequent than monthly, never. This measure served as a fourth independent variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.">Dependent variables</head><p>We use two dependent variables, comprehension task performance and comprehension task efficiency. Comprehension Task Performance is calculated based on the answers given by the participant to the model comprehension questions. It captures the number of correct answers by the person. The maximum value is 36 for six questions on six models. This measure serves as an operationalization of formal process model understanding of a person.</p><p>Comprehension Task Efficiency is based on the task completion time that the participants invested in answering the different questions in the questionnaire. The measure is calculated by dividing the number of correct answers (Comprehension Task Performance) by the time it takes to complete the respective questions, and served as a second dependent variable in our study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Experiment execution</head><p>We implemented the experiment in two ways. First, we defined an online experiment in order to make access to practitioners with modeling experience more easy. The automated system further allowed us to record the answer times, randomly assign the subject to a label type, and randomly define the presentation order of the six models in the corresponding label type, thereby ensuring a balanced treatment. Participation was voluntary. As an incentive the participants received feedback about their test performance.</p><p>In 2007, we distributed the link to the experiment via the German mailing lists EMISA and WI as well as among students that followed courses on process modeling at the Vienna University of Economics and Business. Typically, both academics and practitioners with an interest in conceptual modeling and information systems development are registered with these lists. The questionnaire was started by 200 persons and completed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref>. From these 46 we excluded 4 people who spent less than 10 minutes time on the questionnaire since we assumed that to be the minimum time to provide meaningful answers. The remaining 42 persons and their answers to the 36 questions establish the first part of the sample for our statistical analysis below. Altogether, 1512 answers are recorded in the sample. 65% of the participants had more than three years experience in process modeling.</p><p>To increase confidence in the conclusion validity of our study, we collected further data with paper-based replications of the experiment. The first replication in April 2009 involved 23 graduate students from Vienna University of Economics and Business who followed a course on modeling. The second sample includes 22 graduate students who followed the same course in June 2009. 2 The third replication was conducted with 32 graduate students who followed the system analysis and design course at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. From all four experiments we collected data from altogether 119 persons. With each answering 36 questions, we get 4284 answers to model understanding questions.</p><p>These four experiments correspond to a strict replication according to Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, with the variation between the experiments being only in the institution of the participants and the mode of presentation (web versus paper). Because neither institutional affiliation nor mode of presentation is a relevant factor in our study, our replication can be considered strict and therefore allows not only combination of experimental results but also pooling of data. To be able to examine any potential threats to validity stemming from the replication, we created two dummy variables, affiliation, and experimentMode, to examine whether experimental results differed significantly across the replications. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref> gives the results. All test results were insignificant, with p values ranging from 0.17 to 0.41, suggesting that none of the relevant data differed significantly for the dummy variables, thereby justifying to our pooling of the data.</p><p>Each of the experiments used feedback about the performance as an inducement. While this feedback was meant to be informative to practitioners, it served the students for the preparation towards their exams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data analysis and interpretation</head><p>In this section, we first discuss distribution and correlation before we turn to hypothesis testing. Last, we discuss threats to validity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Distribution and correlation analysis</head><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref> shows descriptive statistics for our measures. All results are in line with expectations. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref> gives the correlation matrix. First, we check for potential interactions between our betweensubject factor (label type) and our within-subject factors (experience, intensity, knowledge). The data in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref> clearly shows that no significant interaction terms are present between these factors, thereby suggesting independence of the experimental conditions used in our study. The insignificant correlations of the between-subjects factor and the within-subject factors allow to run the hypothesis tests independently. Further inspection of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref> suggests that Label type and formal process knowledge (knowledge) are meaningful independent factors as they correlate significantly with the dependent measures. By contrast, experience and intensity do not correlate largely with the dependent measures but with each other. This correlation between intensity and experience, however, behaves in accordance with general expectations (in the sense that people that model longer often model more frequently, too). Next, the correlation between intensity and experience to knowledge is expected, as people with more intensive or overall longer process modeling experiences build up higher levels of knowledge about process modeling. The correlations between comprehension score and efficiency, likewise, were expected. Overall, we do not find counter-intuitive correlations in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref>. Note that in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> we see that the sample size for the efficiency measure is 87, which is because we failed to accurately record task completion times in our experiment replication with the students in Berlin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Testing hypotheses on comprehension task performance</head><p>After screening the data, we now discuss the test of our predictions. We argued in our Hypotheses H a 1 , H a 3 , H a 5 and H a 7 that process model comprehension task performance would be positively impacted by</p><p>• the use of abstract labels,</p><p>• higher levels of formal process knowledge,</p><p>• higher levels of process modeling experience, and • higher levels of process modeling intensity.</p><p>As a dependent measure, we used the process model comprehension task performance scores (0-36). We first checked whether the data met the assumption of equal variances in the dependent measures across the levels of each independent variable. Levene's test was insignificant (F = 1.45, p = 0.19), indicating that the data met this assumption. Hypothesis testing was completed individually for 2 Vienna University of Economics and Business runs the modeling course on a halfsemester turn. each of the four independent factors above, using SPSS Version 16.0. First, we performed an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for our between-subjects factor Label Type. Then, for each of the three factors formal process knowledge, process modeling experience, and process modeling intensity, we used a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test to examine our hypotheses, because a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirmed that the normality assumption did not hold for these measures, i.e. Z = 2.51 (knowledge), 2.68 (experience), 2.52 (intensity), all p b 0.01. Therefore, we used the Kruskal-Wallis test, which is accepted as an alternative to ANOVA in case the considered variables are not normally distributed <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. We examined the hypotheses individually because our correlation analysis suggested independence of the between-subjects and within-subjects factors. Also, our experimental design features three ordinal variables, for which we required nonparametric tests, and the Kruskal-Wallis test we selected considers one independent variable at a time. We chose this test over others (e.g., ANOVA, Mann-Whitney) because, first, the Kruskal-Wallis test is the generalization of the Mann-Whitney test when there are more than two independent groups, like in our study (four levels) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Second, even though we replicated the experiment to gather more data, the number of respondents overall is rather small, and the subgroups for each ordinal scale level are smaller. The distribution-free nature of non-parametric tests places few restrictions on the sample size in contrast with parametric tests, which rely on asymptotic properties or normality of the sample distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Third, the ordinal measures used in our study called for the use of non-parametric methods, which yield higher power than corresponding parametric tests (e.g., ANOVA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Finally, rank-based non-parametric tests are not affected by outliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, which allows us to also consider those data where respondents took unusually long (or short) for answering the experimental questions. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> gives the descriptive results and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> gives the results from the statistical tests. Perusal of the data in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> leads to the following observations.</p><p>H a 1 hypothesized higher comprehension task performance scores for the group of users working with models with abstract labels. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> shows that the average comprehension task performance scores indeed were higher (mean score = 26.45 vs. 25.48), and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> confirms that the differences are significant (F = 5.05, p = 0.03). These results lead to the rejection of null hypothesis H 0 1 and suggest people viewing models with no textual labels achieve a higher level of comprehension of formal syntactic aspects of process models. H a 3 hypothesized higher comprehension task performance scores for users with higher levels of formal process knowledge. And indeed, we observe that comprehension task performance scores were higher, relatively, for users with very high knowledge levels, over those with somewhat high, and somewhat low knowledge (means = 29.47, 26.57 and 23.80). 3 Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> suggests that the comprehension task performance across the four groups is significantly different (Chi -2 = 24.48, p = 0.00). We note, interestingly, that the group of users with very low knowledge performed somewhat better than the group with somewhat low knowledge (mean = 24.78). A follow-up ANOVA analysis of these two groups, however, showed these differences to be insignificant. A second-follow up ANOVA analysis of comprehension task performance based on the actual comprehension task performance scores (0-12) also yielded significant results (df=11, F = 2.05, p = 0.03). Therefore, we suggest to reject the null hypothesis and tentatively accept hypothesis H a 3 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H a</head><p>5 and H a 7 hypothesized higher comprehension task performance scores for users with higher levels of modeling expertise (in the sense of modeling experience and intensity). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> shows that the comprehension task performance scores for the four groups of users (for both experience and intensity) follow an inverse U-shaped curve in that task scores increase for the users with very low, somewhat low, and somewhat high expertise (both for experience and intensity) but drop for the groups of users classified as very experienced/very intensive. The results from the Kruskal-Wallis test in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> show, furthermore, that group differences for both factors experience and intensity are insignificant (Chi -2 = 6.37, p = 0.10 and Chi -2 = 5.70, p = 0.13). In light of these results, we cannot reject the null hypotheses H 0 5 and H 0 7 , suggesting that modeling expertise is not an important factor in explaining process model comprehension task performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Testing hypotheses on comprehension task efficiency</head><p>Next, we argued in our Hypotheses H a 2 , H a 4 , H a 6 and H a 8 that process model comprehension task efficiency (measured by the normalized ratio between comprehension task performance and comprehension task completion times) would be positively impacted by</p><p>• the use of abstract labels,</p><p>• higher levels of formal process knowledge,</p><p>• higher levels of process modeling experience, and • higher levels of process modeling intensity.</p><p>Because during our conduct of the experiment at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin we were unable to accurately record time measures for comprehension tasks, for this second analysis we had to  exclude 32 entries from our data set, resulting in an effective sample size of 87. Again, we first checked whether the data met the assumption of equal variances in the dependent measures across groups. Levene's test was insignificant (F = 1.30, p = 0.08), indicating that the data met this assumption. Hypothesis testing was completed in the same manner as above, using the same four measures as independent factors. As a dependent measure, we used the process model comprehension task efficiency scores. The descriptive analysis results are displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref>.</p><p>Perusal of the data in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref> leads to the following observations.</p><p>H a 2 hypothesized better comprehension task efficiency scores for the group of users working with models with abstract labels.

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref> shows that the group differences are significant (F = 3.90, p = 0.05). Therefore, the results suggest rejecting null hypothesis H 0 2</p><p>, which means that textual semantics, being a significant factor for how well people understand the formal content of process models, also significantly affects the effort that is required to reach this understanding.</p><p>H a 4 hypothesized better comprehension task efficiency scores for the group of users working with higher levels of formal process knowledge. We note from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref> that the differences in comprehension task efficiency across the groups of users with different levels of knowledge are significant (Chi -2 = 8.38, p = 0.04), and from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> that the efficiency scores are better for users with higher levels of knowledge. We note, however, that Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> also shows a somewhat unexpected exception. The group of users with low levels of knowledge completed their tasks the with the second-best efficiency score (mean = 1.34), superseded only by those with high levels of knowledge (mean = 1.51). We note that these results may have been over-compensated through quick task completion, independent from correct results (as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>). Indeed, it seems plausible that users with low knowledge levels just quickly selected answers without engaging in a thorough consideration of the content presented to them. Overall, the results are in line with our expectations, the null hypothesis H 0 4 is rejected.</p><p>H a 6 and H a 8 hypothesized better comprehension task efficiency scores for users with higher levels of modeling expertise (in the sense of modeling experience and intensity). We note from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref> that the differences in task completion efficiency across the user groups with different levels of modeling intensity are significant (Chi -2 = 9.09, p = 0.03), and provide the correct directionality (means = 1.09, 1.19, 1.28 and 1.30). The results support hypothesis H8a. For modeling experience, however, the results are not in line with hypothesis H6a. There are fluctuations in comprehension task efficiency scores noted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> (means = 1.36, 1.29, 1.01 and 1.21), and the Kruskal-Wallis tests suggests that the differences across the groups are insignificant (Chi -2 = 4.29, p = 0.23). Therefore, we cannot reject null hypothesis H 0 6 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Discussion of results</head><p>Our experimental study provides support for five out of eight hypothesized factors of process model comprehension task performance and efficiency (see Table <ref type="table">8</ref>). The results for hypotheses H a 1 and H a 2 suggest that a plus in semantical information in terms of text labels seems to be a burden when analyzing the syntactical content of a process. These findings are in line with arguments that are founded on the grounds of cognitive load theory as well as the premise of the semiotic ladder. Hypotheses H a 3 to H a 8 are interesting to be discussed relative to each other. Theoretical knowledge turned out to be a strong indicator for both comprehension task performance and efficiency on syntaxrelated comprehension of process models (H a 3 and H a</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4</head><p>). In contrast, modeling experience and intensity were found not to contribute significantly to either comprehension task performance or efficiency, set aside the result obtained in relation to hypothesis H a</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>8</head><p>. We interpret this result as an indication that theoretical knowledge is of paramount importance to understanding syntactical aspects of a process model, over and above any practical experience with the exercise of process modeling. Indeed, the non-significance of experience and intensity here might suggest that these factors are more important for the semantical interpretation of process models and that theory is the prerequisite for understanding syntax.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Threats to validity</head><p>The results of this experiment have to be discussed against different threats to validity. We focus on those threats of ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, p. 67) that are most relevant for our experiment.</p><p>Conclusion validity is concerned with the relationship between treatment and outcome, and the conclusions drawn from it. Two aspects have to be considered: The first aspect concerns the appropriateness of the statistical tests. As reported above, we have screened our data for conformance with the assumptions of the statistical tests we used (ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test). We used Levene's test to show that the dependent variables across the treatment groups shared approximately equal variance. We used the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test for our ordinal measures because the independent data was not normally distributed. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirmed that the normality assumption did not hold for the measures knowledge, experience, or intensity (Z= 2.51, 2.68, 2.52, all p = 0.00). Therefore, we used the Kruskal-Wallis test, which is accepted as an alternative to ANOVA in case the considered variables are not normally distributed <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. The second aspect concerns the effect sizes of the results. In order to reach a sample size sufficient to solve potential issues regarding the statistical significance, we conducted strict replications <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> of our experiment. In order to show that our replications did not induce bias into our analysis, we created two dummy variables, affiliation and experimentMode, to examine whether experimental results differed significantly across the replications. Affiliation with one of the universities partaking in our study did not affect results for comprehension task performance or task completion time-the Kruskal-Wallis test was insignificant (p= 0.16 and p = 0.09). The mode of experiment (paper versus online), likewise, was an insignificant factor, as shown in an independent samples t-test (p= 0.20 and p = 0.80 for comprehension task performance and task completion time).</p><p>Internal validity demands that the treatment causes the effect. In order to avoid maturation and learning effects, we used a random sampling of the questions. Other threats relate to resentful demoralization and mortality. In general, we can assume that those who perform better would be less likely to interrupt or stop answering the questionnaire. This is presumably not a problem when this dropout is equally relevant for both treatments. As we observe in the results, it appears to require a higher cognitive load to inspect the models with text labels. Participants receiving this treatment might be more likely to give up due to higher mental effort. While we did not have drop outs in the student replications, we noticed some instances in which online participants failed to answer all questions. For the online participants (N = 42), cases for the comprehension questions ranged from 0 missing answers to a maximum of 8 missing answers (out of 36 questions), with the mean being 1.69. We then performed a linear regression analysis to examine whether the number of missing answers has a significant effect on the number of correct answers. The regression model showed that number of missing answers was an insignificant predictor (t = -1.64, p = 0.11), thereby alleviating concerns about internal validity of our results.</p><p>Construct validity can be related to potential interactions between the measures. To that end, first, we inspected the measure correlations as reported above. We did not find any unexpected correlations, but only those that establish confidence in the convergent validity of our comprehension measures (task performance and task efficiency: r = -0.31, p b 0.01) and expertise measures (experience and intensity: r = 0.24, p b 0.05), and the discriminant validity of our model and personal factors (e.g., label type and knowledge: r = -0.01, p &gt; 0.05).</p><p>As reported above, we also cared to eliminate potential bias stemming from non-equivalency between the treatment groups, by conducting manipulation checks to assess differences between the groups of participants across treatments. We noted above that there were no significant differences in the independent and dependent variables used, based on independent samples t-tests using the experimental medium used (paper versus online), student cohort (two from Vienna University of Economics and Business versus one from Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin), or time of experiment <ref type="bibr">(2007</ref><ref type="bibr">, April 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">, June 2009)</ref>. These results indicate that the participants were effectively randomized across treatments. We can also assume that there was no hypothesis guessing by the participants as we did not even reveal that two different treatments were used. The students participated as a preparation for the exam while the practitioners expected to receive feedback on their performance.</p><p>External validity is concerned with how generalizable the results are to the wider population of process modelers. Our set of replications was particularly motivated by external validity considerations, since we aim to generalize to the population of professionals involved in process modeling initiatives. Our manipulation checks confirmed that our replications can be considered strict, thereby increasing the external validity of our findings. One particular aspect of the external validity of the presented research relates to the extent to which the used models are representative for real-world models. As explained, we countered this threat by our choice of real process models from a partnering organization. A third important aspect that refers to a potentially limited external validity, relates to the involvement of students. We note that some of the students possessed prior practical experience with process modeling. Also, prior research found that students tend to have higher theoretical knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. While we explicitly built both these factors into our research model, this could be seen as a limitation of this research, as the population in our study is potentially more knowledgeable of formal aspects of process modeling theory than the wider population. And indeed, our results confirm that theoretical knowledge is a key factor in explaining process model comprehension. One may argue, however, that process modeling students will form the next generation of junior analysts, and therefore our results may be predictive of the future generations of process analysts.</p><p>Last, we consider the effect of setting as a potential threat to external (as well as internal) validity: We used an online and a paperbased system. Therefore, participants either viewed process models on screen or as a printout. Both these practices are widespread in industry practice, where models are either provided through an intranet web page linked to a modeling tool (e.g., ARIS Web Publisher), or provided in print out format as part of process handbooks or manuals of procedures. Our study used both options, thereby increasing the external validity of the study. As noted above, we observed no statistical differences in relation to the experimentMode, thereby alleviating concerns about the internal validity of this treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Implications</head><p>In this section, we discuss implications for research (Section 5.1) and for practice (Section 5.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Implications for research</head><p>The findings presented in this paper have three major implications for research. First, we have shown that textual labels hamper syntax comprehension of process models. This finding emphasizes the relevance of cognitive load theory for interpreting comprehension phenomena in this context. This is in line with prior research that identified size and complexity as factors having a negative impact on process model comprehension <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, although a direct reference to cognitive load theory is missing in these works. Cognitive load theory might offer a useful perspective to study the impact of process model complexity on comprehension in a more detailed way in future research. We further identify research on textual labels, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> to be an important extension of our work, given that we identified textual labels to be a potential barrier to syntactical process model comprehension. Indeed, future work may examine how textual labels could be specified in order to decrease the additional cognitive burden on the model viewer.</p><p>Second, research on expert performance has established a close link between expertise and the duration and extent of training <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. Our findings point to the fact that expertise is a taskspecific phenomenon, as emphasized in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Knowledge in theoretical aspects of process model syntax have been found as a significant factor of comprehension while general modeling intensity and general modeling experience were not significant. We speculated that semantic comprehension might be much more dependent on these factors than syntactical comprehension appeared to be. This speculation suggests that experience might have a different impact on comprehension of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of a process model. These levels of comprehension might even be in conflict with each other. This aspect requires a deeper investigation in future research, both from a theoretical and from a behavioral perspective.</p><p>Third, our research showed that there is a trade-off in understanding the formal, syntactical structure of a model and its semantical content (as conveyed through textual labels). In this paper, therefore, we chose to examine process model understanding in terms of comprehension of syntactical content. Other research, by contrast, has examined semantic understanding, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> while neglecting the syntactical comprehension. Future research should now combine these streams of study to be able to assert the relevant factors important to syntactic and semantic understanding, as well as the interactions between understanding of syntax and semantics. Ultimately, this vein of research can then arrive at a body of knowledge informing pragmatic understanding of process models as representations of knowledge for action <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and study the factors the influence how individuals use process models to solve tasks such as organizational re-design, software specification, certification and others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Implications for practice</head><p>Our research has at least two relevant implications for practice. First, we note that the importance of theoretical knowledge for syntactical process model comprehension was supported by our tests. In contrast, practical experience does not seem to have a significant impact. These facts suggest that it is essential to provide formal process modeling education to staff members before letting them take part in a project. Such a training program should proceed in two stages. Initially, it should develop sufficient expertise in the syntactical rules of process modeling to ensure that practitioners appropriately understand the syntax of process models. Subsequently, the training program could proceed to more realistic process models that carry domain semantics, to teach practitioners how to reason about the processes being modeled. The recommendations in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> could guide the development of a staged training program.</p><p>Second, we note that there are several situations in practice when syntactical aspects have to be investigated for a process model. This is, for instance, the case when a process model needs to be verified for soundness <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> before it is deployed in a workflow system. Our findings suggest that a tool option to hide, or to abbreviate the activity labels, could help analysts when correcting a syntactically unsound model. The abbreviation would reduce the cognitive load of the modeler, which would permit her to focus her attention on control flow. Corresponding features are not yet part of nowadays modeling tools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>Using process modeling for the analysis and design of processaware information systems is an emerging, highly relevant domain of Information Systems practice. In this paper, we have described the formulation and execution of an experimental study to examine factors of process model comprehension.</p><p>We identify two key limitations to the work carried out. First, congruent to other studies, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>, we used post-graduate students as proxies for novice business analysts. Second, our operationalization of model comprehension was focused on the syntactical structure of a process model. Future work could investigate other aspects of understanding, for instance, through problem-solving tasks, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. In spite of the boundaries set by these limitations, we believe our work offers two central contributions. First, we provided a theoretical framework to define levels of process model comprehension task performance and efficiency, and the set of factors relevant to reaching comprehension on basis of cognitive load theory and semiotic considerations. Second, our series of experiments examined two sets of relevant factors-model factors and personal factors. We found that theoretical knowledge and, to a small extent, process modeling expertise, are important personal factors, and also found a negative effect of textual domain semantics-a model factor-on the comprehension of the formal content of process models.</p><p>Our work extends the body of knowledge in the field of process modeling, and thereby paves the way to more effective and efficient process modeling-which will significantly increase the benefits of process modeling in organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and also reduce associated direct and indirect costs. In moving forward, we discussed a number of speculations and possible directions for future research in our implications section. Most notably, it will be an important objective for future research to study the joint impact of various factors on different levels of comprehension, from syntactical to semantical to pragmatic.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
