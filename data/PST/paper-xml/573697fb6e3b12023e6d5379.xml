<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In recent years, gamification, "the use of game design elements in non-game contexts", has drawn the attention of an increasing number of scientists.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Socialness is a fundamental value in modern enterprises, and a core component of their business strategies. Many organisations take advantage of "social" Web-based systems such as social media or collaboration platforms for a variety of business purposes. For instance: to maintain awareness of organisational dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>; to incentivise contribution within enterprise social software <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>; to leverage social connections within and outside the enterprise <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>; and to promote continuous education and knowledge growth of the enterprise's workforce.</p><p>Engaging employees with such tools is often challenging, and it is difficult to make them embrace the long-term vision of the company without proper motivation. On the one hand, the pace by which companies vary their internal organisation and policies increases with their need to respond to everchanging business environments; this process is often accompanied with a rapid introduction of new technologies which call for proper training. On the other hand, employees tend to resist to change: the demand for quick adaptation is often hindered by their need to perform their everyday activities, and their personal and business goals.</p><p>Gamification, "the use of game design elements in non-game contexts" <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, has been recently proposed as the "silver bullet" to overcome such challenges. Points, badges, leaderboards, and other game mechanics are often used to make work-related activities enjoyable and interesting. Employees' engagement is an important business need, and a precondition for motivation and retainment; team-and communitybuilding; learning; and loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>An increasing number of studies look at how gamification techniques can be leveraged to engage users with ecommerce, health, education, and learning platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. Despite this great attention, only few scientific works <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> studied the gamification inside the enterprise; thus, the question of how gamified processes can help enterprises with their business goals remains unclear.</p><p>As the adoption of gamification techniques is foreseen to dramatically increase in the upcoming years, it is of fundamental importance to scientifically understand whether their application in enterprise environments can provide benefits comparable to those observed in non-enterprise contexts.</p><p>Objective. We pursue a better understanding of how gamification can be used to help companies achieving their business needs by fostering employees' engagement with enterpriseclass social Web-based systems. In this paper, we are interested in investigating whether the use of gamification techniques in an enterprise environment is positively associated with increased social interaction and learning behaviour. Enterprises strive to create a positive and inclusive working environment, especially as the size of the workforce increases. In this context, it is common for employees to lack knowledge about and to feel disconnected from their colleagues, their company and its history, products and services.</p><p>In this paper, we report the results of an experiment performed within the IBM corporation, one of the largest and most diverse enterprise workforces in the world. Our leading research question is:</p><p>How can gamification techniques foster employees' engagement, social interaction behaviours, and learning in an enterprise environment?</p><p>Original Contributions. We introduce Work&amp;Play, an application-independent framework for enterprise gamification. The framework includes state-of-the-art features of gamification system, and is designed to support the entanglement of game mechanics with business activities, while using quantifiable measures of engagement to enable studies on their effectiveness.</p><p>We instrumented a real-world gamification experiment that involved 206 IBM employees. We instantiated the Work&amp;Play framework into "How much of an IBMer are you" (HMIAY), a Web-based application for IBM employees that interfaces enterprise and public knowledge bases and social networks to provide question answering, news sharing, and social interaction functionalities. We studied the effect of three game mechanics: a general score to summarise the employee's performance in the application, leaderboards, and badges. By combining objective metrics with subjective assessment of employees' perceptions on the application, this experiment provides an empirical demonstration of the impact that a gamified experience can have in promoting employees' engagement with enterprise Web systems. We show how the effectiveness of game mechanics differs across business needs and learning topics.</p><p>Paper Structure. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. After the "Related Work" Section, "Work&amp;Play Gamification Engine" and "HMIAY Application" respectively introduce the Work&amp;Play framework and the HMIAY application developed for our study. Section "Experimental Methodology" details the applied experimental methodology; Section "Results" describes the outcome of the experiment and reports on gathered insights. Finally, Section "Conclusions and Future Work" presents our conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RELATED WORK</head><p>In the common definition of gamification <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, "non-game contexts" are those use cases where the design elements from games are not employed to develop a proper game, but rather to stimulate user engagement, i.e. "the emotional, cognitive and behavioural connection that exists, at any point in time and possibly over time, between a user and a resource" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In this context, many attributes of user engagement (e.g., aesthetics, novelty, reputation, trust, incentives and benefits, saliency) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> play a key role in improving the user interaction with a system or application, inducing longer and more frequent usage, and, ultimately, a better user experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. Moreover, a common phenomenon associated with gamification is the so-called social comparison, i.e. the persuasive power that emerges when people compare their performance (in terms of points and badges) amongst each other, and so benchmark themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Most of existing literature has focused on the application of game mechanics in the (social) Web context. The importance and effect of engagement attributes is often domain and application dependent. Gamification is a user engagement technique that, in order to be effective, must be tailored to the characteristics of both the targeted users, as well as of the targeted user behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Such a contextual dependency makes gamification techniques elusive to generalisation, thus calling for ad-hoc studies. Previous work studied how to stimulate engagement and drive user behaviour in applications such as knowledge sharing and question answering <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, crowdsourcing <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Only a handful of works <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> have studied the effectiveness of gamification techniques in an enterprise environment. Though applications and tasks (e.g. learning or social media) in an enterprise environment are not different from a public environment per se, the engagement of employees with these processes and hence the impact of gamification techniques may be different: employee behaviour in an enterprise is inherently related to business goals, and monetary incentives play an important role.</p><p>While paving the way for further research in the field of enterprise gamification, previous work presents shortcomings such as small sample sizes, short experimental time-span, absence of control groups, focus on single gamification mechanism, or lack of both qualitative and quantitative analysis. Hamari et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> review existing literature where the usage of game mechanics has been correlated with positive patterns in service use, improvement of social interaction and increased user activity and productivity. In an earlier work, Hamari <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> describes a field experiment, where an utilitarian peer-to-peer trading service is gamified by implementing a single game mechanism of badges; the work shows how users who actively monitored their own badges and those of others featured increased activity. While closely related, this work targeted an online community (www.sharetribe.com), and did not consider the internal dynamics of an organisation. Guy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> describe an experiment in which they gamified the registration of relationships within an enterprise social network, deployed within a large global enterprise.</p></div>

In contrast Thom et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> studied the impact of removing a gamification feature from an enterprise social networking system.

We instrumented a rigorous experimental design in which we adopted an open recruiting methodology, to ensure enrolment based on intrinsic motivations, and used a control group to minimise threats to the internal validity of the study. Thanks to a novel application-independent gamification engine designed for the enterprise context, we ran the experiment for two months, to allow possible novelty effects to wear of.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WORK&amp;PLAY GAMIFICATION ENGINE</head><p>This section presents Work&amp;Play, an applicationindependent gamification engine designed for the enterprise environment. We provide an in-depth description of our enterprise gamification system -the first such detailed public description we know of to date.</p><p>It is important for an enterprise gamification engine to unobtrusively attach gamification functionalities to work-related activities, which we assume to be executed by using existing enterprise tools (e.g. Web, enterprise, and custom systems; data and knowledge repositories). Work&amp;Play achieves this goal by means of a rigorous definition and organisation of the main components needed to gamify enterprise processes and applications. A high-level overview of Work&amp;Play is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. It comprises four modules, described next: 1) game elements; 2) game mechanics; 3) an authentication sub-system; and 4) a routing controller.</p><p>Game Elements. These encode the experiences that form the structure of what can be recognised as a game <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. Four types of game elements are relevant to our work: 1) Actions, a set of activities that have to be performed to reach a particular goal in the framework, but require efforts to be solved. Examples of actions relevant in an enterprise context are: sharing content on an enterprise or public social network; contributing to discussion groups; assessing the expertise of a colleague; completing the quiz of an on-line training course.</p><p>2) Rewards, i.e. the benefits obtained for having (successfully) performed an action. Rewards are typically of tangible nature (e.g. points, currency, items), and provide support for game mechanics. 3) Rules, prescribed guides for conduct or action; they define which actions (in the framework) are allowed for a given player, and how the execution of such actions map to given rewards. For instance, a user might not be allowed to obtain rewards for a given action unless another action has been successfully taken. 4) Feedback, communication to users about changes in the gamification engine's state. Examples of feedback include acknowledgment of successfully executed actions (e.g. answering a question), or messages about the progresses of users in the platform (e.g. obtaining a reward).</p><p>We stress how Work&amp;Play can accommodate other game elements (e.g. winning conditions and conflicts), to enable additional gamified experiences.</p><p>Game Mechanics. These are tools employed by the gamification engine to guide the player toward the desired business goals. Game mechanics are often related to rewards elements, as they are the means by which users can influence game states in order to complete a goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. We describe three mechanics relevant for our experiment. 1) Points, i.e. numerical values that represent a measure of the skill/progresses of a user; 2) Leaderboards i.e. ordered lists of users based on the points they have obtained; and 3) Badges, i.e. sets of designer-defined tasks used to guide the users towards a certain goal and track their progress in a system.</p><p>Authentication. The module contains functionalities devoted to the management of user identification within the corporate and social network providers (e.g. IBM Connections, LinkedIn, Facebook). It is also responsible to guarantee compliance with third-party system's policies w.r.t. to the access and management of the social data therein hosted.</p><p>Routing Controller. The Routing controller supports customised gamified experience, as well as targeted experiments like the one proposed in this paper. It links other components of the framework, and it regulates the access to Game Elements and Game Mechanics.</p><p>A main requirement for a gamification engine is its ability to decouple from the business logic of the gamified systems and applications. This allows for great flexibility in terms of independent system co-evolution, a conditio sine qua non for enterprise-class software. Work&amp;Play addresses such needs by means of event-driven communication abstractions. Events produced by third-party applications are consumed by Work&amp;Play to enact the gamification logic.</p><p>Beyond enabling the work presented in this paper, Work&amp;Play provides a strong foundation to study the effect on game mechanics in a variety of applications and contexts. In the next section, we describe how Work&amp;Play provides a modular and extensible implementation of key game elements and mechanics; and how it can be instantiated to gamify business actions such as the transfer of knowledge to employees, and news sharing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HMIAY APPLICATION</head><p>We introduce "How much of an IBMer are you" (HMIAY), a learning and social interaction Web application implemented on top of Work&amp;Play. HMIAY has been developed and deployed in IBM to support our experiments.</p><p>In the context of our work, we limit the scope of social interaction to the need to build stronger professional connections, learn more about one's colleagues, and spread awareness of the enterprise's vision and interests by sharing companyrelated news to the outside world. Learning is targeted at gaining and assessing knowledge about the company's products and services and targeted markets.</p><p>HMIAY can be accessed by all IBM employees, behind the company's firewall. The application includes three modules: 1) the Quiz; 2) the Social Hub; 3) the News Centre. Each module is linked to one or more game elements in Work&amp;Play, and it is designed to promote learning and/or social behaviour. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> depicts four screenshots of the HMIAY application.</p><p>The quiz. This module implements a Q&amp;A quiz. Its purpose is to favour the diffusion of knowledge about different domains. Our experiment included questions from three categories: IBM facts, World Wide Technology and You &amp; Your Network. The latter category is personalised on the social neighbourhood of employees, i.e. focuses on knowledge related to their peers (the colleagues' area of expertise) and social connections. The other categories respectively relate with enterprise-specific knowledge (e.g. important figures/events in the history of IBM), and with facts in key business and research areas. Players interact with the module by initiating quiz sessions, each featuring 10 rounds. Each round contains a question to answer. Players can abandon the quiz at any point. Before a question is served, the player will have to choose the quiz category. On the question page, the question category and text are displayed together with a timer indicating how much time is left for answering the question. The user has 20 seconds to choose an answer. The time constraint introduced by the timer puts pressure on the players, thus making the questions more challenging. Moreover, the timer lowers the chances of someone cheating by looking up the questions' answers. At any point during a game, the player is informed about the number of questions answered and the number of remaining questions. After the 10th question, a summary page with the percentage of correct answers and the average answering time is shown. Questions for IBM facts and World Wide Technology are drawn from an IBM knowledge base, common to all players. You &amp; Your Network questions are dynamically created for each player, according to a set of pre-defined templates filled-in at run-time with information coming from the player's social neighbourhood. Questions are selected from the knowledge base as follows: first, the game tries to pick (at random) a question that hasn't been seen yet by the player; when such questions are exhausted, it picks (at random) questions that were previously wrongly answered. Finally, the game randomly picks from the pool of all questions.</p><p>The Social Hub. It allows employees to manage their enterprise (IBM Connections) and social (LinkedIn, Facebook) connections, with the purpose of inviting them to use the application. Users can voluntary link to their social account in order to grant the Authentication module of Work&amp;Play access to their profiles; when the permission is granted, the module first derives from the pool of social connections which ones are also IBM employees. Then, for each connection, the module verifies if such employee is already known to the system. In this case, the module gathers the information needed to instantiate the personalised You &amp; Your Network questions.</p><p>News Centre. The goals of this module are to keep employees up to date with the company's activities, and to promote social sharing of such news. It shows to users the latest news distributed by the company, for them to share on their social networks. Instead of counting share actions immediately, the module periodically (e.g. once per hour) monitors employee' social streams, to look for the shared news. This asynchronous verification mechanism has been employed to ensure that news gets a proper exposure on the employee's network, before it gets eventually removed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Work&amp;Play Configuration For HMIAY</head><p>We now describe how Work&amp;Play has been configured in our experiment. We focus on the game elements and game mechanics used to gamify the HMIAY application.</p><p>Game Elements. User activities in the application are mapped to action game elements in Work&amp;Play. In our experiment, the following activities are mapped to game actions: join the application; connect to social provider; answer a Quiz question; use the Social Hub to invite a colleague to join the application; share a news from the News Centre module. A set of rules, omitted for brevity's sake, maps such actions to one or more rewards (points). The mapping of points to game mechanics is described in the next section. The Feedback element has been configured to access the IBM knowledge base and provide a user the correct answer to a quiz question, and to check if the provided answer was correct or incorrect. Previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> suggest that being told the correct answer is a more effective form of learning than only giving information regarding the correctness of a response. The event from Work&amp;Play is shown in HMIAY as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>: a correct answer is indicated by highlighting the corresponding text in green, while an incorrect answer is indicated by highlighting the answer in red. Upon changes in the game mechanics' state for a given user, Work&amp;Play also triggers the Feedback module. HMIAY consumes the event from Work&amp;Play in order to show a notification message, thus closing the feedback loop.</p><p>Game Mechanics. Our experiment makes use of the three game mechanics that are more commonly used in gamified applications.</p><p>The IBMer Score summarises the user's actions in the application with a positive integer. It serves as an incentive for users to perform balanced actions in the tool, and it represents the basis for other mechanics. Its inclusion is motivated by previous literature, which highlights the need for this mechanism in an enterprise environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The IBMer Score is displayed next to the profile picture of the user (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), similar to other services 1 . The score is built up according to the type, number, and frequency of the rewards obtained by performing actions. Intuitively, the more actions, the higher the score. To keep the players engaged, the score is periodically re-calculated taking into account: 1) a discount factor that adjusts the score according to the number of days since their last action in the game; and 2) the overall activeness of all the other players in the game.</p><p>Based on the IBMer Score, a Leaderboard displays the ranking of a user compared to other users. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref> depicts a 1 For instance, http://www.klout.com screenshot of the leaderboard page in HMIAY. Leaderboards are a performance comparison game element which trigger, when properly implemented, competitiveness. It has been suggested that leaderboards can decrease motivation when the top user has a score that is considered by the current player to be out of reach. To overcome this, we implemented relative leaderboards where a user's rank is compared to her peers only, i.e. those employees the user is connected to on social networks.</p><p>Badges are a commonly employed tool to incentivise user's activity. Badges are awarded to a user for performing one or multiple actions of a given type, and they serve as a summary of a user's accomplishments. The five main categories of actions for which we award badges are: 1) Joining the application; when signing up, people receive the Proud to be an IBMer badge for successfully providing their email address. 2) Answering questions: when answering questions, users earn multiple badges for the first correct answer in a category, or multiple (consecutive) answers. 3) Linking social networks: users also receive the Social as it can get badge for linking their Facebook and LinkedIn accounts. 4) Inviting peers: users can also receive badges when one or a number of colleagues accept the invitation to join the application. 5) Sharing news: when sharing news, users earn badges for sharing the first, five or twenty five news articles on LinkedIn or Facebook. The tool shows the player the list of available badges, the list of earned badges, the progress towards earning new badges, and the number of players that have earned a specific badge. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref> depicts a screenshot of the achievements page in HMIAY.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY</head><p>This section describes the experimental methodology applied in our work. We focused on one configuration aspect of the Work&amp;Play framework and HMIAY application: the game mechanics. We organised our experiments around three main research questions:</p><p>• RQ1: Which game mechanic is more effective for driving user engagement?</p><p>• RQ2: Which game mechanic is more effective for promoting online social behaviour of employees?</p><p>• RQ3: Which game mechanic is more effective for supporting learning?</p><p>We designed a between-subject post-test only control group experimental design, and made use of several objective and subjective metrics to assess (and compare) the engagement, social behaviour, and learning performance of participants during their use of the HMIAY application.</p><p>The experiment started in the IBM Headquarters in Amsterdam (the Netherlands). Initial recruitment has been performed on a voluntary base, and trough advertisement: we placed one banner and a few hundred flyers at the IBM Headquarter, inviting employees to play the HMIAY online application. Other participants (from other IBM buildings in the same or other countries) signed up to the application after receiving an invitation email in their corporate email box from someone already in the application.</p><p>Participants interacted with the experimental tool for a number of days, depending on the signup date. Our observation interval has been between May 12th and July 11th 2014. Then, we performed an objective quantitative analysis by examining web logs and usage patterns of the HMIAY application. Following the objective analysis, we carried out a subjective analysis by means of a questionnaire aimed at providing a better understanding of the quantitative data, but also to provide answers to research questions dealing with user perception. All employees who played HMIAY were sent an invitation to fill in the questionnaire.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental design</head><p>The dependent variables of the experiments are user engagement, social online behaviour, and learning. They are measured according to the metrics described in Section "Assessment metrics". The independent variables are the game mechanics implemented in the application, and described in Section "Work&amp;Play Configuration For HMIAY". To reduce the space of experimental conditions, we decided to provide all the treatment groups with the The IBMer Score mechanic.</p><p>The final set of independent variables included: the presence of a leaderboard, and the presence of badges. The resulting four treatment groups were organised as in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Group 0 was the control group, and was used to give a reference measure of engagement for HMIAY users. Our running hypothesis was that the adoption of game mechanics would contribute to foster motivation and engagement, causing a significant social and learning behavioural change in our subjects. We hypothesised that users would strive to reach one of the top leaderboards positions, or, at least, to overcome their colleagues. Also, we tested the hypothesis that badges could also have a positive effect on engagement, by showing users how many actions of a type needed to be taken to obtain a new achievement.</p><p>Group 0 Group 1 Group 2 Group 3</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">IBM Score X X X X Leaderboard - X - X Badges - - X X</formula><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>: The treatment groups used in the experiments.</p><p>The between-subjects design was adopted to limit the effects of learning biases. Such a design presents two drawbacks: 1) it requires a large number of participants; and 2) it introduces variability due to the distribution of individual characteristics of the participants. The first issue has been overcome by deploying the tool on IBM 's internal network, which hosts a large potential number of employees, and resulted in a considerable number of participants. To minimise the chances of bias due to subjects' variability, at signup participants were randomly assigned to a treatment group. Experiments in an enterprise environment might suffer from the history internal validity threat, due to participants discussing the application among themselves and, thus, influencing their perceptions and attitudes towards the application. Such an effect cannot be ruled out; however, given the existence of a control group, and given that all experimental groups were affected in the same way, the impact of such threat is minimised.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment metrics</head><p>The engagement and social online behaviour of employees were quantitatively measured by analysing HMIAY's logs. To measure engagement we used: average session length, user retention curve, and the user life time. To measure online social behaviour, we counted the number of invites a user sent in the application, and the number of shared news. A questionnaire has been used to calculate subjective metrics such as the perceived engagement and perceived learning (i.e. the transfer of knowledge to employees on topics such as facts about IBM, technology in general, and colleagues' skills). The employees that agreed to fill in the questionnaire were asked to select on a 5-point Likert scale their level of agreement with a set of questions.</p><p>User Engagement. The average session length is defined by the total time a user spent in the tool divided by the number of sessions, as calculated from the application logs. The average session length falls into the online behaviour metrics and is a good indicative of user engagement, while normalising for the sign up time. The higher the value, the more engaged a user is. We assume activities to belong to the same session if their time difference is less than 15 minutes. The user retention curve is defined by the proportion of users who revisited the tool and the frequency of their sessions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The steepness of the slope indicates the level of engagement. A steep slope implies that many people interacted with the application only a few times; a flatter slope indicate that only a few people abandoned the application after interacting with it just a few times, while many people had frequent interactions. Within each treatment group, we compute the number of sessions by all users and display a log-log plot of the data. Being an application independent measure, we use the user retention curve to compare the engagement performance of our four experimental treatments with the ones of reference gamified applications and games with a purpose from literature<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> . The user life time represents the number of correct and incorrect quiz questions answered by a user. We use this metric to understand how different game mechanics influence the number of correct and incorrect answers submitted by a user. To subjectively measure user engagement, we use the multidimensional scale constructed by O'Brien et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, targeting the focused attention, perceived usability and aesthetics dimensions. We apply a Principal Component Analysis on the questionnaire's result to select a single statement (for each of the three attributes) to use for reporting purposes. The analysis resulted in: 1) I found this website confusing to use (perceived usability); 2) The website was aesthetically appealing (aesthetics);</p><p>3) I forgot about my immediate surroundings while playing on the website (focused attention).</p><p>Social Online Behaviour. Our interest is in online actions aimed at building stronger professional connections, and spread awareness of the enterprise's vision and interests. We therefore have two measures. The number of invites metric measures the amount of invitations sent by a participant to another IBMer connected on this user's social networks. The more invites a user sends, the more socially active (s)he is in the application. The number of shared news refers to how many news articles a user shared on her/his social networks from the tool. Both metrics closely relate to the definition of social online behaviour given in Section "HMIAY Application".</p><p>Learning. We used three knowledge categories: IBM Facts, World Wide Technology and You &amp; Your network. To assess the learning effect of the application on participants, we used a qualitative assessment method. For each of the above categories, employees were asked to select on a 5-point Likert scale their level of agreement with the following question: "I have learned about {TOPIC} by answering questions in the category {CATEGORY}".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>During the observation interval, 413 unique IBM employees visited the home page of HMIAY application, as observed trough Web analytics. Out of the 250 that signed up for the experiment, 206 employees played the game at least once. They were based in nine countries and three continents: 78.1% from The Netherlands, 8.7% Belgium, 7.8% Romania, 1.4% United Kingdom, 1.4% United States of America, and less than 1% in Argentina, France, Peru and Germany). A majority of Dutch employees was expected, as the application has been only physically advertised at IBM's HQ in the Netherlands. As no online advertisement campaign was employed, the presence of international users has been a positive unexpected result, mainly due to the invitation mechanism in the application. 77.7% of the employees in our experiments were male, a ratio that reasonably approximates IBM's gender distribution worldwide. 20.9% of users were IBM managers. In terms of business units, employees' were distributed as follows: Global Business Services department (30.6%), IBM Sales &amp; Distribution (31.5%), IBM Integrated Operations (17.4%), Global Technology Services (7.7%), IBM Software Group (8.2%), IBM Systems &amp; Technology (0.5%) and IBM Integrated Supply Chain (2%).</p><p>The random assignment yielded acceptable results, taking into account the given sample size. Although the number of female employees is not equally distributed across the four groups, the differences are contained. Male employees, on the other hand, were better distributed across groups.</p><p>The number of managers and non-managers is also well distributed across the groups. All groups included participants working in different countries, and belonging to different departments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>User Engagement</head><p>This section is concerned with RQ 1: Which game mechanic is more effective for driving user engagement? In the observed period, the HMIAY application has been used 778 times. The number of sessions per user ranged between 1 and 103, with 112 employees playing a single session. They spent in the application a total number of 66 hours, while individual interaction time was between 1 minute and 8.3 hours. Employees answered a total of 2061 questions in IBM Facts, 1720 questions in World Wide Technology and 3995 social questions; they submitted 553 invitations (addressed to 440 unique colleagues), and shared company related news 299 times.</p><p>We answer RQ1 through three sub research questions, each focusing on a different aspect of user engagement.</p><p>Which game mechanics are more effective for incentivising users to play longer? We look at the average session length in the four treatment groups and use the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon non-parametric test <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> to test for statistically significant difference across the groups <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref> . The resulting statistics for average session length are summarised in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>. When users are provided with either leaderboards (G1) or badges (G2) we see an improvement in the average session length. When we combine leaderboards and badges (G3) the effect is more pronounced, resulting in even longer sessions. We investigated the statistical significance of the observed differences, testing the null hypothesis that the distributions of the considered groups are identical. The resulting pvalues are summarised in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> (right-hand side). We have strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the two samples come from the same distribution when comparing G0 with G1, G2, and G3. This suggests that the users tend to stay on the website longer when they see leaderboards or receive badges.  The effect is even more pronounced when the two game mechanics are combined. When used alone, there is no preference towards either leaderboards or badges.</p><p>The previous statistics only considered average session length. To test the engagement of our subjects over time, we computed and analysed their retention curves. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> we compare the slopes (calculated as linear fits to the real of the lines between our four treatment groups, and with other reference systems from literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. We observe that G1 and G2 produce flatter (almost identical) lines, compared to the control group G0, thus pointing to an higher level of engagement. The flattest curve is the one associated with G3 which, as for the average session length, appears to be the more engaging configuration. Notably, G0 shows a retention curve comparable with the ones of applications such as ESP, Verbosity, and others. G1, G2, and G3, however, appears to provide significantly better engagement performance.</p><p>Which game mechanics are more effective for incentivising users to answer questions? We analyse the number of total and correct answered questions in the three targeted knowledge categories. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">5</ref> reports an overview of the number of average questions per user. As in similar studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, we investigate the effect of incentive mechanics on the number of answered questions by means of negative binomial regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, to account for over-dispersed data. users provided with both leaderboards and badges (G3) featured the strongest increase in the number of both correct and total number of questions. Both G1 and G2 do not increase the number of total answered questions nor the number of correct questions. For World Wide Technology questions, all treatments have a significant effect on both increasing overall participation and the number of correct answers. Badges provide slightly better performance for both variables. When combined, leaderboard and badges give the strongest effect, increasing the number of answered questions by 370% (1.31) and the number of correct questions by 448% (1.51) compared to the control group. With You &amp; Your Network questions, the adoption of leaderboards show an improvement in both total and correct answers, while badges do not have such an effect. As with the previous results, the combination of leaderboards and badges is the best for incentivising user participation.</p><p>Which game mechanics stimulate better perceived user engagement? We address focused attention, perceived usability and aesthetics attributes of user engagement. We analyse the data resulting from N = 41 respondents who answered the questions related to user engagement. Respondents were split into the four treatment groups as follows: 6 participants in G0, 13 in G1, 10 in G2, and 12 participants in G3. To process the answers, we recoded the Likert scale on an ordinal scale with 1 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree) and compute basic statistics across treatment groups. We test for statistically significant differences using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon non-parametric test. Results are summarised in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>. Treatments consistently received positive evaluation in all the engagement dimensions (in the perceived usability question, the lower the score the better), thus indicating a good feeling between our subjects and the application. We observe no statistically significant difference between groups in terms of focussed attention and perceived usability attributes. When analysing responses concerning aesthetics, we notice that users in G3 perceived the tool to be more visually appealing than users in the other groups. This is an interesting outcome, given that all configurations of the application shared the same look and feel. Results suggest that having both leaderboards and badges, compared to receiving only one of the two, have an influence on users' aesthetics perception.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social online behaviour</head><p>This section is concerned with RQ 2: Which game mechanic is more effective for promoting online social behaviour of employees?. We analyse the number of invitations sent and the number of news shared across the treatment groups, and address the following three sub-questions.  Which game mechanics are more effective for incentivising users to invite their colleagues to play the game? 21.07% of the users sent at least one invitation. The skewed distribution of data suggests the adoption of a zero-inflated Poisson regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. For consistency, we want to use a negative binomial regression, unless the zero-inflated Poisson regression mode proves statistically superior. We therefore fit the two regressions and test how well they approximate our data by means of a Vuong closeness test <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The null hypothesis is that the two models are equally close to the actual model, against the alternative that one model is closer. Although the result suggests that the zero-inflated Poisson regression model is superior, we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis (pvalue : 0.327). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref> shows the coefficients and significance levels of fitting a negative binomial regression model on the number of sent invitations across treatments. As users receive rewards (used to increase their leaderboard position) and earn badges when invitations are accepted, we also included in the regression model the distribution of accepted invitations. The intercept corresponds to the control group and has been omitted from the table. While only a fraction of users sent invitations, we observe how leaderboards had a significant effect, which got enhanced when combined with badges. The result suggests that game mechanics can provide a further positive influence on the social behaviour of already engaged users.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">µ σ G0 G1 G2 G3 µ σ G0 G1 G2 G3 µ σ G0 G1 G2 G3<label>G0</label></formula><p>Coeff. Signif.</p><p>Acc.Invit. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Do IBMers have strong ties across departments?</head><p>We use the number of invitations sent in the application as a proxy for strong ties, under the assumption that employees send invitations only to those colleagues they have a strong connection with (intuitively, due to professional reputation, one is less prone to "spam" social connections in a professional environment). A strong tie refers to friendship and familial relationships and is characterised by "the amount of time and emotions invested in a relationship" <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Our hypothesis is that employees have stronger relationships with colleagues from the same department, than colleagues in other departments.</p><p>The nodes in the graph represent users (inviter or invitee) and the edges represent invitations sent between these users. A node is colour-and size-coded. The colour shows the department and the size represent the number of invitations sent by the user. The more invitations sent, the larger the node.</p><p>From the total number of invitations sent in the application, 48.42% were inter-department, while 51.57% were intradepartment. Interestingly, we observed differences in the behaviour of employees across departments: employees in Global Technologies and Sales and Distributions sent most invitations to colleagues outside their departments, contrarily to employees in Global Technology Services and Global Business Services. These insights suggest that the user invitation action can be an effective tool to detect and trace strong ties across enterprise departments; such an analysis can prove very valuable for human resource management and organisation purposes, and indicates interesting directions for future research.</p><p>Can gamification incentivise users to share news on their professional network? The 299 news sharing actions were performed by 5.33 % of the employees who used the application. Statistical significance analysis run on the coefficients of a zero-inflated Poisson regression model shows no relevant difference in the distribution of news sharing activities between the four treatments. We performed further inves-tigations to understand the reasons behind the low number of news sharing users. We studied the hypothesis that the new content was not appealing enough to be worthy of redistribution even with an additional incentive. To test such hypothesis we extended our analysis to include all IBM related news shared by user that linked they LinkedIn network. We included in this analysis all the posts a user made on her social networks that include the word "IBM". 44 IBMers <ref type="bibr">(21.</ref>35 % of our sample size) shared IBM-related content on their LinkedIn network after signing up to the application. We found no statistical difference in the distribution of IBMrelated news across groups. Therefore, we don't have sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis. This shows that more explorations are needed into the effect of gamification on this type of social behaviour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning</head><p>This section focuses on RQ 3: Which game mechanic is more effective for supporting learning? We analyse the response of the 41 users that filled the questionnaire on perceived engagement and perceived learning. We recode the answers on the Likert scale on an ordinal scale from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) and compute means and standard deviations across the treatment groups. We use Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon non-parametric test to verify statistically significant differences between groups. The results are summarised in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref>. Treatments consistently received positive evaluation for all the knowledge categories, thus showing the positive effect on learning that a gamified experience can provide. We observe no statistical difference across treatments for the perceived learning in the IBM Facts and You &amp; Your Network categories. In the World Wide Technology category, we observe a statistical difference between G2 and G3.</p><p>Consistent with literature investigating gamification outside the enterprise, the subjective data indicates that the gamified HMIAY tool can promote learning. The experiment did not show a relevant effect for the studied game mechanics, therefore calling for further detailed investigations on the subject.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We now elaborate on the results reported in the previous sections, in the light of the research questions and experimental hypothesis defined in Section "Experimental Methodology".</p><p>Recruitment and Retainment. The comparison between the number of employees invited by colleagues (440) and the number of unique employees visiting the application's home page (413), points to the effectiveness of word-of-mouth and social sharing techniques. 60% (250) of such employees decided to subscribe to the experiment, and 82% of them played at least once. These outcomes suggest a significantly diverse perception of the game (and its utility and goals) within the targeted population. We acknowledge the likelihood of a selection bias, as the nature and the requirements of HMIAY might have influenced the distribution of participants in the overall IBM employees' population. The adoption of an open recruitment methodology, does not allow for deeper analysis on the success of the HMIAY application within IBM: intuitively, we have no information about employees that willingly decided not to visit the application's home page, or not to enrol. The investigation on the attractive and repulsive aspects of enterprise gamification across different demographics is therefore left for future work. On the other hand, we consider the 45% retainment ratio (i.e. employees that played more than once) a good result, especially when compared with other games with a purpose in literature (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</p><p>User Engagement. The experiment demonstrated in a consistent manner the positive effects that gamification can provide in an enterprise learning and social interaction tool. Leaderboard and badges shown a positive effect for all the considered objective dimensions. In terms of average session length, their combination is even more effective. The same type of additive effect is at play when considering the number of (correctly) answered questions. However, the effect of only badges or only leaderboards is dependent on the type of questions users answer. Used alone, leaderboards are effective only for incentivising users to answer World Wide Technology and You &amp; Your Network. When used alone, badges are only effective for incentivising users to answer questions in the World Wide Technology category. Noteworthy is the popularity of You &amp; Your Network across all conditions. This is an important result, that suggests a genuine interest of employees in discovering more about their work environment, an interest that is significantly amplified by game mechanics.</p><p>From a subjective point of view, we observed that only the users' perception of aesthetics is influenced by the game mechanics. The other two attributes, focussed attention and perceived usability, while showing very good assessment from the interview users, appear not be influenced. Given the amount of subjects, and the known drawbacks of user perception measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, results should be conservatively interpreted, and further investigations performed. Finally, it is worth mentioning the good results in terms of user retention curve for all the treatments groups (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>): even accounting for the more limited user base, these results suggests an high level of engagement, which is comparable, if not superior to the one featured by the most popular GWAP in literature. This is a very encouraging result, which hints to a potentially successful employment of even more "aggressive" forms of gamification in the enterprise environment.</p><p>Social Behaviour. Given the definition provided in Section "HMIAY Application", we measured the number of sent invitations and shared news as an indication of social behaviour. The tested game mechanics provided a positive effect on the number of sent invitations; as for the engagement aspects, the combination of leaderboards and badges provides a strengthened effect. As part of the analysis, we investigated the invitations graph and observed that the considered IBMers are well connected both intra-and inter-department. This type of analysis can be very useful in an enterprise environment, and the correct usage of game mechanics can greatly help in the identification of strong organisational types.</p><p>The analysis of shared news provided conclusive evidence neither about the efficacy of the HMIAY tool, nor about the roles that game mechanics can play in driving this type of social behaviour. We explain this outcome as the result of a confounding factor of the content of the articles to be shared:  no personalisation mechanism was included in the news sharing functionality, thus binding employees to a pre-defined and fixes set of choices. As employees are more and more active in managing their personal and professional identities <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, we hypothesise the lack of suitable news to have neutralised the incentive attached to the sharing action. Further investigations on the joint effect of personalised content sharing and gamification mechanisms are object of future work.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">µ σ G0 G1 G2 G3 µ σ G0 G1 G2 G3 µ σ G0 G1 G2 G3 G0<label>4</label></formula><p>Learning. Lastly, we look at perceived learning by analysing respondents' answers to a questionnaire. While the tool has been consistently evaluated in a positive way, results show that leaderboards, badges, or the combination of the two do not impact learning neither negatively nor positively, exception being made by the World Wide Technology category. This is also a promising result, that confirm previous works in literature: the feedback gaming element supported the learning experience, which wasn't affected by the adoption of different game mechanics. Interestingly, the You &amp; Your Network category consistently received the lowest (although positive) evaluation. We can interpret this result as a signal of disappointment: despite the great engagement with this type of questions (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">5</ref>), employees would have preferred more information about their peers. This is an encouraging outcome, that suggests the value of a gamified experience to promote the spread of information about the enterprise workforce.</p><p>Legal and ethical aspects Our work bridged the gap between an employee's professional and private information by combining user data from social and professional networks with enterprise data. Respecting user's privacy is not only required from a legal and an ethical point of view, it has also been a critical part of system design because trust is a prerequisite for engagement. Our work featured the best practices concerning transparency and privacy and is compliant with the European Data Protection Act<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">4</ref> . Specifically, at registration time, and at any moment during the usage of the application, users could access the "Terms of Service" , which specified the purpose of the tool, what kind of data was requested of the employees and how this data has been used. At any moment in time, users could also opt-out from the application, and we made sure that all the information about an employee associated with this project were permanently deleted. Notably, within the duration of our experiment no user took advantage of such an option.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>Our research aims at better understanding how gamification can be used to drive user engagement with Web systems in an enterprise environment. In this paper we have presented an experiment performed at IBM, where we studied the effectiveness of various game mechanics on social interaction and learning.</p><p>The experiments provided several useful insights. The "How much of an IBMer are you" (HMIAY) application was received well by employees. They quickly engaged with the application, answering quiz questions, inviting colleagues to try the application, and shared news. The level of engagement achieved through the tested game mechanics was, in general, high. We often noticed variations in the measures for the engagement dimensions according to the mechanics a group received. HMIAY has proven successful for promoting knowledge acquisition. Results related to social online behaviour are also encouraging, showing how gamification can also be an effective tool for driving given types of social behaviours.</p><p>This work provides plenty of inspirations for future research directions. For instance, we plan to better understand the type of additive relationship often shown by the combination of leaderboards and badges. While the two mechanics stress two different types of motivations, a latent effect, to be further studied, seems to play a role when combined. Also, we want to better understand which incentives can better drive employees with news sharing activities. Our work explicitly focused on leaderboards, badges and the combination of the two. However, the research community would benefit from expanding these game mechanics to include the ones that are less popular, for instance levels and progress.</p><p>Gamification engines like Work&amp;Play can potentially access and cross reference personal data from different sources. It is therefore important to protect such private data from attacks, de-anonymization and exploitation beyond the explicitly allowed use. Having more means to protect one's privacy can prove beneficial for engagement and mass adoption of gamification tools. We believe that an important direction for future work is to explore privacy-by-design approaches for gamified system.</p><p>Finally, we recognise the obvious importance of conducting similar studies in other companies, to test if the conclusions drawn by the current work can be further generalised beyond the IBM use case.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Overview of the Work&amp;Play architecture.</figDesc></figure>
