If one imposes conditions on the degree of the divisor used, then we derive criteria for linear codes to be algebraic-geometric. In particular, the family of q -ary Hamming codes is investigated, and it is proven that only those with redundancy one or two and the binary [7,4,31 code are algebraic-geometric in this sense.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>braicgeometric (SAG) codes (Definition 2). The class of SAG codes is a proper subset of the class of AG codes, and the class of AG codes is a proper subset of the class of WAG codes. Furthermore, we also explain what we mean by a WAG, AG, or SAG representation of a code. Some basic properties are mentioned. Section I1 actually serves as an introduction to the rest of the paper. At the end of Section I1 we introduce the notion of a minimal representation. We prove that every WAG, AG, or SAG code of dimension at least two has a minimal WAG, AG, or SAG representation, respectively. This is useful in Sections IV and V.</p><p>The WAG codes are the codes that can be obtained by Goppa's construction when no restrictions are imposed on the degree of the divisor used. Inspired by the notion of a covering curve of <ref type="bibr">Goppa [9]</ref> and a paper by Hansen and Stichtenoth <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>, we prove in Section I11 that every linear code is WAG. In this way we solve problem <ref type="bibr">(3.1.19)</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. The curves are given explicitly. <ref type="bibr">Goppa [7,</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 781</ref> claimed that every linear code is WAG, but his proof is not sufficient, see Remark 5. Lachaud <ref type="bibr">[14, (5.</ref>10)l made a weaker claim, namely that every linear code is a subcode of a WAG code.</p><p>In Section IV we derive several conditions on linear codes to be AG. As proved at the end of that section, all binary SAG codes have length <ref type="bibr">5 8</ref> . By the results of Section 111, the class of AG codes therefore seems to be the most interesting. Special attention is paid to Reed-Muller codes, Hamming codes, and the binary Golay code and its extension. For example, the conditions on AG codes imply that a q-ary Hamming code of redundancy r is not AG if r &gt; 2 and ( r , q ) # <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>.</p><p>In Section V we are interested in explicit WAG, AG, or SAG representations of codes, and in the question whether something can be said about the uniqueness of these representations. As an example, we investigate the family of q-ary Hamming codes in close detail (Section V-A). We prove that these codes are SAG in the cases left open in Section IV. In the case ( r , q ) = (3,2), that is, for the binary [7,4,3] code, we obtain the nice result that this code has a unique minimal representation as an AG code. In Section V-B we discuss another example, namely, a code that was mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, and prove that it is SAG.</p><p>0018-9448/91/0500-0583$01.00 01991 IEEE</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Notation</head><p>We use F, to denote the finite field of q elements. We use P' to denote the I-dimensional projective space; it will be clear from the context over which field (usually F, or the algebraic closure F,). If any confusion is possible, we use P'(F,) to denote the finite set of (q'+' -l)/(q -1) points over F, in P', for instance. Similarly, A' denotes the I-dimensional affine space. By a curve over a field k we mean a projective, reduced scheme over k of dimension one. As with P' and A', we sometimes write E(&amp;',) to indicate the finite set of F,-rational points on E. The function field of E over k is denoted by k ( X ) . The group of divisors on X is denoted by Div(E). If 9: E-+ LT' is a morphism of curves, then we denote by (p* both the induced homomorphism k ( T ) + k ( X ) and the induced homomorphism Div(LT') + Div(E), see <ref type="bibr">[ll, p.</ref> 1371. If f E k(E)\(O}, we denote by (f) its divisor, a so-called principal divisor. The notation div(f) is also used in the literature. Similarly, if w is a nonzero rational differential form on E, then we denote its divisor by ( w ) , a so-called canonical divisor. If P is a place of k ( Z ) over k, that is, a discrete valuation ring of k ( Z ) over k, then we denote by up the discrete valuation function at P. In the literature the notation ord, is also customary. If D is a divisor on E, then supp(D) denotes the support of D , that is, the set of places with nonzero coefficient in D. If D , and D , are divisors on a curve Z, then we denote by D , -D , that D, and D , are linearly equivalent. By <ref type="bibr">[D]</ref> we denote the linear equivalence class of D , that is, the set consisting of all the divisors on X linearly equivalent with D. The complete linear system associated to D is denoted by ID(. This is the set of all effective divisors in <ref type="bibr">[D]</ref>. We denote by P i c ( E ) the group of divisors on E modulo principal divisors, the so-called divisor class group. By Pic,(E) we denote the subgroup of P i c ( E ) consisting of the divisors of degree 0 modulo principal divisors. By Pic,(E) we denote the coset of Pic,(E) in Pic(X) consisting of the divisors of degree m modulo principal divisors. By g, we denote the set of effective divisors on E of degree m. We define h := #Pic,(E). In fact, we have h = #Pic,(E) for every m. For all this, see [161.</p><p>If C is a linear code, we denote by d(C) its minimum distance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">ALGEBRAIC-GEOMETRIC CODES AND REPRESENTATIONS</head><p>Definition 1: Let E be a projective, nonsingular, absolutely irreducible curve defined over F,. The genus of E is denoted by g ( E ) , or simply by g, if it is clear which curve is meant. Let P,; *, P,, be n distinct F,-rational points of E. We denote both the n-tuple (PI,. . -, P,,) and the divisor P, + . . . + P, by D (the order of the Pi is fixed). Let G be a divisor on E of degree m with support disjoint from the support of D. <ref type="bibr">Let</ref>  If moreover m &lt; n then k = n -m -1 + g.</p><p>Proof: See <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, or [221. Proof: See <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, or [221. 0 Definition 2: We call a q-ary linear code C weakly algebraic -geometric (WAG) if there exists a projective, nonsingular, absolutely irreducible curve X defined over F, of genus g, and n distinct rational points P,; e , P,, on X and a divisor G with support disjoint from the support of D , where D = P, + ... + Pn, such that C = C,(X, D , G ) . We call the triple (E, D, G ) a weakly algebraic -geometric representation (WAG representation), or shortly, a representation of C. An algebraicgeometric representation (AG representation) is a representation</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(X, D , G ) with deg(G) &lt; n. We call a code algebraic- geometric (AG) if it has an AG representation. A strongly algebraic -geometric representation (SAG representation) is a representation (E, D , G ) with 2g -2 &lt; deg(G) &lt; n.</formula><p>A code is called strongly algebraic-geometric (SAG) if it has a SAG representation.</p><p>Remark 1: There exists a differential form w with a simple pole at each P, and such that resp, (0) = 1 for </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">C is AG if moreover 2g -2 &lt; deg(G). The code C is SAG if moreover 2g -2 &lt; deg(G) &lt; n.</formula><p>In view of Proposition 1 we therefore have the following corollary.</p><p>Corollary 1: If C is WAG or SAG, then C is WAG, SAG, respectively.</p><p>Remark 2: There exist codes which are AG while the dual is not. For an example, see Remark 13.</p><p>Definition 3: Let n &gt; l . Let r i : F:-+ F:-' be the projection defined by deleting the ith coordinate. If C is a code in F: then define Ci by Ci = r i ( C ) . We say that Ci is obtained from C by puncturing at the ith coordinate.</p><p>Lemma 1:   We call a q-ary linear [ n, kl code projectiue if every two columns of a generator matrix of C are linearly independent. Thus if we view the columns of a generator matrix as points in the (k -@dimensional projective space P k -' , expressed in homogeneous coordinates, then we get n distinct points. This definition is obviously independent from the generator matrix chosen. By S(r,q) we denote any q-ary projective code of dimension r and length (qr -l)/(q -1). Such a code is called a Simplex code. By H(r,q) we denote the dual of S(r,q). This is a q-ary Hamming code of redundancy r. If all the is AG or SAG, then C , is AG, SAG, respectively. n points of a projective code lie in the complement of a hyperplane then we call the code affine.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">If C is WAG then Ci is WAG. Proof: Suppose that C = C L ( X , D, G</formula><p>Remark 4: If n 2 3, then a code C is projective if and only if d(C ) 2 3. The code C is affine if and only if C is projective and there exists a codeword with weight equal to the word length. The maximal word length of a projective code of dimension r is (4'-l)/(q -1). For fixed r and q all q-ary Simplex codes of dimension r are isometric. The same holds for Hamming codes. The maximal possible word length of an affine code of dimension r is qr-'. For fixed q and r all affine q-ary codes of dimension r and word length qr-' are isometric and are called q-ary first-order Reed -Muller codes.</p><p>Remark 5: Suppose C is an affine code and we want to show that it is WAG. By Lemma 2, we may assume after an isometry, that the all one vector is a codeword and it is the first row of a generator matrix of C. Let the n points Q,;.*,Q, in Pk-' correspond to the n columns of the generator matrix. Suppose there exists an absolutely irreducible, projective curve X over F4 in P k -' , which goes through Q,,. . a , Q,. The curve may be singular, but suppose there exjsts a rational point Pi in n-l(Qi), for every i, where n: E-+ X is the normalization. Let </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">C is k. So l(G) 2 k. If l(G) = k then C=C,(&amp;,D,G)</formula><p>,where D=(P,;..,P,), that istosay C is WAG. In other words, we are looking for a curve % in pk-1 going through Q,,. . ., Q, such that the linear system of hyperplane sections of X is complete, and such that for every i there is a rational point in n-'(Qi). In the next section we show that indeed there exists such a curve, going through all the qk-' rational points of Pk-' outside a hyperplane. Such curves were called covering curves by Goppa [9, Ch. 4, Sect. 101. Goppa [7, p. 781 claimed that every linear code is WAG. In the proof he only mentioned that if Q1; . -, Q, are n distinct points in pk-1 , then there exists a curve passing through Q,; * *, Q,.</p><p>First of all this reasoning only applies to projective codes, and secondly, the linear system of hyperplane sections of this curve does not need to be complete. This would only prove that every projective code is a subcode of a WAG code, see Lachaud <ref type="bibr">[14, (5.10)</ref>].</p><p>Remark 6: Let C be a q-ary projective code of dimension at least 2. Suppose C = CL(X, D, G) for some curve X and divisors D and G. If L(G) = L(G -P ) for some point P of E, then P is not in the support of D.</p><p>Otherwise P = Pi for some i E (1,. . -, n), so all the codewords have a zero at place i, contradicting the assumption that C is projective. Thus G -P has disjoint support with D and C = C L ( X , D,G -P). Repeating this procedure we may assume without loss of generality that G is a divisor such that L(G) # L(G -P ) for all points P, that is to say G has no base points. Let I(G) = I and let fo,. . a , f l P l be a basis of L(G). Consider the morphism cp, : E-, p1-1, given by the collection of morphisms where Gj = G +(fi), and qj is defined by . . : --( P ) ) , (see [ l l , p. 1581). Let X o be the reduced image of 9 L ? under the morphism pG. Then Zo is not a single point. Even stronger, Xo is not contained in any hyperplane. This follows from the fact that fo,fl,-..,fi-l are linearly independent. Hence pG is a finite dominant morphism X + Xo of curves. Since X is absolutely irreducible, Eo is absolutely irreducible too.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(cp) = 1; f) if ( E , D , G ) is an AG representation, then so is g) if _(X,D,G) is a SAG representation, then so is Proof: Let I(G) = I.

This implies that the inclusions in (2) are equalities, and hence that P is a basepoint of Go, a contradiction. Thus deg(cpi)=l, and cp is separable. So we can apply the genus formula of Zeuthen-Hurwitz to cp:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">2 g ( E) -2 = ( 2 g ( eo) -2 ) deg (cp) + deg ( R ) ,</formula><p>where R is the ramification divisor of cp, which is effective. As shown ic [ l l , p. 303, Example 2.5.41, it follows that g ( X ) 2 g ( Z o ) . Note that if de_g(cp) = 1, then R = 0.

U Corollary 2: Suppose that (X, D, G) is a WAG representation of a projective code C of dimension at least two, with G base point free, and such that g ( X ) is minimal, that is to say, for all WAG representations (xl, D',G') of C we have g ( X ) I g ( x l ) . Then (E, D,G) is a minimal WAG representation of C . This corollary is also true if "WAG" is replaced by "AG" everywhere, or by "SAG."</p><p>Proof: Let (eo, b, 6) be a minimal WAG representation of C with the properties as in Proposition 2. By the assumption on g ( X ) , and by Proposition 2e), we have g ( p 0 ) = g ( X ) , and hence deg(cp,) = deg(cp) = 1, by Proposition 2c). Since G is base point free, moreover, ( Z , D , G ) is minimal. The two assertions in the second part of the corollary are proved similarly, using Proposi-0 tion 2f) and 2g), respectively.</p></div>

For every fixed y1 there are exactly-q'-' solutions y = (yl; * e , yr) in Fi as well as in F: of the equations fl; . *, f i P l = 0. Hence X(I, q ) has dimension one and is a complete intersection. Let f = (fl; . -, fll). Computing the derivative of f gives Hence df has m-~mal rank at all points not equal to P, of Z ( 1 , q ) over F4. Thus the curve is nonsingular outside P,. Thus X(I,q) is reduced outside P, and a complete intersection, and therefore it is reduced. Let n: @ ( k ) -+ X ( I , s ) be the normalization of X(I,q) and p, any point in n-'(P,). Let U , be the discrete valuation at P, . Let zC= yr 0 n. Then zl ; a , zI are rational functions on X(l,q) and have no poles outside n-'(P,&gt;.

Let f be a rational function on E such that G = G' + (f). Then f is defined at Pi and f ( P i ) # 0, for all i . In the special case (which is the only possible case if C is binary), that f ( P i ) = f(4) for all i and j , we have C = C'. This is a sufficient but, in general, not a necessary condition. By the theorem of independence of valuations, see <ref type="bibr">[2, p. 111</ref> We see that the triple (Z, a D , G') represents a code that is isometric with C. The proof of Lemma 2 shows that every code isometric with C can be represented this way, that is to say, by a triple ( Z , a D , G ' ) for a suitable permutation a and a divisor G' linearly equivalent with G . If E%^' is a curve and cp: x'+ .9? is an isomorphism, <ref type="figure">then C ,</ref><ref type="figure">( T ,</ref><ref type="figure">cp*(D),</ref><ref type="figure">cp*(G)</ref>) is also a representation of C.</p><p>Here cp*( D ) and cp*(G) denote the pull backs of D and G to T under cp, respectively. When discussing uniqueness of representations of codes, one does not wish to distinguish between isomorphic curves, nor between linearly equivalent divisors G , nor between divisors D that can be obtained from each other by a permutation of the rational points in their support. By the above reasoning, it is therefore more convenient and more useful to think of a representation as a representation of the whole collection of codes isometric to a particular code, rather than to consider it as a representation of a single code. For given Z and D , it is actually sufficient only to specify the linear equivalence class of G , since in the linear equivalence class of any divisor there is a divisor that has disjoint support with D , by the independence of valuations.</p><p>Therefore, we introduce the following concepts.  Remark 22: Recall from Section I1 (Definition 5 and Remark 4) that H ( r , q ) denotes any q-ary linear code with parameters [n = (4' -l)/(q -11, nr,3] (codes of the same length and dimension, but with minimum distance greater than 3 do not exist). All such codes are isometric. From now on, we shall use the notation H(r, q ) also to denote the isometry class consisting of all the q-ary linear codes with these parameters. It is well known and easily deduced from Definition 5 and Remark 4 that a q-ary linear code is a Simplex code S(r, q ) if and only if it has parameters [ n = (4' -l)/(ql), r, q r -' ] . Similar to the case of the Hamming codes, we shall also use the notation S(r, q ) to denote the isometry class consisting of all the q-ary linear codes with these parameters.</p><p>In Section IV (Corollary 7) we already saw that the only Hamming codes that can possibly be AG are those with r = 1, r = 2, or ( r , q ) = (3,2). The cases r = 1 and r = 2 are dealt with by the following proposition.</p><p>Proposition 14: For every q , H(1,q) and H(2,q) are SAG.</p><p>Proof: Let X = P ' , the projective line over F,.

To do so, let us first try to find a triple (E, D,G) such that the code C,(X, D, G) is a binary code with parameters [7,4,3], hence is equal to an H <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>. First of all, we need a nonsingular, absolutely irreducible projective curve defined over F,, having at least seven rational points. Such a curve cannot be hyperelliptic (since then it would have at most six rational points), and it has genus at least three (see Table <ref type="table">I</ref>). If it has genus equal to three, such a curve, since not hyperelliptic, is isomorphic to a nonsingular and absolutely irreducible plane projective curve of degree four. Let S be the set consisting of all the (not necessarily nonsingular or absolutely irreducible, a priori) plane projective curves X of degree four, which have the following property: X goes through all the seven F,-rational points of P 2 , and none of these seven points is a singularity of Z. The set S is easily computed.

There are three rational points on L , which are also on X,. It follows that X, intersects L with multiplicity 2 at exactly one of them, and that the intersection is transversal at the two remaining points. In other words, the tangents to El at the seven rational points are precisely the seven lines defined over F,.

CRITERIA FOR LINEAR CODES TO BE ALGEBRAIC-GEOMETRIC We first mention a few well-known theorems (Theorems 3-5) and bounds on the genus of a curve. Definition 10: For any divisor D on a nonsingular, absolutely irreducible curve X over a field we define l ( D ) = dim L ( D ) and i ( D ) = dim f N D ) . Remark 9: If deg(D)&lt;O then I(D)=O. If deg(D)&gt; 2g -2 then i ( D ) = 0, where g is the genus of the curve. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that l ( D ) = deg(D) +1g + i ( D ) . So it gives a lower bound on I(D) in terms of the degree of D. The following theorem gives an upper bound. Theorem 3 (Clifford): If I(D) &gt; 0 and i ( D ) &gt; 0, then 1(D) 5 deg(D)+ 1. Proof: See [ l l l .Remark 10: A hyperelliptic curve is an absolutely irreducible, nonsingular curve of genus at least two, which has a morphism of degree two to the projective line. The pull back under this morphism of a point of degree one on the projective line is called a hyperelliptic divisor. A hyperelliptic curve over F, has at most 2q + 2 rational points. We have equality in Clifford's theorem if and only if D is a principal or a canonical divisor or the curve is hyperelliptic and the divisor D is linearly equivalent with a multiple of a hyperelliptic divisor, see [ l l , p. 3431. Definition 11: Let N,(g) be the maximal number of rational points on a nonsingular, absolutely irreducible curve, over F, of genus g . Remark 11: Table I gives some exactly determined values of N,(g). See [16, p. 341, [191, and [201. Castelnuovos bound): Let 12 1. If E is an absolutely irreducible curve, over F,, in P i and not contained in any hyperplane, then g ( Z ) I r ( m , [ ) .</figDesc></figure>
