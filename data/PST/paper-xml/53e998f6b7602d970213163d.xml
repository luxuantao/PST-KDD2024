<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>There are a growing number of shape-changing devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. However, most research has focused on demonstrating point-designs, i.e. illuminating a spot, in the space of possible shape-changing devices. We have reached a point in the evolution of these devices where it is necessary to be able to articulate how the devices compare and contrast with each other. If we take the analogy of a display device, we can express (and thereby compare and contrast) new display devices in terms of the number of pixels available, the pixel density, the screen size, screen refresh rate and number of bits per pixel. This tuple provides a rich space within which we can situate the different display devices built and identify gaps in the innovation cycle.</p><p>In contrast, we have no equivalent metric to describe shapechanging devices. Hence it is not clear how one prototype differs from another or what opportunities exist for new devices in this landscape. To address this gap, we introduce shape resolution, a tuple with ten features that we derive from Non-Uniform Rational B-splines (NURBS), a geometrical model able to describe most shapes. These features such as Area, Closure and Zero-crossing describe the features of a shape and also explain why they are desirable in a shape-changing device.</p><p>To explore a portion of the large design space that our framework offers, we propose and study the concept of Morphees, the next generation of flexible mobile devices that adapt their shapes on-demand to better fit the myriad of services they are likely to support. Morphees allows users to download applications that embed a dedicated form factor, for instance the "stress ball app" collapses the device on itself, or the "game app" makes it to adopt a console-like shape (Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>).</p><p>We concretize our concept of Morphees by implementing preliminary prototypes that help us to explore six building strategies using different shape changing materials. For instance one uses tiles of wood that are actuated with thin Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) wires (Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref>) and the other bends a flexible touchscreen (E-Ink and Unmousepad <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>) using SMA wires that we forged to return to the shape we needed (Figure <ref type="figure">1c</ref>). We compare the shape resolution of each design strategies and generate insights into creating high shape resolution self-actuated flexible devices.</p><p>Our main contribution is to offer the first metric for comparing shape-changing devices in term of shape by introducing the term shape resolution and its definition in ten features. We also contribute the concept of Morphees, the next generation of self-actuated flexible mobile devices, and show six technological approaches for building them. By evaluating the shape resolution of these strategies, we present informative insights for builders toward creating high shape resolution shape-changing devices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE FRAMEWORK OF SHAPE RESOLUTION</head><p>Our definition of shape resolution is based on the model of Non-Uniform Rational B-splines (NURBS) and has ten features (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>) that are analogous to the ones used for display resolution such as number of pixel, size of pixel, bit per pixel etc. However, a high resolution feature is not about maximizing its value but maximizing the range of its possible values. For instance, a shape has a highcurvature resolution if its surface has range of curvatures comprised between -π and π (concave to convex spike). Our features complement Coelho's properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> that describe the technological properties of shape-changing devices. Examples include power requirement, ability to memorize new shapes, input stimulus such as voltage potential or ability to sense deformations. This approach differs from ours in that these properties describe the object material and not the possible shapes it can adopt. To give a simple analogy, a display resolution is given by features such as pixel count, screen size or bits per pixel but not features such as power consumption or display technology (e.g. LCD), that, even if useful, relate to the underlying technology. Our approach follows the same line than the display resolution definition while Coelho's approach informs the technological description of the device.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NURBS principle</head><p>Invented in the 70s, NURBS is the geometrical model used to represent shapes from straight lines, to conic sections to free-form curves. A way to understand it is to see the shape as a grid of control points (a mesh), with particles traveling across it to trace the surface of the shape. At any time t, the particles' positions are an average of all the control points that attract them. The attraction depends on other attributes: the weights that can be seen as the amounts of attraction each control point has; the degree of freedom that can be seen as the size of the attraction effect: the more degrees, the more control points affect the particles, thus flattening the overall surface (e.g. a NURBS surface of degree 1 is a combination of lines). The knot vector allows some control points to affect the surface more strongly than others by partitioning the time into intervals. By varying the relative lengths of the intervals, it varies the amount of time each control point affects the particles, thus creating a surface less smooth. When the knot vector contains several consecutive knots of the same value (knot-multiplicity), it forces the curve to go through the associated control point, and create a kink in the surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. NURBS can describe shapes but do not take into account physical constraints such as time, mass distributions, and internal deformation energies. Dynamic-NURBS <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> incorporates these and other physical quantities into the NURBS geometric equations. A detailed description of NURBS and Dynamic-NURBS can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simplified version of NURBS</head><p>The features of NURBS (control points, weight, degree, knot vector) are at a level of abstraction that does not help comparing shape-changing devices from a design perspective. At the same time, these models are powerful tools that can describe any shape. Given these arguments, our approach is to use a simplified version of NURBS and to extract features at a level of abstraction that is intuitive and descriptive to designers and practitioners. We choose to use a uniform weight across control points, with a fixed degree of freedom of two, allowing the creation of almost all possible shapes. By using a simplified version of NURBS, we lay down the foundation to extend our feature set in the future by using the complete NURBS model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advantages of using NURBS</head><p>There are other geometrical model for representing shapes (e.g. using volumetric representation) but we believe that NURBs model represents a good approach to describe topographies of deformable devices for the following reasons: (1) It gives a precise and uniform metric for computing the value of the features. For instance, a designer can easily compute them in a CAD tool (e.g. Maya deals with NURBs and a script can easily compute values for these features); (2) Its foundations are deeply rooted in the physical word: In the bygone days before computers, draftsmen (for shipbuilding) were drawing smooth curves using a splines, thin rods of flexible material held in place with lead weights called ducks (the equivalent of control points in NURBs); (3) It can accurately describe any shapes and thus allows us to explore a conceptual space, which not only copes with existing technologies but that also encompasses enhancements in material development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE TEN FEATURES OF SHAPE RESOLUTION</head><p>A way to understand the generation of our ten features is to see the shape as a mesh: a shape is made of (a grid of) control points as a display is made of pixels. Finding features is then describing the possible ways this mesh can deform. Our approach was first to list usual mathematical operations we can perform on a grid of points (e.g. area, angles, sum of angles, altitudes, distances etc.); secondly we generated the shapes created by varying these measures; finally we grouped shapes by similar characteristics that lead to our features that are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> and for which we give the computation metrics in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. In this section we define and illustrate them using the related work.</p><p>Our features work with both uniform and non-uniform shapes. With a uniform shape, the same values apply for each feature all over the surface, whereas with a non-uniform shape, the values of each feature are defined per part.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Area</head><p>The Area of the shape is its surface area. A way to approximate it is to compute the surface area of the mesh convex hull. With NURBS, it is equivalent to computing the surface area of the controls points since a NURBS surface is contained in the convex hull of these points.</p><p>There are several manually changeable Area devices. For instance Xpaaand <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> is a display that can roll on itself and that the user extends by pulling its edges ([90C m 2 ;720 Cm 2 ]). Actuated 3D construction kits such as Bosu <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, Topobo <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> or Kinematics <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> have a potentially infinite, extendable Area since users can always manually attach a new block to the entire assembly.</p><p>Automated changeable Area devices include large architectural structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref> and small systems such as the Inflatable Mouse <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The BMW kinetic sculpture <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> consists of balls hanging from a ceiling and moving vertically to create a shape. As the shape fits in a room, the Area varies from the surface of the floor to the surface area of the room itself. The Inflatable Mouse <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> is a relatively small device that inflates and deflates for ergonomic purposes. Its Area changes as a function of the pressure in a balloon placed inside. The maximum Area is nearly five times the minimum. A similar deformation is used in Ambient Life <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, where a mobile device has a soft casing that inflates to mimic breathing when air flows back and forth in it. Among his other works on shape changing devices, Hemmert also propose a device whose casing tapers downwards when held in hand, thus increasing its Area by a factor of ~3 (the back plate tilts by 10° into each direction, extending by up to 15mm in depth) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Granularity</head><p>Granularity measures the density of physical actuation points. We assume that these physical actuation points have a 1:1 relation to NURBS control points and hence granularity is computed by dividing the number of control points (cp) by the Area of the shape in rest state.</p><p>Granularity is generally fixed. E.g. Surflex <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref>) or programmable blobs <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> are actuated materials with four control points. BMW kinetic sculpture <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> (714 metal balls, Area not given) has higher Granularity followed by actuated-pin displays. Such devices are made of an array of linear actuators that move up and down to create a shape above a plane. Examples include Popup <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> with a Granularity of 0.4 cp/cm 2 (4x4 pins on 64x64mm), FEELEX <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> with a Granularity of 0.063 cp/cm 2 (6x6 pins on a 24x24cm), Lumen <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> with a Granularity of 2.4 cp/cm 2 (13x13 pins on 84x84mm), Relief <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> with a Granularity of 0.07 cp/cm 2 (12x12 pins on 45x45cm).</p><p>To our knowledge there are no objects that change granularity on-demand, except actuated-pin displays that can simulate this by actuating groups of pins as one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Porosity</head><p>The surface of a shape can be discontinuous or perforated. The related feature is Porosity and is the ratio of the Area of perforated parts to the total Area of the shape. Computing the surface areas in done by using the convex hull made by the control points of the perforated and non-perforated parts of the surface. Thus the porosity can be computed by the following formula: 100×(Σ holes Area / Area). Changing the Porosity of a material is difficult since this deformation is not homeomorphic, i.e. not a result of a continuous stretching or bending of the original shape. Thus it is necessary to pre-perforate the material and close the hole when needed. This mechanism has for instance been used to create automated blinds to regulate the flow of air and light. Examples include Homeostatic facade [57] which Porosity goes from 0% to theoretically ~90% or Shutters <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> which Porosity goes from 0% to ~50%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Curvature</head><p>The Curvature intuitively describes the curviness of the surface. It is computed by removing π from the angle between 3 consecutive control points. Thus, the Curvature is positive for convex shapes, negative for concave shapes and zero for planes. For instance, a unit sphere has π/2 Curvature since the control points of a sphere form a cube.</p><p>Examples of fixed Curvature devices include spherical devices (Curvature π/2) such a Sphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and FlyEye <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, or arc shapes (Curvature also ~π/2) such as pointing devices proposed in Mouse 2.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</p><p>There are manually changeable Curvature devices such as Speakup <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58]</ref> that changes its shape from convex to concave. Note, however, that curve deformations are not trivial due to the intrinsic properties of material: a nonstretchable plane cannot be deformed into a sphere. Such planes may be deformed into cylinders. This is seen in Gummi <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, a thin touchscreen device that users can manually and continuously bend in one dimension. Other devices using E-ink flexible touchscreen allowing similar deformations include the PaperPhone <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, DisplayStacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> or FlexCam <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Bookisheet <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> reports a maximum bending of ± π/2 that corroborates our own measures using an 8x10cm E-ink display. Curving more than the material limits causes damage. In order to increase the maximum Curvature, alternative materials have to be considered, for instance paper as in Paper Window <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, few works have investigated automated changeable Curvature. Haptic Chameleon <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> is a widget for navigating video that changes shape depending on its functionality. For instance, when circular (Curvature π/2) it plays the video frame by frame, and when rectangular (Curvature 0 on each edges) it plays the video scene by scene. Harrison <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> demonstrates a touchscreen that creates bumps and valleys on a seamless surface. They created air chambers by layering several specially cut pieces of clear acrylic. A thin sheet of latex is draped on top. Inflating or deflating the cavities allows a Curvature range from -π/2 to π/2 for each cavity. A similar mechanism is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Reverse Curvatures (concave and convex) are also possible with Surflex <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> since it has actuators on both sides of a material (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Amplitude</head><p>The Amplitude intuitively describes the range of displacement of control points. It is computed as the distance between the rest position and the actuated position of a point on the surface. For instance, a rigid plane has zero Amplitude and a unit sphere has an Amplitude of 1.</p><p>Examples of automated changeable amplitude include actuated-pin displays already presented earlier. For instance Popup <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> has a maximum Amplitude of 12cm, FEELEX <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> 8cm, Lumen <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> 6cm and Relief <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> 13cm. In comparison, BubbleWrap <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> or ShadePixel <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, that are also actuated-pin displays, operate at a smaller Amplitude (&lt;1cm) and are rather used to simulate texture on a surface.</p><p>Note that actuated-pin display are 2.5D, meaning that they have a planar base. But the computation of the Amplitude also applies for any 3D shapes. The shape on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b</ref> can be used to illustrate how to proceed: each visible joint being assimilated as a control point, the Amplitude is thus given by the altitude between each triplet of consecutive joints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Zero-crossing</head><p>Zero-crossing describes the capability of a shape to have wave-like forms. It is the number of sign-changes between each pair of consecutive angles across the surface. A shape with a large Zero-crossing can have a wave pattern. A sphere has zero Zero-crossing. Note that there is a relation between Granularity and Zero-crossing; a high Granularity implies a possible high value for Zero-crossing.</p><p>There are few works investigating changeable Zero-Crossing devices. Harrison <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> demonstrates one of them with a touchscreen that creates bumps and valleys. When the touchscreen is flat the Zero-Crossing value is null but when air is pumped into the preformed cavities, the Zerocrossing reached a value that depends on the number of cavities; two in their example. With Pinoky <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> it is possible to increase this number. Pinoky is a ring-like device that can be attached to a plush toy for instance. By attaching the devices in several points of the plush and by alternating the direction of the actuation, it is thus possible to achieve variable Zero-crossing. However Pinoky has a low Granularity as the actuator are substantially large. Paik et al. demonstrate how to fold a surface into a set of shapes such as a boat or an airplane using the art of Origami <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, the Thrifty Faucet <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b</ref>) shows water consumption and hygiene to the user through deforming its shape into various postures. The Faucet can curl on itself or form a wave pattern (from zero to three Zero-crossing).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Closure</head><p>Closure intuitively describes how "closed" a shape is. It is computed as 100×(Area-boundaries Area) where boundaries Area is the surface area of the shape created by using the control points situated on the edges. A Plane has 0% Closure while a Sphere has 100% closure.</p><p>Thrifty Faucet <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b</ref>) illustrates changeable Closure. The Faucet is flat at rest and can form a spiral when actuated. Topobo <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> also achieves this circular deformation. Tilt display <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> illustrates an actuated-pin display with higher Closure than other pin-displays: the screen placed on each pin can tilt, thus offering control over the Closure of the shape. Finally, Qi <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> (~500%), Ambient Life <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> or inflatable buttons <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>An example of a device with changeable Stretchability is Mudpad <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. It is a surface that can change viscosity under the effect of an electromagnetic field in order to provide haptic feedback. The viscosity levels range from low viscocity fluids like water to highly viscous peanut butter. The liquid is embedded in a latex casing that can be deformed when users are pressing the surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strength</head><p>The Strength is the force needed to move a control point from the minimum Amplitude position to the maximum Amplitude position of the shape. Note that we define a difference in Amplitude as the reference point to compare Strength of devices. For instance a shape with a fixed high Strength is a rigid shape, i.e. it requires a large amount of force to deform (or break).</p><p>For decades, haptic feedback researchers have been investigating automated changeable Strength using device such as articulated arm. One example of manipulating physical shape with an articulated arm is the Haptic Chameleon presented earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The changes in shape that the controller undergoes (circle to rectangle) create a force feedback (Strength is not specified).</p><p>Examples of haptic feedback devices are ClaytricSurface <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3c</ref>) or Jamming UI <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> that are surfaces filled with Polysterene balls. By changing the air pressure inside the box, the particles compress, thus changing the softness of the overall material. This mechanism, called jamming, provides high Strength and is used to allow robots to grab heavy objects. MimicTile <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> is a flexible actuator placed on the side of a device that can dynamically change it stiffness by using an assembly of Shape Memory Alloy (the nominal practical force produced is 150 gf). SqueezeBlock <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> enables eye-free interaction with a mobile device by altering the stiffness and size of the virtual spring. Dynamic Knobs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> is a knob, placed on the side of a mobile phone, which alters it shapes so that the user can explore the phone status by touching it (no Strength values given).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Speed</head><p>The Speed is the time needed to move a control point from the rest position to the maximum Amplitude position of the shape under self-actuation. As with Strength the difference in Amplitude serves as the reference point to compare Speed of devices. To draw an analogy with displays, Speed can be seen as the refresh rate of a shape. Note that deformableonly devices such as bendable touchscreens (Gummi <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, PaperPhone <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, DisplayStacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> FlexCam <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> or Bookisheet <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>) are characterized by 0 Speed. In other words they are not self-actuated.</p><p>The range of Speed covered by shape changing devices depends on the actuator technology. For instance devices using thin SMA wires, such in Animating Paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> or Shutters <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, can change shape very quickly even so they do not investigate variable Speed. Actuated-pin displays based on motors allow for more control over the Speed. For instance the triggering speed of FEELEX <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> pins is 100ms. We did not find any values of variable Speed in the literature of shape changing objects we reviewed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of current related work shape resolution</head><p>We explained the ten features that describe the resolution of a shape and illustrated these features with existing related work. Based on this we observe that:</p><p>• Changeable Area devices are either very large and allow a large range of values, or small but only allow a small variation of Area (5 times for the highest resolution one). • Granularity is still low for most hand sized devices, and there are no devices with changeable Granularity. • Speed has currently been investigated as a value to maximize but we did not find shape changing with variable deformation Speed.</p><p>In summary, we observe that work on shape changing devices have concentrated on increasing the shape resolution for specific features, but few combine multiple high resolution features. In particular we see several gaps:</p><p>(1) there are no small Area and high Granularity devices with changeable Zero-crossing and Closure; (2) there are few devices that change their Porosity or Stretchability. This is probably due to the intrinsic limitations of materials that are hard to deform; (3) there are few small Area devices with high resolution Strength. The main issue is that force-feedback actuation is difficult to miniaturize, as it requires physical motors; (4) there are no devices with changeable Speed, i.e. that investigate the animation of the deformation (this corroborates with Rasmussen <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MORPHEES: CONCEPT AND PROPERTIES</head><p>A Morphee is a self-actuated flexible mobile device that address the multiple affordance desired by any applications and transform itself into desired shapes. We envision that app stores can potentially evolve to give opportunities to developers to create practical applications with their specific form factors. Using the Norman's definition of affordance <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, we present two main properties that such devices offer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived affordance on-demand</head><p>A Morphee changes shape to suggest the way it should be operated. For instance, the two sides of a Morphee can curl outward to mimic a console, thus suggesting users to grab the device with two hands. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4b</ref>, the top edges of a Morphee curls inward when the user is typing a password, thus suggesting a private operation to others in the vicinity (e.g. when typing a password).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Actual affordance on-demand (tactile &amp; force feedbacks)</head><p>A Morphee's physical properties change during the interaction to help users perform actions. In other words, it offers tactile and force feedback. For instance, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4b</ref>, the curled edge of a Morphee becomes a gun trigger in a shooting game, i.e. it offers resistance and a detent sensation when pushed by users. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4c</ref> instantiates the inflatable buttons by Harrison <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>: the surface creates bumps and valleys to mimic a physical keyboard, thus helping the user to enter text. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implementing Morphees</head><p>A Morphee has to be as thin and flexible as possible, with no physical switches or dials that could prevent shape deformations. It has several layers of flexible components: the computation circuits, the display and a 2D touch sensor and a shape-shifting layer. The shape-shifting layer morphs (and also senses its deformation), thus affecting the entire assembly. The key point is that the shape-shifting layer is a grid of physical control points, which can be actuated to form the desired shape. It implies that Morphees physically instantiate our framework. Actuating control points in the middle of the layer creates bumps and valleys while actuating control points in the periphery curl the layer. To realize these actuations there are various strategies possible, which we now investigate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MORPHEES: SIX ACTUATION STRATEGIES</head><p>We compare six actuation strategies, five using advanced technologies in morphing materials: Dielectric Electro Active Polymers (DEAP) and Shape Memory Alloys (SMA). We start with the simple strategies and then progress to more complex and higher shape resolution strategies. For each strategy we present their principle of actuation and the prototypes we built. We then evaluate the strategy with the ten features we proposed to define the shape resolution (see summary in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Morphee-motor: Linear actuation using motors</head><p>Principle: Morphee-motor is inspired by the SPIDAR system <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>: it uses motors and guitar strings to actuate control points. Actuating one motor decreases or increases the length between two corresponding nodes, thus bending the underlying part of the screen. The motor-strings couple is only placed on one side of the device so that strings do not prevent touch interaction when extended.</p><p>Low-fidelity prototype: The prototype shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref> consists of two servo motors, two guitar strings and four control points on a 8x10cm sheet of plastic that has the same thickness than a flexible touchscreen (An E-ink flexible display being ~2mm thick and a flexible touch sensor ~1mm) and approximately the same flexibility. The strings are attached on diagonally opposite corners of the device. A set of 6 rings serves as guides for the strings along each diagonal (see a). When a motor turns in one direction it bends the screen inward, otherwise the screen goes back to its initial flat shape.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Shape resolution:</head><p>The main advantage of Morphee-motor is the Strength it provides due to the motors. It also allows for high Amplitude and Curvature. One drawback of this approach is that increasing the Granularity of it would increase the number of motors needed and thus decrease the overall flexibility of the device. Also Curvature depends on the underlying material, a common issue we found recurrent with other strategies. A workaround is described in the section "Toward high resolution Morphees". Actuating the material decreases or increases the length between two corresponding nodes, thus bending the underlying part of the screen. The actuators are only placed on one side of the device so that the actuators do not prevent touch interaction when in their extended form.</p><p>Low-fidelity prototype: The prototype shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5b</ref> consists of a sheet of polypower DEAP material (www.polypower.com) attached to a piece of classic paper (7×12cm). The actuation is done by using a switched-mode power supply that delivers voltages between 1000-2500V.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Shape resolution:</head><p>The main advantage of Morphee-polymer is that Granularity can be increased without loss of flexibility. However it has less Strength, Curvature and Amplitude range, and it also has a fixed Speed. Lastly the power supply (~2500V) poses a challenge for miniaturization and safety. Morphee-wire: Linear actuation using SMA wires</p><p>Principle: Morphee-wire uses Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) in the form of wires. SMA is a special metal alloy that "remembers" its original educated shape when deformed within limits, and returns to this educated shape when heated (70° to 90° C). SMA wires are special cases of SMA. They are educated to return to a smaller length than their original one (5% less length). A common way to actuate SMA is by passing current through them, which causes them to heat up. The actuators are only placed on one side of the device so that they do not prevent touch interaction when in their extended form.</p><p>Low-fidelity prototype: The prototype shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6a</ref> consists of a piece of wood with a laser cut pattern allowing it to bend. Each edge of the wood is linked to a 0.06mm diameter 7cm SMA wire.</p><p>Shape resolution: Morphee-wire offers a reliable way to create a high Granularity shape. However, it does not provide enough Strength (more than Morphee-polymer), Amplitude or Closure as the wire can only shrink 5%. An alternative way is to use SMA springs (see Morphee-spring) or by combining it with a pulley system (see Morpheesewn-wire). One advantage of using thin SMA wires is the Speed of the deformation (&lt;1 second).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Morphee-spring: Linear actuation using SMA springs</head><p>Principle: Morphee-spring uses SMA springs which are educated to return to a compact spring when heated. As with SMA wires, a way to actuate them is to apply a voltage to heat them up. Because of their specific educated shape, SMA springs shrink more than wires. The actuators are only placed on one side of the device so that they do not prevent touch interaction when in their extended form.</p><p>Shape resolution: Morphee-spring provides more Strength, Amplitude and Curvature than Morphee-wire and Morpheepolymer. One drawback is the Speed that is quite slow (&gt;1s second). In addition the springs are much thicker than actuators used in other strategies, this can prevent the creation of a thin flexible device. With our high-fidelity prototype, Curvature is affected in a similar way as in Morphee-motor.</p><p>Low and high fidelity prototypes: The first prototype (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6b</ref>) consists of a bendable piece of wood (3mm). Each edge is linked to a SMA spring (1mm diameter wire and 5mm diameter for the spring). As springs shrink more than wires, we built another prototype with higher Granularity using a grid of 9 springs. We coupled springs with a Darlington pair transistor, which acts as a current driver and was controlled through an Arduino board.</p><p>Morphee-forged: "Home-educated" SMAs</p><p>Principle: Morphee-forged uses SMA wires that bend to a certain angle. This mechanism is possible by educating the SMA wires as bent shapes and to attach them to the device. When cold the wires are straight but when heated they bend. The set up is reversible: it is possible to place educated SMA on both sides of the device, as their deformation will follow the deformation of the screen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Low and high fidelity prototypes:</head><p>The low-fidelity prototype (Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>) consists of a piece of wood with flexible edges. We attached two educated SMA to each edge to allow them to curl. The high-fidelity prototype (Figure <ref type="figure">1c</ref>) combines an E-ink display (2mm thick) with an unmousepad touchsensor <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> (1mm thick). We attached our educated SMA to the devices using heat-insulated tape.</p><p>The device can thus be in two shapes: flat or cylinder. Offthe-shelf SMA are educated to a certain shape (shrinking in size, springs, or straight shapes) but it is possible to educate them by heating (&gt;500° C). We thus used SMA wires (1mm thick) that we maintained in the appropriated shape we needed while heating them up using a propane gas stove.</p><p>Shape resolution: Morphee-forged has advantages over other strategies. It allows concave and convex Curvatures, multiple Zero-Crossing and strong Strength and Amplitude.</p><p>One drawback is the Speed: as it uses relatively thick SMA, the heating time is longer (the resistance of the wire is larger), thus increasing the actuation time.</p><p>Morphee-couture: Wood structure sewn with SMA Principle: Morphee-couture uses the same SMA wires than Morphee-wire. The difference is that the wires are sewn into a tiled structure with inter-locking edges. The special pattern shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> acts as a lever that multiplies the shrinkage to give large actuation (5% shrinkage gives 90º bend). Note that the tiled structure is made of heat resistant material and that we added metal crimps in each hole to avoid the SMA burning the wood. The set up is reversible: inverting the pattern allows bends in the opposite direction. High-fidelity prototypes: Our prototype (Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref>) is based on a structure of 8 wood tiles. We coupled each wire with a Darlington pair transistor, which acts as a current driver and was controlled through an Arduino board. Using a projector we implemented three applications to illustrate Morphees:</p><p>(1) one that bends the top of the device toward the user to hide the screen content; (2) one that bends the four corners in the same fashion that a flower blooming or closing; (3) one that actuates any hinges that users choose.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TOWARD HIGH SHAPE RESOLUTION MORPHEES</head><p>By evaluating our prototypes we gathered insights to help future builders. There are three main challenges to consider. First at the shape level, it is hard to have all features with high resolution. Secondly we discuss device's life cycles and the possibility of creating bistable devices. Finally, we argue that it is difficult to combine high shape resolution with high display and touch resolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High shape resolution</head><p>As demonstrated with our prototype and the examples from the related work, it is difficult to create devices with high resolution for all features. E.g. we need to optimise the compromise between Curvature, Strength and Speed: SMA wires are fast to actuate but have less Strength and Curvature. Morphee-couture offers a way to overcome this issue using a pulley system. It however does not increase the Strength. In comparison, Morphee-forged offers large Curvature and Strength but is much slower. The tradeoffs between features are not specific to shape resolution, but also apply to display resolution. E.g. It is hard to create displays with a high refresh rate, high pixel density, high bits per pixel etc. For shapes, each feature is likely to be more important than others in various context. For instance a device with high Strength can be adapted for force feedback applications, while a device with high Speed can animated shape notifications to users. The choice of the device shape changes has thus to be dictated by the range of applications it can support, therefore maximizing the resolution of specific features. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Device life cycle and bistability</head><p>Another challenge is the life cycle. Maintaining a device in a shape requires the material to be constantly on, drawing significant power. In addition, shape-changing materials have a life cycle as well. They can potentially be triggered hundreds of thousands of times. But if the strain overcomes a certain ratio (depending on the material), it reduces their life cycle. For example we experienced this phenomenon with home-educated SMA: we educated some SMAs in a 90° bending shape and actuated them several times to test it. During the process we manually unbend the wire several time to force it to form a line. This caused a lot of stress in the material, thus reducing its life cycle. After several actuations, the SMA was only able to bend at 45°. One solution is to use bistable materials. Similar to a bistable screen that can stay in one state when no power is provided (E-Ink), a bistable device can stay in one shape when no power is provided. A way to achieve this is to use heat deformable plastic (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>) that becomes malleable when heated, and retains their shape when cooling down. Another example of bistable structure has also been proposed in the shape memory polymer chair <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High shape-display-touch resolution</head><p>Another big challenge is to combine high resolution for the shape layer but also for the display and touch ones. However, this is difficult given that the flexibility of the display and touch sensor will impact the way the shape layer can deform. As we experienced, the E-ink flexible display is quite stiff and reduces the possible Curvature that the device can have. A way to alleviate these issues is to use projection and tracking as in our Morphee-couture and as suggested in a recent vision of mobile computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In this case the display and touch layer does not add any constraint on the shape-changing layer. Another way to overcome this issue is to consider tiling the touch sensor and display as in the tiles of Morphee-couture.</p><p>Another issue is that the deformation can impact the data retrieved by the touch sensor. For instance, bending a resistive touch sensor is likely to trigger touch events while no fingers are in contact as it relies on pressure. The same problem would happen with optical sensing or TDR <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Thus the touch sensor technology has to be appropriately chosen to avoid this phenomenon. For example this is possible with capacitive touch sensing as used in Mouse 2.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. Some resistive technologies are also promising, such as TactileTape <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> that supports bends up to 85° .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper we contributed a new metric to define the resolution of an interactive device: in addition to display and touch resolution, we proposed "shape resolution". We believe our work lay down the foundation for creating future high shape resolution devices. One example of such devices is our concept of Morphees, self-actuated flexible mobile devices that can change shapes on their own to offer better affordances. We envisage Morphees to be the next generation of mobile devices, with which users can download applications with their own form factor. In future work we are thus interested in building higher shape resolution Morphees by investigating further the flexibility of materials. We are also interested in exploring other kind of deformations that our prototypes did not yet explore, such as Porosity and Stretchability.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
