Within the operating range of SM (i.e., in the low-to-moderate SE regime), SM is demonstrated to achieve better EE compared to conventional massive MIMO schemes.

INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HE fifth generation (5G) cellular network is expected to offer 1000 times the system capacity, 10 times the spectral efficiency (SE), energy efficiency (EE) and data rate, and 25 times the average cell throughput, compared to the fourth generation (4G) network <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This has attracted considerable interest in researching revolutionary wireless technologies to meet these challenging targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is one of the key potential techniques to dramatically improve system capacity and reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. By deploying a large number of antennas at the base stations (BSs), e.g., hundreds of antenna elements compared to tens of single-antenna user terminals, surplus degrees of freedom can be achieved, leading to increased spatial multiplexing and beamforming gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. At an asymptotically large number of BS antennas, channel vectors from the BS to different users were shown to be nearly orthogonal and the impacts of small-scale fading, thermal noise, and uncorrelated interference diminish <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Nevertheless, inter-cell interference caused by pilot contamination, i.e., due to the reuse of pilot sequences in multi-cell environments, does not vanish and becomes the limiting factor to the system performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. It was also shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> that simple linear processing methods, such as matched filter (MF) precoding and detection, can achieve near-optimal performance in the large number of antennas regime. The performance of massive MIMO with linear processing has been extensively investigated in the literature. In particular, uplink performance of massive MIMO systems with Rayleigh fading channels, was studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, while that with Ricean fading channels was analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The impact of pilot contamination was also investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Furthermore, practical channel assumptions, such as finitedimensional channels and antenna correlations, were considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The investigations of downlink performance were also given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Spatial modulation (SM) is another promising candidate for 5G radio access technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In SM, only a single transmit antenna is allowed to be active at each time instant and user data is conveyed by two information carrying units, namely the antenna index and the symbol modulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. A special form of SM, known as space-shift keying (SSK), is referred to the case when the user information is only carried on the antenna indexes. Compared to the conventional MIMO systems, SM and SSK schemes offer several advantages, including mitigation of inter-channel interference, relaxation of inter-antenna synchronisation requirements, reduction of receiver complexity, and the use of single radio-frequency (RF) chain at the transmitter <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The concept of SM is extended to allow multiple active transmit antennas, leading to generalized spatial modulation (GenSM) schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The performance of SM has been intensively studied in the literature. Most of the existing works, however, focus on the single-user (point-to-point) MIMO context. For instance, the bit error rate (BER) performance of SM was analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and the achievable sum rate of SM was discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. In contrast, limited works have considered SM schemes in multi-user context, most of which only focused on the BER performance, such as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Despite extensive research on individual technologies, the combination of massive MIMO and SM has been less investigated in the literature. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, the performance of SM and Gen-SM schemes was analyzed in single-user massive MIMO scenarios. A study of SM in multi-user massive MIMO systems was given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, whereby SM was used to enhance uplink transmission, with multiple antennas (with a single RF chain) being deployed at each user and a massive-antenna array being considered at the BS. By applying SM in uplink, the saving of user transmit power was shown to be achieved <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. This potentially leads to significant improvement in EE and enhanced battery life at mobile terminals, which is one of the main targets specified in 5G requirements. Nevertheless, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> only studied SM in the single-cell environment and the performance was evaluated only in terms of BER. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the evaluation of the achievable sum rate of Gen-SM in multi-cell multi-user massive MIMO systems has not yet been considered in the literature. Motivated by the benefits of SM in massive MIMO systems, this paper extends the idea in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and evaluates the potential advantages of Gen-SM in multi-cell multi-user massive MIMO scenarios. Linear receive processing is considered for low computational complexity, and a comprehensive performance evaluation using various performance metrics, including SE, EE, and economic efficiency (ECE), is also given. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:</p><p>1) A detection algorithm based on linear processing is proposed for multi-cell multi-user massive MIMO systems with Gen-SM. A general framework for evaluating the sum-rate performance, considering practical scenarios, such as antenna correlation, imperfect channel state information (CSI) and pilot contamination, is also presented. 2) Following the proposed framework and applying the concept of order statistics, the probability of antennacombination detection, based on two common linear processing, namely MF and zero forcing (ZF) detection, is analyzed and is adopted in the approximation of the achievable sum rate. The approximation is shown to be in good agreement with simulation results. • denots the Frobenius norm.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL</head><p>Consider an uplink multi-cell MIMO system with L BSs, each is equipped with M receive antennas and serves K users, each with N transmit antennas. A user u in cell j is denoted as (j, u). A similar channel model as given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> is considered and can be summarized as follows. Let G lju = β lju H lju ∈ C M×N be the channel matrix from a user (j, u) to BS l, with β lju representing large-scale fading and H lju denoting small-scale fading as given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">H lju = R 1 2 R H w lju R T 2 T (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>where R T and R R are transmit and receive spatial correlation matrices, respectively, with Tr (R T ) = N and Tr (R R ) = M . Each element of H w lju is an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance. It follows that</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">H lju ∼ CN (0 M×N , R H ), with R H = R T ⊗ R R .</formula><p>The channel matrix from all users in cell j to BS l can be given by G lj = [G lj1 , ..., G ljK ], and the overall channel matrix to BS l is denoted as G l = [G l1 , ..., G lL ]. For Gen-SM systems, the information can be conveyed via active antenna indexes, in addition to the conventional signal modulation. For each user, independent multiple data streams are simultaneously transmitted over 1 ≤ A ≤ N active antennas, i.e., the data vector of user (j, u), denoted as x ju = [x ju1 , ..., x juN ] T ∈ C N ×1 , contains A nonzero entries. Each non-zero entry is assumed to be an i.i.d. Gaussian random variable with zero-mean with unit variance. Let xju ∈ C A×1 be a sub-vector of x ju corresponding to non-zero data entries, and Ḡlju ∈ C M×A denote a sub-matrix of G lju with each column associated to the user u's active antennas. The overall data vector of users in cell j can be given by xj = xH j1 , ..., xH jK H . The composite active channel can be written as Ḡlj = Ḡlj1 , ..., ḠljK ∈ C M×AK and Ḡl = Ḡl1 , ..., ḠlL ∈ C M×AKL . The received signal vector at the BS l can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">y l = √ ρ ul L j=1 Ḡlj xj + n l<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where n l ∼ CN 0, σ 2 I M , and ρ ul = ρ A with ρ being the transmitted power per user.</p><p>The following notations are further used to facilitate subsequent discussions. With 1 ≤ A ≤ N active antennas, the number of possible antenna combinations for each user is given by C = N A . The set of all possible antenna-index combinations is denoted as A = {A 1 , ..., A C }, whereby A i is a set of active-antenna indexes for the antenna combination i. The transmitted and the detected antenna combinations for user (l, k) are represented as A lk , Âlk ∈ A, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Channel Estimation</head><p>Uplink training (pilot) sequences are considered for channel estimation. It is assumed that the same set of orthogonal pilot sequences is used in all L cells. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, the received pilot matrix after removing the transmitted pilot symbols for user k at BS l can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Ỹlk = √ ρ t L j=1 G ljk + Ñlk<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where ρ t = ρτ N denotes the transmitted pilot power per user, N K ≤ τ ≤ T represents the duration of the pilot sequences with T being the coherence time, and Ñlk ∼ CN 0, σ 2 I MN . Note that Ỹlk contains the channel matrices of other-cell users using the same pilot sequence as user (l, k), causing pilot contamination to the channel estimation of user (l, k). It follows from <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> that the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) channel estimate can be obtained as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">vec( Ĝllk ) = A 1 √ ρ t vec( Ỹlk )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>with</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">A = β llk R H   L j=1 β ljk R H + σ 2 ρ t I MN   -1 .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Using the orthogonal property of MMSE channel estimates, it is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> that the actual channel matrix can be decomposed as G llk = Ĝllk + Gllk , with Ĝllk and Gllk being statistically independent. Further, to ease subsequent discussions, let g llks = [G llk ] * ,s , ĝllks = Ĝllk and gllks = Gllk * ,s for the rest of the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Linear filters</head><p>Two linear filters, namely MF and ZF, are considered for detection of Gen-SM signals in this paper. By constructing the matrix of channel estimates as the receiver matrix, the MF performs maximum ratio combining (MRC) across multiple receive antennas, aiming to maximize the received signal energy for each detected data stream.This, however, may lead to high interference between multiple data streams. The ZF, in contrast, applies the matrix of channel inversion (the pseudo inverse of the channel estimates) as the receiver matrix to ensures zero interference among different data streams. Consequently, considering the case of imperfect CSI, using the channel estimate Ĝll = [ Ĝll1 , ..., ĜllK ] with Ĝllk being obtained from (4), the MF and ZF receivers can respectively be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">BMF l = Ĝll<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">BZF l = Ĝll ĜH ll Ĝll -1 .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Linear filters for the case of perfect CSI, denoted as B l , can also be given in a similar manner, with Ĝll being replaced by G ll . In the following discussion, both analytical results and proofs will be given for the case of imperfect CSI. For the case of perfect CSI, only the results will be provided since the proofs can be obtained by applying similar analysis (e.g., as a special case of the imperfect case) and can therefore be omitted.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Detection algorithm with linear filters</head><p>For signal detection in multi-cell multi-user massive MIMO systems with Gen-SM, the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) detection tends to be impractical due to its high complexity. Motivated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, to reduce complexity, a sub-optimal detection algorithm based on linear processing is proposed in this subsection and can be divided into two stages, i.e., the detection of the active antennas and the detection of signal constellation from the active antennas previously obtained in the first stage. The proposed algorithm can be considered as an extension of the algorithms in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> from singleuser single-cell SM systems to multi-cell multi-user Gen-SM scenarios. The proposed procedure can be summarized as follows:</p><p>1) A linear filter, e.g., either MF or ZF, is applied to the received signal vector. The output vector for a user k in BS l can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">ŷlk = BH lk y l<label>(8)</label></formula><p>with B lk ∈ C M × N being a linear filter of the user k in BS l. Letting ŷlk = [ŷ lk1 , ..., ŷlkN ], Âlk can be obtained by selecting a valid antenna combination i that provides the maximum received power, e.g.,</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Achievable Rate Analysis</head><p>The two-stage detection algorithm, as described in Section III-A, can be viewed as a mapping function from the post-processed received signal vector (ŷ lk = BH lk y l ) to the detected antenna-combination ( ÂIP lk ) and the corresponding output vector (r IP lk ), i.e., { ÂIP lk , rIP lk } = f mapping BH lk y l . The superscript (•) IP indicates that the linear filter with imperfect CSI knowledge, Blk , is applied to y l . In the case of perfect CSI, the superscript (•) P is adopted.</p><p>For imperfect CSI, the average achievable uplink rate of a user (l, k) can be obtained through the amount of mutual information as given in the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">1 - τ T E I xlk , Ḡllk ; ÂIP lk , rIP lk = 1 - τ T E I xlk ; ÂIP lk , rIP lk | Ḡllk +E I Ḡllk ; ÂIP lk , rIP lk<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where the coefficient 1 -τ T reflects the percentage of time being used for data transmission.</p><p>Proposition 1: The average achievable rate of a user (l, k) in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">12</ref>) can be lower bounded by</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">1 - τ T E I xlk , Ḡllk ; ÂIP lk , rIP lk ≥ 1 - τ T R IP lk 1 - τ T R IP lk,1 + R IP lk,2<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">R IP lk,1 = E 1 C C c=1 C i=1 ̺ IP lk(i|c) d∈Ai log 2 1 + µ IP lkd|c ν IP lkd|c (14) R IP lk,2 =log 2 (C)-E 1 C C c=1 C i=1 ̺ IP lk(i|c) log 2 C c2=1 ̺ IP lk(i|c2) ̺ IP lk(i|c)<label>(15)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">µ IP lkd|c = ρ ul | bH lkd ĝllka | 2<label>(16)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">ν IP lkd|c = s∈Ac\{a} ρ ul | bH lkd ĝllks | 2 + (j,u) =(l,k) s∈Aju ρ ul | bH lkd ĝljus | 2 + L j=1 K u=1 s∈Aju ρ ul | bH lkd gljus | 2 + blkd 2 σ 2<label>(17)</label></formula><p>with blkd = Blk * ,d</p><p>, ĝljus = Ĝlju * ,d</p><p>for any user (j, u), and ̺ IP lk(i|c) = P ÂIP lk = A i |A lk = A c denoting the probability of detecting antenna combination i when the antenna combination c is actually transmitted, and d ∈ A i , a ∈ A c representing a detected antenna and the corresponding transmitted antenna, respectively.</p><p>Proof: See Appendix A.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Spatial multiplexing as a special case of Generalized Spatial Modulation</head><p>From <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, the achievable rate of Gen-SM schemes consists of two contributing factors, i.e., the information rate due to symbol modulation (R IP lk,1 ) and the information rate due to antenna modulation (R IP lk,2 ). It can be interpreted from ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) that R IP lk,1 is the average of symbol-modulation information rates over all possible antenna-combination events. From ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">15</ref>) and (63), R lk,2 can also be viewed as the information rate for transmitting codewords (antenna indexes) across a C-ary asymmetric channel. For a special case of A = N (C = 1), it can be seen that R IP lk,2 becomes 0 and R IP lk,1 reduces its form to the information rate of spatial multiplexing schemes. Hence, spatial multiplexing can be considered as a special case of Gen-SM to which the analysis in Proposition 1 and the subsequent corollaries remain applicable.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Discussion on accuracy and improvement of the approximation 1) MF detection:</head><p>The analysis in Section IV-A applies the concept of order statistics by treating ŷlkd , for all values of d, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> as being statistically independent. For MF detection, however, the received symbols {ŷ lkd } are seen to be correlated since, for any d, ŷlkd contains a linear combination of the transmitted symbols x lks , for ∀s ∈ A c . Consequently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> appears to underestimate the probability of correctly detecting antenna combinations since max d∈ Ãi {|ŷ lk d| 2 } given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> tends to have smaller variation due to the correlation of {ŷ lkd }. Simulation results suggests that the approximation of ergodic achievable rates in Section IV-B1, labeled as approximation 1, remains relatively accurate when A ≥ N 2 , as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1</ref> with the case of A = 2 and N = 4. For A &lt; N 2 , the approximation can be improved by using the following heuristic approach. To reflect smaller variation on max d∈ Ãi {|ŷ lk d| 2 }, a scaling factor can be incorporated into the variance of |ŷ lk d | 2 for d ∈ Ãi . Experimental observation suggests that the modified variance, denoted as ηlkd|c , may be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_56">ηlkd|c = η lkd|c , d ∈ A i min 1, 1-1 A 1-A N θ log 2 M N K η lkd|c , d ∈ Ãi<label>(47)</label></formula><p>with θ observed to be 2 and 3 for the case of perfect and imperfect CSI, respectively. With ηlkd|c , the antenna detection probability given by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_34">28</ref>) is denoted as Ṗlk(i|c) . By modifying η lkd|c to ηlkd|c , C i=1 Ṗlk(i|c) , for any given c, may no longer equal to one. To ensure the summation of the probabilities becomes unity, the following adjustment is also imposed:</p><formula xml:id="formula_57">Plk(i|c) =          Ṗlk(c|c) , i = c    C n=1 n =c Ṗlk(n|c)    -1 Ṗlk(i|c) , i = c.<label>(48)</label></formula><p>Note that, despite ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_56">47</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_57">48</ref>) being obtained from heuristic observation, they tends to result in relatively accurate approximation as supported by extensive simulation for 2 ≤ N ≤ 8 and can be demonstrated with the label approximation 2 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1</ref>.</p><p>2) ZF detection: In contrast to MF detection, the received symbols ŷlkd tends to be uncorrelated with ZF detection. This can be seen by noticing that, with ZF detection, the first and the second terms on the right-hand side (RHS) of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_25">21</ref>) become zero when d does not match with one of the transmitted antennas in the set A c , i.e., bH lkd ĝllks = 0 for d = s, s ∈ A c . As a result, ŷlkd contains the transmitted symbol x lks with s = d only, leading to ŷlkd being uncorrelated for different values of d. Hence, the analysis in Section IV-A is generally valid for ZF detection.</p><p>It can be seen, however, that the approximation in Section IV-B2 is mainly based on the case of large antenna systems.</p><p>In particular, the inverse of the matrix ĜH ll Ĝll -1 in (74) is considered to be a block-diagonal matrix since the off-diagonal blocks converge to zero, i.e., ĜH llk Ĝllu → 0 for k = u as M → ∞.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Discussion on system performance and impact of spatial correlation</head><p>The general framework given in Section IV-A provides an analytical approach to evaluating the performance of Gen-SM systems, as demonstrated in Sections IV-B and IV-C. More insights into system performance can also be obtained based on these analytical results. As an illustration, the impact of spatial correlation to the ergodic achievable rate will be discussed in this subsection. From ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_37">30</ref>) - <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> in Section IV-A, the achievable rate is seen to depend on 3 main factors, i.e., the average signal power E µ IP lkd|c , the average interferenceplus-noise power E ν IP lkd|c , and the antenna-combination detection probability P IP lk(i|c) . It can be shown that E ν IP lkd|c and P IP lk(i|c) become worsen with higher spatial correlation. In particular, for MF receiver, the terms t sd and t d increase with an increasing spatial correlation at the BS, resulting in a higher value of E ν IP lkd|c in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>. It follows from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">22</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_34">28</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_35">29</ref>) that the probability of detecting antenna combination erroneously P IP lk(i|c) become worsen. Consequently, the ergodic achievable rate is seen to degrade with an increasing spatial correlation. A similar conclusion can be drawn for the case of ZF by observing the increasing values of z dd and z d in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref> when spatial correlation increases.</p><p>It should also be highlighted that the analysis in this paper does not impose restrictions on the structures of R T and R R . The analysis can, therefore, be applied to spatial correlation matrices with any specific structures, e.g., to the case of practical channel models with finite numbers of angles of arrival (AoAs) at the BS in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p></div>

SPECTRAL, ENERGY AND ECONOMIC EFFICIENCIES TRADE-OFF</head><p>In typical communication systems, SE can generally be improved with increasing power consumption, resulting in decreasing EE.

For a required radiated power ρ u , the power consumption of a practical power amplifier can be given by ρu ηPA , with η PA being the efficiency of the power amplifier. Circuit power concerns the power consumed by RF circuits and baseband processing. The power consumption due to RF circuits linearly increases with the number of RF chains as given by AP ms RF per user. Baseband processing involves channel coding and modulation, also leading to power consumption as a linear function of the number of data streams as expressed by AP cod . Static power considers fixed power consumption, P ms 0 , incurred by mobile stations for other purposes than for data transmission, such as control signalling and load-independent baseband processing, which does not scale with the number of RF chains and data streams. Using the above power consumption model, the total transmit power for K users in a cell can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">p ms = K ρ u η PA + P ms 0 + AP 1<label>(53)</label></formula><p>with P 1 = P ms RF + P cod . 2) SE and EE trade-off: Following the ideas in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, trade-off curves between SE and EE can be obtained by seeking a set of the network parameters, such as the transmit power (ρ u ) and number of users (K), that maximize the EE for a given SE.

This motivates a search for a complementary performance metric that can provide a balanced trade-off between SE and EE along the the Pareto optimal frontier.</p></div>

The revenue generated by each traffic class largely depends on marketing strategies and deals. Typically, voice service is charged per minute usage. Thus, the amount of chargeable traffic tends to be a linear function of the voice traffic volume. In contrast, based on the observation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, the attainable revenue for data service with limited quota seems to grow logarithmically with the data volume as users tend to consider acquiring higher traffic quota only with a slight increase in the premium. Moreover, by intuition, the generated revenue for data service with unlimited quota seems to be independent of the amount of data usage. Consequently, the effective chargeable data throughput of traffic classes 1, 2, and 3 can be modeled as linear, logarithmic, and constant functions, respectively, as can be expressed as </p><formula xml:id="formula_71">U v, R IP =      R 1 , v = 1 R ref 2 • log 2 1 + R2 R ref 2 , v = 2 R ref 3 • u (R 3 ) , v = 3<label>(</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_72">R v =        min R lim 1 , α1 Tcu R IP , v = 1 α2 Tcu R IP , v = 2 1 Tcu R IP -min r 1 , α1 Tcu R IP -α2 Tcu R IP , v = 3 (57)</formula><p>with α 1 , α 2 being the estimated traffic volume (in percent) for traffic classes 1 and 2, respectively, and T cu denoting the time duration per channel use (c.u.). Since recent traffic trends <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> show that voice traffic tends to reach a saturate level, the upper limit of voice traffic R lim 1 is also included in (57). The evaluation of energy cost in (55) considers the power consumption at the BS to reflect network operators' costs. This power is required for detection of transmitted data from the users. Using the model in Section V-A1, it can be seen that radiated power can be omitted since only signal detection is considered. The power consumption of receiver chains can be written as M P bs RF . Baseband processing involves channel decoding and demodulation, incurring the power of KAP dec . Additional processing is also required at the BS for uplink channel estimation and receive processing. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, the additional power consumption can be given by M N K 1+T -τ</p><formula xml:id="formula_73">ZT + P RX , with P RX being 2N KM ZT and 3N 2 K 2 M+2N KM ZT + 2N 3 K 3 3ZT</formula><p>for MF and ZF detection, respectively, and Z denoting the computational efficiency in operations per Joule (J).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. SIMULATION RESULTS</head><p>Numerical examples are given in this section. Simulation parameters are described in Section VI-A and results are presented in Sections VI-B and VI-C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Simulation parameters 1) Network parameters:</head><p>A multi-cell system with L = 7 cells, each with K = 10 users are considered. Each user is assumed to be equipped with N = 4 antennas unless stated otherwise. Following the assumptions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, path gains of the serving links are set to 1 and those of interfering links are set to β, i.e., β llk = 1 and β lju = β = 0.1, ∀j = l. Further, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the coherence time is set to T = 98 c.u.. It is also assumed that τ = N K and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is defined as ρ u /σ 2 .</p><p>2) Antenna correlation parameters: For a large antenna array, different antenna elements in the array may experience different sets of scatterers. The evolution of scatterers on the array axis can be modeled based on the birth-death (BD) process <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. Here, the spatial correlation matrices of the received antennas can be given by R R = E R • T R , where [E R ] m,n = e -α|m-n| represents the survival probability of the scatterers between the m-th and the n-th antennas, and [T R ] m,n = J 0 (2πd r |m -n|) is the correlation between the m-th and the n-th antennas based on the conventional Kronecker model, with J 0 (•) denoting the zero-th order Bessel function of the first kind and d r being the antenna spacing of the receive-antenna arrays in wavelengths. For transmit antenna arrays, a few number of antenna elements (i.e., no evolution of scatterers) are considered. Thus, R T = T T with [T T ] m,n = J 0 (2πd t |m -n|). Note that the above R R and R T hold under the assumption of isotropic scattering environment, i.e., the AoAs and angles of departure (AoDs) are uniformly distributed. Here, α = 0.3, d r = d t = 0.3 are assumed.</p><p>3) Power consumption and cost parameters: Following the model in Section V, power consumption parameters are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">I</ref>. For practical evaluation of ρ u , users are assumed to be located at distance 2  3 r, with cell radius r = 1000 m and pathloss exponent being 3.7.</p><p>Motivated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, the cost parameters are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">I</ref>. Note that these values indicate the current pricing and are referred to as the cost set-up 1. The economic trends, however, suggest that the revenue per bit tends to have decreasing, whereas the network cost appears to be increasing. To evaluate future economic figures and the impact on ECE, an extreme set of parameters, referred to as the cost set-up 2, is assumed by dividing the revenue per bit (κ r (1), κ r (2), and κ r (3)) and multiplying the cost parameters (κ c and C 0 ) by a factor of 10.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Ergodic achievable sum rate</head><p>The ergodic sum rates in the case of imperfect CSI for different values of M and SNR are given in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and<ref type="figure">4</ref>, respectively. The theoretical analysis with the improved approximation as presented in Section IV-C is used and is shown to agree well with the simulation results. For a small to moderate M , MF detection tends to outperform ZF detection since, unlike ZF detection, the modulated symbols can be weakly detected with MF detection even when the antenna combination is incorrectly decoded, as can be seen by comparing <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref> with <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>. In contrast, for a large M with sufficiently high probability of correctly detecting the antenna combination, ZF detection becomes superior as it can suppress inter-stream interference more effectively compared to MF detection. Notice that, for ZF detection, the sum rate increases with the number of active antennas, A. For MF detection, on the other hand, since inter-stream interference cannot be mitigated at the receiving side, deploying a smaller A may lead to higher sum rate, as can be illustrated by comparing the cases of A = 1 with A = 2 for MF detection in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Trade-off analysis</head><p>A trade-off between EE and SE is evaluated using (54) as presented in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> and<ref type="figure">6</ref> for M = 150 and M = 500, respectively. For comparison, results for conventional massive MIMO, i.e., A = 1 and N = 1, is also given. Despite contributing to higher sum rate, increasing the number of active antennas for Gen-SM schemes is shown to reduce the energy efficiency due to the increase in circuit power consumption of RF chains and baseband processing. This    suggests that the conventional SM with A = 1 tends to be the most energy-efficient mode among the entire class of Gen-SM.</p><p>Considering the case of A = 1 (SM mode), MF detection achieves better EE than ZF detection for a small value of M as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, due to higher SE being achieved with the same amount of power consumption. The performance gap between MF and ZF becomes smaller as M increases, similar to the observation in Section VI-B and can be demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Due to the significant advantage over ZF detection, MF detection will be focused in the subsequent discussion. Comparing to conventional massive MIMO, SM offers benefits in terms of EE for a certain range (low to moderate values) of SE. Since SM requires longer time for pilot transmission (τ = N K in contrast to τ = K for conventional massive MIMO), the duration of data transmission becomes shorter, resulting in feasible range of SE being limited compared to the conventional massive MIMO scheme. This, in turn, suggests that, to combine the benefits of SM (operating with high EE at low-to-moderate SE) and conventional massive MIMO (operating at high SE exceeding the feasible range of SM), a dynamic scheme capable of flexibly switching between SM and conventional massive MIMO should be considered.</p><p>A detailed analysis of the trade-off between EE and SE can be demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. For conventional massive MIMO with MF detection, the Pareto optimal frontier can be indicated as the part on the trade-off curve between the points A and B. The points on the curve before point A are seen to be non-optimal as they are always worse than point A in terms of both EE and SE. The points on the curve after point B are also not optimal for a similar reason. Analogously, the Pareto optimal frontier for SM with MF detection are indicated with the points C and D. As described in Section V-A, the optimal frontiers represent efficient operating points, such that an extra advantage of one performance metric can only be achieved by trading it off with the benefits of the other metric. A sensible operating point on the optimal frontiers can be obtained by evaluating a complementary metric, such as ECE, along the trade-off curve as illustrated in Figs. <ref type="figure">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> for the two sets of cost parameters. For cost set-up 1 with the generated revenue dominating the energy cost, the strategy for maximizing ECE is to operate at the point with highest SE, i.e., the points B and D in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> for conventional massive MIMO and SM schemes respectively. In contrast, for cost setup 2 with decreasing revenue and increasing energy cost, the operating point maximizing ECE tends to move towards the high EE regime as depicted by points E and F in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>. In this case, SM (point F) is shown to achieve better ECE compared to the conventional massive MIMO (point E) as a result of significant advantages of SM in terms of EE. This suggests that SM is potentially an attractive candidate, offering a balanced trade-off between EE and SE, for future wireless communications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This paper has investigated the achievable sum-rate performance based on linear detection in multi-cell multi-user massive MIMO systems with Gen-SM, considering practical channel conditions, including antenna correlation, imperfect channel estimation and pilot contamination. A general framework for approximation of sum-rate performance with linear detection has been proposed and evaluated for MF and ZF detection. The proposed methodology has been shown to achieve close approximation in comparison with simulation results. The fundamental trade-off between SE and EE has also been investigated. Among the entire class of Gen-SM, SM with a single active antenna per user has been demonstrated to be the most energy-efficient strategy as a result of reduced inter-channel interference and the use of single RF chain per user. Compared to conventional massive MIMO, the feasible SE range of SM has been shown to be limited to lower values due to longer training duration being required for channel estimation, leaving shorter time slots for useful data transmission. However, within its feasible SE regime, SM tends to achieve better EE compared to conventional massive MIMO schemes. The Pareto optimal frontiers, representing efficient operating points on SE and EE trade-off curves, have also been analyzed. To achieve a balanced SE-EE operating condition, ECE has been evaluated along the Pareto optimal frontier and has been demonstrated to potentially provide a sensible trade-off between SE and EE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. FUTURE WORK</head><p>This paper has provided good insights into Gen-SM systems to a certain degree and their trade-off. The analysis in this paper can further be improved and extended in several aspects, some of which are outlined as follows.</p><p>1) The analysis is mainly based on a homogeneous network, i.e., all the cells and users are equipped with M and N antennas, respectively, and all channels have the same small-scale fading statistics, i.e., being complex Gaussian matrix with mean 0 M×N and covariance matrix R H . As a result, the MMSE channel estimates can be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>, and the corresponding channel statistics can be expressed in a simplified form as given in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_41">34</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>. In contrast, for heterogeneous networks with nonidentical small-scale fading statistics, the MMSE channel estimates and their statistical properties are given in more complicated form, hindering the analysis in Section IV. The analysis of ergodic achievable sum-rate for Gen-SM systems in heterogeneous networks remains a challenging task, which will be addressed in the future work. Other research challenges and directions of heterogeneous networks are also highlighted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</p><p>2) It has been assumed that the spatial correlation matrices R T and R R are known and can be used for MMSE channel estimation. However, the acquisition of these channel correlation matrices in practice would be hampered by the large dimension of massive antenna arrays, which will be studied in the future research. The impact of spatial correlation matrices with special structures, e.g., as specified in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, will also be considered. 3) Only two specific linear receivers, namely MF and ZF, have discussed in this paper. Receivers that are more robust to channel uncertainty and interference, such as MMSE receiver, should be considered. Performance comparison with optimal ML detection will also be discussed in the future work. 4) With the assumption of orthogonal uplink pilots, Gen-SM generally requires longer training period, limiting the system performance, compared to conventional MIMO schemes. More advanced pilot designs, e.g., given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, can be incorporated to further improve the performance of the proposed system.</p></div>
