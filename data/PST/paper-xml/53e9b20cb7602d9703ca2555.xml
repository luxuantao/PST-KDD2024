<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>An iterative multiscale finite volume (i-MSFV) method is devised for the simulation of multiphase flow in fractured porous media in the context of a hierarchical fracture modeling framework. Motivated by the small pressure change inside highly conductive fractures, the fully coupled system is split into smaller systems, which are then sequentially solved. This splitting technique results in only one additional degree of freedom for each connected fracture network appearing in the matrix system. It can be interpreted as an agglomeration of highly connected cells; similar as in algebraic multigrid methods. For the solution of the resulting algebraic system, an i-MSFV method is introduced. In addition to the local basis and correction functions, which were previously developed in this framework, local fracture functions are introduced to accurately capture the fractures at the coarse scale. In this multiscale approach there exists one fracture function per network and local domain, and in the coarse scale problem there appears only one additional degree of freedom per connected fracture network. Numerical results are presented for validation and verification of this new iterative multiscale approach for fractured porous media, and to investigate its computational efficiency. Finally, it is demonstrated that the new method is an effective multiscale approach for simulations of realistic multiphase flows in fractured heterogeneous porous media.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Mathematical formulations describing flow in natural porous media are typically governed by highly heterogeneous anisotropic tensorial coefficients (hydraulic conductivity) at different scales. Moreover, a considerable percentage of natural formations, e.g. carbonate reservoirs, are fractured in the sense that there exist highly conductive channels (with small apertures) at various length scales acting as phase transport highways. In addition to the complex geometries, the high contrast in the physical properties and length scales (compared to those of the matrix) results in very expensive fine scale simulations. Therefore, there have been extensive studies during the past five decades to reduce the problem complexity and as a result different modeling approaches and numerical strategies suitable for different types of fractures have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>The dual porosity model approach and its divisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> were proposed for naturally fractured porous media with many small fractures. More precisely, this method introduces effective coefficients for (n À 1) dimensional (D) fractures by mapping (upscaling) them into a continuum nD domain. This upscaling based strategy results in reasonably efficient simulations with the cost of additional assumptions. More specifically, this method is appropriate for problems with only small scale fractures. For problems with long scale fractures, however, this approach fails to provide good solutions. This is due to the fact that in this approach no general upscaling strategy is possible. Note that long fractures can be treated by dual permeability approaches.</p><p>To obtain more accurate simulations, the discrete fracture modeling approach was devised; see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. In that approach, geometry and locations of fractures are honored accurately by using complex unstructured gridding techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The grid is generated with the constraints that the fracture elements are located at the matrix cell interfaces and that the matrix cells around fractures are small enough to capture the correct fracture geometries. The latter constraint often results in very small cells, especially near intersections. Besides the fact that small cells lead to big linear systems, they also impose time step restrictions for multiphase transport simulations.</p><p>It is very important to keep in mind that this approach has limited applicability for realistic scenarios due to the complex conforming grids. Moreover, this approach is not suited for dynamic fracture network problems, as e.g. in simulations of enhanced geothermal systems, where the grid has to be updated frequently due to generations of new fractures. In such applications, it is preferable to work with independent discretizations for the discrete large fractures and the damaged matrix.</p><p>Motivated by the previously discussed issues, a hierarchical fracture modeling approach was introduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In this approach, small scale fractures are homogenized and treated as a continuous damaged matrix with effective coefficients. Large-scale fractures, on the other hand, are explicitly represented by a coupled discrete fracture model. More precisely, simple structured nD and (n À 1)D grids are independently generated for matrix and fractures, respectively. Note that neither grid alignment nor any other constraints apply.</p><p>In this work, a hierarchical fracture modeling approach which is suited for multiscale methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> is introduced. Moreover, as will be demonstrated later in this paper, for highly conductive fractures the proposed strategy leads to enhanced convergence rates. One additional constraint per fracture network is added to the matrix equations, which is crucial to ensure enough coupling to achieve good convergence rates. Combining a hierarchical fracture model to a muliscale method for reservoir simulation is of interest, since multiscale methods are capable of honoring fine-scale transmissibility variations with much fewer degrees of freedom (DOF) than classical simulators. Such fine-scale variations become an even bigger issue in highly fractured reservoirs. In order to properly deal with transport it is highly desirable to work with a multiscale method which delivers conservative fine-scale velocity fields; see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. Therefore, here the multiscale finitevolume (MSFV) method is favored, which requires fewer DOFs than mixed multiscale methods and still is conservative opposed to e.g. the multiscale finite-element methods. Moreoever, as shown recently, in this framework the error can systematically be reduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>; adaptive in space and time <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Opposed to classical iterative solvers like algebraic multigrid (AMG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, conservative solutions can be constructed after any iteration, i.e. it is not required to fully converge.</p><p>In this work, the i-MSFV method is extended for the solution of the hierarchical fracture problem using the proposed sequential coupling strategy. To capture fractures accurately at the coarse scales, local fracture functions are introduced. The fracture functions are solved within local problems, similar to the basis and correction functions, based on the full governing equations (with fracture-matrix couplings) subject to the reduced problem boundary conditions. This results in only one additional coarse DOF per fracture network. Inner and outer iterations are applied to enhance the correction function boundary conditions and for the convergence of the sequentially-coupled fracture-matrix system, respectively. A classical iterative fine-scale solver is used as the smoother, which is necessary to guarantee convergence. Alternatively, a Krylov sub-space method like GMRES <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> can be used to stabilize the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Here we employ line-relaxation as a smoother, since it is very robust for problems with stretched grids. The convergence history of the new i-MSFV method for fractured porous media is tested for a wide range of test cases. Moreover, the efficiency of the method is studied for multiphase flow in heterogeneous and homogeneous fractured porous media. Numerical results show that the i-MSFV method is a flexible iterative method which is efficient for multiphase simulations in highly heterogeneous fractured porous media.</p><p>The paper is organized as following. Section 2 consists of two subsections. First, the governing equations for the hierarchical fracture modeling approach together with the model parameters are introduced. Then, in the second subsection, a previously proposed tightly coupled simulation strategy is explained. The sequentially-coupled strategy is then introduced in Section 3 followed by Section 4, where the i-MSFV method for non-fractured systems is explained. The new i-MSFV method for the fractured porous media is introduced in Section 4; and numerical results for single and multiphase flow scenarios are presented in Section 5. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 6.</p></div>

It is worth re-emphasizing that the fracture equation is solved on the lower dimensional fracture manifolds, while the homogenized small scale fractures are treated by the matrix equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The flux interaction is modeled similar as in classical well models <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, e.g. in a volume V intersecting with a fracture interface A one obtains the volume averaged source</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">W mf V ¼ CIK m k m t ðp m À p f Þ=V ¼ g m ðp m À p f Þ<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>in the discretized matrix pressure equation and the areal averaged source</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">W fm A ¼ CIK m k m t ðp f À p m Þ=A ¼ g f ðp f À p m Þ<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>in the discretized fracture pressure equation.

To illustrate how they can be computed, a 2D problem with one fracture network consisting of three connected fracture lines is considered (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The matrix is discretized by a Cartesian grid and the fractures are independently divided into connected fracture segments. Obviously, W mf V is non-zero only in those matrix cells, which overlap with at least one fracture segment, and the value of CI iÀj can be calculated based on the area fraction A iÀj of the fracture segment i inside the matrix cell j, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">CI iÀj ¼ A iÀj hdi :<label>ð7Þ</label></formula><p>The average distance between matrix cell j and fracture element i is denoted by hdi, which can be calculated as where x n is the distance from the fracture <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Discretized linear system</head><p>A problem with N fn disconnected fracture networks is considered. Each fracture network may be governed by one or several connected fracture lines (planes in 3D). Employing a computational grid, the matrix and the ith fracture network consist of N m and N f,i grid cells, respectively. Note that the computational grids for the matrix and each fracture network are all totally independent.

Moreover, as explained before, the convergence rate of iterative linear solvers may be negatively affected by the high contrast between matrix-matrix and fracture-fracture connections. Therefore, it is a desirable goal to develop multi-scale methods which allows to approach the global problem with much less degrees of freedom. The next section is devoted to this goal, i.e. a consistent, but alternative coupling strategy suited for the MSFV method is devised. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Consistent matrix-fracture coupling based on scale separation</head><p>To make the hierarchical approach suitable for the MSFV method, a consistent matrix-fracture coupling based on scale separation of the fracture pressure is devised here. For each fracture network, the pressure distribution must ensure mass balance. In other words, for incompressible systems without external source terms it has to be such that total volumetric exchange rate with the matrix is zero. This can be achieved by adjusting the reference pressure levels in each fracture network accordingly. Therefore, the pressure distribution p f,i inside a network i is split into an average value p f ;i plus a remainder pf;i , i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">p f ;i ¼ ð p f ;i þ pf;i 1 ; p f ;i þ pf;i 2 ; . . . ; p f ;i þ pf;i N f ;i Þ T :<label>ð12Þ</label></formula><p>Eq.

Note that this is a system for matrix and mean fracture network pressures only. To obtain the fracture pressure remainders, one also has to solve the systems</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">B i FF pf;i ¼ Q f ;i À B i FM c RB i FF À Á p m p f ;i 8i 2 f1; . . . ; N fn g ð<label>14Þ</label></formula><p>for each fracture network independently. The systems ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">13</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">14</ref>) are then solved sequentially until convergence. Note that the size of system ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">13</ref>) is</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">N m;loose ¼ N m þ N fn ;<label>ð15Þ</label></formula><p>which generally is much smaller than that of system <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, since it only contains one degree of freedom (DOF) per fracture network. This additional DOF is essential, since it strictly ensures total mass balance for each fracture network at any iteration level, which is an important property to achieve good convergence rates of the iterative solver. Note that this splitting approach can be refined by allowing for spatial variations of p f ;i within network i, which automatically results in additional DOFs; this, however, is subject of future research.</p><p>In general it can be stated that the smaller the pf;i contributions the better the expected convergence rate of the sequential procedure. As a direct consequence, as shown later in this paper, the approximation by the mean fracture network pressure is better in cases with high fracture connectivities (small pressure gradients). But we emphasize that this property is not our main motivation for this approach; as already mentioned it was our goal to extend our MSFV framework for hierarchical fracture modeling.</p><p>In the next section we devise an iterative MSFV (i-MSFV) method for Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">13</ref>), which generally is the most expensive part of the proposed sequential solution strategy.</p></div>

As shown earlier for non-fractured problems, the i-MSFV method is conservative at any iteration level <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, allows to reduce errors and thus can be used for efficient simulations of multiphase flow with rigorous local control of the error <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</p><p>In this section, we first explain the new i-MSFV framework for fractured reservoirs and then talk more specifically about the use of an iterative linear solver to reduce high frequency errors and thus achieve convergence.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Use of an iterative linear solver to reduce high frequency errors</head><p>As can be seen from Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_24">22</ref>), the localization boundary conditions for the correction functions is iteratively improved using the fine-scale solution p 0m;m s from the previous iteration m, which is obtained by applying n s iterations of a consistent linear solver starting with p 0 m,m . Moreover, the overall convergence rate of the sequential solution strategy is improved by also updating the fine-scale fracture pressure values by the iterative solver (smoother). Note that generally the smoothed (not converged) solution obtained by such an iterative fine-scale solver is not conservative, which would have a negative impact on the convergence rate. Therefore, after each iteration an additional step is required to ensure correct total flux balance for each fracture network.</p><p>Here, we chose a line-relaxation (LR) method to smooth the matrix pressure field; similar as presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. The smoothing procedure can be summarized as follows:</p><p>(1) One LR iteration is applied on the matrix pressure p m (resulting in p m s ), whereas p f is treated explicitly on the RHS. (2) The reference pressures p f in each fracture network is adjusted such that total mass balance, i.e. Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">18</ref>), is honored.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Validation of the hierarchical approach</head><p>Although it is not the main scope of this paper, in this subsection the quality of the hierarchical fracture modeling approach is demonstrated for a single phase flow test case. For this reason, a homogeneous 2D problem is considered (see Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>), where a ''+''-shaped fracture network with k ⁄ = k f /k m = 10 5 located at the center of the quadratic L Â L domain. No-flow boundary conditions are applied at the top and bottom, while the pressure values are set to p = 1 and p = 0 at the left and right boundaries. According to the length scales specified in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, the fractures with aperture a = L/225 are fully resolved by using 225 Â 225 grid cells (fully resolved simulation). For the simulation with the hierarchical approach 27 Â 27 matrix grid and 32 fracture segments are used.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> illustrates the solutions from the fully resolved simulation and the hierarchical approach. Note that the role of the vertical fracture is less important than that of the horizontal line one.

For the matrix, a 99 Â 99 equidistant Cartesian grid is employed at the fine-scale (misaligned with the fractures).

Note that the i-MSFV method is applied only for the matrix equation and it is re-emphasized here that no grid alignment is necessary. Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> illustrates that the converged i-MSFV (with n s = 4 iterated till solution is fully converged to machine accuracy) and fine-scale results are identical.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Convergence studies</head><p>The reference results shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">9a</ref> are obtained by applying an AMG solver of Sandia National Lab. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. The convergence histories of the i-MSFV method and the fine-scale simulation with AMG corresponding to the results of Figs. <ref type="figure">9a</ref> and<ref type="figure">b</ref> are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10a</ref>. Note that the sequential strategy used by the i-MSFV method results in much smaller global systems. Convergence histories for k ⁄ = 10 are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10(b)</ref>, which clearly demonstrates that the convergence rate of the sequential strategy decreases as the conductivity of the fractures is reduced, which is confirmed by the convergence histories shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>. In fact, the lower the fracture conductivity, the higher the pressure gradient. Hence, the remainder pf of the fracture pressure, which is updated sequentially, becomes more important and more outer iterations are required to achieve convergence.</p><p>Note that the devised i-MSFV method can be interpreted as a domain decomposition method <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref> with the important property that conservative velocity fields can be obtained after any iteration. Latter can be of great importance for practical applications, where one may be only interested in improved MSFV results rather than in fully converged solutions. The reason why this i-MSFV method is so efficient for highly conductive fractures is also due to the fact that the representation of individual fracture networks by single average (coarse-scale) pressure values corresponds to extreme coarsening, or in AMG terminology to agglomeration of highly connected DOFs <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>It is very important to emphasize that the main intention of these convergence studies is not to compare convergence rates of AMG, i-MSFV and existing domain decomposition methods. That would require a more extensive analysis and numerical studies including actual CPU times. This paper is mainly focused on devising an i-MSFV algorithm to solve fractured porous media problems and a more detailed comparison of convergence rates is beyond its scope. We want to point out, however, that our pressure splitting technique and agglomerating along strongly connected fracture cells (using the apriory knowledge) is advantageous.</p><p>Finally, a test case with the same setup as for the previous one, but a heterogeneous permeability field (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12(a)</ref>) is considered. The solution for k</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">Ã ¼ k f = k m ¼ 10 3</formula><p>, where k m is the average matrix permeability, is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>(b), and convergence histories (for i-MSFV simulations) with different k ⁄ are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">13</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Dynamic fracture network</head><p>As one of the advantages of the hierarchical fracture modeling approach is the minimal fracture/matrix grid dependencies, it is interesting to test the performance of the devised i-MSFV method for these types of scenarios. Therefore, in this sub-section a similar domain with a homogeneous permeability field is considered. No-flow conditions are applied on the whole domain boundary. Similar to the previous test cases, fine and coarse grids consist of 99 Â 99 and 9 Â 9 cells, respectively. The pressure values in cells (1, 1) and (99, 99) are set to 1 and 0, respectively. In contrast to the previously studied test cases, the fracture network is generated in 8 phases. Phase 1 consists of only one fracture line (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">14</ref>). During each phase, one fracture line is added to the network; hence the network becomes bigger from one phase to the next. The locations of the fracture lines are arbitrary selected. Note that for each phase, the initial pressure value was set to 0, i.e. each phase is treated like a new test case with a new fracture network.</p><p>Note that the matrix grid is the same during all phases, and all fractures are 10 3 times more conductive than the matrix. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">15</ref> illustrates the convergence histories of the i-MSFV method obtained with n s = 4 for all 8 problems. As the fracture network grows and gets closer to the production location, the pressure variation inside the fracture network becomes larger and therefore more iterations are required to achieve convergence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Multiphase flow problems</head><p>Here results of two phase flow in homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media obtained with the devised i-MSFV method are presented. First, a homogeneous domain with one fracture line is considered. A fracture element is 3 Â 10 3 more conductive than the porous media per unit area. The fracture contains 57 segments and matrix grid 99 Â 99 fine cells; for the i-MSFV method a 9 Â 9 coarse matrix grid is employed. No-flow conditions are applied at all boundaries, an injector well with a constant rate of 1 is located in fine cell (1, 1) and production occurs out of fine cell (99, 99), where the pressure value is kept constant at 0. The injected phase is 10 times less viscous than the displaced one. Quadratic relative permeabilities, i.e. k r = S 2 /l, are used for flow in the matrix; in the fracture on the other hand, k r = S/l is employed. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">16</ref> shows pressure and saturation maps obtained with the i-MSFV method after 0.04 PVI (pore volume injection). Finally, results of a similar test case with a heterogeneous matrix (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>(a)) are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">17</ref>. Note that for both of the previous test cases fine-scale and multiscale results are virtually identical, since here i-MSFV iterations were applied until the maximum fracture pressure change becomes extremely small (10 À4 in the homogeneous and 10 À7 in the heterogeneous case).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper an iterative multiscale finite volume method for the solution of fractured porous media using a hierarchical fracture modeling approach is presented. The fracture modeling approach was extended to become suitable for the MSFV framework. This extension involves splitting of the fracture pressure into an average value and a deviation. This splitting technique results in only one additional DOF for each connected fracture network being implicitly coupled with the matrix system. This results in much smaller coupled systems compared with those in the previously proposed hierarchical approach. For the fracture deviation pressure a classical solver is employed, since the corresponding systems tend to be much smaller than the globally coupled one.</p><p>To reduce the computational cost required for the solution of the global system with its additional DOFs, an i-MSFV is devised. Local fracture functions are introduced to accurately capture fractures at the coarse scale; similar as well functions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. In each coarse dual cell there exists only one local fracture function per overlapping network and one DOF is per fracture network is added to the coarse scale system.</p><p>Efficiency and accuracy of the proposed i-MSFV approach for fractured porous media was assessed for a wide range of test cases and corresponding results are documented in the paper. These demonstrate that the combination of the new i-MSFV method with sequential coupling of the global coarse system with the small systems for the fracture deviation pressure is very effective; especially for highly connective fractures. There are scenarios, however, that pressure gradients inside fractures are high. Such cases can occur in cases with large fractures and low fracture conductivities. For these cases, the convergence rate can be significantly improved by introducing more than one additional DOF for each fracture network in the matrix equation as a result of using higher order pressure splitting techniques.This improvement is subject of our future research.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1. 2D matrix with a 1D fracture network consisting of 3 connected fracture lines.
