<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We report on some recent work centered on attempts to understand when one set is more random than another. We look at various methods of calibration by initial segment complexity, such as those introduced by Solovay [125], Downey, Hirschfeldt, and Nies <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39]</ref>, Downey, Hirschfeldt, and LaForte <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>, and Downey <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>; as well as other methods such as lowness notions of Kučera and Terwijn <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[71]</ref>, Terwijn and Zambella <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[133]</ref>, Nies <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[101,</ref><ref type="bibr">100]</ref>, and Downey, Griffiths, and Reid <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>; higher level randomness notions going back to the work of Kurtz <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[73]</ref>, Kautz <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[61]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">Solovay [125]</ref>; and other calibrations of randomness based on definitions along the lines of Schnorr <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[117]</ref>.</p><p>These notions have complex interrelationships, and connections to classical notions from computability theory such as relative computability and enumerability. Computability figures in obvious ways in definitions of effective randomness, but there are also applications of notions related to randomness in computability theory. For instance, an exciting by-product of the program we describe is a more-or-less natural requirement-free solution to Post's Problem, much along the lines of the Dekker deficiency set.</p><p>This paper is self-contained (though we assume basic notions from computability theory, at the level of the first few chapters of Soare <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[121]</ref>), with some representative proofs being sketched. We begin with a quick recapitulation of the classical approaches to algorithmic randomness, through measure theory, unpredictability, and incompressibility. After that we turn to Solovay's approach to calibrating the complexity of left computably enumerable (left-c.e.) reals, and the Kučera-Slaman Theorem which implies that there is essentially only one random left-c.e. real, Chaitin's Ω. After looking at deficiencies of the notion of Solovay reducibility we turn to other initial segment measures of relative randomness.</p><p>We next introduce the notion of K-triviality. A set is K-trivial if its initial segment prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity is the same as that of the sequence of all ones (up to an additive constant). Noncomputable K-trivial sets exist but are all Δ 0 2 . The c.e. sets among them are solutions to Post's Problem. We explore Nies' results on the Turing degrees of such sets, which form a natural Σ 0  3 ideal in the c.e. Turing degrees, and the connections between K-triviality, lowness notions, and other forms of computational weakness related to randomness. We then discuss the complexity of c.e. sets and a theorem of Kummer which characterizes c.e. degrees containing complex c.e. sets.</p><p>After this we turn to other notions of randomness such as Schnorr randomness and computable randomness, where the notion of what constitutes a random set actually changes. Again, there have been many recent results in this area, such as a machine characterization of Schnorr randomness, and beautiful lowness characterizations related to the hyperimmune-free degrees. We also discuss lowness notions for various flavors of randomness.</p><p>Next we look at arithmetical versions of randomness (n-randomness). We include a bit of background material here, as it seems not widely known, and the lovely recent result that a set is 2-random (a relativized prefix-free complexity notion) iff its initial segment complexity is maximal infinitely often when measured by plain Kolmogorov complexity. Many "typical" random phenomena only really occur for 2-or even 3-random sets. For instance, if we concentrate on the left-c.e. reals, then we get the impression that 1-random sets look like Ω and are computationally rich. However, 2random sets are computationally very weak, and look much more like low sets. The next section includes several results of Miller and Yu, which explore another measure of relative randomness and further expand on this story, showing for instance that there is a relationship between levels of randomness and initial segment complexity. We follow this with a look at relativizing randomness by considering Ω as an operator, which is complicated by the fact that it is a c.e. operator but is not c.e. in and above.</p><p>In the last section we take a brief look at effective Hausdorff dimension and related notions of partial randomness. This is a huge area of research, particularly in computer science, and we will only mention a few recent results.</p><p>The topic of this paper is a mix of computability theory, algorithmic information theory, and measure theory. Our computability-theoretic notation generally follows Odifreddi <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">107]</ref> and Soare <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[121]</ref>. We deal with several degree structures, but when we mention degrees without further specification, we mean Turing degrees. We will denote the e-th partial computable function by Φ e , the e-th partial computable function with oracle X by Φ X e , and the e-th computably enumerable set by W e . When we write log n, we mean the base 2 logarithm of n, rounded up to the nearest integer. We will use C to denote plain Kolmogorov complexity, and K to denote prefix-free <ref type="bibr">Kolmogorov complexity.</ref> This paper is not a general introduction to recent work on algorithmic randomness, but rather an attempt to give the reader insight into what we feel are some of the high points in the program to understand relative randomness, the Kolmogorov complexity of sets, and the relationships of these topics to classical computability theory. This is a fast-growing area of research, and we have necessarily omitted many important results and even entire fruitful lines of investigation. There is a wealth of open questions in this area; we mention a few below, but refer the reader to Miller and Nies <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[93]</ref> for a more comprehensive list.</p><p>Although we do not focus on the history of the field, we have tried to give motivating historical definitions and intuitions, as well as related results by, for instance, Kurtz <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[73]</ref> and Kautz <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[61]</ref>. Among several historically important papers not explicitly mentioned below, we may cite Shannon <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[119]</ref>, Solomonoff <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[123]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Chaitin [22]</ref>, and van Lambalgen <ref type="bibr">[135]</ref>. Details of the results here and a version of the legendary unpublished notes of <ref type="bibr">Solovay [125]</ref> will appear in a forthcoming book by Downey and Hirschfeldt <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>, Solovay's material appearing with his permission. A forthcoming book by Nies <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[102]</ref> contains details on some of the results here, in particular where the application of randomness notions in computability theory is concerned (for instance lowness properties and priority-free solutions to Post's problem). It also contains a chapter on formalizing the intuitive notion of randomness via effective descriptive set theory, studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[52]</ref>. §2. Sets, measure, and martingales.</p><p>2.1. Sets and measure. The Cantor space of all infinite binary sequences is denoted by 2 . This space is endowed with the tree topology, which has as basic clopen sets We identify an element X of 2 with the set {n : X (n) = 1}. The space 2 is measure-theoretically identical with the real interval [0, 1], although the two are not homeomorphic as topological spaces, so we can also think of elements of 2 as elements of [0, 1]. Thus we refer to elements of 2 as sets or reals. We will use the former term except when we wish to emphasize the identification of 2 with [0, 1], in particular when dealing with left computably enumerable reals. A real is left computably enumerable (left-c.e.) if it is the limit of a computable increasing sequence of rationals, or equivalently, if its left cut is c.e. Such reals are often simply called c.e. reals, but we wish to avoid any confusion between c.e. reals and c.e. sets. A real is strongly c.e. if it is of the form 0.A for a c.e. set A. It is not hard to see that not every left-c.e. real is strongly c.e.</p><p>The collection of strings (finite initial segments of sets) is denoted by 2 &lt; . For strings and , let denote that is an initial segment of . Similarly, for a set X and a string , let ≺ X denote that is an initial segment of X . We denote the length of a string by | |. For a set X , we denote the string consisting of the first n bits of X by X n.</p><p>One particularly important class of measurable subsets of 2 consists of the unions of prefix-free collections of basic clopen sets. A set P ⊂ 2 &lt; is called prefix-free if for all , , if ≺ and ∈ P, then / ∈ P. Note that for such a set P, if P = ∈P [ ], then</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(P) = ∈P 2 -| | .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Martingales.</head><p>A different treatment of measure, important for our story, is the one of Ville using martingales. A martingale is a function d : 2 &lt; → R + ∪ {0} that satisfies for every ∈ 2 &lt; the averaging condition 2d ( ) = d ( 0) + d <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">( 1)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, d is a supermartingale if it satisfies 2d ( ) d ( 0) + d <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">( 1)</ref>.</p><p>A (super)martingale d succeeds on a set A if lim sup n→∞ d (A n) = ∞. We say that d succeeds on, or covers, a class A ⊆ 2 if d succeeds on every A ∈ A. The success set S[d ] of d is the class of all sets on which d succeeds. The reader should think of a martingale as a betting strategy. The function d assigns a portion of our capital to be bet on the string . The success set of d is thus the collection of sets on which this betting strategy allows us to increase our capital arbitrarily much.</p><p>The following classical result shows how the concept of a martingale relates to measurability. Theorem 2.1 (Ville <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[136]</ref>). For any class A ⊆ 2 the following statements are equivalent:</p><p>(i) A has Lebesgue measure zero, (ii) There exists a martingale that succeeds on A.</p><p>Martingales will prove important when we look at refinements of classical Martin-L öf randomness. Martingales are the key to looking at measure and Hausdorff dimension in small classes such as polynomial time, a fact first realized by Lutz <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[80]</ref>. (See also <ref type="bibr">Lutz [83]</ref>.) §3. Three approaches to randomness. Historically, <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> there have been three main approaches to the definition of an algorithmically random sequence. They are via what we call (i) the measure-theoretic paradigm, (ii) the unpredictability paradigm, and (iii) the incompressibility paradigm.</p><p>3.1. The measure-theoretic paradigm. Among the oldest definitions of randomness are those saying that a random set should have certain stochastic properties. For instance, a random set should have about as many 0's as 1's. Von Mises, in his remarkable paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[137]</ref>, defined a notion of randomness based on such stochastic properties, and noted that for any countable collection of such properties a nonempty notion of randomness results. But he did not have a canonical choice of such a countable collection at hand. Later Church made the connection with the theory of computability by suggesting that one should take all computable stochastic properties. Martin-L öf then noted that these are a special kind of measure zero subsets of 2 , and that a more general and smooth definition could be obtained by considering all effectively measure zero sets. We discuss this approach of Martin-L öf below. For more discussion and references on the original stochasticity approach see Ambos-Spies and Kučera <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>The measure-theoretic paradigm is that the random sets should be those with no effectively rare properties. If a property constitutes an effective null set, then a random set should not have this property.</p><p>A collection of sets that is effectively enumerated is a Σ 0 1 -class. We can represent a Σ 0 1 -class U as ∈W [ ] for some prefix-free c.e. set of strings W . We say that W is a presentation of U . Whenever we mention a Σ 0  1 -class U , we assume we have a fixed presentation W of U , and identify U with W . So, for instance, for ∈ 2 &lt; , we write ∈ U to mean ∈ W . We will not explicitly mention presentations unless necessary for clarity. Now a test is a sequence {U i } i∈ of such Σ 0 1 -classes that are shrinking in size. A set passes a test {U i } i∈ if it is not in the intersection i U i . The main idea is that a random set should pass all effective tests. This leads to the following definition. Definition 3.1 (Martin-L öf <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[85]</ref>). A collection of sets A ⊆ 2 is Martin-Löf null (or Σ 0  1 -null) if there is a uniformly c.e. sequence {U i } i∈ of Σ 0 1 -classes (called a Martin-Löf test) such that (U i ) 2 -i and A ⊆ i U i . A set A ∈ 2 is Martin-Löf random, or Σ 0 1 -random, or 1-random, if {A} is not Σ 0 1 -null.</p><p>Solovay gave the following definition of randomness equivalent to that of Martin-L öf. It is not hard to prove that the two notions are the same. Definition 3.2 <ref type="bibr">(Solovay [125]</ref>). A Solovay test is a uniformly c.e. sequence {U i } i∈ of Σ 0 1 -classes with i (U i ) &lt; ∞. A set A is Solovay random if for all Solovay tests {U i } i∈ , we have A ∈ U i for only finitely many i. Note that the definition does not change if we replace the Σ 0  1 -classes U i by basic clopen sets [ i ].</p><p>One very interesting fact, due to Martin-L öf, is that there is a universal Martin-L öf test {U n } n∈ , meaning that a set A is Martin-L öf random iff A /</p><p>∈ n U n . To define such a test, fix a computable enumeration {V m i } i,m∈ of all Martin-L öf tests (with the m-th test being {V m i } i∈ ), and let U n = k V k n+k+1 . Similarly, there is a universal Solovay test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">The unpredictability paradigm.</head><p>If you ask someone why they think a certain event is random they will most often give the answer that the event is "unpredictable". In particular, a set A = a 0 a 1 . . . should be random if we cannot predict any of its bits given other bits. One way to implement this idea is to use martingales. Definition 3.3 <ref type="bibr">(Schnorr [116]</ref>). We say that a (super)martingale d is effective (also called Σ 0  1 or computably enumerable) if the reals d ( ) for ∈ 2 &lt; are uniformly left-c.e.</p><p>The reader might have expected that an effective martingale would be one where d is a computable function, rather than one with computable approximations. We will return to this very important point in Section 10.</p><p>Martingales of varying complexities are a convenient way of introducing various effective measures. This approach was first taken by Schnorr <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[116,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">117]</ref>, and later applied with much success in complexity theory by Lutz <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[80]</ref>.</p><p>Schnorr proved the following effective version of Ville's Theorem 2.1. Its proof is a direct effectivization of that of Theorem 2.1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Theorem 3.4 (Schnorr [117], Satz 5.3). A class A ⊆ 2 is Martin-Löf null iff there is a c.e. supermartingale d such that A ⊆ S[d ].</formula><p>This theorem remains true if we replace "c.e. supermartingale" by "c.e. martingale".</p><p>Since c.e. supermartingales are Σ 0 1 objects, it comes as no surprise that we can effectively list all of them in an enumeration d 0 , d 1 , . . . . The sum d = i 2 -i d i is then again a c.e. supermartingale, and its success set S[d ] is the maximal Martin-L öf null set, so d is a universal c.e. supermartingale. Additionally, d is an optimal c.e. supermartingale, in the sense that for any other nontrivial c.e. supermartingale d , there is a c such that cd ( ) d ( ) for all . The existence of an optimal c.e. supermartingale is also implicit in Levin's construction of a universal c.e. semimeasure (see Zvonkin and Levin <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[145]</ref>). The fact that there is no optimal c.e. martingale is one of the reasons to consider supermartingales. (This fact was implicit in <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[145]</ref>; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref> for a proof.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">The incompressibility paradigm.</head><p>A third approach to defining the notion of a random set is the one essentially due to Kolmogorov <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[65]</ref>. Here we regard a string as random iff it has no short description, that is, there is no short program to generate the string, meaning that the only way to generate it is essentially to hardwire it into the machine. (As opposed to, e.g., 101010 repeated 1000 times, which can be generated by a short program.) We then use this idea to define randomness of sets by considering the lengths of shortest descriptions of its initial segments. We mention only a few basic results about Kolmogorov complexity; for more on the subject, see Li and Vitányi <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[78]</ref> or Calude <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. For n ∈ N, let C (n) = C (0 n ). The specific encoding of natural numbers into strings used in this definition does not matter, since if</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f : 2 &lt; → 2 &lt; is computable, then C (f( )) C ( ) + O(1).</formula><p>We can define to be k</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">-random if C ( ) | | -k.</formula><p>(This definition will only be used in this section, and should not be confused with the notion of n-randomness we will introduce in Section 12.) An easy counting argument shows that random strings exist: For each n, there are n-k-1 i=0 2 -i = 2 n-k -1 programs of length &lt; nk, so there are at least 2 n -2 n-k + 1 many krandom strings of length n. For every k, the set of k-random strings is an immune Π 0 1 set, i.e., it does not contain any infinite c.e. subsets. As a function, C is not computable. If m(x) = min{C (y): y x}, then m is unbounded (because we eventually run out of short programs), but grows slower than any unbounded nondecreasing partial computable function.</p><p>We would like to extend the definition of randomness for finite strings to a definition for infinite strings. Naively, we could define a set A to be random iff there is a k such that every ≺ A is k-random. However, Martin-L öf showed that such sets do not exist! This can be seen using the following argument of Katseff <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[60]</ref>. Let 0 , 1 , . . . be an effective listing of all strings, with | n | = log n. If A m = n , then from the length of A n we can recover A m. Thus, to generate A n, we need only generate the string such that A n = n and compute n from | | = nlog n, which gives us n . This shows that for every A,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">∃ ∞ n [C (A n) n -log n + O(1)].</formula><p>The basic intuition for what goes wrong in trying to use plain Kolmogorov complexity to define randomness for sets is that the Kolmogorov complexity of should be the length of the shortest string such that can be obtained from the bits of . The length of seems to give an additional log n many bits of information. This idea is explicitly used above to demonstrate that, using plain Kolmogorov complexity, we will always get complexity oscillations in the initial segments of a set. <ref type="bibr">Levin [75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">76]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Schnorr [118]</ref>, and Chaitin <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">23]</ref> introduced methods to get around this problem, as we now discuss.</p><p>It should be noted that there is now a plain complexity characterization of 1-randomness, given recently by Miller and Yu <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[94]</ref>.</p><p>Theorem 3.5 <ref type="bibr">(Miller and Yu [94]</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">A set A is 1-random iff for every com- putable function g such that n 2 -g(n) &lt; ∞, C (A n) n -g(n) -O(1).</formula></div>

We retain the terminology "Kraft-Chaitin" for this theorem and certain associated concepts defined below for the sake of terminological consistency with many of the papers we discuss. If U is a prefix-free machine then the open set presented by the domain of U is measurable. The Kraft-Chaitin Theorem is a kind of converse to this fact, and implies that each left-c.e. real is the measure of the domain of some prefix-free machine. Theorem 3.9 (Levin <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[74]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Schnorr [118]</ref>, Chaitin <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>).

Thus K( i ) K M ( i ) + O(1) d i + O(1).</formula><p>Proof. It is enough to define effectively a prefix-free sequence of strings 0 , 1 , . . . with | n | = d n . The following organizational device is due to Joe Miller. For each n, let x n = x n 1 . . . x n m be a binary string such that 0.x n 1 . . . x n m = 1j n 2 -d j . We will define the n so that the following holds for each n: for each m with x n m = 1 there is a string n m of length m so that S n = { i : i n} ∪ { n m : x n m = 1} is prefix-free. We begin by letting 0 be 0 d 0 . Notice that x 0 m = 1 iff 0 &lt; m d 0 , so if we define 0 m = 0 m-1 1, then { 0 } ∪ { 0 m : x 0 m = 1} is prefix-free. Now assume we have defined 0 , . . . , n and n m for</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">x n m = 1 so that S n = { i : i n} ∪ { n m : x n m = 1} is prefix-free.</formula><p>If x n d n+1 = 1 then x n+1 is the same as x n except that x n+1 d n+1 = 0.

Otherwise, find the largest j &lt; d n+1 such that x n j = 1. Such a j must exist since otherwise 1j n 2 -d j &lt; 2 -d n+1 , which would mean that j n+1 2 -d j &gt; 1. In this case x n+1 is the same as x n except for positions j, . . . , d n+1 , where we have x n+1 j = 0 and</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">x n+1 m = 1 for j &lt; m d n+1 . Let n+1 = n j 0 d n+1 -j .

Then S n+1 = { i : i n + 1} ∪ { n+1 m : x n+1 m = 1}</formula><p>is the same as S n except that n j is replaced by a pairwise incomparable set of superstrings of n j . This clearly ensures that S n+1 is prefix-free.</p><p>This completes the definition of the i . Each finite subset of { 0 , 1 , . . . } is contained in some S n , and is hence prefix-free. Thus the whole set is prefixfree.

We will often use the Kraft-Chaitin Theorem in conjunction with Kleene's Recursion Theorem (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[121,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem II.3.1]</ref>). If we uniformly enumerate Kraft-Chaitin sets K n for n ∈ N and use the Kraft-Chaitin theorem to obtain corresponding prefix-free machines M n , then, since the proof of the Kraft-Chaitin Theorem is effective, the Recursion Theorem implies that there is an n such that M n has coding constant n. Thus, when we build a prefix-free machine M via the Kraft-Chaitin Theorem, we can assume we know the coding constant c of M in advance and use it in enumerating our requests (as long as the enumeration yields a Kraft-Chaitin set for any value of c).</p><p>Recently, Miller and Yu <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[94]</ref> have proved significant generalizations of Schnorr's Theorem 3.8, which can be interpreted as saying that not only is a set 1-random iff its initial segment complexity is always above n, but the initial segment complexity of 1-random sets is "well above" n most of the time.</p><p>Theorem 3.10 (Miller and Yu <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[94]</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">Let A be 1-random.

Part (ii) had been proved for computable functions f by <ref type="bibr">Solovay [125]</ref>. It is easy to check that if A is not 1-random, then (i) and (ii) fail, so these conditions are actually equivalent to 1-randomness.</p><p>In this section we have seen that for certain natural notions of randomness, various approaches to the definition of randomness lead to the same class, the 1-random sets. Later we will look at certain criticisms of this notion and variations generated by such criticisms. We now turn to our first approach to calibrating randomness. §4. Solovay reducibility, and a characterization of 1-random left-c.e. reals. Notice that a consequence of the Kraft-Chaitin Theorem is that a real is left-c.e. iff it is the measure of the domain of a prefix-free machine. Thus, in this setting, left-c.e. reals occupy the same place as c.e. sets do in classical computability theory.</p><p>We have not yet seen an example of a 1-random set. Since the universal Martin-L öf test defines an effectively null set, the collection of Martin-L öf random reals has measure 1. One might well ask to what extent they resemble one another, and how such resemblance might be measured. Since for each k the set</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">P k = {A : ∀n [K(A n) n -k]} is a Π 0 1</formula><p>-class containing only 1-random sets, there are 1-random sets of low Turing degree (by the Low Basis Theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[58]</ref>), and 1-random left-c.e. reals (since the leftmost path of a Π 0 1 -class is a left-c.e. real). On the other hand, we have the following result. Theorem 4.1 (Kučera <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[67]</ref>). If a 1-random set A has c.e. degree, then A ≡ T ∅ .</p><p>The most famous explicitly defined 1-random set is Chaitin's Ω <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">Ω := U ( )↓ 2 -| | = (dom(U )),</formula><p>where U is a universal prefix-free machine. This is the halting probability of U . Notice that Ω is a left-c.e. real.</p><p>Here is a short proof that Ω is 1-random. It follows from Theorem 4.1, and is not hard to check directly, that Ω ≡ T ∅ , so in particular Ω is not rational. Thus for each n there is an s with Ω s n = Ω n, where Ω s := Us ( )↓ 2 -| | . We build a prefix-free machine M . By the Recursion Theorem, we can assume we know its coding constant c in U . Whenever at a stage s we have U s ( ) = Ω s n for some such that | | &lt; nc (which means that K U (Ω s n) &lt; nc), we choose a string not in the range of U s and declare M ( ) = . Since M is coded in U with coding constant c, there must be a such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">| | | | + c &lt; n and U ( ) = M ( ) = . Since / ∈ rng(U s ), it follows that / ∈ dom(U s ), so Ω -Ω s 2 -| | &gt; 2 -n , and hence Ω n = Ω s n. This procedure ensures that if | | &lt; n -c then U ( ) = Ω n, whence K U (Ω n) n -c for all n.</formula><p>Of course, the definition of Ω depends on the choice of universal prefix-free machine, so we should really say that Ω is a halting probability, rather than the halting probability, as it is commonly referred to. However, the analog of Ω in classical computability is the halting problem ∅ := {i : Φ i (i) ↓}, and we usually talk about the halting problem, although that situation is analogous, in that the definition of ∅ depends on the choice of enumeration of the partial computable functions. What allows us to disregard this enumerationdependence is Myhill's Theorem (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[121,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem II.4.6]</ref>), which says that all halting problems are essentially the same, since they are all equivalent modulo a very strong reducibility. <ref type="bibr">Solovay [125]</ref> recognized this situation, and sought to introduce appropriate reducibilities to establish an analog to Myhill's Theorem. As we now discuss, Solovay's program has been recently realized by the joint work of several authors. Our starting point is the notion of Solovay reducibility, or domination, introduced by Solovay in his manuscript <ref type="bibr">[125]</ref>. Definition 4.2 <ref type="bibr">(Solovay [125]</ref>). We say that a real α is Solovay reducible to (or that dominates α), and write α S , if there are a constant c and a partial computable function f so that for all q ∈ Q with q &lt; , αf(q) &lt; c(q). One way to look at this definition is that a sequence of rationals converging to can be used to generate one converging to α at the same rate or faster. Indeed, if we have increasing computable sequences of rationals {r n } n∈ and {q n } n∈ converging to α and , respectively, then f(q n ) ↓ for all n, and for each n we can effectively find a k such that f(q n ) &lt; r k &lt; α. This observation yields the following characterization of Solovay reducibility. Lemma 4.3 (Calude, Coles, Hertling, and Khoussainov <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>). For left-c.e. reals α and , let {r n } n∈ and {q n } n∈ be increasing computable sequences of rationals converging to α and , respectively. Then α S iff there exist a total computable function g and a constant c such that for all n, αr g(n) &lt; c(q n ). <ref type="bibr">Solovay [125]</ref> observed that this "analytic" version of m-reducibility could be used to extend many results about Ω to a class of left-c.e. reals with a machine-independent definition, namely the Ω-like, or Solovay complete, left-c.e. reals, which are those left-c.e. reals α such that S α for all left-c.e. reals . (It is not hard to show that Ω is Ω-like.) In particular, if a left-c.e. real is Ω-like, then it is 1-random. This result follows from the following property of Solovay reducibility. Lemma 4.4 <ref type="bibr">(Solovay [125]</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">If α S then K(α n) K( n) + O(1).</formula><p>Proof Sketch. The proof relies on the following fact observed by Solovay: For each d there is a k such that, for all n 1 and all , of length n with |0. -0. | &lt; d2 -n , we have |K( )-K( )| k. Solovay's observation (which is also true for C ) follows easily from the fact that there are only O(d ) many such for a fixed . Now let f and c be as in Definition 4.2. Let n = 0.( n). Since n is rational andn &lt; 2 -(n+1) , we have αf( n ) &lt; c2 -(n+1) . Thus, by the observation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">K(α n) K(f( n ) n) + O(1).

Using the Kraft-Chaitin Theorem, Calude, Hertling, Khoussainov, and Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> proved that if α is Ω-like, then α is the halting probability of a universal prefix-free machine. We give a short proof based on a characterization of Solovay reducibility by Downey, Hirschfeldt, and Nies <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39]</ref>. Theorem 4.5 (Calude, Hertling, Khoussainov, and Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>). Let α be a left-c.e. real such that Ω S α. Then α is a halting probability. That is, there is a universal prefix-free machine U such that (dom( U )) = α.</p><p>Proof. Let U be a universal prefix-free machine with Ω = (dom(U )).

Define a prefix-free machine U by letting U ( ) = M ( ) if and U ( ) = U ( ). Then U is universal, since it codes U , and (dom(</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">U )) = (dom(M )) -2 -c (1 -Ω) = α.</formula><p>Kučera and Slaman finished the story by proving the following.</p><p>Theorem 4.6 (Kučera and Slaman <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[70]</ref>). Every 1-random left-c.e. real is Ω-like.</p><p>Proof Sketch. Suppose that α is a 1-random left-c.e. real and is a left-c.e. real. We need to show that S α. We enumerate a Martin-Löf test {R n } n∈ in stages. Let {α s } s∈ and { s } s∈ be increasing sequences of rationals converging to α and , respectively. At stage s, if α s ∈ R n,s , do nothing, and otherwise put (α s , α s +2 -n ( s+1ts )) into R n , where t s is the last stage at which something was put into R n . Now (R n ) &lt; 2 -n &lt; 2 -n , and thus {R n } n∈ is a Martin-L öf test. As α is 1-random, there is an n such that α / ∈ R n , which implies that S α with constant 2 n . Theorem 4.6 gives great insight into the structure of the 1-random left-c.e. reals. All that is needed for α to be 1-random is that K(α n) n-O <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. But of course K(α n) can be near n+K(n). In fact, we know that the complexity of the initial segments of Ω must oscillate near this bound, and, indeed, by the work of Solovay mentioned after the proof of Theorem 3.10, all 1-random sets exhibit such oscillations. The Kučera-Slaman Theorem says that all 1random left-c.e. reals exhibit the same pattern of complexity oscillation, and that in a strong sense, there is essentially only one 1-random left-c.e. real.</p><p>Results such as the above motivate us to understand the structure of left-c.e. reals under S . Naturally, this reducibility gives rise to equivalence classes, called Solovay degrees. We denote the Solovay degree of α by deg S (α). It was observed by Solovay and others, such as Calude, Hertling, Khoussainov, and Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, that the Solovay degrees of left-c.e. reals form an upper semilattice, with the join operation induced by addition (or equivalently, multiplication); that is, deg S (α) ∨ deg S ( ) = deg S (α + ) = deg S (α • ). Downey, Hirschfeldt, and Nies <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39]</ref> showed that this upper semilattice is distributive, and established some of its structural properties.   <ref type="figure">-c</ref>.e. reals in the sense that they cannot be split into two left-c.e. reals of lesser Solovay degree. It is important to realize that this is only true of left-c.e. reals. To see this, note that if Ω = .a 0 a 1 . . . and we let α = .a 0 0a 2 0a 4 0 . . . and = .0a 1 0a 3 0 . . . , then clearly neither α nor can be 1-random, yet α + = Ω. But α and are not left-c.e. The fact that addition induces the join operation on left-c.e. reals leads to another characterization of Solovay reducibility on left-c.e. reals. Theorem 4.8 (Downey, Hirschfeldt, and Nies <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39]</ref>). Let α and be leftc.e. reals. Then α S iff there exist a constant c and a left-c.e. real such that c = α + .</p><p>Before we leave the Solovay degrees of left-c.e. reals, we note that their structure is quite complicated. Theorem 4.9 <ref type="bibr">(Downey,</ref><ref type="bibr">Hirschfeldt,</ref><ref type="bibr">and LaForte [37]</ref>). The first-order theory of the Solovay degrees of left-c.e. reals is undecidable.</p><p>The proof of Theorem 4.9 uses Nies' method of interpreting effectively dense Boolean algebras (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[99]</ref>), together with a technical construction of a certain class of (strongly) c.e. reals.</p><p>Calude and Nies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> proved that the 1-random left-c.e. reals are all wttcomplete. This also follows from the result in Downey, Hirschfeldt, and LaForte <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref> that if is a left-c.e. real and α is a strongly c.e. real, then α S implies α wtt (and even α sw , which will be defined in Section 5.1). If we combine this result with the following theorem of Demuth, and the fact that if a 1-random set has c.e. Turing degree then it is Turing complete, we see that while a 1-random left-c.e. real is wtt-complete, it is tt-incomparable with all noncomputable, incomplete c.e. sets. In particular, no 1-random left-c.e. real can be tt-complete. Theorem 4.10 (Demuth <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>). If A is 1-random and B tt A is noncomputable, then there is a 1-random set C ≡ T B.</p><p>Proofs of Demuth's Theorem can be found in Kautz <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem IV.3.16]</ref> and Downey and Hirschfeldt <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>. §5. Other reducibilities that calibrate randomness. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>, a transitive preordering on sets was said to be a measure of relative randomness if it satisfies the Solovay property:</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">If A B, then K(A n) K(B n) + O(1).</formula><p>This view of what constitutes a measure of relative randomness is too restrictive, as it is tailored to reducibilities motivated by the incompressibility approach to randomness, so we will instead use the term K-measure of relative randomness. (In Section 5.3 we will see a reducibility motivated by the unpredictability approach to randomness.) Solovay reducibility is a K-measure of relative randomness, but it is certainly not the only one. Moreover, it behaves reasonably only on the left-c.e. reals; it is quite easy to construct a real α and a computable real with S α. Even on the left-c.e. reals, S-reducibility is too fine and uniform (as we will see), and badly fails to capture relative complexity exactly.</p><p>5.1. sw and rK . In <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>, Downey, Hirschfeldt, and LaForte introduced another K-measure of relative randomness called sw-reducibility (strong weak truth table reducibility). Definition 5.1. We say that A is sw-reducible to B, and write A sw B, if there is a functional Γ such that Γ B = A and the use of Γ B (n) is bounded by n + O(1).</p><p>Again it is not difficult to prove that sw is a K-measure of relative randomness. This reducibility is quite close to one considered by Csima <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Soare [122]</ref> in connection with work of Nabutovsky and Weinberger <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[98]</ref> in differential geometry, the difference being that the use is bounded by n in their case. Lewis and Barmpalias <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[77]</ref> have recently given an interesting characterization of sw-reducibility in terms of Lipschitz continuity. Downey, Hirschfeldt, and LaForte <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref> showed that sw agrees with S on the strongly c.e. reals, but the two notions are incomparable on the left-c.e. reals, in the sense that there exist left-c.e. reals α, , , with α S but α sw , and sw but S . Furthermore, if α is a noncomputable left-c.e. real, then there is a noncomputable strongly c.e. real sw α, but this is not true in general for S , as shown by the following theorem, which is proved by a gap/co-gap argument.</p><p>Theorem 5.2 (Downey, Hirschfeldt, and LaForte <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>). There exists a noncomputable left-c.e. real α such that all strongly c.e. reals S-below α are computable.</p><p>By and large, however, sw-reducibility is very badly behaved, as witnessed by the next two theorems. Theorem 5.3 (Downey, Hirschfeldt, and LaForte <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>). The sw-degrees of left-c.e. reals do not form an upper semilattice.</p><p>Theorem 5.4 <ref type="bibr">(Yu and Ding [142]</ref>). There is no sw-complete left-c.e. real.

Theorem 5.5 (Downey and Hirschfeldt <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>). Let α be a 1-random leftc.e. real. Then B sw α for any c.e. set B. Thus, not only is Ω wtt-complete, but it is sw-hard for c.e. sets.</p><p>Proof. Since α is 1-random, there is a d such that K(α n) &gt; n-d for all n. We build a prefix-free machine M using the Kraft-Chaitin Theorem. By the Recursion Theorem, we can assume we know the coding constant c of M in the universal prefix-free machine U . Whenever we see n &gt; c + d enter B at stage s, we enumerate a request ncd, α s n . The total cost of these requests is bounded by n&gt;c+d 2 -(n-c-d ) = 1, so the hypotheses of the Kraft-Chaitin Theorem are satisfied. Thus for all n &gt; c + d , if n enters B at stage s, then K(α s n) K M (α s n) + c ncd + c = nd , which implies that α n = α s n. So to compute B(n) for n &gt; c +d , it is enough to run the approximation of α until a stage s such that α n = α s n, and then n ∈ B iff n ∈ B s .

For instance, Barmpalias <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> showed that there are no sw-maximal c.e. sets, and Barmpalias and Lewis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> showed that there are left-c.e. reals that are not sw-below any 1-random left-c.e. real (cf. the comment following Theorem 12.1). It is not known whether there is a maximal sw-degree, although Lewis and Barmpalias <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[77]</ref> showed that no 1-random set can have maximal sw-degree.

While the proof below is easy, it is slightly hard to see why it works. So, by way of motivation, suppose that we were to asked to "prove" that ∅ has the same initial segment complexity complexity as . A complicated way to do this would be to build our own prefix-free machine M whose only job is to compute initial segments of ∅. The idea would be that if the universal prefix-free machine U converges to 1 n on input then M ( ) ↓= 0 n . Notice that, in fact, using the Kraft-Chaitin Theorem it would be enough to build M implicitly, enumerating the length request | |, 0 n . We are guaranteed that</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">∈dom(M ) 2 -| | ∈dom(U ) 2 -| | 1</formula><p>, and hence the Kraft-Chaitin Theorem applies.

We will build a noncomputable c.e. set A in place of ∅ in the remark and, as above, we will slavishly follow the universal prefixfree machine U on n in the sense that whenever U enumerates, at stage s, a shorter with U ( ) = n, we will enumerate a request | | + 1, A s n for our machine M . To make A noncomputable, we will also sometimes make A s n = A s+1 n. Then for each j with n j s, for the currently shortest string j computing j, we will also need to enumerate a request | j |, A s+1 j for M . The construction works by making this extra measure added to the domain of M small.</p><p>We are ready to define A:</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">A := {n : ∃e ∃s [W e,s ∩ A s = ∅ ∧ n &gt; 2e ∧ n ∈ W e,s ∧ n j s 2 -Ks (j) &lt; 2 -(e+2) ]},</formula><p>where W e,s is the stage s approximation to the e-th c.e. set W e and K s (j) is the stage s approximation to the K-complexity of j.</p><p>Clearly A is c.e. Since j m 2 -K (j) goes to zero as m increases, if W e is infinite then A ∩ W e = ∅. Since A is also coinfinite, this implies that A is noncomputable. Finally, the extra measure put into the domain of M , beyond one half of that which enters the domain of U , is bounded by e 2 -(e+2) (corresponding to at most one initial segment change for each e), whence</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">∈dom(M ) 2 -| | ∈dom(U ) 2 -(| |+1) + e 2 -(e+2) 1 2 + 1 2 = 1.</formula><p>So the Kraft-Chaitin Theorem applies, and M is a well-defined prefix-free machine. Thus</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">K(A n) K(n) + O(1).</formula><p>The above proof can be modified to prove the result, due to Muchnik (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>), that there exists a noncomputable c.e. set A that is low for K, in the sense that K-complexity relativized to A is the same as K-complexity, up to an additive constant, i.e., K( ) K A ( )+O <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Such an A is both K-trivial and low for 1-randomness (which will be formally defined in Section 7, but means that relativizing the definition of 1-randomness to A does not change the class of 1-random sets). We will later see that these concepts are all equivalent, as shown by the work of Nies (see Sections 7 and 8).</p><p>Clearly the above proof also admits many variations. For instance, we can make A promptly simple, or below any nonzero c.e. degree. We cannot control the jump or make A Turing complete, since the K-trivial sets are nonhigh, as shown by Downey, Hirschfeldt, Nies, and Stephan <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[40]</ref> (and in fact low, as shown by Nies [100]); see Sections 6.2, 7, and 8.</p><p>As we will see in Section 6.2, the construction above automatically yields a Turing incomplete c.e. set. It is thus an injury-free solution to Post's Problem. It is not, however, priority-free, in that it depends on an ordering of the simplicity requirements, with stronger requirements allowed to use up more of the domain of the machine M . We can do methodologically better by giving a priority-free solution to Post's Problem, in the sense that no explicit diagonalization (such as that of W e above) occurs in the construction of the incomplete c.e. set, and therefore the construction of this set (as opposed to the verification that it is noncomputable) does not depend on an ordering of requirements. We now sketch this method, which is due to Downey, Hirschfeldt, Nies, and Stephan <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[40]</ref>, and is rather more like that of Solovay's original proof of the existence of a noncomputable K-trivial set.</p><p>Let us reconsider the key idea in the proof of Theorem 6.2. At certain stages we wish to change an initial segment of A for the sake of diagonalization. Our method is to make sure that the total measure added to the domain of our machine M (which proves the K-triviality of A) due to such changes is bounded by 1. Suppose, on the other hand, that we were fortunate enough to have the universal machine itself "cover" the measure needed for these changes. That is, suppose we were at a stage s where we desired to put n into A s+1 -A s , and at that very stage K s (j) changed for all j ∈ {n, . . . , s}. That means that in any case we would need to enumerate new requests describing A s+1 j for all j ∈ {n, . . . , s}, whether or not these initial segments change. Thus at that very stage, we could also change A s j for all j ∈ {n, . . . , s} at no extra cost.</p><p>Notice that we would not need to copy the universal prefix-free machine U at every stage. We could enumerate a collection of stages t 0 , t 1 , . . . and only update M at stages t i . Thus, for the lucky situation outlined above to occur, we would only need the approximation to K(j) to change for all j ∈ {n, . . . , t s } at some stage u with t s u t s+1 . This observation would seem to allow a greater possibility for this lucky situation to occur, since many stages can occur between t s and t s+1 .</p><p>The key point in this discussion is the following. Let t 0 , t 1 , . . . be a computable collection of stages. Suppose that we construct a set A = s A ts so that for n t s , if A t s+1 n = A ts n then K ts (j) &gt; K t s+1 (j) for all j with n j t s . Then A is K-trivial. We are now ready to define A in a priority-free way.</p><p>A Priority-Free Solution to Post's Problem. Let t 0 , t 1 , . . . be a collection of stages such that t i as a function of i dominates all primitive recursive functions. (Actually, we do not need i → t i to be quite this fast growing; see below for more details.) At each stage u, let {a i,u : i ∈ } list A u . Define</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">A t s+1 = A ts ∪ {a n,ts , . . . , t s },</formula><p>where n is the least number t s such that K t s+1 (j) &lt; K ts (j) for all j ∈ {n, . . . , t s }. (Naturally, if no such n exists, A t s+1 = A ts .) Requiring the complexity change for all j ∈ {n, . . . , t s }, rather than just j ∈ {a n,ts , . . . , t s }, ensures that A is coinfinite, since for each n there are only finitely many s such that K t s+1 (n) &lt; K ts (n).</p><p>Note that there is no priority used in the definition of A. It is like the Dekker deficiency set or the so-called "dump set" (see Soare <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[121]</ref>, Theorem V.2.5).</p><p>It remains to prove that A is noncomputable. By the Recursion Theorem, we can build a prefix-free Turing machine M and know the coding constant c of M in the universal prefix-free machine U . That is, if we declare M ( ) = j then we will have U ( ) = j for some such that | | | | + c. Note further that if we put into the domain of M at stage t s , then will be in the domain of U by stage t s+1 -1. (This is why we required i → t i to dominate the primitive recursive functions. In fact, we only need this function to dominate the overhead of the Recursion Theorem; that is, we only need the property that if enters the domain of M at stage t s , then there is a such that | | | | + c and U t s+1 -1 ( ) ↓= M ( ). The use of a fast growing sequence of stages was the key insight in Solovay's original construction.) Now the proof looks like that of Theorem 6.2. We devote 2 -(e+1) of the domain of our machine M to ensuring that A satisfies the e-th simplicity requirement. When we see a n,ts occur in W e,ts , where n j ts 2 -Kt s (j) &lt; 2 -(e+c+2) , we provide shorter M ts descriptions of all j with n j t s so that K t s+1 (j) &lt; K ts (j) for all such j. The cost of this change is bounded by 2 -(e+1) , and a n,ts will enter A t s+1 , as required.</p><p>While the above proof does make use of an ordering of the simplicity requirements, it does so only in the verification of the fact that A is not computable, and not in the construction of A, which remains priority-free.</p><p>One remarkable fact about the K-trivial sets is that there are few of them for any given witnessing constant (cf. Theorem 5.12). Theorem 6.3 (Zambella <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[144]</ref>).

In complexity theory, if a class C has a definition that relativizes, a set A is called low for C (or C-low) if C = C A . So the low sets from computability theory are those that are low for the class of Δ 0 2 sets. Similarly, a set A such that every 1-random set is 1-random relative to A is called low for the 1-random sets, or low for 1-randomness.</p><p>Clearly, every computable set is low for 1-randomness. M. van Lambalgen and D. Zambella asked whether there exist noncomputable sets that are low for 1-randomness. (The question was first stated in Zambella <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[144]</ref>.) This question was raised in the context of a comparison between randomness properties in classical dynamic systems (specifically, Bernoulli sequences) and computability-theoretic randomness. A result of Kamae <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[59]</ref> showed that the infinite binary sequences that have no information about Bernoulli sequences (normal sequences) are precisely those with zero entropy. This fact raised the issue of whether a similar characterization exists for sets that have no information about 1-random sets, and motivated the question of the existence of noncomputable sets that are low for 1-randomness, which was answered by Kučera and Terwijn <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[71]</ref>.</p><p>Theorem 7.1 (Kučera and Terwijn <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[71]</ref>). There exists a noncomputable c.e. set that is low for 1-randomness.</p><p>Proof. It is not difficult to build a c.e. operator I such that I A is a universal Solovay test relative to A for every oracle A. (Here we think of Solovay tests as collections of basic clopen sets.) Given a set A, we can attempt to cover I A with an unrelativized Solovay test J by adding [ ] to J at stage s whenever [ ] is in I As at stage s. We then have J ⊇ I A , but we also need to build A to ensure that ( J ) = [ ]∈J ([ ]) &lt; ∞, and hence J is a Solovay test.

If n / ∈ A s and we enumerate n into A, then the elements of M s (n) may be in J -I A , where J is as above, so we need to ensure that ( M s (n)) for n ∈ A s+1 -A s is small, while still making A noncomputable.

Definition 7.2 (Zambella, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[131]</ref>).

A set A is low for 1-randomness iff A is K-trivial.</formula><p>Both directions of this theorem are rather hard to prove, particularly the "if" direction, which will be discussed in Section 8. The proof of this direction is based on Nies' proof that the class of K-trivial sets is closed downward under Turing reducibility, and is necessarily nonuniform, in a sense that will be made precise below. As we will see in Section 8, it can be extended to show that every K-trivial set is low for K (as defined in Section 6.1).</p><p>The proof of the "only if" direction of Theorem 7.4 went through various stages; see <ref type="bibr">Nies [104]</ref> for details. One approach is to convert the hypothesis that A is low for 1-randomness into a combinatorial condition, which can then be used to establish the K-triviality of A. For instance, an early version of the proof used the condition, due to Frank Stephan, that for some Σ 0 1 open set R ⊂ 2 of measure less than 1,</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">∃b ∈ ∀ ∈ 2 &lt; [K A ( ) | | -b ⇒ [ ] ⊆ R],</formula><p>where K A denotes prefix-free complexity relative to A. This condition says in essence that A cannot be used to reduce the prefix-free complexity of very many strings. A more recent version of the proof uses martingales, and will be sketched in the proof of Theorem 11.12 below. We will see another approach to establishing this direction of Theorem 7.4 in Theorem 8.10 below.</p><p>For c.e. sets A, however, there is an easier proof. In fact, Nies, Stephan, and Terwijn <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[105]</ref> have shown that in this case it suffices to require that A be low for Ω, which is defined as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_56">Definition 7.5.

On the other hand, Theorem 8.10 will show that Theorem 7.6 can be extended to all Δ 0 2 sets A. Proof Sketch of Theorem 7.6. We enumerate a Martin-L öf test {R A d } d ∈ relative to A, and use the fact that there is a d such that Ω / ∈ R A d to define a Kraft-Chaitin set L d that shows that A is K-trivial (that is, for each n there is a request r, A n ∈ L d for some r K(n) + d + 1). We define L d as a union S ∪ C d , where S supplies a new request whenever the approximation to K(n) decreases, and C d does the same when A n changes (after some delay).</p><p>Let</p><formula xml:id="formula_57">S = { K s (n) + 2, A s n : n, s ∈ ∧ K s (n) &lt; K s-1 (n)}.

We also want to ensure that C d is a Kraft-Chaitin set of weight at most 1/2, which implies that L d = S ∪ C d is a Kraft-Chaitin set. To do so, we "force" the approximation to Ω to increase by 2 -Ks (n)-d before we put K s (n) + d + 1, A s n into C d . This allows the weight of requests enumerated into C d to be "accounted against" increases of Ω. (That is, it ensures that increases in the weight of C d are bounded by increases in the approximation to Ω, or more precisely, one half of such increases.)</p><p>The increase in Ω is achieved by putting an interval [Ω s ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_58">Ω s + 2 -Ks (n)-d ] into R A d with an A-use n.</formula><p>Either A changes below n (in which case we do not need the new request anymore, and have not enumerated it into R A d ), or Ω has to move out of the interval, since we are assuming that Ω / ∈ R A d . Notice that this proof shares some elements with that of Kučera and Slaman <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[70]</ref> showing that each 1-random left-c.e. real is Solovay complete (Theorem 4.6).</p><p>From Theorem 7.4 we can conclude that all K-trivial sets are low, as we now see.

In this section we discuss the harder direction of Theorem 7.4, along with several related results about the class K of K-trivial sets.

We have already discussed the fact that lowness for 1-randomness implies K-triviality (and will return to it at the end of this section, when we discuss bases for 1-randomness). The converse follows immediately from the following theorem. The proof of this result is a reasonably straightforward modification of that of the following theorem. As we will discuss below, the proof of Theorem 8.2 also yields the result that the construction in the proof of Theorem 6.2 is in fact a characterization of K, in that it is in essence the only way to obtain a K-trivial set! Proof Sketch of Theorems 8.1 and 8.2. We first discuss the easier proof that every K-trivial set is Turing incomplete, but present it as a "projection" of the proofs of Theorems 8.1 and 8.2 in Nies [100]. We then briefly discuss the modifications needed to convert this argument into proofs of Theorems 8.1 and 8.2.</p><p>Assume for a contradiction that ∀n [K(A n) K(n)+b] and A is Turing complete. By Theorem 6.1, we can choose a Δ 0 2 approximation {A s } s∈ to A. We will enumerate requests into a Kraft-Chaitin set L (in fact enumerating at most one request r, n for each n ∈ , with r ∈ ). The weight of X ⊆ is wt(X</p><formula xml:id="formula_62">) := {2 -r : r, n ∈ L ∧ n ∈ X }.</formula><p>This weight coincides with the measure of the corresponding descriptions given by the prefix-free machine M d defined by L (using the Kraft-Chaitin Theorem). Roughly, we will enumerate appropriate requests r, n into L in order to ensure that K(n) r + d . Since A is K-trivial via b, at some stage s after this enumeration the opponent has to give a short description of A s n, by ensuring that U s ( ) = A s n for some with | | r + d + b, where U is the universal prefix-free machine that is being used to define K. We use the Turing completeness of A to make the approximation to A n change after stage s, so that the opponent has to come up with a short description of the new approximation to A n. If we can change A often enough, then the measure corresponding to the opponent's descriptions exceeds 1, which is impossible.</p><p>More precisely, by the Recursion Theorem we can assume we have an index d such that M d is a prefix-free machine corresponding to L in the sense of the Kraft-Chaitin Theorem. If we let c = b + d , then as an answer to our enumeration of the request r, n into L, the opponent has to provide a U -description of A n of length r + c. Let k = 2 c+1 . If we manage to put requests of total weight 1/2 into L and also force the approximation to A n to change at least k times for each n mentioned in our requests, then the total measure of the opponent's descriptions will exceed 1. (Here we only count a change in the approximation to A n if the opponent has provided a short description of the previous approximation to this initial segment.)</p><p>The proof is much easier if we assume that ∅ wtt A. In this case, we build an auxiliary c.e. set B, and by the Recursion Theorem we can assume we are given a total wtt-reduction Γ such that B = Γ A , with use bounded by a computable increasing function g. Let n = g(k). We put the single request 0, n into L. (The weight of this single request is 1.) Each time Γ As (j) converges to B s (j) for all j &lt; k and the opponent provides a U -description of A s n of length c, we force the approximation to A n to change by putting into B the largest number &lt; k that is not yet in B. Once we reach k such changes, the total measure of U -descriptions is at least k2 -c &gt; 1, which is a contradiction.</p><p>For the Turing case, we still build B and have a total reduction Γ A = B given by the Recursion Theorem, but now there is no computable bound on the use A of Γ A . The problem now is that, when we have an m such that As (m) = n and we put a request r, n into L, the opponent might, before providing a short description of A s n, move A (m) beyond n, thereby depriving us of the possibility of causing further changes in the approximation to A n by enumerating numbers &lt; m into B. Broadly speaking, the solution is to carry out many attempts, based on different computations Γ A (m). Each time the use of such a computation changes, some of what we placed in L for this attempt becomes "garbage", but as the reduction Γ is total, this only happens finitely often for each m. We have to ensure that the total weight of the garbage produced by all our attempts is limited, since otherwise L will not be a Kraft-Chaitin set.</p><p>For each s, we can effectively determine a stage f(s) &gt; s such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_63">∀n &lt; s [K f(s) (A f(s) n) K f(s) (n) + b]. Let s 0 = 0 and s i+1 = f(s i ).</formula><p>The construction is restricted to stages in {s i : i ∈ }. The following is a way to keep track of the number of times the opponent has had to give new descriptions of approximations to A n. We say that the number n is in a j-set if this has happened j times. More precisely, for 1 j k, we say that a finite set E ⊆ is a j-set at stage t if, for all n ∈ E, at some stage u &lt; t a request r, n went into L and at stage t there are at least j distinct strings of length n such that K t ( ) r + c. A c.e. set E with an enumeration E = t E t is a j-set if E t is a j-set at each stage t. In our construction, the strings will have the form A s n for certain stages s with u s t. Since the opponent has to match every description of n we provide via L with descriptions of A n that are at most c longer, we have the following straightforward but important fact. (Recall that k = 2 c+1 .)</p><formula xml:id="formula_64">If the c.e. set E is a k-set, then wt(E) 1/2.</formula><p>As in the wtt case, our construction will build a k-set C k of weight &gt; 1/2 to reach a contradiction.</p><p>The procedure P j (2 j k) enumerates a j-set C j . The construction begins by calling P k , which calls P k-1 several times, and so on down to P 2 , which enumerates L (and C 2 ).</p><p>Each procedure P j has rational parameters q, ∈ [0, 1]. The goal q is the weight it wants C j to reach, and the garbage quota is how much it is allowed to waste.</p><p>We now describe the procedure P j (q, ), where 1 &lt; j k, and the parameters q = 2 -x and = 2 -y are such that x y.</p><p>1. Choose m large. 2. Wait until Γ A (m) ↓. 3. Let v 1 be the number of times P j has gone through step 2. j = 2: Pick a large number n. Put r n , n into L, where 2 -rn = 2 -v . Wait for a stage t such that K t (n) r n + d , and put n into C 1 . (If M d is a prefix-free machine corresponding to L, then t exists.) j &gt; 2: Call P j-1 (2 -v , ), where = min( , 2 j-k-w-1 ) and w is the number of P j-1 procedures started so far. (The most important point to understand here is that the goals of the P j-1 procedures called by a P j procedure are related to the garbage quota of the P j procedure, which ensures that even if all such procedures are canceled, the wasted measure will still be below this garbage quota. Another important point is that the garbage quotas are chosen so that their sum over all procedures started during the construction is less than 1/2.) In any case, if wt(C j-1 ) &lt; q then repeat step 3, and otherwise return. 4. Put m into B. This forces A to change below (m) &lt; min(C j-1 ), and hence makes C j-1 a j-set (if we assume inductively that C j-1 is a (j -1)-set). So put C j-1 into C j , and declare C j-1 = ∅.</p><p>If A (m) changes during the execution of the loop at step 3, then cancel the run of all subprocedures, and go to step 2. Despite the cancelations, C j-1 is now a j-set because of this very change. (This is an important point, as it ensures that the measure associated with numbers already in C j-1 is not wasted.) So put C j-1 into C j , and declare C j-1 = ∅. This completes the description of the procedures. The construction consists of calling P k (1, 1/4). One can check that, because of the way the garbage quotas are chosen, L is a Kraft-Chaitin set. The set C k is a k-set, and therefore should have weight at most 1/2. But, since Γ A is total, each procedure returns unless canceled, so the initial procedure P k , which is never canceled, eventually ensures that C k has weight &gt; 1/2, which is a contradiction.</p><p>We can visualize this construction by thinking of a machine similar to Lerman's pinball machine (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[121,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter VIII.5]</ref>). However, since we enumerate rational quantities instead of single objects, we replace the balls in Lerman's machine by amounts of a precious liquid, say 1955 Biondi-Santi Brunello wine. Our machine consists of decanters C k , C k-1 , . . . , C 0 . At any stage C j is a j-set. We put C j-1 above C j so that C j-1 can be emptied into C j . The height of a decanter is changeable. The procedure P j (q, ) wants to add weight q to C j , by filling C j-1 up to q and then emptying it into C j . The emptying corresponds to adding one more A-change.</p><p>The emptying device is a hook (the A (m)-marker), which besides being used on purpose may go off finitely often by itself. When C j-1 is emptied into C j then C j-2 , . . . , C 0 are spilled on the floor, since the new hooks emptying C j-1 , . . . , C 0 may be much longer (the A (m)-marker may move to a much bigger position), and so we cannot use them any more to empty those decanters in their old positions.</p><p>We first pour wine into the highest decanter C 0 , representing the left domain of L, in portions corresponding to the weight of requests entering L. We want to ensure that at least half the wine we put into C 0 reaches C k . Recall that the parameter is the amount of garbage P j (q, ) allows. If v is the number of times the emptying device has gone off by itself, then P j lets P j-1 fill C j-1 in portions of size 2 -v . Then when C j-1 is emptied into C j , at most 2 -v much liquid can be lost because of being in higher decanters C j-2 , . . . , C 0 . The procedure P 2 (q, ) is special but limits the garbage in the same way: it puts requests r n , n into L where 2 -rn = 2 -v . Once it sees the corresponding A n description, it empties C 0 into C 1 (but C 0 may be spilled on the floor before that because of a lower decanter being emptied).</p><p>We briefly sketch how to show that the class of K-trivial sets is closed downward under Turing reducibility. Let A be K-trivial and let a Turing reduction B = Γ A be given. We cannot change B at will any more, since we do not directly control it. However, if B does not change enough, we can build a Kraft-Chaitin set W showing that B is K-trivial. We now have a tree of runs of procedures. The root node is the single run of P k , which as before tries to reach a k-set of weight 1. The leaves behave like the P 2 procedure above. A node P j, (2 &lt; j k) calls procedures P j-1, , at stages where U s ( ) = m and B s = Γ As converges on all inputs &lt; m. For in this case we want to enumerate a request | | + d, B s m into the Kraft-Chaitin set W built at node P j, (where d is an appropriate constant depending on the node P j, ).</p><p>As before, once P j-1, returns, P j, needs an A (m) change. If such a change happens sufficiently often then P j, reaches its goal. Otherwise, the cost of changes of B, in the sense of the proof of Theorem 6.2, is small, so W is a Kraft-Chaitin set, showing that B is K-trivial. There must be a run on the tree where this cost is small (called the "golden run" in [100]), as otherwise the root node would reach its goal. However, the proof is nonuniform since one cannot identify the golden run effectively, as we will see below.</p><p>The proof of Theorem 8.1 proceeds in a similar way, except that P j, calls procedures P j-1, based on computations U A ( ) = y (since we now want to enumerate requests | | + d, y ), and the marker (m) is replaced by the use of this computation. The details can be found in Nies <ref type="bibr">[100]</ref>.</p><p>We next discuss two theorems from Nies [100] that can be obtained by extending the methods in the proof of Theorem 8.2. The first shows that the construction in the proof of Theorem 6.2 actually provides a characterization of the K-trivial c.e. sets. That is, each K-trivial c.e. set A can be thought of as being built by such a construction, for an appropriate effective enumeration. The proof of this result uses the proof of downward closure of K, for the special case of the identity functional. We state it here for c.e. sets, but a version for Δ 0 2 sets is also given in [100]. Theorem 8.3 <ref type="bibr">(Nies [100]</ref>). For any c.e. set A, the following are equivalent.</p><formula xml:id="formula_65">(i) A is K-trivial.

In other words, one can not list the c.e. sets B in K while also providing constants d such that ∀y [K(y) K B (y) + d ]. The reason is that from such a constant one can effectively obtain an index for the lowness of B [100, Proposition 2.8]. On the other hand, for any sequence {B e } e∈ of uniformly low c.e. sets, an extension of the construction in Theorem 6.2 provides an A ∈ K = M that is not Turing below any B e , and hence the sequence {B e } e∈ does not exhaust K. Thus the nonuniformity in the proof of Theorem 8.1 is necessary. Details can be found in [101, Theorem 5.9].</p></div>

We want to ensure that there is a d such that One corollary of this result is the easier direction of Theorem 7.4, namely that every set that is low for 1-randomness is K-trivial. Another is an extension of Theorem 7.6: if A is Δ 0 2 and low for Ω, then it is a basis for 1-randomness, and hence K-trivial.</p><p>One way to look at Theorem 8.10 is in connection with the following classical theorem. Theorem 8.11. (de Leeuw, Moore, Shannon and Shapiro <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>, Sacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[115]</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">If A is not computable then ({X : X T A}) = 0.</formula><p>There is a sense in which this result cannot be effectivized, since {X : X T A} is never Martin-L öf null, as by Theorem 12.1 it always contains a 1-random set. However, if A is not a basis for 1-randomness, then {X : X T A} is contained in the universal Martin-L öf test relative to A, and hence is Martin-L öf null relative to A. Thus we have the following consequence of Theorem 8.11, which can be taken to say that the K-trivial sets are exactly those relative to which Theorem 8.11 cannot be effectivized. Corollary 8.12 (Hirschfeldt, Nies, and Stephan <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[50]</ref>). A set A is not Ktrivial iff {X : X T A} is Martin-Löf null relative to A. Theorem 8.10 has found a surprising application to computability theory. A Scott set is a Turing ideal S such that for each infinite binary tree T ∈ S, there is an infinite path of T in S. Scott sets occur naturally in various contexts, such as the study of models of arithmetic and reverse mathematics. H. Friedman and A. McAllister independently asked the following question: if S is a Scott set and X ∈ S is not computable, does there necessarily exist a Y ∈ S such that X | T Y ? Kučera showed that the answer is positive if X is not a basis for 1-randomness, by the following argument. If X ∈ S, then S contains an infinite binary tree all of whose infinite paths are 1-random relative to X , so there is a Y ∈ S that is 1-random relative to X . Of course Y T X , but if X is not a basis for 1-randomness, then also X T Y , so X | T Y . Slaman (personal communication) has recently used Theorems 8.1 and 8.10 to handle the case in which X is a basis for 1-randomness, thus giving a full positive answer to the question.</p><p>Most of the topics in this Section are surveyed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[103]</ref> and the corresponding proceedings paper.

Kummer complex c.e. sets, array noncomputability, and c.e.-traceability. As we saw in Theorem 7.3, Terwijn and Zambella <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[133]</ref> showed that the sets that are low for 1-randomness are c.e.-traceable. In Theorem 11.6, we will see that an analogous concept to c.e.-traceability is relevant to the characterization of another class of sets satisfying a lowness notion. In the case of c.e. sets, there is a fascinating connection between Kolmogorov complexity and the notion of array computability introduced by Downey, Jockusch, and Stob <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[41]</ref>, which, as shown by Ishmukhametov <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[53]</ref>, coincides with c.e.-traceability on the c.e. degrees.</p><p>Again we are concerned with initial segment complexity, this time of c.e. sets.

A degree is array noncomputable if it contains an array noncomputable set; otherwise it is array computable.</p><p>This definition was designed to capture a certain kind of multiple permitting construction. The intuition is that for A to be F-a.n.c., A needs |D f(k) | many permissions in order to agree with W on D f(k) .</p><p>In Downey, Jockusch, and Stob <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[42]</ref>, a new definition of array noncomputability was introduced, based on domination properties of functions. We first recall that f wtt A (for a function f and a set A) means that there are an index e and a computable function b such that f = Φ A e and, furthermore, for each n, the use of the computation Φ A e (n) does not exceed b(n). It is easily seen that f wtt ∅ iff there are computable functions h(., .) and p(.) such that, for all n, we have f(n) = lim s h(n, s) and |{s : h(n, s) = h(n, s + 1)}| p(n). Definition 9.5. A degree a is array noncomputable if for each f wtt ∅ there is a function g computable in a such that g(n) f(n) for infinitely many n. Otherwise, a is array computable. Theorem 9.6 (Downey, Jockusch, and Stob <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">42]</ref>). Let a be a c.e. degree and let {F n } n∈N be a very strong array.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hence for c.e. degrees, the two definitions of array noncomputability coincide, and the first definition is independent of the choice of very strong array.</head><p>It is well known that an arbitrary degree a is in GL 2 (i.e., (a ∪ 0 ) &lt; a ) iff for each function f computable in a∪0 there is a function g computable in a such that g(n) f(n) for infinitely many n. From this fact it immediately follows that if a ∈ GL 2 , then a is a.n.c., and if a is Δ 0 2 and array computable, then a is low 2 .</p><p>There are a number of other characterizations of the array noncomputable c.e. degrees (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">42]</ref>). For example, the a.n.c. c.e. degrees are precisely those that bound c.e. sets A 1 , A 2 , B 1 , B 2 such that A 1 ∩ A 2 = B 1 ∩ B 2 = ∅ and every separating set for A 1 , A 2 is Turing incomparable with every separating set for B 1 , B 2 . In fact, they are the degrees that bound disjoint c.e. sets A, B that have no separating set of degree 0 . The a.n.c. c.e. degrees also form an invariant class for the perfect thin Π 0 1 -classes, which form an orbit in the lattice of Π 0 1 -classes, in the same way that the maximal sets realize all high c.e. degrees and are an invariant orbit for the high c.e. degrees (see Cholak, Coles, Downey, and Herrmann <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>).</p><p>Of relevance here is the following result.</p><p>Theorem 9.7 (Ishmukhametov <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[53]</ref>). A c.e. degree is array computable iff it is c.e.-traceable.</p><p>Using this characterization, Ishmukhametov proved the following remarkable theorem.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem 9.8 (Ishmukhametov [53]). A c.e. degree is array computable iff it has a strong minimal cover.</head><p>We can now state Kummer's classification of the c.e. degrees containing complex c.e. sets. Again there is a deep connection with traceability. Theorem 9.9 (Kummer's Gap Theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[72]</ref>). (i) A c.e. degree contains a complex set iff it is array noncomputable. (ii) In addition, if A is c.e. and of array computable degree, then for every unbounded, nondecreasing, total computable function f,</p><formula xml:id="formula_72">C (A n) log n + f(n) + O(1).</formula><p>(iii) Hence the c.e. degrees exhibit the following gap phenomenon: for each c.e. degree a, either (a) there is a c.e. set A ∈ a such that C (A n) 2 log n -O(1) for infinitely many n, or (b) there are no c.e. set A ∈ a and ε &gt; 0 such that C (A n) (1 + ε) log n -O(1) for infinitely many n. Thus we have the remarkable fact that a c.e. degree contains a c.e. set whose initial segment complexity is as large as possible iff it has a strong minimal cover! In Theorem 10.30 we will see that the degrees containing Kummer complex c.e. sets are the same as those containing sets that are random relative to a variation of Kurtz randomness. It is natural to ask whether there is a classification of, say, all jump classes in terms of initial segment complexity. §10. Other notions of algorithmic randomness. We now return to our consideration of the basic definition of randomness. We have seen that the three approaches (through measure theory, unpredictability, and incompressibility) all yield the same notion of randomness. But consider the characterization of 1-randomness in terms of martingales, namely that no computably enumerable martingale succeeds on the given set. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[117]</ref>, Schnorr gave this characterization, then analyzed it. He argued that it demonstrates a clear failure of the intuition behind the notion of Martin-L öf randomness. He argued that randomness should be concerned with defeating computable strategies rather than computably enumerable ones, since the latter are fundamentally asymmetric, in the same way that a c.e. set is semi-decidable rather than decidable. We can make a similar argument about Martin-L öf tests being effectively null (in the sense that we know how fast they converge to zero), but not effectively given, in the sense that the test sets V n themselves are not computable, but rather c.e. (The discussion may have been obscured by the fact that for a Martin-L öf test {V n } n∈ , the sets V n can always be chosen to be computable (as sets of finite initial segments). However, their measures are not necessarily computable.)</p><p>Armed with this fundamental insight, and following Schnorr <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[117]</ref>, we will look at two notions of randomness that refine the notion of Martin-L öf randomness. Both notions are natural, one being inspired by the measuretheoretic approach and the other by the martingale approach. The first notion we introduce is most naturally defined using tests.</p><p>Definition 10.1 <ref type="bibr">(Schnorr [117]</ref>). (i) We say that a Martin-L öf test</p><formula xml:id="formula_73">{V n } n∈ is a Schnorr test if (V n ) = 2 -n</formula><p>for all n. In this case we call any subset of n V n a Schnorr null set.</p><formula xml:id="formula_74">(ii) A set A is Schnorr random if A / ∈ n V n for all Schnorr tests {V n } n∈ .</formula><p>In his original version of Definition 10.1, Schnorr only required that the numbers (V n ) be uniformly computable, which is easily seen to yield the same notions of null set and random set as the definition given here. When dealing with Schnorr randomness, we will use whichever version of the definition is most convenient.</p><p>Our next notion of randomness is based on computable martingales. Definition 10.2 <ref type="bibr">(Schnorr [117]</ref>). (i) A martingale f : 2 &lt; → R + ∪ {0} is computable if its values f( ) are uniformly computable reals. (ii) A set A is computably random if no computable martingale succeeds on A.</p><p>Schnorr proved that we can take the range of the martingales in the definition of computable randomness to be the non-negative rationals Q + ∪ {0}. <ref type="bibr">Lemma 10.3 (Schnorr [117]</ref>). For each computable martingale F there is a computable martingale f :</p><formula xml:id="formula_75">2 &lt; → Q + ∪ {0} such that S[F ] = S[f].</formula><p>The notion of computable randomness has enjoyed considerable popularity in complexity theory since it naturally admits complexity-theoretic versions, such as polynomial time randomness, which can be used to explore both randomness and Hausdorff dimension in small complexity classes. For more discussion and references, see Lutz <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">81]</ref> and Ambos-Spies and Kučera <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>It is clear that Martin-L öf random implies computably random, and Theorem 10.5 below shows that computably random implies Schnorr random. Neither of these implications can be reversed. That there are computably random sets that are not Martin-L öf random was proved by Schnorr <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[117]</ref>, and that there are Schnorr random sets that are not computably random was proved by Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[138]</ref>. (See also Section 15.3.) The precise separation of these concepts in terms of Turing degrees was determined by Nies, Stephan, and Terwijn <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[105]</ref>; see Theorem 10. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref>.</p><p>We remark that a natural algorithmic randomness notion C ought to be invariant under a computable rearrangement of the bits. Thus one should have Z ∈ C → (Z) ∈ C for any computable permutation . For Martin-L öf and Schnorr randomness this is clear, since the underlying test concepts are invariant under such permutations, and likewise for Kurtz randomness (defined in Section 10.3). Merkle, Miller, Nies, Reimann, and Stephan <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[90]</ref> showed that closure under computable permutations also holds for computable randomness.</p><p>10.1. Schnorr randomness. Although the critique in Schnorr's book <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[117]</ref> was subtle and well-put, the notion of Schnorr randomness initially did not attract the attention that it deserved. Perhaps part of the reason was that Martin-L öf randomness was good enough for many results. Another reason was that the notion is much less tractable than Martin-L öf randomness. For instance, Schnorr proved that there is no universal Schnorr test. Many basic questions remained open for a long time. For instance, one of the cornerstones of the theory of 1-randomness is that the three characterizations, via machine incompressibility, tests, and martingales, all coincide, and hence the notion of 1-randomness is mathematically robust. It is thus interesting to ask whether similar equivalent characterizations exist for the notions of randomness proposed by Schnorr.</p><p>Schnorr gave the following martingale characterization of Schnorr randomness. The crucial notion is that of an order. Definition 10.4 (Schnorr <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[117]</ref>). An order is an unbounded nondecreasing function h : N → N. (Note that an "Ordnungsfunktion" in Schnorr's terminology is always computable, whereas we prefer to leave the complexity of orders unspecified in general.) For a martingale d and an order h we define</p><formula xml:id="formula_76">S h [d ] := {X : lim sup n→∞ d (X n) h(n) 1}.</formula><p>Schnorr pointed out that the rate of success of a c.e. martingale d can be so slow that it cannot be computably detected. Thus, rather than working with null sets contained in sets of the form S[d ] with d ∈ Σ 0 1 , he worked with null sets contained in sets of the form S h <ref type="bibr">[d ]</ref> where both d and h are computable. He showed that these null sets are the same as the Schnorr null sets from Definition 10.1. The following result gives Schnorr's characterization of Schnorr randomness in terms of computable martingales and the "speed of success". (Note that it implies that every computably random set is Schnorr random.) Theorem 10.5 (Schnorr [117, Sätze 9.4, 9.5]). A ⊆ 2 is Schnorr null iff there are computable functions d and h such that A ⊆ S h <ref type="bibr">[d ]</ref>.</p><p>It had been a longstanding open problem to provide a machine characterization for Schnorr randomness.

A total Solovay test is a computable collection of c.e. open sets {V i } i∈ such that i (V i ) is finite and computable. A set A passes this total Solovay test if A ∈ V i for at most finitely many i.

A set is Schnorr random iff it passes all total Solovay tests.</p><p>The Kučera-Slaman Theorem 4.6 shows that all 1-random left-c.e. reals are wtt-complete, since they are Solovay-complete. (As we have seen in Theorem 4.1, Kučera <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[67]</ref> was the first to prove that they are all Turing complete.) There is also a characterization of the Turing degrees of Schnorr random left-c.e. reals: Downey and Griffiths <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref> proved that every Schnorr random left-c.e. real has high Turing degree, and they also proved that there is a Turing incomplete Schnorr random left-c.e. real. Later, Downey, Griffiths, and LaForte <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref> proved that every high c.e. Turing degree contains a Schnorr random left-c.e. real.

Computable randomness. It is not hard to prove that there is no computable enumeration of all computable martingales. Thus, as with Schnorr randomness, arguments about computable randomness need to deal with Π 0 2 behavior. We have already noted that there is a computably random set that is not Martin-L öf random. <ref type="bibr">Wang [139]</ref> proved that there is also a Schnorr random set that is not computably random. Downey, Griffiths, and LaForte <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>, and independently Nies, Stephan, and Terwijn <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[105]</ref>, showed that this also holds for left-c.e. reals. The following theorem shows precisely how complex it is to separate these randomness notions. Theorem 10.13 (Nies, Stephan, and Terwijn <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[105]</ref>). For every set A, the following are equivalent.</p><p>(i) A is high. Proof. We only prove that ¬(i) ⇒ ¬(ii) ∧ ¬(iii). For the other implications, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[105]</ref>. Let A be a nonhigh set that is not Martin-L öf random. Let {U i } i∈ be the universal Martin-L öf test. We show that A is not Schnorr random, and hence also not computably random. Let f be the function that tells us when A is covered by the U i . That is, f(i) is the first stage at which an initial segment of A enters U i . Notice that f is A-computable. Let g be a computable function that is infinitely often larger than f (which exists because A is not high). We can define a Schnorr test {V n } n∈ by stopping the enumeration of each U n after g(n) many steps to obtain V n . Then every V n is finitely presented, so {V n } n∈ is a Schnorr test, and A is in V n for infinitely many n, which is sufficient to show that A is not Schnorr random (since we can convert the Schnorr test {V n } n∈ into a Schnorr test { Ṽn } n∈ covering just as much and with the additional property that Ṽn+1 ⊆ Ṽn , by letting Ṽn = m&gt;n V m ).</p><formula xml:id="formula_80">(ii) ∃B ≡ T A s.t</formula><p>We finish this section by mentioning that there is a measure-theoretic characterization (which could be turned into a machine characterization) of computable randomness.

Theorem 8.10). They obtained a partial characterization in terms of two well-known classes of degrees. The PA-degrees are the degrees of complete extensions of Peano Arithmetic. This is an important class of degrees, with many equivalent definitions. For instance, a degree d is a PA-degree iff every computable infinite binary tree has a d-computable infinite path. (More generally, we say that d is a PA-degree relative to A if every A-computable infinite binary tree has a d-computable infinite path.) The PA-degrees are also those that contain {0, 1}-valued total functions f that are diagonally noncomputable, in the sense that ∀e [Φ e (e) = f(e)]. The class of PA-degrees is strictly contained in the class of diagonally noncomputable (DNC) degrees, which are those that contain (not necessarily {0, 1}-valued) diagonally noncomputable functions. Theorem 10.16 (Hirschfeldt, Nies, and Stephan <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[50]</ref>). (i) If a Δ 0 2 set does not have DNC degree then it is a basis for computable randomness. (ii) No set of PA-degree is a basis for computable randomness. The proof of the second part of Theorem 10.16 uses a lemma of independent interest: If A has PA-degree relative to B and X is computably random relative to A, then X is 1-random relative to B.</p><p>Let A be an n-c.e. set. If A is Turing incomplete then A does not have diagonally noncomputable degree, by Jockusch, Lerman, Soare and Solovay <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[56]</ref> (which extends Arslanov's Completeness Criterion). So A is a basis for computable randomness. On the other hand, if A is Turing complete then A has PA-degree, and hence is not a basis for computable randomness. Thus we have the following result.</p><p>Corollary 10.17 (Hirschfeldt, Nies, and Stephan <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[50]</ref>). An n-c.e. set is a basis for computable randomness iff it is Turing incomplete.</p><p>It would be interesting to investigate bases for other notions such as Schnorr and Kurtz randomness.</p><p>10.3. Kurtz randomness. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[73]</ref>, Kurtz introduced a new notion of randomness which looks at the idea from another perspective. Namely, instead of thinking of a set as random if it avoids all effectively given null sets, Kurtz suggested that a set should be considered random if it obeys every effectively given test of measure 1.</p><p>Definition 10.18 <ref type="bibr">(Kurtz [73]</ref>). (i) A Kurtz (positive) test is a c.e. open set U such that (U ) = 1. (ii) A set is called Kurtz random (or weakly 1-random) if A ∈ U for all Kurtz tests U .</p><p>Kurtz originally called this notion weak randomness, and it is a weak notion in that, as shown by Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[138]</ref>, it is not stochastic in the sense of Church. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">5</ref>It is nevertheless a very interesting concept, especially in its relativized form. As we will see in Section 12, Kurtz 2-randomness, which means being in every Σ 0 2 open set of measure 1, is equivalent to passing every "generalized" Martin-L öf test {U n } n∈ , where we still have (U n ) → 0, but there may be no decreasing computable upper bound on the measures.</p><p>Most of the definitions of tests so far have been negative.

A set A is not Kurtz random iff there exist a computable martingale d and a nondecreasing unbounded computable function h such that d (A n) &gt; h(n) for all n.</head><p>Because of this result we easily see that Schnorr randomness implies Kurtz randomness. No Kurtz random set can be a c.e. set. In fact: Theorem 10.22 (Jockusch, see Kurtz <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[73]</ref>).

Downey, Griffiths, and Reid <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref> gave a machine characterization of Kurtz randomness in the style of Theorem 10.7. Definition 10.24 (Downey, Griffiths, and Reid <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>).

Using such a characterization, Downey, Griffiths, and Reid <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref> provided a characterization of Schnorr randomness in terms of Kurtz randomness.</p><p>Kurtz positive tests can also be used to define 1-randomness, if the speed of enumeration is also taken into account.</p><p>Theorem 10.27 (Davie <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>). A set A is 1-random iff there is a constant c such that for each p, if the p-th computable sequence of intervals I 1 , I 2 , . . . is such that ( j I j ) = 1, then there is an n with A ∈ I n and ( j n I j ) &lt; 1 -2 -|p|-c . 10.4. Kolmogorov-Loveland randomness. The computable betting strategies (martingales) used to define computable randomness are monotonic, in the sense that they bet on the bit positions in their natural order. Dropping this monotonicity condition yields a more powerful notion of betting strategy.</p><p>We give an informal version of the definition in Muchnik, Semenov, and Uspensky <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[97]</ref>. See also Merkle, Miller, Nies, Reimann, and Stephan <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[90]</ref> for a more formal definition. A nonmonotonic betting strategy behaves as follows. Given a set A, at stage s suppose the previously scanned bit positions are n 0 , . . . , n s-1 and the corresponding values are r i = A(n i ). From n 0 , . . . , n s-1 and r 0 , . . . , r s-1 , the strategy determines a new position n s = n 0 , . . . , n s-1 , or may choose to be undefined. If defined, it also chooses an i &lt; 2 and makes a bet v ∈ Q with 0 v V on A(n s ) being equal to i, where V is the current capital (if s = 0, then V &gt; 0 is the initial capital). If the bet turns out right, then v is added to the capital; otherwise it is subtracted. A set A is Kolmogorov-Loveland random (KL-random) if no computable nonmonotonic betting strategy succeeds on A, in the sense that the limsup of the capital it obtains by betting on A is infinity. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[97]</ref> such sets are called unpredictable, and they have also been called nonmonotonically random. Clearly, KL-random sets are computably random, since computable martingales are a particular kind of nonmonotonic betting strategy. In fact, if A is KL-random then no partial computable martingale succeeds on A. However, by results in Muchnik, Semenov, and Uspensky <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[97]</ref>, the converse is not true; that is, there are non-KL-random sets on which no partial computable martingale succeeds.</p><p>Muchnik, Semenov, and Uspensky <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[97]</ref> showed that every 1-random set is KL-random. Whether the converse holds is a major open problem.</p><p>Question 10.28. Is every KL-random set 1-random? While we allow partial betting strategies, we could as well require them to be total: Merkle (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[90]</ref>) proved that for each nonmonotonic betting strategy M there exist total (even primitive recursive) nonmonotonic betting strategies L 0 , L 1 such that, if M succeeds on A, then one of L 0 , L 1 succeeds on A. Thus if the answer to Question 10.28 is affirmative, then one might argue that Schnorr's critique of 1-randomness ceases to apply, as we will then have a characterization of 1-randomness based on computable strategies. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">6</ref>However, presently we do not even know whether the inclusion holds for leftc.e. reals. Several results have been obtained suggesting that KL-randomness is at least close to 1-randomness. Muchnik (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[97,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 9</ref>.1]) showed that if there is an unbounded computable function d such that K(A n) nd (n) for all but finitely many n, then A is not KL-random. (In fact the weaker hypothesis that ∀n</p><formula xml:id="formula_90">[K(A g(n)) g(n) -n],</formula><p>where g is an unbounded computable function, suffices.)</p><p>Merkle, Miller, Nies, Reimann, and Stephan <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[90]</ref> showed that if A = A 0 ⊕ A 1 is KL-random, then at least one of A 0 , A 1 is 1-random, and in fact both are if A is Δ 0 2 . Extending this argument shows that lim inf n (K(A n)/ n) = 1 (i.e., the effective Hausdorff dimension<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">7</ref> of A is 1); see <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[90]</ref>. On the other hand, Merkle <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[87]</ref> showed that the effective Hausdorff dimension of a set on which no partial computable martingale succeeds is not necessarily 1. All of these results on KL-randomness are proved by constructing several strategies, one of which succeeds. The problem in answering Question 10.28 seems to be to understand the interplay between such strategies. A possible approach to answering this question might be to first investigate (apparently) weaker versions of KL-randomness, such as permutation randomness and injective randomness. For the definitions and a discussion of these notions, see Miller and Nies <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[93]</ref>.</p><p>It follows from Theorem 11.12 below that every set that is low for KLrandomness is K-trivial. 10.5. Finite randomness. The notions above would seem to indicate that all of the randomness notions are linearly ordered in strength. We briefly mention a further randomness notion <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">8</ref> which shows that this may not always be the case. A finite test {U n } n∈ is a Martin-L öf test where each U n is a finitely presented open set. For example, a Kurtz null test is finite. We say that A is finitely random if it passes all finite tests. It is not hard to see that a Δ 0 2 set is Martin-L öf random iff it is finitely random. We say that a finite test {U n } n∈ is computably bounded if the U n are presented by sets P n for which there is a computable function g such that |P n | &lt; g(n). We say that A is computably finitely random if it passes all computably bounded tests.</p><p>Theorem 10.29 <ref type="bibr">(Downey,</ref><ref type="bibr">Miller,</ref><ref type="bibr">and Reimann [44]</ref>). (i) Martin-Löf randomness implies finite randomness, but not conversely.</p><p>However, finite randomness and computably finite randomness neither imply nor are implied by either Schnorr or computable randomness. (ii) On the left-c.e. reals, (i) remains true, except that finite randomness coincides with Martin-Löf randomness. Once again we see a connection with traceability and array noncomputability:</p><p>Theorem 10.30 <ref type="bibr">(Downey,</ref><ref type="bibr">Miller,</ref><ref type="bibr">and Reimann [44]</ref>). If a left-c.e. real is computably finitely random then it is array noncomputable. §11. Lowness properties revisited. Recall that in Section 7 a set A was called low for a class C if C = C A . When discussing lowness for randomness notions, one has two options. For Schnorr randomness, for instance, one can look at sets A that are low for the Schnorr null sets (called S 0 -low in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>), meaning that every set that is Schnorr null relative to A is Schnorr null, or one can look at the potentially larger class of sets A that are low for Schnorr randomness, meaning that every Schnorr random set is Schnorr random relative to A. In the case of 1-randomness, there is no difference between these notions because there is a universal Martin-L öf test. Ambos-Spies and Kučera [1, Problem 4.5] asked whether the two notions are different for Schnorr randomness. It will follow from Theorem 11.10 below that the answer is no, despite the absence of a universal Schnorr test. For computable randomness, the answer is even easier: the only sets that are low for computable randomness are the computable ones! (See Theorem 11.14.) 11.1. Lowness for Schnorr and Kurtz null sets. One nice aspect of Schnorr randomness is that there is a complete characterization of the sets that are low for Schnorr randomness. As usual, let D n denote the n-th canonical finite set. Definition 11.1 (Terwijn and Zambella <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[133]</ref>; c.f. Definition 7.2). A set A is computably traceable if there is a computable function p (called a bound) such that, for each function g T A, there is a computable function h satisfying, for all n, (i</p><formula xml:id="formula_91">) |D h(n) | p(n) and (ii) g(n) ∈ D h(n) .</formula><p>The following proposition shows that it does not matter what bound p we choose.</p><p>Proposition 11.2 (Terwijn and Zambella <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[133]</ref>). Let A be computably traceable and let p be an unbounded nondecreasing computable function such that p(0) &gt; 0. Then A is computably traceable with bound p.</p><p>A degree is hyperimmune-free if each function of that degree is majorized by some computable function. If A is computably traceable then each function</p><formula xml:id="formula_92">g T A is majorized by the function f(n) = max D h(n)</formula><p>, where h is as in Definition 11.1. Thus every computably traceable set has hyperimmune-free degree. One may think of computable traceability as a uniform version of hyperimmune-freeness. Terwijn and Zambella <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[133]</ref> showed that a simple variation of the standard construction of hyperimmune-free sets by Miller and Martin <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[96]</ref> produces continuum many computably traceable sets.</p><p>Kjos-Hanssen and Nies (unpublished) have recently characterized the computably traceable sets within the class of sets of hyperimmune-free degree using prefix-free complexity. Definition 11.3 (Kjos-Hanssen and Nies (unpublished)). (i) A set A is weakly c.e. traceable if Definition 7.2 holds for the computably bounded A-computable functions; that is, if there is a bound p such that for every f T A that is majorized by some computable function, there is a c.e. trace for f with bound p (as before, the choice of bound does not matter). (ii) A set X is facile if for every nondecreasing unbounded computable function h, for almost all n we have K(X n | n) h(n).</p><p>Proposition 11.4 (Kjos-Hanssen and Nies (unpublished)). A set A is weakly c.e. traceable iff every set X T A is facile.</p><p>Thus every computably traceable set is facile. Conversely, suppose that A has hyperimmune-free degree and is facile. It is not hard to see that the facile sets are closed downwards under wtt-reducibility, but Turing reducibility implies wtt-reducibility within the hyperimmune-free degrees, so every Acomputable set is facile. Thus by Proposition 11.4, A is weakly c.e. traceable, and hence c.e. traceable (since every A-computable function is computably bounded). But as shown below in step 2 of the proof of part (ii) of Theorem 11.10, we can use the fact that A has hyperimmune-free degree to convert a c.e. trace into a computable trace, so A is computably traceable. Thus we have the following corollary.</p><p>Corollary 11.5. Suppose that A has hyperimmune-free degree. Then A is computably traceable iff A is facile.</p><p>Remarkably, the class of sets that are low for the Schnorr null sets is characterized by the purely computability-theoretic property of computable traceability.</p><p>Theorem 11.6 (Terwijn and Zambella <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[133]</ref>). A set is low for the Schnorr null sets iff it is computably traceable.</p><p>One direction of the proof of Theorem 11.6 relies on ideas of Raisonnier <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[109]</ref> on rapid filters for the "mathematical" proof of Shelah's theorem that the inaccessible cardinal cannot be removed from Solovay's <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[124]</ref> construction of a model of set theory where every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable.</p><p>Interestingly, we have the following fact about the degrees of sets that are low for Schnorr randomness (which was proved by Terwijn and Zambella <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[133]</ref> for the sets that are low for the Schnorr null sets, before it was known that these two classes are the same).</p><p>Theorem 11.7 (Terwijn and Zambella <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[133]</ref>). The degrees of sets that are low for Schnorr randomness are a proper subclass of the hyperimmune-free degrees, and hence, except for 0, none of them are Δ 0 2 . In particular, the degrees of noncomputable sets that are low for 1-randomness and the degrees of noncomputable sets that are low Schnorr randomness are disjoint.</p><p>Recently, an easier result relating a lowness notion to the computably traceable and hyperimmune-free degrees was obtained by Downey, Griffiths, and Reid <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>. We give the proof below since it is representative of the much more difficult proof of Theorem 11.6. A Kurtz null set is any subset of the intersection of a Kurtz null test (see <ref type="bibr">Definition 10.19)</ref>. A set A is low for the Kurtz null sets if every Kurtz null set relative to A is Kurtz null. It is currently not known whether being low for the Kurtz null sets is equivalent to being low for Kurtz randomness. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">9</ref>Theorem 11.8 (Downey, Griffiths, and Reid <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>).

The Kurtz null set n U n contains all sets with a 1 at bits g(1) + 1, g(1) + g(2) + 2, etc., so V 1 must also contain all such sets. Since (V 1 ) 1/2, there must be some k such that V 1 does not contain all sets with k-th bit 0, and this k must be one of g(1)+1, g(1)+g(2)+2, . . . . Notice that because {V n } n∈ is a Kurtz null test, we can effectively find such a k. Now letting f(1) = k, we have f(1) &gt; g <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</p><p>Since (V 2 ) 1/4, there must be k 1 &lt; k 2 such that V 2 does not contain all sets with k 1 -th bit 0, and also does not contain all sets with k 1 -th bit 1 and k 2 -th bit 0. Again, k 1 and k 2 are among g(1) + 1, g(1) + g(2) + 2, . . . , so letting f(2) = k 2 , we have f(2) &gt; g <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. We can continue this process to define a computable function f dominating g. Let MLRand, CRand and SRand denote the classes of 1-random, computably random, and Schnorr random sets, respectively. Then, for instance, Low(MLRand, CRand) is the class of sets A such that every 1-random set is computably random relative A. We want to characterize lowness for any pair of randomness notions.</p><p>Recall from Definition 7.2 that a set A is c.e.-traceable if there is a computable p such that for every function f T A, there is a computable function h such that for all n, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_95">|W h(n) | p(n) and f(n) ∈ W h(n) .</formula><p>We have seen that both c.e.-traceability and computable traceability, defined in the previous subsection, are deeply related to lowness notions. The following result expands on this relationship. Theorem 11.10 (Kjos-Hanssen, Nies, and Stephan <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[63]</ref>). (i) A set is in Low(MLRand, SRand) iff it is c.e.-traceable. (ii) A set is in Low(CRand, SRand) iff it is computably traceable.</p><p>Proof Sketch. (i) Notice that A ∈ Low(MLRand, SRand) iff every Schnorr null set relative to A is contained in the intersection of the universal Martin-L öf test. This already looks quite similar to "there is a c.e. trace for the functions computable in A". We obtain (i) by modifying the methods in Terwijn and Zambella <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[133]</ref> to the case of c.e. traces instead of computable ones.</p><p>(ii) Because of Theorem 11.6, it only remains to be shown that every set in Low(CRand, SRand) is computably traceable.</p><p>1. The first step was made by Bedregal and Nies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">63]</ref>, who proved that every set in Low(CRand, SRand) has hyperimmune-free degree. To see this, assume that A has hyperimmune degree, so that there is a function g T A not dominated by any computable function. Use g to define an A-computable martingale that succeeds in the sense of Schnorr, with the computable lower bound n/4, on some Z ∈ CRand. The construction of this martingale uses the fact that g is infinitely often above the running time of each computable martingale. Special care has to be taken with partial martingales, which results in a set Z that is only Δ 0 3 . 2. Next we use the fact that if A has hyperimmune-free degree and is c.e.-traceable, then A is computably traceable. To see this, let f T A and let h be as in the definition of c.e.-traceability. Let g(n) be the least s such that f(n) ∈ W h(n),s . Then g T A and so, since A is hyperimmune-free, g is majorized by a computable function r. So if we choose a computable function h such that D e h(n) = W h(n),r(n) for all n, then we obtain a computable trace for A. We have seen that K-triviality is equivalent to lowness for 1-randomness. Nies <ref type="bibr">[100]</ref> showed that K-triviality already follows from the weaker hypothesis of being in Low(MLRand, CRand). (One consequence of this result is that every set that is low for Kolmogorov-Loveland randomness is K-trivial. Nothing about this class of sets is known beyond that.) Theorem 11.12 (Nies [100]). A set is Low(MLRand, CRand) iff it is Ktrivial.</p><p>Proof Sketch. The "if" direction has been discussed in Section 8. For the remaining direction, suppose that A ∈ Low(MLRand, CRand). Then for every set Z, if N is an A-computable martingale that succeeds on Z, then Z / ∈ MLRand. We first show that this fact implies a certain condition on finite strings. Let R be any c.e. open set such that (R) &lt; 1 and all sets in the complement of R are 1-random (for instance, let R = { : ∃</p><formula xml:id="formula_96">[K( ) | | -1]}).</formula><p>The following condition expresses the failure to build a set / ∈ R on which N succeeds.

Otherwise one could inductively build a sequence of strings 0 ≺</p><formula xml:id="formula_98">1 ≺ • • • such that [ i ]</formula><p>R and N ( i ) 2 i , which would imply that N succeeds on the set Z = n n , which is not in R, since R is open.</p><p>Note that [ ] R implies that the relative measure (R) = 2 | | (R∩[ ]) is less than 1 (otherwise let X / ∈ R be a set extending ; then X is a 1-random set in a Π 0 1 -class of measure 0, which is impossible). As in the proof of Theorem 7.6, we want to enumerate a Kraft-Chaitin set W showing that A is K-trivial, in the sense that for each n there is a request r, A n ∈ W with r K(n) + O <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Recall that in that proof, the Kraft-Chaitin set (which was called L d ) depended on a number d such that Ω / ∈ R A d . This time the Kraft-Chaitin set W depends on a witness , d, u for Lemma 11.13, where u is a number such that 2 -u 1 -(R). We build a Turing functional L such that L X is a martingale for each set X . We first pretend that we know a witness , d, u for Lemma 11.13 with N = L A .</p><p>We have to approximate the possible initial segments A n to make W c.e., and need to be careful not to make too many errors, since otherwise W will not be a Kraft-Chaitin set. Roughly speaking, we work with a computable sequence of finite trees {T s } s∈ , where at each stage s, strings on T s represent the possible initial segments of A of length s. The tree T s checks whether condition (1) holds at stage s: if for some we have defined L ( ) 2 d for a string on a previous tree T t with t &lt; s, then is only allowed to be on the present tree</p><formula xml:id="formula_99">T s if [ ] ⊆ R s .</formula><p>A procedure α is a pair , , where , ∈ 2 &lt; . We start α when there is a stage s such that ∈ T s and U s ( ) = | |, where U is the universal prefix-free machine used to define K. Now α wants to put r + c, into W , where r = | | (and c is an appropriate constant), as this would result in r+c) to enter R. Basically, α chooses a clopen set C = C (α) of that measure, which is disjoint from R s and the sets chosen by other procedures, and causes (in a way to be specified below) L X ( ) 2 d for each X and each string ∈ C of minimal length. If at a stage t &gt; s we once again have ∈ T t , then C ⊆ R t , and α now has permission to put r + c, into W . In short, the weight of requests put into W is accounted against the measure of new enumerations into R. If the sets belonging to different procedures are disjoint, then W is a Kraft-Chaitin set.</p><formula xml:id="formula_100">K( ) r + O(1). First, α causes a clopen set C ⊆ [ ] of relative measure (C ) = 2 -(</formula><p>We discuss how to guarantee this disjointness. Suppose = α is a procedure that wants to choose its set C ( ) at a stage s &gt; s. If is in some T q with s &lt; q &lt; s , then C (α) ⊆ R s , so there is no problem, since chooses its set disjoint from R s . However, if has not appeared in any such tree (and it possibly never will), then α wants to keep C (α) away from possible assignment to other procedures, which may cause a conflict because C (α) is relatively large. The solution to this problem is to build up the set C (α) in small portions D, whose measure is a fixed fraction of 2 -(r+c) , and only assign a new set D once the old one is in R. If always reappears on a tree after such a set is assigned, then eventually C (α) reaches the required measure 2 -(r+c) , in which case α is allowed to enumerate the request r +c, into W . Otherwise, α keeps away from assignment to other procedures only a single set D, whose measure is so small that the union (over all procedures) of the measures of sets kept away in this fashion is at most the small quantity 2 -u-2 .</p><p>To ensure that L X ( ) 2 d for each X , the procedure α = , acts as follows. Once U s ( ) = | |, it claims ε = 2 -r of the initial capital 1 of L at the root node (recall that r = | |), and generally preserves it along both extensions of a string. It chooses its strings of the form 0 r+d +1 , where is a string where the capital claimed by α is still available. At it "withdraws" this capital, by defining L ( 0) = L ( )+ε and, to maintain the martingale property, L ( 1) = L ( )ε. From 0 on, it doubles the capital along , always betting all the capital on 0, thus eventually reaching an increase of 2 d at .</p><p>Different procedures , and , have to choose their sets D to be disjoint, but there is no conflict as far as the capital is concerned: if , are incompatible, then they refer to different martingales L X . Otherwise they claim different amounts of the initial capital. For any L X , the total capital claimed is at most Ω, as a procedure , with ≺ X claims 2 -| | much of the capital only once U ( ) converges, and there is at most one such procedure for each .</p><p>Finally, as a witness for Lemma 11.13 is not actually known, we do the above for each possible witness , d, u . Let { m , d m , u m } m∈ be an effective listing of such witnesses. For each m we build a martingale functional L X m as above, but now with initial capital 2 -m , and make it eventually constant if it turns out that m (R s ) &gt; 1 -2 -um for some s. We now have to choose of the form 0 m+r+d +1 to make up for the smaller capital. Now simply let L = m L m . Since A ∈ Low(MLRand, CRand), Lemma 11.13 holds for N = L A , via a witness m , d m , u m . Now (1) holds for N = L A m , since L A L A m . Thus each ≺ A reappears infinitely often on the trees T s , and so the "accounting against" trick outlined in the proof of Theorem 7.6 allows us to define the desired Kraft-Chaitin set W (where the constant c is d m + m + u m + 3).</p><p>We have seen characterizations of lowness for 1-randomness and Schnorr randomness. These results raise the question of characterizing lowness for computable randomness. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">Problem 4.8]</ref>, Ambos-Spies and Kučera asked whether there is a noncomputable set that is low for computable randomness. Downey conjectured that the answer is negative, and this conjecture was confirmed by <ref type="bibr">Nies [100]</ref>.</p><p>Theorem 11.14 <ref type="bibr">(Nies [100]</ref>). A set is low for computable randomness iff it is computable.</p><p>The proof in [100] is a direct argument similar to but preceding the proof of Theorem 11.12 discussed above. But we can also use Theorem 11.12: Suppose that A is low for computable randomness. Then A ∈ Low(MLRand, CRand), and hence A is K-trivial, and thus Δ 0 2 . On the other hand, by a result of Bedregal and Nies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, A has hyperimmune-free degree. But the only Δ 0 2 sets of hyperimmune-free degree are the computable ones, by Miller and Martin <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[96]</ref>.</p><p>The original proof has the advantage of being extendible to the resource bounded setting, and also to show that each set in Low(PrecRand, CRand) is computable. Here PrecRand is the class of sets on which no partial computable martingale succeeds (i.e., no martingale whose values are uniformly computable, but that may choose to be undefined on strings off the given set). §12. Relativized randomness. We have so far focused on 1-randomness and weaker notions. We can also obtain stronger notions of randomness by increasing the complexity of tests in terms of the arithmetical hierarchy. These notions are of particular interest when we study the relationship between randomness and Turing degrees. The basic result connecting 1randomness to Turing reducibility is the celebrated one often attributed only to Gács, but actually first proved by Kučera.</p><p>Theorem 12.1 (Kučera <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[67]</ref>, Gács <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[47]</ref>). Every set is wtt-reducible to a 1random set.</p><p>The easiest proof of Theorem 12.1 is the recent one of Merkle and Mihailović <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[88]</ref>. That proof shows that the bound on the wtt-reduction can be taken to be n + o(n). However, this bound cannot be improved to n + O(1); that is, there are sets that are not sw-reducible to a 1-random set (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref> for a proof). It is an open question whether every set is rK-reducible (or even K-reducible) to a 1-random set. Other results on the Turing degrees of 1-random sets include Kučera's theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[67]</ref> that all degrees above 0 contain 1-random sets. As noted in Section 4, for each c, the collection of sets with initial segment prefix-free complexity nc for all n is a Π 0 1 -class, so there are 1-random sets of low Turing degree. Kučera <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[67]</ref> proved that the Δ 0 2 degrees containing 1-random sets are not closed upwards. On the other hand, their jumps are better behaved: using a new basis theorem for Π 0 1 -classes with no computable members, Downey and Miller <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[43]</ref> showed that for every S that is c.e. in and above ∅ , there is a Δ 0 2 1-random set A with A ≡ T S. This result was stated earlier by Kučera <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[68]</ref>, who constructed a high incomplete Δ 0 2 1-random set using a similar technique. Kučera also observed that 1-randomness is connected to the PA-degrees, which were discussed in Section 10.2. This connection was recently clarified by Stephan <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[129]</ref>, who proved the following. Theorem 12.2 (Stephan <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[129]</ref>). If X is 1-random and has PA-degree, then ∅ T X .</p><p>The following is another result demonstrating the computational weakness of the 1-random sets that cannot compute ∅ . Theorem 12.3 (Hirschfeldt, Nies, and Stephan <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[50]</ref>). Suppose A is a c.e. set and X T A is 1-random and such that ∅ T X . Then A is K-trivial.</p><p>Theorems 12.2 and 12.3 establish that there are two kinds of 1-random sets. The first are those that are computationally rich and can compute the halting problem. The second are those that are computationally feeble and cannot even compute a {0, 1}-valued diagonally noncomputable function or a non-K-trivial c.e. set. As we see below, this means that all 2-random sets (defined below) are computationally weak.</p><p>The basic definition of 1-randomness can be generalized quite easily. We will use the following definitions, noted by several researchers, such as Solovay [125] and Kurtz <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[73]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_101">Definition 12.4.

(iv) A set is arithmetically random if it is n-random for all n.</p><p>These definitions can be relativized in the same way as 1-randomness, to yield notions such as n-randomness relative to a set X .</p><p>We have identified Σ 0 1 -classes of sets with c.e. sets of strings, since every Σ 0 1 -class is equivalent to {[ ] : ∈ W } for some (prefix-free) c.e. set of strings W . However, we cannot do the same at higher levels of the arithmetical hierarchy. For example, consider the Σ 0 2 -class consisting of those sets that are zero from some point onwards. This Σ 0 2 -class is not equivalent to one of the form {[ ] : ∈ W } for some Σ 0 2 set of strings W . The use of open sets is basic in many arguments involving 1-randomness. Fortunately, this technique can be resurrected for higher-order randomness, as we now see. We denote the n-th jump of ∅ by ∅ (n) .

It is not difficult to see that being Kurtz 2-random coincides with passing all generalized Martin-L öf tests {U n } n∈ , where we have (U n ) → 0, but there may be no computable decreasing bound on (U n ). Thus every Kurtz 2-random set is 1-random. Relativizing this observation and the fact that every 1-random set is Kurtz 1random (see Section 10.3), we see that every n-random set is Kurtz n-random, and every Kurtz (n + 1)-random set is n-random.

Kautz <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[61]</ref> also noted that the effective 0-1 law has an easy but interesting consequence for the theory of the Turing degrees. For a degree a, let Th(D a ) be the theory of the degrees less than or equal to a. For any sentence in the language of degree theory, the class of all A such that ∈ Th(D deg(A) ) is arithmetical, so if a and b are degrees of arithmetically random sets, then Th(D a ) = Th(D b ). A more careful analysis can be made to calculate the level of randomness necessary to ensure the equality of the n-quantifier fragments of these theories.</p><p>There is a wealth of material in this area, and not enough room to present it all. We finish this section by looking at the initial segment complexity of n-random sets, a topic which will also be addressed in the next section. Of course, there is a natural characterization in terms of relativized machines; namely, A is (n+1)-random iff K ∅ (n) (A k) k-O(1). However, one would naturally expect n-and (n + 1)-random sets to have different unrelativized initial segment complexities. This is true for Ω (n) .

For all m = n, the K-degrees of Ω (m)  and Ω (n) have no upper bound. §13. Results of Miller and Yu, and van Lambalgen reducibility. Recently, Joe Miller and Liang Yu <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">94,</ref><ref type="bibr">95]</ref> have proved some remarkable results on the initial segment complexities of random sets, which highlight both the strengths and limitations of initial segment complexity as a measure of relative randomness. Motivated by van Lambalgen's Theorems 12.14 and 12.17, they introduced the following measure of relative randomness.</p><p>(ii) If A ⊕ B is 1-random, then A | K B, and the K-degrees of A and B have no upper bound. Thus there is no join operator on the K-degrees.</p><p>According to Miller and Yu <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[94]</ref>, R. Rettinger independently announced that if</p><formula xml:id="formula_110">A ⊕ B is 1-random then A | K B.</formula><p>Theorem 12.25 follows from the second part of the above result, since if m = n then Ω (m) and Ω (n) are 1-random relative to each other, and hence Ω (m) ⊕ Ω (n) is 1-random.</p><p>Thus we see that, while there is no direct correlation between increasing levels of randomness and increasing K-degrees, there is a relationship between levels of randomness and initial segment complexity.</p><p>Although certain results on vL-reducibility can be transfered to Kreducibility, there are some important differences between these notions. For instance, by part (iii) of Theorem 13.2, every Δ 0 2 1-random set is vL Ω. On the other hand, we have the following result, which shows that if Ω = Ω 0 ⊕Ω 1 then Ω 0 is an example of a Δ 0 2 1-random set K Ω. Theorem 13.5 <ref type="bibr">(Miller and Yu [94]</ref>). If A⊕B is 1-random then A | K A⊕B. An even more significant difference between the vL-degrees and the Kdegrees is that the former are invariant under computable permutations (by part (iii) of Theorem 13.2 and the closure of the notion of 1-randomness under computable permutations), but the latter are not. Theorem 13.6 (Miller and Yu <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[94]</ref>). There is a computable permutation f : → such that for every 1-random set A, the K-degrees of A and f(A) have no upper bound. This result suggests that K-reducibility may be too strong as a measure of relative randomness on the 1-random sets, and that vL-reducibility may be a better measure in this context.</p><p>As pointed out by Miller and Yu <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[94]</ref>, it follows from part (ii) of Theorem 13.2 that if we let Ω n be the n-th column of Ω, then {Ω n : n ∈ } is a vL-antichain, and hence a K-antichain. So we have a concrete example of infinitely many pairwise incomparable K-degrees of 1-random sets. It was a vexing open question whether there are any comparable K-degrees of 1-random sets. <ref type="bibr">Miller and Yu [95]</ref> recently answered this question, making use of a converse to part (ii) of Theorem 3.10, which shows that the Ample Excess Theorem (part (i) of Theorem 3.10) is in a sense tight.

Then lim n K(B n) -K(A n) = ∞. <ref type="bibr">Miller and Yu [95]</ref> showed that it is also possible to ensure additionally that A ⊕ C &lt; K B for all C . As they pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[94]</ref>, if we take a C that is 1-random relative to A, then A ⊕ C is 1-random, and the K-degree of B bounds the K-degrees of A and A ⊕ C , which does away with a possible improvement of Theorem 13.5.</p><p>Using new techniques and extensions of the above methods, Miller proved the following.

(ii) If A and B are 3-random and A K B, then B T A ⊕ ∅ and B T A . As noted by Miller <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[92]</ref>, it follows from part (ii) that the upper cone above the K-degree of a 3-random set is always countable.

(ii) If A is weakly low for K and 1-random, then it is strongly Chaitin random (as defined in <ref type="bibr">Section 12)</ref>. §14. Relativizing Ω. So far when we have looked at relativizations, we have always looked at the "standard way" of forming a universal prefixfree machine (as in the definition of Ω (n) in <ref type="bibr">Section 12)</ref>. Relativization acts strangely on randomness notions, since we are dealing with c.e. operators, but not CEA (computably enumerable in and above) operators. We have already seen this (in Section 8) since, for instance, if A is not GL 1 , or even just not K-trivial, then no set that is 1-random relative to A is Turing above A (Kučera <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[69]</ref>; Hirschfeldt, Nies, and Stephan <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[50]</ref>). In particular, whatever Ω Ω is, Ω T Ω Ω .</p><p>Notice that this means that if we could construe Ω as an invariant operator, meaning that A ≡ T B implies Ω A ≡ T Ω B , then it would be a degree invariant operator that is not the jump or an iterate of the jump, thereby resolving a longstanding conjecture of Martin (see <ref type="bibr">[62, p. 279]</ref>). As we will see below, this is not the case, but given the central role of Ω in this area, it is natural to try to understand it as an operator in the same way that we seek to understand the halting problem, and hence the jump operator, in classical computability theory.</p><p>The first thing we need to understand is what we actually mean when we talk about relativizing Ω. Clearly, any reasonable definition must ensure that Ω X is an X -left-c.e. real and is 1-random relative to X . Furthermore, the definition should be relatively oracle-independent, in the sense that it should only involve machines U such that U X is a universal prefix-free machine relative to X for every oracle X , and the coding constants of prefix-free oracle machines do not depend on the oracle. More precisely, we have the following definitions from <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref>. An oracle machine M is a prefix-free oracle machine if M A is prefix-free for every A ∈ 2 . A prefix-free oracle machine U is universal if for every prefix-free oracle machine M there is a ∈ 2 &lt; such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_115">∀A ∈ 2 ∀ ∈ 2 &lt; [U A ( ) = M A ( )].</formula><p>In other words, U can simulate any prefix-free oracle machine in a way that does not depend on the oracle. Given such a machine, we can define the halting probability</p><formula xml:id="formula_116">Ω A U := U A ( )↓ 2 -| | ,</formula><p>which can be thought of as an operator on 2 ; we call such an operator an Omega operator. Recall Theorems 4.5 and 4.6, which together imply that the only 1-random left-c.e. reals are versions of Ω. We would like to relativize these results. The relativization of Theorem 4.6 is straightforward, but the same is not true of Theorem 4.5. We can relativize the notion of Solovay reducibility in the natural way, and hence talk about X -Solovay complete X -left-c.e. reals. The proof of Theorem 4.5 given above does relativize in the sense that if a real is X -left-c.e. and X -Solovay complete then it is the halting probability of some prefix-free oracle machine M X that is universal with respect to prefix-free machines with oracle X . However, there is no reason to expect that M should be a universal prefix-free oracle machine, since it is unclear how M Y should behave for Y = X .</p><p>However, Downey, Hirschfeldt, Miller, and Nies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref> did show that the relativization of Theorem 4.5 holds. Together with the relativization of Theorem 4.6, this result yields the following theorem. Theorem 14.1 (Downey, Hirschfeldt, Miller, and Nies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref>). The following are equivalent.</p><p>(i) α is an X -left-c.e. real and is 1-random relative to X . (ii) α is an X -left-c.e. real and is X -Solovay complete. (iii) α = Ω X U for some universal prefix-free oracle machine U . This result has some rather counterintuitive consequences for the possible values of Ω X for various oracles X . Let us reconsider n-randomness, that is, 1-randomness relative to ∅ (n-1) . Since every 2-random set is 1-random relative to Ω, it follows from Corollary 12.18 that Ω is 1-random relative to any 2-random set. Furthermore, Ω is a left-c.e. real relative to any oracle. Since any version of Ω Ω is 2-random, we see that Ω is a possible value of Ω relative to Ω Ω .</p><p>Another interesting property of Omega operators is that the class of low 1-random sets is closed under their action. Indeed, let U be a universal prefix-free oracle machine and let A be low and 1-random. Since Ω A U is 1random relative to A, Corollary 12.18 implies that A is 1-random relative to Ω A U . So by Theorem 7.7, Ω A U is GL 1 . But Ω A U is A-left-c.e., and hence is Δ 0 2 . So Ω A U is low. Theorem 14.1 is particularly interesting in light of the following result. Theorem 14.2 (Downey, Hirschfeldt, Miller, and Nies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref>). Let X ∈ 2 be 2-random. Then there is an A ∈ 2 such that X is an A-left-c.e. real and is 1-random relative to A. Thus X = Ω A U for some universal prefix-free oracle machine U .</p><p>So almost every real is a halting probability relative to some set. Furthermore, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref>, for every universal prefix-free oracle machine U , the range of Ω U has positive measure, which implies (by Kolmogorov's 0-1 law mentioned in Section 12) that for almost every X , there is an A such that X = * Ω A U , where we write B = * C to mean that B and C agree on a cofinite set.</p><p>As pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref>, Theorem 14.2 cannot be extended to all 1-random sets, since if 1 -Ω is an A-left-c.e. real then it is A-computable.</p><p>The case where Ω A U is a left-c.e. real is particularly interesting. The following result shows that this is not at all a rare occurrence. §15. Hausdorff dimension and partial randomness. In this section, we look at the following intuitive notion, which provides yet another way to calibrate randomness. Suppose that Ω = .a 1 a 2 . . . . Then we would expect .a 1 0a 2 0 . . . to be " 1  2 -random". To make this notion of partial randomness precise, and describe some results that are very interesting in their own right, we need to detour through the theory of Hausdorff dimension.</p><p>15.1. Classical Hausdorff dimension. First we recall the definition of classical Hausdorff dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[49]</ref>. For comments and discussion see for instance Falconer <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[45]</ref>. In particular, dim(X ∪ Y ) is max{dim(X ), dim(Y )}. 15.2. Effective Hausdorff dimension. We now discuss effectivizations of Hausdorff dimension. There has been a large amount of research in effective dimension, and we only scratch the surface here. In particular, we do not discuss work in effectivizing other types of fractal dimension, such as packing dimension (see Athreya, Hitchcock, Lutz, and Mayordomo <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>). For more on effective dimension theory, see Reimann <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[111]</ref> or Lutz <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[84]</ref>; for results on the complexity of these and related notions, see Hitchcock, Lutz, and Terwijn <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[51]</ref>.</p><p>Recall from Definition 10.4 the null sets of the form S h <ref type="bibr">[d ]</ref>. Schnorr also addressed null sets of exponential order, which have the form S h <ref type="bibr">[d ]</ref> for h(n) = 2 εn with ε ∈ (0, 1]. Although he did not make an explicit reference to Hausdorff dimension, it turns out that the theory of Hausdorff dimension can be cast precisely in terms of such null sets of exponential order.</p><p>Lutz constructivized Hausdorff dimension in <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">83]</ref>, using what he called s-gales (a generalization of martingales). Let s ∈ [0, ∞). An s-gale is a function d : 2 &lt; → R + that satisfies the averaging condition</p><formula xml:id="formula_117">2 s d ( ) = d ( 0) + d ( 1)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>for every ∈ 2 &lt; . (Notice that 1-gales are the same as martingales.) Similarly, d is an s-supergale if (3) holds with instead of equality. The success set S[d ] is defined exactly as was done for martingales in Section 2.2.</p><p>Although the following theorem shows that we do not really need s-gales for the treatment of Hausdorff dimension, it is sometimes convenient to use them. The C-dimension of a set A is the C-dimension of the singleton {A}.</p><p>There is an important connection between Σ 0 1 -dimension and Kolmogorov complexity, which was established in the form given below by Mayordomo <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[86]</ref> and prefigured by Ryabko <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[113,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">114]</ref>, Staiger <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[126,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">127]</ref>, and Cai and Hartmanis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> (see <ref type="bibr">Staiger [128]</ref> for a discussion of these and other related papers).</p><p>Theorem 15.6 (Mayordomo <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[86]</ref>).

That these implications hold follows easily from the definitions. The strictness of the implications in the first column was discussed in Section 10 (except for the fact that there is a Schnorr Δ 0 2 -random set that is not 1-random, which follows immediately from the fact that no Δ 0 2 set can be Schnorr Δ 0 2 -random). That there are no more implications between the first and the second column follows from the next proposition. The strictness of the two implications in the second column follows by similar means. (It is easy to show (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[83]</ref>) that the class of computable sets has Σ 0 1 -dimension 0, but is not computably null, so in particular the class of computable sets has computable dimension 1. Also, Lutz <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[83]</ref> has shown that for every Δ 0 2 real r ∈ [0, 1], there is a Δ 0 2 set of Σ 0 1 -dimension r, but it is obvious that every Δ 0 2 set has Δ 0 2 -dimension 0.) Proposition 15.7 (Terwijn <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[132]</ref>). There are sets that are not Schnorr random but have Δ 0 2 -dimension 1. An important related open question, formulated independently by Reimann and by Terwijn (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[93]</ref>), is whether every set of positive Σ 0 1 -dimension computes a 1-random set. Even if we strengthen the hypothesis to Σ 0 1dimension 1, the question is still open. We can use this notion to define partial Martin-L öf randomness as follows.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>[ ] := {X ∈ 2 : ≺ X }, where ∈ 2 &lt; .

(ii) There is a set of hyperimmune-free degree that is neither computably traceable nor of diagonally noncomputable degree. (iii) If a set is low for weak 1-genericity then it is low for Kurtz randomness. (iv) Thus lowness for weak 1-genericity, and hence lowness for Kurtz randomness, are not the same as lowness for Schnorr randomness.

(i) If A ⊕ B is n-random, then so are A and B. (ii) If A is n-random, then so is A [n] , the n-th column of A.</p><p>Theorem 12.14 (van Lambalgen <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[134]</ref>). If A ⊕ B is n-random, then A is n-random relative to B.</p><p>Corollary 12.15 (Kučera (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[61]</ref>), van Lambalgen <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[134]</ref>).</p><p>Thus every 1-random set X splits into two Turing incomparable halves, both of which are computable in X . So we have the following result.</p><p>Corollary 12.16 <ref type="bibr">(Kurtz [73]</ref>). No 1-random set has minimal degree. Using Theorem 10.13, Yu <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[140]</ref> has recently shown that Theorem 12.14 fails for Schnorr and computable randomness, even for n = 1. Thus this important tool in the theory of 1-randomness is not available in the study of these notions.</p><p>The following is a converse to Theorem 12.14 (which, as pointed out by Yu <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[140]</ref>, does also hold for Schnorr and computable randomness).</p><p>Theorem 12.17 (van Lambalgen <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[134]</ref>). If B is n-random and A is nrandom relative to B, then A ⊕ B is n-random.</p><p>Proof. We give a proof due to Nies. Suppose A ⊕ B is not n-random. We show that either B is not n-random or A is not n-random relative to B. By Theorem 12.5, we can choose a sequence</p><p>Let ∅ be the empty string. We write [ ⊕ ] for the collection of sets X = X 0 ⊕ X 1 such that ≺ X 0 and ≺ X 1 .</p><p>Let</p><p>Clearly, S i+1 ⊆ S i , and the S i are uniformly Σ 0 n open sets. We show that (S i ) 2 -i . Let 0 , 1 , . . . be a listing of the strings that are minimal (under the substring relation) such that (</p><p>The R i are open and uniformly Σ 0 n relative to B, and</p><p>Combining Theorems 12.14 and 12.17, we have the following corollary, which will be useful several times below.</p><p>Corollary 12.18 (van Lambalgen <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[134]</ref>). If B is n-random and A is nrandom relative to B, then B is n-random relative to A.</p><p>The following is an application of this result.</p><p>Theorem 12.19 <ref type="bibr">(Miller and Yu [94]</ref>).</p><p>Proof. We can assume that n 2. Let X ≡ T ∅ (n-1) be 1-random. Since A is n-random, it is 1-random relative to X . So X is 1-random relative to A, and therefore relative to B. Hence B is 1-random relative to X , and thus is n-random.</p><p>By different means, Miller and Yu <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[94]</ref> proved the stronger result that for any X , if A is 1-random relative to X and B T A is 1-random, then B is 1-random relative to X . Theorem 12.20 <ref type="bibr">(Kautz [61]</ref>). If A and B are 2-random relative to each other, then their degrees form a minimal pair.</p><p>Proof. Suppose that 0 &lt; T C T A, B. Let e be such that Φ A e = C . It is easy to check that {X : Φ X e = C } is a Π C 2 -class, and by Theorem 8.11, it has measure 0. So A is not 2-random relative to C , and hence relative to B, contrary to hypothesis. Thus, by Theorem 12.14, every 2-random set is the join of a minimal pair.</p><p>Theorem 12.20 cannot be extended to the n = 1 case. Indeed, Kučera <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[67]</ref> showed that no two Δ 0 2 1-random sets form a minimal pair. However, we have the following consequence of Theorem 8.10.</p><p>Theorem 12.21 (Hirschfeldt, Nies, and Stephan <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[50]</ref>). If A and B are 1random relative to each other, then any X T A, B is K-trivial.</p><p>Proof. Since A is 1-random relative to B, it is 1-random relative to X . So X is a basis for 1-randomness, and thus is K-trivial.</p><p>Randomness is linked to properties of "almost all" degrees. Classically, Kolmogorov's 0-1 law states that any class of sets closed under finite translations has measure 0 or 1 (see e.g., Oxtoby <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[108]</ref>). There is also an effective 0-1 law.</p><p>Lemma 12.22 (Kurtz <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[73]</ref>, Kautz <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[61]</ref>, Kučera for n = 1). Let X be a set, let n 1, and let T be a Π X n -class of positive measure. If A ∈ 2 is n-random relative to X , then there are ∈ 2 &lt; and B ∈ T such that A = B. Thus, for every set A that is n-random relative to X , the class T contains a member Turing equivalent to A.</p><p>Definition 13.1 <ref type="bibr">(Miller and Yu [94]</ref>). We say that A is van Lambalgen reducible to B, and write</p><p>This notion is closely related to one introduced by Nies. In [100, Section 8], Nies defined A LR B if every set that is 1-random relative to B is 1-random relative to A. (So, for instance, A LR ∅ iff A is low for 1-randomness.) Notice that this relation is implied by Turing reducibility. <ref type="bibr">Nies [100]</ref> studied the monotone Σ 0 3 operator LR(B) := {A : A LR B}. He also showed that if A and B are c.e., then A LR B implies A tt B . Moreover, applying the technique of pseudo-jumps from <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[57]</ref> to the c.e. operator given by the construction of a set that is low for 1-randomness, he showed that there is a c.e. set that is Turing incomplete but LR-complete.</p><p>If A and B are both 1-random then Theorems 12.14 and 12.17 imply that</p><p>matter what C is, so the least vL-degree consists of all sets that are not 1-random. Thus vL-reducibility is interesting only on the 1-random sets. It might be fruitful to explore extensions of vL-reducibility that behave nontrivially on the non-1-random sets.</p><p>The following result summarizes some of the basic properties of vLreducibility and the resulting vL-degrees. </p><p>(vii) Every finite partial order can be embedded into the vL-degrees, and hence the Σ 0 1 -theory of the vL-degrees is decidable. One of the attractive features of vL-reducibility is that it can be used to prove results about K-and C -reducibility, in ways that are often easier than dealing directly with these reducibilities. The following result is what allows for the transfer of results from vL-reducibility to K-and C -reducibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theorem 13.3 (Miller and Yu [94]). For any sets A and B, (i) A K B ⇒ A vL B and (ii) A C B ⇒ A vL B.</head><p>We state the following consequences for K-reducibility, but they also hold for C -reducibility.</p><p>Corollary 13.4 (Miller and Yu <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[94]</ref>). (i) If A K B and A is n-random, then B is n-random. Theorem 14.3 (Downey, Hirschfeldt, Miller, and Nies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref>). Let U be a universal prefix-free oracle machine.</p><p>It is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref> that A is low for Ω iff there is a universal prefix-free oracle machine U such that Ω A U is a left-c.e. real. By Theorem 12.8, every 2-random set is low for Ω, so almost every set is taken to a left-c.e. real by some Omega operator.</p><p>Another result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref> is that for any universal prefix-free oracle machine U and any set X , the set of all B such that Ω B U is 1-random relative to X has positive measure. Together with the first part of Theorem 14.3, this gives a resoundingly negative solution to the question of the degree-invariance of Omega operators. Theorem 14.4 (Downey, Hirschfeldt, Miller, and Nies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref>). Let U be a universal prefix-free oracle machine. </p><p>In light of this result, one might wonder whether there are any degrees on which Omega operators are invariant. Once again, the answer is connected with K-triviality. Theorem 14.5 (Downey, Hirschfeldt, Miller, and Nies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref>). Let A ∈ 2 . the following are equivalent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>real. (iii) Every Omega operator is degree invariant on the degree of A.</head><p>There is an example in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref> of an Omega operator that is degree invariant only on the K-trivial degrees. It is not known whether every Omega operator has this property.</p><p>For further properties of Omega operators, including their interesting analytic behavior, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref>.</p><p>Definition 15.8 <ref type="bibr">(Tadaki [130]</ref>). (i) A weak Martin-Löf s-test is a computable collection of c.e. open sets</p><p>We can also define a set A to be weakly <ref type="bibr">Levin</ref> <ref type="formula">1</ref>) for all n. The analog of Schnorr's Theorem 3.8 that Levin-Chaitin random is the same as Martin-L öf random can be established with a similar proof. Theorem 15.9 (Tadaki <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[130]</ref>). A set A is weakly Martin-Löf s-random iff A is weakly Levin-Chaitin s-random.</p><p>Armed with this result, we can emulate the proof that Ω is Levin-Chaitin random to show the following: Theorem 15.10 (Tadaki <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[130]</ref>). Let 0 &lt; s 1 be a computable real and define</p><p>where U is a universal prefix-free machine. Then Ω s is weakly Martin-Löf s-random.</p><p>Similarly, we can construct a universal weak Martin-L öf s-test, and establish similar analogues to results on Martin-L öf randomness.</p><p>This notion squares with our intuition that if A = a 1 a 2 . . . is random then B = a 1 0a 2 0a 2 . . . should be "somewhat" random. Indeed B is weakly Martin-L öf 1  2 -random. To see this suppose that for each d there are infinitely many n such that K(B n) &lt; 1  2 nd . Consider the prefix-free machine M that simulates the universal prefix-free machine U and, when it finds that U ( ) ↓ is of the form b 1 0b 2 0 . . . b n 0, outputs b 1 . . . b n . Then K M (A n) = K(B 2n), so for each c there are infinitely many n such that K M (A n) &lt; nc, and hence A is not 1-random.</p><p>We would like to prove the analogs of our basic results that martingale randomness, test set randomness, and incompressibility all coincide. Unfortunately, the proof breaks down for the martingale case. Consider the proof that if a set is Martin-L öf random then no c.e. martingale succeeds on it. We are given a c.e. martingale d , and when we see d ( ) &gt; 2 k we put into U k . Now imagine we are following the same proof method for the s &lt; 1 case. The problem is that d is only c.e. We might see that d t ( 0) &gt; 2 k and put 0 into V k . At some later stage u &gt; t, we might see that d u ( ) &gt; 2 k . We would like to put into V k , but need to keep the set prefix-free. In the s = 1 case we can do this by putting 1 into V k . But in the s &lt; 1 case, 2(2 -s(| |+1) ) might be much bigger than 2 -s| | .</p><p>Another approach, taken by Lutz <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">83]</ref>, is to define partial randomness using martingales and orders, as in the development of Hausdorff dimension. Recall that Schnorr proved that a set is 1-random iff no c.e. martingale succeeds on A. Now we want to say that no c.e. martingale quickly succeeds on A. Definition 15.11 <ref type="bibr">(Calude,</ref><ref type="bibr">Staiger,</ref><ref type="bibr">and Terwijn [19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">132]</ref>). (i) A strong Martin-Löf s-test is a computable collection of c.e. sets of strings {V k } k∈ (not necessarily prefix-free) such that for all prefix-free subsets Theorem 15.12 (Calude, Staiger, and Terwijn <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">132]</ref>). Fix a computable s with 0 &lt; s 1. Then a set A is strongly Martin-Löf s-random iff A is Schnorr s-random iff A is Lutz s-random.</p><p>It is also possible to give a machine characterization of strong Martin-L öf s-randomness. We say that a machine M is s-measurable if for all prefix-free V ⊆ dom(M ), we have s ( ∈V [ ]) 1.</p><p>Theorem 15.13 (Downey, Reid, and Terwijn (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[110]</ref>)). A set A is strongly Martin-Löf s-random iff K M (A n) n -O(1) for all s-measurable machines M .</p><p>Reimann and Stephan (unpublished; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[112]</ref>) have recently shown that weak Martin-L öf s-randomness does not imply strong Martin-L öf s-randomness.</p></div>			</div>
