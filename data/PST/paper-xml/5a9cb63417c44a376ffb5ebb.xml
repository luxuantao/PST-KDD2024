<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, a priority sorting approach based on simplified model predictive control (MPC) is proposed for modular multilevel converter (MMC). It aims at reducing the computational burden of conventional MPC method while maintaining the system performance, especially under high voltage-levels. The proposed approach mainly consists of three parts, i.e., grid-side current control (GCC), circulating current control (CCC) and capacitor voltage balancing control (CVBC). The GCC and CCC are separately designed with simplified MPCs, avoiding the weight factor. Meanwhile, the redundant calculations are eliminated in GCC by considering the desired predicted output voltage of equivalent MMC model. To further minimize the optional combinations of the switching states, the CCC is constructed by utilizing the output of GCC and the arm current. Besides, a novel priority sorting approach is proposed for the CVBC to alleviate the sorting operation. The sub-modules are divided into three groups according to the detected capacitor voltages. Moreover, the groups are assigned with different priorities based on the arm current, and only one group needs the sorting process. Additionally, a reduced frequency approach is introduced to decrease the power loss in the steady-state.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>HE modular multilevel converter (MMC) consists of several half-or full-bridge sub-modules (SMs) connected in series, generating numerous voltage-levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. With the modular structure, it exhibits the merits of low switching frequency, bidirectional power flow, scalability and high quality of the output voltage <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. These advantages make MMC especially well suitable for medium-and high-voltage applications, such as the high voltage direct current system (HVDC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, reactive power compensator <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and renewable energy system <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Generally speaking, in MMC systems, the grid-side current should be well regulated to its desired value, as it directly affects system's steady-state accuracy and transient performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Besides, the circulating current and the unbalanced voltages among the sub-module (SM) capacitors are also the challenges for MMC <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Therefore, there are three main control tasks for MMC: grid-side current control (GCC), circulating current control (CCC) and capacitor voltage balancing control (CVBC).</p><p>The GCC is analyzed and developed most often based on the linear system theory, where proportional-integral (PI) or proportional-resonant (PR) controllers are usually utilized <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In fact, MMC system is highly nonlinear and has a wide range of operational points. Therefore, it is quite difficult to guarantee its transient performance by applying PI or PR controllers. As a nonlinear approach, MPC gains increasing attention in MMC applications due to its reserved nonlinearity property and flexible control objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In MPC approaches, the best switching states are chosen by optimizing the pre-defined cost function. However, due to multiple objectives, such cost function may consist of several weight factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which are technically hard to be tuned on-line. Besides, it makes the system implementation quite computationally costly. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the number of the considered statuses is N 2N C , where N indicates the SM number of each arm. Obviously, its computational complexity will increase with the voltage-level of MMC. In order to overcome this disadvantage, a finite control set MPC (FCS-MPC) is analyzed and utilized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. However, it is applied to the induction motor drive control rather than MMC. Therefore, the first motivation of this paper is to remove the weight factors and reduce the number of considered statuses.  In MMC system, circulating current usually exists due to the parameter mismatch, switching transients, and unbalanced capacitor voltage of the SMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. It increases the branch currents and consequently produces additional conduction loss to the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In order to suppress the circulating current, several methods have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the accurate impedance angle of the converter leg is estimated to attenuate the circulating current. But it is technically difficult to be implemented. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, two PI controllers are employed to minimize the inner circulating current. However, this approach is designed based on the twice fundamental-frequency (2ω), where the multiple coordinate transformations and decoupling techniques are needed. It is reported that MPC has also been applied in CCC to facilitate the implementation and reduce the system loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. However, it also suffers from high computational cost, which motivates us to propose a simplified MPC in this paper.</p><p>Apart from grid-side current regulation and circuiting currents suppression, capacitor voltage balancing in each SM is also a vital factor for the reliable operation of MMC <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Conventionally, some balancing methods based on the sorting technique are quite popular. However, in these sorting approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, for each phase, the total number of switching states is , which is acceptable if the number of SMs is small. In order to reduce the sorting burden, a grouping-sorting-optimized method is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The SMs of each arm are evenly divided into several groups. However, the specific charging and discharging statuses of the capacitor voltage are not taken into account, resulting in certain needless sorting processes.</p><p>Considering the aforementioned discussions, in this paper, a priority sorting approach based on simplified MPC is proposed for MMC. The ultimate goal is to regulate the grid-side current, suppress the circulating current and balance the capacitor voltage with less computational cost. More specifically, compared to conventional MPC methods, in our proposed method, the GCC and CCC are designed individually without the weight factors. Moreover, the CVBC is built based on a priority sorting approach and a reduced frequency approach.</p><p>In summary, the main contributions of this paper are threefold. 1) Different from conventional MPC approaches, the desired output voltage of the equivalent MMC circuit are introduced to obtain the approximate on-state SM number of each arm. Thus, a cost function of GCC is defined only with three considered statuses, regardless of voltage-levels. This dramatically eliminates some redundant calculations. 2) Combining the circulating current error, the number of considered statuses in the designed CCC is reduced to minimum. Moreover, a method involving four additional candidates is introduced to further suppress the circulating current, which is suitable for some specific applications. 3) A priority sorting approach is designed for the proposed CVBC to operate during the transient-states. It divides the SMs into three groups and assigns them with the different priorities. Thus, only one group needs the sorting operation, which avoids some unnecessary computations. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the MMC model is presented. An MPC-based strategy involving GCC, CCC and CVBC is designed and analyzed in Section III. Section IV and V present the simulation and experimental results respectively to validate our method. This paper is concluded in Section VI.</p></div>

The inductance L can be obtained as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">sa 1 2 L L L </formula><p>, where a L and s L represent the arm and grid-side inductance respectively.</p><p>According to Fig. </p><p>From ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">2</ref>), it can be concluded that the grid-side current j i is related to the difference between the lower-arm voltage nj u and upper-arm voltage pj u , while the total capacitor voltages of the upper-and lower-arms influence the circulating current cirj i ( j=a, b, c ) . In traditional MPC methods, the optimal switching states are selected from combinations. However, the extensive predicted statuses and resultant computational cost make it impractical under the high voltage-levels. Thus, in the next section, a priority sorting approach based on simplified MPC is proposed to facilitate the implementation and reduce the computational burden.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PROPOSED MPC-BASED STRATEGY</head><p>Motivated by MPC and capacitor voltage balancing approaches in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, a priority sorting approach based on simplified MPC is proposed for MMC in this paper. Its control diagram is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The outer control loop adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> is designed to obtain the desired grid-side current. Besides, three main control blocks are designed including grid-side current control (GCC), circulating current control (CCC) and capacitor voltage balancing control (CVBC). The relationship among these three parts is summarized as follows. 1) Utilizing the desired grid-side current * js () i t T  obtained from the outer control loop and the measured grid-side voltage and current, an individual cost function is developed for GCC to determine the on-state SM number of each arm n pj and n nj ( j=a, b, c) . 2) Combining the output of GCC and the status of the circulating current, the CCC updates n pj and n nj ( j=a, b, c)  by considering the tradeoff between suppressing the circulating current and deteriorating the grid-side current. 3) In the designed CVBC, a pre-set criterion is employed to achieve the corresponding objective. When the capacitor voltage error is large, a priority sorting approach is proposed to balance the voltages of SMs. When the error is relatively small, a reduced frequency approach is employed to alleviate the system loss. The detailed design is presented subsequently.</p></div>

Moreover, additional four statuses are recommended in some specific applications when the requirement on the grid-side current quality is relatively low.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Capacitor voltage balancing control (CVBC)</head><p>Capacitor voltage errors (CVEs) between SMs will be restricted into a small range when the MMC reaches its steady-state with the conventional control methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In this case, no frequent sorting operation is needed, as pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. However, this approach cannot guarantee the transient-state performance when CVEs are large.</p><p>To address this concern, a novel CVBC approach is proposed in this sub-section. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, there are two options to balance the capacitor voltage, i.e., priority sorting approach and reduced frequency approach. These two options can be switched based on a pre-defined criterion dcav1 dcav2</p><p>|| uu  , where dcav1 u and dcav2 u are the voltages of the first two SMs of each arm.</p><p>The reason why we choose the first two SMs is that the CVEs are usually the same for each arm when the capacitor voltages of SMs are balanced. Certainly, we can choose more SMs, but this will lead to a higher computational cost.

In this case, the system is usually in its steady-state; hence the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> is introduced to reduce switching times.</p><p>Case 2: dcav1 dcav2 avj || u u u  . In this case, the system is treated as in its transient-state. Therefore, a priority sorting approach is proposed to decrease the CVEs, which is presented subsequently.</p><p>Just taking the upper-arm as an example, the detailed illustration is listed as follows.</p><p>There are only three statuses for each SM, i.e., charging, discharging or idle in each operating period. Firstly, according to the measured capacitor voltage of SMi dcavi u , we can categorize the whole operating period into three groups.</p><p>Group N 1 : dcavi u &gt;(1+μ) avj u , where μ(&gt;0) is called the boundary coefficient.

Secondly, we assign the priority to above three groups as follows. 1) If the upper-arm is in discharging, the priority is sorted as</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">1 3 2 (N ) (N ) (N ) p p p .</formula><p>2) If the upper-arm is in charging, the priority is sorted as</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">2 3 1 (N ) (N ) (N ) p p p .</formula><p>Finally, the on-state SMs can be determined based on pj n and nj n obtained from the CCC and the direction of the arm current i pj . According to the priority assigned above, we can put one or two groups into operation without sorting, reducing the computational burden. The overall CVBC procedure is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>. Remark 3 In all, the CVBC designed in this paper takes both the transient-and steady-states into account simultaneously. In the transient-state, the main task is to reduce the CVE. While in the steady-state, the goal is to reduce the switching frequency and avoid needless calculations. In this way, the number of sorting operation time is decreased significantly, which greatly facilitates the implementation of the designed CVBC especially under the high voltage-level condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. SIMULATION RESULTS</head><p>In this section, a MMC system is established to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in PSCAD/EMTDC environment. The specific system parameters are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">I</ref>. For comparison, the conventional control in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> is also applied to our system. Its detailed schematic is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>, where its cost function c</p><p>J is defined as a combination of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">11</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">14</ref>) by weight factors 2  and 3</p><p> respectively.  || uu  with μ=5% , which are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>(a). Since group N 3 may operate without sorting, the larger range of N 3 will result in less computational cost. But it will bring more SM DC voltages to the range (1+μ) avj u ≥ dcavi u ≥(1-μ), thus leads to the more unbalanced SM DC voltages output. Considering the computational burden and control precision, μ=2% is selected in our system. Note that both group N 3 and reduced frequency approach can decrease the sorting process; thus we select λ as μ   . Similarly, the maximum difference of dcav1 dcav2 || uu  is then normalized as dcav1 dcav2 2% / uu  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><p>, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">2%    is the value of dcav1 dcav2 || uu  with =2%</formula><p> . The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7(b</ref>). It can be observed that all these normalized differences are in an acceptable range. However, the smaller λ will result in the higher computational cost. Thus, a trade-off value =2%  is finally selected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Grid-side current control</head><p>In this sub-section, comparison studies with the conventional GCC approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> are carried out to analyze the grid-side current. For a fair comparison, the same CVBC approach designed in this paper is applied in both methods. Note that we have tried our best to regulate the weight factors as 2 =0.9 For the conventional GCC, the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the grid-side current is 4.5%. While it is reduced to 3.9% in our proposed method, which indicates that our proposed GCC approach can achieve slightly better performance on regulating grid-side current but with less computational cost as the weight factor tuning is avoided and the considered statuses are reduced.</p><p>It is observed from Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> that the grid-side current can track its reference well, even though there exists some delay time. However, as pointed out before, there is a trade-off between the circulating current suppression and grid-side current quality. Therefore, such slightly distorted grid-side current is acceptable when the circulating current suppression is also taken into account.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Circulating current control</head><p>The performance of the designed CCC is demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">9(a)</ref>, the total number of the on-state SMs remains at N before introducing CCC. It is added or subtracted two voltage-levels with CCC to suppress the circulating current. If the sampling period is 200μs, the ripple range of the circulating current is 60A. It is reduced to 30A with 100μs sampling period, as presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">9(b)</ref> and<ref type="figure">(c</ref>) respectively. Apparently, shorter sampling period brings higher control precision, but also results in higher sampling and computational burden.</p><p>It is observed from Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>(d) that the circulating current is varying with the active power. During 0.7s&lt;t&lt;0.9s, only reactive power is transferred, and thus the desired circulating current is zero. It is regulated to 0.167kA when transferring the active power from t≥0.9s. These results verify the effectiveness of the designed CCC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Voltage balancing control</head><p>In this sub-section, the proposed CVBC is compared to the conventional CVBC approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> with the same GCC and CCC designed in this paper. The sorting process is triggered with a fixed-frequency 5kHz. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">10</ref>.</p><p>It is observed from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">10</ref>(a) and (c) that both these two approaches can adjust the fluctuation range of capacitor voltage within 160V; meanwhile, the voltage difference among the SMs is basically the same, approximately 25V. The average numbers of SM switching in these two methods are given in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">10(b</ref>) and (d) respectively. It is observed that before t=0.6s, they are almost the same. However, after t=0.6s, compared to the result in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">10(b)</ref>, the average value of switching frequency for the proposed CVBC presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">10(d</ref>) is decreased nearly half.</p><p>These results indicate that the proposed CVBC can achieve the better grid-side current than the conventional one with less switching loss and lower computational burden.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">II</ref>, we summarize the comparison result. It is observed that compared to the conventional control approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, the AC current THD obtained in our proposed method is reduced by 13.3% while the average switching frequency of each SM is decreased by 47.5%.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION</head><p>In this section, an experimental prototype is built to validate the proposed control method with SM number N=10 in each arm, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">11</ref>. A digital signal processor (DSP TMS320F28335) and a field-programmable gate array (ALTERA Cyclone III-EP3C16Q240) are employed in the 0278-0046 (c) 2017 IEEE.

See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information. controller design. The sampling period is set as 150μs. And the rated grid-side voltage and the desired DC-bus voltage are chosen as 380V and 700V respectively. The rated active power is 50kW. The other remaining parameters are the same as those in the simulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Verification of GCC</head><p>In this sub-section, the grid-side current performance obtained by the proposed GCC is compared with the GCC approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. MMC operates from the capacitive condition to the inductive condition, and the desired reactive current is changed from 10A to -11A. The results are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">12</ref>.</p><p>Comparing the results in Figs .12(a) and (b), our proposed method can achieve better grid-side current quality than the GCC approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> no matter the condition is capacitive or inductive. More specifically, the THDs are 5.2% and 4.3% in the inductive condition and 5.3% and 4.4% in the capacitive condition for the approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and the proposed one respectively. Besides, in our proposed method, the settling time from capacitive to inductive condition is less than 10ms, which is almost half of that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, where it is around 20ms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Comparison of CCC</head><p>In this sub-section, the performance of the proposed method for suppressing the circulating current is verified. And it is also compared with the CCC approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> while employing the same CVBC designed in this paper. The desired reactive current is set as 15A under the purely capacitive condition. Hence, the desired circulating current is zero.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">13</ref>(a), before the proposed CCC is activated, the circulating current fluctuates periodically. However, when the proposed CCC is activated, the amplitude of circulating current is reduced to 0.3A within 1ms. Besides, it is also observed from Figs. <ref type="bibr">13(a)</ref> and (b) that the grid-side current remains unchanged with its THD being around 3.7%, which indicates the proposed CCC has almost no impact on the grid-side current. In addition, the proposed CCC can also drive the upper-and lower-arm currents to balance, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">13(c</ref>).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="bibr">13(d)</ref> shows the results of the CCC approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. It can be seen that the amplitude of circulating current is reduced to 0.25A when the CCC is activated, which is slightly better than ours. However, it is achieved by sacrificing the quality of the grid-side current, whose THD is increased to 4.4%, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">13(e</ref>). Besides, its settling time is 5ms, almost 5 times slower than ours.</p><p>In order to further improve the circulating current suppression ability of our proposed method, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref>  , nn are not added or subtracted the same voltage-level. The quality of the grid-side current is then affected with its THD increased to 5.3%. These results indicate that there is a trade-off between the suppression of the circulating current and the quality of the grid-side current.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Comparison of CVBC</head><p>In this sub-section, the performance of the proposed CVBC is demonstrated and is also compared with the CVBC approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The capacitor DC voltages in the upper-arms of phase a are given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">14</ref>.</p><p>It is shown that when the CVBCs are activated, both these two approaches can regulate the voltage error among the SMs from 5V to 0.5V. However, the settling time of the proposed CVBC is 40ms, which is almost 2 times faster than the approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. These results validate the advantages of our CVBC approach over the one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, which are stated in Remark 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Comparison of computational burden</head><p>In order to compare the computational burden, the considered statuses are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">III</ref> for the MMC with different approaches in each phase.</p><p>For the conventional MPC in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the total number of considered statuses is N 2N C . While, the total considered statuses are reduced to N+4 and 2N+2 for GCC and CCC in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> respectively. However, in our proposed method, the number of considered statuses is always 4 even under the high voltage-levels. It is observed from Table III that compared to the conventional MPC approaches, the considered status of our approach is reduced by more than 71.43% under N=10.</p><p>Note that in our system, the GCC and CCC are implemented in DSP (TMS320F28335), with the oscillator frequency being 150MHz. This indicates that one clock cycle time T is 6.67ns. For the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the operating time is much longer than 6.67ns×184756=1232μs, which is beyond the sample time (150μs) in our system. Therefore, this method may not be suitable for our system.  In order to alleviate the DSP burden, the CVBC is implemented in FPGA. The resource utilization of the designed CVBC is summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">IV</ref>, and the executing clock cycle is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">15</ref>. The maximum utilization in FPGA (MUF) is only 24.2% with respects to logic cells. Therefore, there is adequate resource to implement the designed CVBC in the selected FPGA chip. If the system clock of FPGA is set as 30 MHz, then the maximum computational time of CVBC is about 5.5μs. The comprehensive comparison results are summarized in Table <ref type="table">V</ref>. It is verified that there is a trade-off between the grid-side current quality and the circulating current suppression. Besides, compared to the CVBC in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the transient settling time of the SM capacitor voltage is decreased by nearly half. Note that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> only reduced frequency approach is implemented to achieve MUF of improved MPC1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, resulting in the relatively lower MUF than the proposed approach. Comparably, the total calculation time of the proposed approach is reduced by more than 24%. Moreover, our approach will be more superior to the other approaches when the voltage-level is higher, as summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">III</ref>. These performances further demonstrate that superiority of the proposed control approach. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In order to reduce the computational burden of conventional MPC methods, a priority sorting approach based on simplified MPC is proposed for MMCs in this paper. Its main objective is to regulate the grid-side current, suppress the circulating current and balance the capacitor voltage. The GCC is firstly designed based on the desired predicted output voltage of the equivalent MMC circuit to get rid of the redundant statuses. After then, the CCC is embedded with a cost function involving the circulating current error to reduce the computational burden. Finally, the CVBC is designed to guarantee the transient performance of capacitor voltage and reduce the switching frequency in the steady state. Simulation and experimental results have shown that the proposed strategy achieves better performance than conventional methods with lower computational cost. Since the computational time of the proposed strategy always keeps unchanged for GCC and CCC, and slightly increases with the number of SMs for CVBC, it is especially suitable for the applications where a large number of SMs are required. In future, the stability analysis of the SM DC voltage will be carried out.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
