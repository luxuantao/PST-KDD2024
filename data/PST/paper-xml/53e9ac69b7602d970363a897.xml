<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In the last three decades, there has been an increasing interest in the simulation of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems that appear in several engineering and life science applications. We consider in this work the situation of an incompressible Newtonian fluid interacting with a relatively thin structure. Such situation appears for instance in hemodynamics applications when studying the interaction between blood and arterial wall. The numerical approximation of this type of heterogeneous systems is challenging. They are coupled and highly nonlinear problems with the following peculiarities: 0021-9991/$ -see front matter Ó 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.jcp.2008.04.006 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> The position of the fluid-structure interface is an unknown of the coupled problem. It introduces a geometrical nonlinearity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> The convective term of the fluid problem is nonlinear and, in case of using an ALE formulation (introduced in Section 2), also depends on the velocity of the fluid domain.</p><p>(3) The fluid and structure subproblems are coupled through transmission conditions which state the continuity of velocity and normal stresses on the fluid-structure interface.</p><p>In this paper, we focus on algorithms based on subsequent solutions of fluid and structure sub-problems (partitioned procedures). Every sub-problem is solved separately, allowing the reuse of existing codes/methods (modularity). This is the main reason why partitioned procedures are so popular, see, e.g, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</p><p>In order to enforce continuity of velocity and normal stresses at the interface (condition (3)) one could consider loosely coupled strategies, which solve the fluid and the structure only once (or just few times) per time step and do not satisfy exactly the coupling transmission conditions. As a consequence, the work exchanged between the two sub-problems is not perfectly balanced and this may induce instabilities in the numerical scheme. For example, it was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>) that an explicit coupling is unstable in those applications where the added mass effect is important, as in hemodynamics. Alternatively, one can treat implicitly (strongly) the coupling conditions at each time step, obtaining the solution of the fully coupled, monolithic system of nonlinear equations. Several strategies have been proposed for the treatment of the nonlinearity. In particular, one could consider Picard or Newton iterations over the nonlinear FSI system, to handle both nonlinearities (1) and (2) (implicit strategy, see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>), or treat the interface position and the convective term in an explicit way by extrapolation from previous time steps (semi-implicit algorithm, see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref>). In this way, no iterations are needed within each time step.</p><p>Whatever strategy is adopted, a sequence of linearized FSI problems (implicitly coupled through condition (3)) has to be solved. Each of these problems can then be solved in a partitioned way via sub-iterations between the fluid and structure sub-problems until convergence. Several iterative procedures have been investigated so far, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. In all these approaches, the work exchanged between the two sub-problems is perfectly balanced in each time step and the numerical scheme is stable. The price to pay is a relatively large number of sub-iterations, particularly in those cases where the added mass is important. Up to now, the computational cost remains extremely high.</p><p>The need to reduce the computational cost for those fluid-structure simulations where it is necessary to treat implicitly the transmission conditions has motivated this work. In particular, we start from the Dirichlet-Neumann (DN) partitioned procedure, in which the fluid problem is solved with a Dirichlet boundary condition at the interface (the structure velocity at the previous sub-iteration) and the structure with a Neumann boundary condition at the interface (the fluid normal stress just computed). This is the standard nomenclature for partitioned procedures: the first kind of transmission conditions refers to the fluid sub-problem while the second one refers to the structure sub-problem. This scheme is very easy to implement, yet, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, it often needs a large relaxation to converge and a quite high number of iterations when fluid and structure densities are comparable.</p><p>This paper proposes new partitioned procedures based on Robin transmission conditions (linear combinations of the Dirichlet and Neumann transmission conditions), applicable to those FSI problems where the fluid and the structure have the same spatial dimension (say d ¼ 2; 3). We introduce the general Robin-Robin algorithm, which generates a whole family of partitioned procedures that includes the classical DN and other new algorithms, such as the Robin-Dirichlet (RD), the Robin-Neumann (RN), the Dirichlet-Robin (DR) and the Neumann-Robin (NR) schemes. At the algebraic level, all these algorithms can be interpreted as suitable block Gauss-Seidel iterations on the monolythic FSI system.</p><p>The use of Robin transmission conditions is motivated by introducing simplified models for the fluid and the structure (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>). In particular, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> a simple membrane model for a thin ðd À 1Þ-dimensional structure has been derived, under the assumption of normal displacements. It was shown that this model can be embedded into the fluid problem leading to a Robin boundary condition. Hence, the original FSI problem is reduced to a single fluid problem. A similar approach was previously proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for a fixed fluid geometry. For FSI problems in which the structure is d-dimensional, the previous considerations motivate the construction of iterative procedures based on Robin transmission conditions applied to the fluid sub-problem.</p><p>The simplified model introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> also provides an estimate for the coefficient appearing in the Robin condition.</p><p>On the other hand, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> a simplified fluid model was considered, based on the assumption of inviscid fluid. It was shown that this model can be embedded into a ðd À 1Þ-dimensional structure equation, by introducing a suitable ''added mass" operator. In this work we consider the case of a d dimensional structure and show that this embedding procedure leads to a generalized Robin boundary condition. Upon approximating the addedmass operator with a multiple of the identity operator, the previous condition reduces to a ''standard" Robin condition. This motivates the construction of iterative procedures based on Robin transmission conditions applied to the structure sub-problem, as well. Again, the simplified model introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> also provides an estimate for the coefficient appearing in the Robin condition.</p><p>We study the convergence of the RD and RN strategies on the model FSI problem proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and extend the results given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> for the DN scheme. In particular, we provide the range of the relaxation parameter for which convergence is guaranteed. This theoretical analysis allows us to compare the efficiency of the different schemes and to understand the dependence of the convergence on different physical and numerical parameters. Our results indicate that, unlike the DN strategy, the RN scheme converges always without relaxation and independently of the added-mass effect.</p><p>Our preliminary numerical results presented in Section 6 show that the Robin-Neumann scheme features excellent convergence properties in comparison to the classical Dirichlet-Neumann approach. Moreover, the results confirm that convergence is almost independent of the added-mass effect. For these reasons we propose the Robin-Neumann scheme as a valid alternative to the Dirichlet-Neumann scheme for problems where the added-mass effect is significant. Among the other schemes, the Robin-Robin algorithm features even better convergence properties provided that the coefficient appearing in the Robin condition for the structure is properly chosen; the Dirichlet-Robin scheme features the same properties of the DN, while the Robin-Dirichlet and the Neumann-Robin scheme are very slow.</p><p>The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the fluid-structure interaction problem at the continuous level. In Section 2.1 we provide a suitable time discretization of the problem. In Section 3 we introduce the classical Dirichlet-Neumann and the new Robin-Robin partitioned procedures. Sections 3.1 and 3.2 are devoted to the two simplified models used to provide suitable coefficients for the Robin boundary conditions. In Section 4 we introduce the algebraic counterpart of the FSI problem and we interpret the partitioned procedures as a block Gauss-Seidel iterative solver. The convergence analysis of the DN, RN and RD schemes is carried out in Section 5. A meaningful set of numerical experiments are presented in Section 6, that confirm all the theoretical results obtained in Section 5. Finally, in Section 7 we draw some conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Problem setting</head><p>Let us consider an heterogeneous mechanical system which covers a bounded and moving domain X t &amp; R d (d ¼ 2, 3, being the space dimension), where t here denotes time. This domain is divided into a sub-domain X t s occupied by an elastic structure and its complement X t f occupied by the fluid. The fluid-structure interface R t is the common boundary between X t s and X t f , i.e. R t ¼ oX t f \ oX t s . Furthermore, n f is the outward normal to X t f on R t and n s ¼ Àn f is its counterpart for the structure domain. The initial configuration X 0 at t ¼ 0 is considered as the reference one.</p><p>In order to describe the evolution of the whole domain X t we define two families of mappings:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">L : X 0 s Â ð0; T Þ ! X t s ; ðx 0 ; tÞ 7 ! x ¼ Lðx 0 ; tÞ and A : X 0 f Â ð0; T Þ !

The combination of these two mappings define an homeomorphism over X t under the following continuity condition on the interface:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L t ¼ A t on R t 8t 2 ð0; T Þ:<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>We adopt a purely Lagrangian approach to describe the structure kinematics. Therefore, the solid mapping is straightforwardly determined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">L t ðx 0 Þ ¼ x 0 þ ĝðx 0 ; tÞ;</formula><p>where ĝ denotes the displacement of the solid medium with respect to the reference configuration.</p><p>The fluid problem is stated in an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>). The fluid domain mapping A t is defined by an appropriate extension of its value on the interface, which is given by condition (1):</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">A t ðx 0 Þ ¼ x 0 þ Extðĝðx 0 ; tÞj R 0 Þ:<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>A classical choice is to consider a harmonic extension operator in the reference domain.

The solid is assumed to be an elastic material, characterized by a constitutive law relating the Cauchy stress tensor T s to the deformation gradient FðĝÞ ¼ I þ rĝ. Moreover, we assume the fluid to be homogeneous, Newtonian and incompressible. We indicate with T f its Cauchy stress tensor:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">T f ðu; pÞ ¼ ÀpI þ 2lGðuÞ;</formula><p>where p is the pressure, l the dynamic viscosity and</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">GðuÞ ¼ 1 2 ðru þ ðruÞ T Þ</formula><p>is the strain rate tensor. In order to write the fluid problem in ALE form, let us apply the chain rule to the velocity time derivative:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">o t uj x 0 ¼ o t u þ w Á ru;</formula><p>where o t u is the partial time derivative in the spatial frame (Eulerian derivative). Then, the fluid-structure problem in strong form reads:</p><p>1. Fluid-structure problem.

Two transmission conditions are enforced at the interface: the continuity of fluid and structure velocities (3d), due to the adherence condition, and the continuity of stresses (3e), expressing the action-reaction principle. The fluid and structure problems are also coupled by the geometrical condition (4), leading to a highly nonlinear problem. Finally, system (3) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">4</ref>) has to be endowed with suitable boundary conditions on oX t n R t and initial conditions. Since the choice of boundary and initial conditions is not essential in the forecoming discussion, they will not be detailed here.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Robin-Robin partitioned procedures</head><p>Partitioned procedures have been introduced in order to solve the linearized fluid-structure system by separate evaluations of fluid and structure sub-problems. These iterative algorithms can be motivated from a domain decomposition viewpoint (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>). The most widely used partitioned procedure is the Dirichlet-Neumann (DN) technique, that consists in solving the fluid sub-problem with a Dirichlet boundary condition and the structure sub-problem with a Neumann boundary condition. We recall it briefly here. To lighten the notation we omit here and in what follows the temporal index n. Referring to the semi-implicit scheme, system (5), and indicating with k the sub-iteration index, the DN algorithm reads:</p><p>Dirichlet-Neumann algorithm Given g n ; g nÀ1 ; u n and the current iteration g k , find the next iteration g kþ1 ; u kþ1 and p kþ1 such that, 1.

The same strategy can be applied in the implicit case to solve the linearized FSI problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. This leads to a two nested loops algorithm.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Block Gauss-Seidel interpretation</head><p>In this section we motivate the partitioned procedures introduced above from an algebraic point of view.

The fully coupled algebraic FSI system is obtained by writing the weak form of the semidiscrete FSI problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> and discretizing it in space using the finite element method. In particular, let us introduce a triangulation of the fluid and structure domains and assume that the two meshes are conforming on the fluid-structure interface R t .

On the other hand, the right hand side b nþ1 accounts for external forces and other terms related to the time discretization scheme. The first two rows are the fully discrete versions of the momentum and mass conservation equations for the fluid. The third equation states the continuity of velocities on the interface and is the algebraic counterpart of (5d). We have indicated by M R the interface mass matrix, which is invertible. The fourth row enforces continuity of stresses in a weak form. Finally, the fifth row is the structure problem in the internal nodes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Numerical results</head><p>In this section we present some numerical results with the aim of testing the algorithms proposed in the previous sections. As pointed out in Section 2.1, we call semi-implicit the algorithms in which we do not update in the loop neither the convective term nor the fluid domain, otherwise we refer to them as implicit. In particular, in Section 6.1 we test the performance of the semi-implicit Robin-Dirichlet (SIRD) and Robin-Neumann (SIRN) algorithms, in comparison with the semi-implicit Dirichlet-Neumann scheme (EDN). Moreover, we test the implicit Robin-Neumann algorithm (IRN). In Section 6.2 we detail the performance of the semi-implicit Robin-Robin, Dirichlet-Robin and Neumann-Robin algorithms.</p><p>For the structure, we consider the following equation of linear elasticity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_133">q s o tt g À cr Á ðrg þ ðrgÞ t Þ À kr Á ððr Á gÞIÞ þ bg ¼ f s ;</formula><p>where I is the identity operator, c ¼ E=ð1 þ mÞ, and k ¼ mE=ðð1 þ mÞð1 À 2mÞÞ. The reaction terms stand for the transversal membrane effects that appear when the structure is written in axisymmetric form. All the numerical simulations are performed in a rectangular domain both for the fluid and for the two structures, whose size is 6 Â 1 cm and 6 Â 0:1 cm, respectively (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). We use a 2D Finite Element Code written in Matlab at MOX-Dipartimento di Matematica-Politecnico di Milano and at CMCS-EPFL-Lausanne. Moreover, we consider P 1 isoP 2 and P 1 elements for the fluid and P 1 element for the structure and a space discretization step h ¼ 0:02 cm. In all the cases we use the residual normalized on the initial one as stopping criterion (see Section 4), with a tolerance equal to 10 À4 .</p><p>We set l ¼ 0:035 poise; q f ¼ 1 g=cm 3 and, unless otherwise specified, we consider the following other values: Dt ¼ 10 À3 s; q s ¼ 1:1 g=cm 3 ; c ¼ 1:15 Â 10 6 dyne=cm 2 ; k ¼ 1:7 Â 10 6 dyne=cm 2 ; b ¼ 4 Â 10 6 dyne=cm 4 and the thickness of the structure H s ¼ 0:1 cm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">The Robin-Neumann and the Robin-Dirichlet schemes</head><p>In this section we study the performance of the Robin-Neumann and the Robin-Dirichlet schemes. When we prescribe a Robin boundary condition for the fluid, an optimal choice for the parameter a f , as <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> suggests, is naturally given by the simplified model for the structure equation, that is a f ¼ H s q s =Dt þ bDt. This value is directly computable, hence very useful in practical computations.</p><p>Let us start with the semi-implicit case. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> we show the solution computed with the SIRN scheme, which, of course, is the same as the one computed with the semi-implicit monolithic scheme (SIM), up to the employed tolerance. In particular, this figure shows average quantities on a radial section of the mean pressure (top), the flow rate (middle), and the fluid domain radius (bottom), as a function of the axial coordinate.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> shows the structure displacement, obtained with the SIRN scheme, in the deformed domain at three different instants. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref> we show the average number of iterations in the first 12 time steps, employed by the SIRN, SIRD and SIDN schemes, in three cases: without relaxation ðx ¼ 1Þ, with an optimally tuned relaxation parameter ðx opt Þ and using an Aitken relaxation procedure (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>). First of all, we point out that SIRN is the only algorithm that converges without relaxation. This is a very interesting feature of this scheme. Moreover, SIRN is always much faster than SIDN. This is confirmed also by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> that plots the errors on several quantities, measured in the L 1 norm, versus the number of iterations. To compute the errors, we have taken as reference solution the one provided by the SIM scheme. In all these tests, we have employed an optimal relaxation parameter. On the other hand, the SIRD scheme is very slow and the relative error at convergence is high, evidencing high condition number of this problem. However, as Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">3</ref> shows, the   number of iterations decreases if we consider a small value of the elastic coefficients, as expected from the analysis of Section 5. Due to its inefficiency, from now on we drop the Robin-Dirichlet scheme and we focus on the Robin-Neumann algorithm only.</p><p>In the sequel, we compare the SIDN and SIRN performance, studying their sensitivity with respect to some of the parameters of the fluid and structure models; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">3</ref>. First of all, we point out that SIRN always converges without relaxation, while SIDN always needs a relaxation parameter smaller than one. Moreover, SIRN shows a number of iterations quite insensitive to the values of physical and numerical parameters and 5-20 times less than SIDN. In particular, we observe that the convergence of SIDN is deteriorated when the added-mass effect becomes more important, that is to say, the value q s =q f increases. On the contrary, SIRN is insensitive to this phenomenon. Changing the stiffness parameters c and k, the two algorithms have different behaviours: SIDN seems to improve the convergence rate when these parameters increase, while SIRN when they decrease (even if in the last case the variation is very small). Finally, decreasing the time step Dt and the thickness H s we observe that the convergence rate of SIDN gets worse, while for SIRN there is only a slight worsening. All these numerical simulations are consistent with the theoretical results presented in Section 5.</p><p>In conclusion, we can state that the SIRN algorithm is clearly more robust and faster than the SIDN scheme.</p><p>Let us consider now the implicit algorithms. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> we compare the mean pressure, the flow rate and the radius of the fluid domain obtained with the SIRN and IRN algorithms. We point out that IRN does not converge using the same iterative loop to update the convective term and the fluid domain, on one hand, and to solve the block Gauss-Seidel system, on the other one. Therefore, we need to use two nested loops: an external one in which we update the convective field and the fluid domain and an internal one in which we solve the block Gauss-Siedel system, as described in Remark 1. However, as numerical evidence suggests, it is sufficient to take tol ¼ 10 À1 as tolerance for the internal loop. On the other hand, the implicit Dirichlet-Neumann scheme (IDN) converges using just one loop. Anyhow, as Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4</ref> shows, the average number of total sub-iterations N (that is the product of the internal and external sub-iterations) per time step is less for IRN, showing that also in the implicit case the Robin-Neumann partitioned procedure is faster than the Dirichlet-Neumann one. This is confirmed by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> showing the L 1 relative errors, using the implicitmonolithic (IM) algorithm as the reference solution and choosing optimally the relaxation parameter.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>The classical Dirichlet-Neumann algorithm is negatively affected by the added-mass effect. Therefore, for FSI applications where this effect is important, DN needs a strong relaxation and its convergence is very slow. We have obtained some new convergence results that are in accordance with this behavior.</p><p>The main contribution of this work is the design of partitioned procedures suitable for FSI problems where the added-mass effect is important, as, for instance, in hemodynamics applications. With this aim, we have introduced a new family of partitioned procedures generated by Robin transmission conditions, i.e. linear combination of Dirichlet (continuity of velocities) and Neumann (continuity of stresses) conditions on the interface. The convergence of the Robin-based algorithms depends on the choice of the combination coefficients. We have proposed those coefficients based on explicit formulae for simplified models for the fluid and for the structure.</p><p>In particular, we have analyzed two of these new methods: Robin-Dirichlet and Robin-Neumann. Whereas the Robin-Dirichlet algorithm is fairly disappointing, the Robin-Neumann algorithm does exhibit excellent convergence properties that make this algorithm very appealing:</p><p>The method always converges, without any relaxation. The convergence is insensitive to the added-mass effect.</p><p>These properties have been proved theoretically for simplified blood-vessel system and checked for more general fluid and structure models using numerical experimentation. These two properties make the RN algorithm very useful in hemodynamics applications. In fact, this method converges much faster than DN for a wide set of numerical tests.</p><p>We have also proposed the more general RR scheme, that depends on the scaling factor c. By suitably tuning this coefficient, we obtain convergence properties for the RR scheme even better than those of the RN </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.

Moreover, the tuned value seems to be very robust and practically independent of some of the parameters defining the problem at hand.</p><p>Even though we have not considered this point in this article, the use of a Robin transmission condition for the fluid system allows to solve FSI problems with enclosed fluid domains (balloon-type problems). The DN algorithm is useless in these cases because the fluid sub-problem is confined (Dirichlet boundary conditions on the whole fluid boundary). Furthermore, those Dirichlet boundary conditions for the fluid are obtained from the structure sub-problem and do not satisfy</p><p>in general. Thus, the null divergence constraint cannot be fulfilled, leading to unphysical results. The application of RN to this kind of problems will be the subject of a future work.</p></div>			</div>
