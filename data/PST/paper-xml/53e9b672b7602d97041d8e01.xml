<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>R ECENTLY, design of disturbance observers has received considerable attention and many different schemes have been suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The motivation is suggested by the fact that if the disturbances can be estimated, then control of the uncertain dynamic systems with disturbances may become easier. For example, the controller with disturbance-cancellation functions can be easily constructed by using the estimated disturbances <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The construction of the disturbance observers, similar to that of state observers, has an important implication in practical applications.</p><p>Among the many suggested disturbance-observer techniques, the approximate differentiator type <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and -type <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> formulations have been popularly applied in the design of tracking controllers for motion-control systems. The procedure of the first approach closes an inner loop around the controlled plant to reject disturbances and force the input-output characteristics of this inner loop to approximate a "nominal" plant model at low frequencies. Tuning of the loop is accomplished through adjustment of a low-pass filter. Since the plant approximates a nominal model at low frequencies, overall closed-loop dynamics are usually well known and feedforward techniques are often applied. The second approach makes the best use of the merits in control <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. But there are some shortcomings to these approaches. A fatal one is that a satisfactory control can hardly be obtained when the types of the disturbances are unknown and the model uncertainties exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Another is that these formulations can only cope with some low-frequency disturbances. It should be mentioned that an important result of estimating the frequency of a signal is proposed recently in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Because of the excellent robustness to uncertainties of the variable structure systems (VSS) sliding-mode method <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, it is found a lot of applications in state estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, disturbance estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, fault detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, etc. This paper proposes a nonlinear-disturbance observer for multivariable systems based on the VSS approach. As a matter of fact, the scheme developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which is based on the VSS "equivalent control" method belongs to this category, where the knowledge of the upper bounds of the disturbances is required. However, the "equivalent control" method is not strict (because, on the sliding surface , it cannot be proved that the derivative of is also zero) and the a priori knowledge about the upper bound may not be easily obtained in practice.</p><p>A common feature of the disturbance observers in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is that they are designed only for single-disturbance singleoutput uncertain systems. Even though the method developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> can cope with multivariable systems, it can only deal with a very limited class of disturbances. It is well known that most of the practical control systems are multivariable systems, such as, to name a few, robots and magnetic bearing systems. However, extensions of the schemes in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> to multivariable uncertain systems may not be easy or, at least, are not obvious.</p><p>The main features of the disturbance observer in this paper are that it is developed for multivariable systems, it is robust to the types of the disturbances and the a priori knowledge concerning the bounds of the disturbances are not needed. The proposed nonlinear-disturbance observer is inspired by the VSS control method and adaptive algorithms. By first estimating the disturbance through a higher order filter, the disturbance through a lower order filter is inductively estimated. Stability analysis shows that the estimation error decreases exponentially to a steady value, which is determined by the design parameters.</p><p>To show the applicability of our design, the proposed disturbance-estimation scheme is applied to a vertical-shaft magnetic-bearing system, where the rotational disturbances and their derivatives are estimated based on a linearized model of the rotational motion. In the case of the magnetic-bearing model, some disturbances, such as unknown angular disturbances, are unmatched uncertainties <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The present robust control theory is generally not applicable to the systems with such disturbances. In order to account for the unmatched disturbances in the controller design it is a challenging task to construct a disturbance observer that can estimate unmatched disturbances. Focusing on the magnetic-bearing system, a sliding mode observer for disturbance estimation was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and a controller was then developed to eliminate the disturbances. However, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, estimation of the derivatives of the disturbances is subjected to the condition that the disturbances are periodic signals with known frequencies. This may not be the case in practice.</p><p>The application of the proposed disturbance observer shows that the unmatched disturbances and their derivatives in the magnetic-bearing system can be estimated without the periodic condition. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method. It should be mentioned that the estimations of the disturbances and their derivatives are the crux of the formulated magnetic-bearing system and the purpose of this paper is to reveal the essential features of the disturbance estimation. It is well known that as long as the disturbances are estimated, it is straightforward to combine this estimation into the controller design <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Therefore, to emphasize the main issue, the discussion of corresponding controller designs will not be pursued here.</p><p>The organization of this paper is as follows. Section II gives the problem formulation. In Section III, the formulation for the disturbance estimation is proposed for multivariable minimum phase systems. In Section IV, the proposed method is applied to the magnetic bearing system. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Section V provides conclusions. In this paper, the following assumptions are made. A1) Without loss of generality, it is assumed that . Remark 1: This assumption is just for the sake of simplicity. The results developed in this paper can easily be extended to the general case . It should be emphasized that the goal is to develop a disturbance observer in a simpler setting that reveals its essential features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROBLEM STATEMENT</head><p>A2) The disturbances are bounded signals. Furthermore, are piecewise differentiable and their first-order derivatives (at nondifferentiable points, it is meant the right-and left-hand derivatives) are bounded. Remark 2: It should be noted that the a priori information about the bounds of the disturbances is not required in this paper. These bounds will be updated by adaptive algorithms. Let and . Suppose</p><p>where . It can be concluded that Further, the following assumption is made regarding . A3) is a Hurwitz polynomial. Remark 3: Assumption A3) means that the system (1) is in minimum phase (with respect to the relation between the output and the disturbance). This can be verified by firstly rewriting system (1) in the observer canonical form and then checking the full rankness of for all complex numbers Z satisfying <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The aim of this research is to estimate the disturbances under the condition that they are bounded and their upper bounds are not available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. FORMULATION OF THE DISTURBANCE OBSERVER</head><p>Since is also a Hurwitz polynomial, multiplying both sides of (1) with yields (5a)</p><p>Now, rewrite (5a) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">. . .

The parameters should be chosen large enough to adjust the estimated upper bounds rapidly for and . The estimation error for the disturbances can be designed to be arbitrarily small by choosing the design parameters. When the analog signals are implemented by a digital computer, the choice of the parameters is also limited by the sampling period <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. APPLICATION TO MAGNETIC BEARING SYSTEMS</head><p>To show the applicability of our design, the proposed disturbance estimation scheme is applied to the rotational motion of a shaft magnetic bearing system. The magnetic-bearing system is a device of electromagnets used to suspend a rotor without any contact. The technique of contactless support for rotors has become very important in a variety of industrial applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Imbalance in the rotor mass will cause vibration in rotating machines. Balancing of the rotor is very difficult and there is often a residual imbalance. However, this imbalance problem can be solved by feedback control. One solution method is to compensate for the unbalance forces by generating electromagnetic canceling forces <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The cancellation of the unbalance forces implies that these forces have to be estimated first. However, the estimation of unbalance forces is a nontrivial task and thus presents a challenge. In the following application, it will be shown that our method can contribute to a practical solution for the control of imbalance forces on magnetic bearings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Model Description</head><p>The nonlinear model for the magnetic bearing assumes the rotor is a rigid floating body whose position is represented in the coordinate frame about the rotor's center of mass. Let and be the angular displacements of the rotor about the -axis and the -axis, respectively. The five degrees of freedom are represented accordingly as <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> (18a)</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(18b) (18c) (18d) (18e)</formula><p>where M is the mass of the rotor; is the axial stiffness coefficient; is the damping coefficient in the axial direction; is the acceleration due to gravity; is the rotor angular velocity; and are the moments of inertia in the axial and radial directions, respectively; is half of the longitudinal length.</p><p>, and are the translational disturbances, while are the rotational disturbances. The electromagnetic forces, for , produced by the th electromagnet are expressed in terms of the air gap flux and the gap length <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> where and represent top and bottom electromagnets, respectively; is a constant; and is the pole width.</p><p>In this paper, we only consider the rotational disturbance identification for a vertical-shaft magnetic-bearing system. The translational disturbances can be independently estimated based on the dynamics in (18a)-(18c).</p><p>A linearization valid for rotational motion described in (18d) and (18e) ispresented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This linear model has state variables where represents the deviation of air gap flux from the nominal value at the th electromagnet. The resulting is <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref> where the matrices , and are described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(21a) (21b)</formula><p>with , and is the nominal value for air gap flux, is the nominal value for gap length, is the electromagnet coil resistance, is the permeability of free space, is the area under one electromagnet pole, is the number of turns in each electromagnet coil <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The state is represented by . The state is unknown, however, its components and are measurable variables. The control input is the voltage potential applied between pairs of electromagnetic coils . In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, it is assumed that the disturbance forces representing imbalance of the rotor about its geometrical axis can be represented as sinusoidal disturbances given by <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref> where is the angular displacement between the geometrical and inertial axes (amount of dynamic imbalance), is the initial value of .</p><p>represents the actuator noise. Since the actuator noise is matched, it will be neglected in the subsequent development knowing that the controller and observer can be made robust to matched disturbances <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>The disturbance force representing imbalance of the rotor about its geometrical axis is an unmatched uncertainties. As pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the unmatched disturbance and its derivative have to be estimated for the controller design. In the following, it will be shown that the disturbance and its derivative can be estimated by using the result presented in Theorem 1.</p></div>

Estimating the Disturbances and Their First-Order Derivatives</head><p>To begin, the system (20) is written in the input-output form</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">(23a)<label>(23b)</label></formula><p>Rewriting (23a) and (23b) in the form of (9) yields</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">(24) (25a) (25b) (26a)<label>(26b)</label></formula><p>(25a) and (26a) also imply that and .</p><p>From Theorem 1, for , we construct the following observer equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">(27) (28)</formula><p>where and are, respectively, determined by</p><p>with ( <ref type="formula">31</ref>) and (32) shown at the bottom of the page.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Simulation Results</head><p>The model parameter values of the vertical shaft magnetic bearing are shown in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>  It should be noted that the parameters are chosen to be very large in order that the convergence speed of the estimating process may be very fast.</p><p>The computer simulation is carried out by using MATLAB, where the step size (sampling period) is chosen as s.

These results confirm the validity of the proposed algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Some Discussions</head><p>By using the estimates of the disturbances, the Luenberger-type state observer for the system (20) can be easily constructed as <ref type="bibr">(37)</ref> where is the estimated state, is described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">(38)</formula><p>is chosen such that is a stable matrix.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, a nonlinear disturbance observer is proposed for multivariable minimum phase systems with arbitrary relative degrees. The estimation of one disturbance is independent of the estimation of the others. Furthermore, the derivatives of the disturbances can also be independently estimated. The proposed disturbance observer is motivated by VSS method and adaptive algorithms. The a priori information about the upper and lower bounds of the disturbances and their derivatives is not required and these bounds are updated online by adaptive algorithms. The nonlinear disturbance observer is robust to the types of the disturbances. The estimation error decreases exponentially to a steady value, which is determined by the design parameters.</p><p>To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, the formulation is applied to a vertical-shaft magnetic-bearing system where the rotational disturbances and their derivatives are estimated based on a linearized model of the rotational motion.
