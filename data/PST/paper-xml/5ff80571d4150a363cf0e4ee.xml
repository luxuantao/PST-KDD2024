<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Stacks and queues are fundamental data structures in computer science. But what is more powerful, a stack or a queue? In 1992, Heath et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> developed a graph-theoretic formulation of this question, where they defined the graph parameters stack-number and queue-number which respectively measure the power of stacks and queues to represent a given graph. Intuitively speaking, if some class of graphs has bounded stack-number and unbounded queue-number, then we would consider stacks to be more powerful than queues for that class (and vice-versa). It is known that the stack-number of a graph may be much larger than the queue-number. For example, Heath et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> proved that the n-vertex ternary Hamming graph has queue-number at most O (log n) and stack-number at least Ω(n<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>/9-ϵ ). Nevertheless, it is open whether every graph has stack-number bounded by a function of its queue-number, or whether every graph has queue-number bounded by a function of its stack-number <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>.</p><p>Planar graphs are the simplest class of graphs where it is unknown whether both stack and queue-number are bounded. In particular, Buss and Shor <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> first proved that planar graphs have bounded stack-number; the best known upper bound is 4 due to Yannakakis <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[115]</ref>. However, for the last 27 years of research on this topic, the most important open question in this field has been whether planar graphs have bounded queue-number. This question was first proposed by Heath et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> who conjectured that planar graphs have bounded queue-number. 1 This article proves this conjecture. Moreover, we generalise this result for graphs of bounded Euler genus, and for every proper minor-closed class of graphs. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref>First, we define the stack-number and queue-number of a graph G. Let V (G) and E (G), respectively, denote the vertex and edge set of G. Consider disjoint edges vw, xy ∈ E (G) and a linear ordering of V (G). Without loss of generality, v ≺ w and x ≺ y and v ≺ x. Then vw and xy are said to cross if v ≺ x ≺ w ≺ y and are said to nest if v ≺ x ≺ y ≺ w. A stack (with respect to ) is a set of pairwise non-crossing edges, and a queue (with respect to ) is a set of pairwise non-nested edges. Stacks resemble the stack data structure in the following sense. In a stack, traverse the vertex ordering left-to-right. When visiting vertex v, because of the non-crossing property, if x 1 , . . . , x d are the neighbours of v to the left of v in left-to-right order, then the edges x d v, x d -1 v, . . . , x 1 v will be on top of the stack in this order. Pop these edges off the stack. Then if y 1 , . . . ,y d are the neighbours of v to the right of v in left-to-right order, then push vy d , vy d -1 , . . . ,vy 1 onto the stack in this order. In this way, a stack of edges with respect to a linear ordering resembles a stack data structure. Analogously, the non-nesting condition in the definition of a queue implies that a queue of edges with respect to a linear ordering resembles a queue data structure.</p><p>For an integer k 0, a k-stack layout of a graph G consists of a linear ordering of V (G) and a partition E 1 , E 2 , . . . , E k of E (G) into stacks with respect to . Similarly, a k-queue layout of G consists of a linear ordering of V (G) and a partition E 1 , E 2 , . . . , E k of E (G) into queues with respect to . The stack-number of G, denoted by sn(G), is the minimum integer k such that G has a k-stack layout. The queue-number of a graph G, denoted by qn(G), is the minimum integer k such that G has a k-queue layout. Note that k-stack layouts are equivalent to k-page book embeddings, Planar Graphs Have Bounded Queue-Number first introduced by Ollmann <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[89]</ref>, and stack-number is also called page-number, book thickness, or fixed outer-thickness.</p><note type="other">22:3</note><p>Stack and queue layouts are inherently related to depth-first search and breadth-first search, respectively. For example, a DFS ordering of the vertices of a tree has no two crossing edges, and thus defines a 1-stack layout. Similarly, a BFS ordering of the vertices of a tree has no two nested edges, and thus defines a 1-queue layout. So every tree has stack-number 1 and queue-number 1.</p><p>For another example, consider the n × n grid graph with vertex set {(x, y) : x, y ∈ [n]} and edges of the form (x, y)(x + 1, y) and (x, y)(x, y + 1). Order the vertices first by x-coordinate and then by y-coordinate. Edges of the first type do not nest and edges of the second type do not nest. Thus, the n × n grid graph has a 2-queue layout. In fact, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, if we order the vertices by x + y and then by x-coordinate, then no two edges nest. So the n × n grid graph has queue-number 1.</p><p>As mentioned above, Heath et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> conjectured that planar graphs have bounded queuenumber. This conjecture has remained open despite much research on queue layouts <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">93,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">107]</ref>. We now review progress on this conjecture.</p><p>Pemmaraju <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[93]</ref> studied queue layouts and wrote that he "suspects" that a particular planar graph with n vertices has queue-number Θ(log n). The example he proposed had treewidth 3; see Section 2.2 for the definition of treewidth. Dujmović et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> proved that graphs of bounded treewidth have bounded queue-number. So Pemmaraju's example in fact has bounded queuenumber.</p><p>The first o(n) bound on the queue-number of planar graphs with n vertices was proved by Heath et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, who observed that every graph with m edges has a O ( √ m)-queue layout using a random vertex ordering. Thus, every planar graph with n vertices has queue-number O ( √ n), which can also be proved using the Lipton-Tarjan separator theorem. Di Battista et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> proved the first breakthrough on this topic, by showing that every planar graph with n vertices has queuenumber O (log 2 n). Dujmović <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> improved this bound to O (log n) with a simpler proof. Building on this work, Dujmović et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> established (poly-)logarithmic bounds for more general classes of graphs. For example, they proved that every graph with n vertices and Euler genus д has queuenumber O (д + log n), and that every graph with n vertices excluding a fixed minor has queuenumber log O (1) n.</p><p>Recently, Bekos et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> proved a second breakthrough result, by showing that planar graphs with bounded maximum degree have bounded queue-number. In particular, every planar graph with maximum degree Δ has queue-number at most O (Δ 6 ). Subsequently, Dujmović et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> proved that the algorithm of Bekos et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> in fact produces a O (Δ 2 )-queue layout. This was the state of the art prior to the current work. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref>22:4 V. Dujmović et al.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Main Results</head><p>The fundamental contribution of this article is to prove the conjecture of Heath et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> that planar graphs have bounded queue-number.</p><p>Theorem 1. The queue-number of planar graphs is bounded.</p><p>The best upper bound that we obtain for the queue-number of planar graphs is 49.</p><p>We extend Theorem 1 by showing that graphs with bounded Euler genus have bounded queuenumber.</p></div>

Every graph with Euler genus д has queue-number at most O (д).</head><p>The best upper bound that we obtain for the queue-number of graphs with Euler genus д is 4д + 49.</p><p>We generalise further to show the following: Theorem 3. Every proper minor-closed class of graphs has bounded queue-number.</p><p>These results are obtained through the introduction of a new tool, layered partitions, that have applications well beyond queue layouts. Loosely speaking, a layered partition of a graph G consists of a partition P of V (G) along with a layering of G, such that each part in P has a bounded number of vertices in each layer (called the layered width), and the quotient graph G/P has certain desirable properties, typically bounded treewidth. Layered partitions are the key tool for proving the above theorems. Subsequent to the initial release of this article, layered partitions and the results in this article have been used to solve the following well-known problems:</p><p>• Dujmović et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> prove that planar graphs have bounded non-repetitive chromatic number (resolving a conjecture of Alon et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> from 2002). This result generalises for graphs excluding any fixed graph as a subdivision. • Dębski et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> make dramatic improvements to the best known bounds for p-centered colourings of planar graphs and graphs excluding any fixed graph as a subdivision. • Bonamy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> find shorter adjacency labellings of planar graphs (improving on a sequence of results going back to 1988 <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75]</ref>). • Dujmović et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> find asymptotically optimal adjacency labellings of planar graphs. This result implies that, for every integer n &gt; 0, there is a graph with n 1+o (1) vertices that contains every n-vertex planar graph as an induced subgraph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Outline</head><p>The remainder of the article is organised as follows: In Section 2, we review relevant background including treewidth, layerings, and partitions, and we introduce layered partitions. Section 3 proves a fundamental lemma which shows that every graph that has a partition of bounded layered width has queue-number bounded by a function of the queue-number of the quotient graph.</p><p>In Section 4, we prove that every planar graph has a partition of layered width 1 such that the quotient graph has treewidth at most 8. Since graphs of bounded treewidth are known to have bounded queue-number <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, this implies Theorem 1 with an upper bound of 766. We then prove a variant of this result with layered width 3, where the quotient graph is planar with treewidth 3. This variant coupled with a better bound on the queue-number of treewidth-3 planar graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref> implies Theorem 1 with an upper bound of 49.</p><p>In Section 5, we prove that graphs of Euler genus д have partitions of layered width O (д) such that the quotient graph has treewidth O (1). This immediately implies that such graphs have queue-number O (д). These partitions are also required for the proof of Theorem 3 in Section 6. A more direct argument that appeals to Theorem 1 proves the bound 4д + 49 in Theorem 2.</p><p>In Section 6, we extend our results for layered partitions to the setting of almost-embeddable graphs with no apex vertices. Coupled with other techniques, this allows us to prove Theorem 3. We also characterise those minor-closed graph classes with the property that every graph in the class has a partition of bounded layered width such that the quotient has bounded treewidth.</p><p>In Section 7, we provide an alternative and helpful perspective on layered partitions in terms of strong products of graphs. With this viewpoint, we derive results about universal graphs that contain all planar graphs. Similar results are obtained for more general classes.</p><p>In Section 8, we prove that some well-known non-minor-closed classes of graphs, such as kplanar graphs, also have bounded queue-number.</p><p>Section 9 explores further applications and connections. We start off by giving an example where layered partitions lead to a simple proof of a known and difficult result about low treewidth colourings in proper minor-closed classes. Then we point out some of the many connections that layered partitions have with other graph parameters. We also present other implications of our results such as resolving open problems on 3-dimensional graph drawing.</p><p>Finally, Section 10 summarises and concludes with open problems and directions for future work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Layerings</head><p>The following well-known definitions are key concepts in our proofs, and that of several other articles on queue layouts <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>. A layering of a graph G is an ordered partition</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(V 0 , V 1 , . . . ) of V (G) such that for every edge vw ∈ E(G), if v ∈ V i and w ∈ V j , then |i -j | 1. If i = j, then vw is an intra-level edge. If |i -j | = 1, then vw is an inter-level edge. If r is a vertex in a connected graph G and V i := {v ∈ V (G) : dist G (r , v) = i} for all i 0, then (V 0 , V 1 , . . . ) is called a BFS layering of G rooted at r .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Treewidth and Layered Treewidth</head><p>First, we introduce the notion of H -decomposition and tree-decomposition. For graphs H and G, an H -decomposition of G consists of a collection (B x ⊆ V (G) : x ∈ V (H )) of subsets of V (G), called bags, indexed by the vertices of H , and with the following properties:</p><p>• for every vertex v of G, the set {x ∈ V (H ) : v ∈ B x } induces a non-empty connected subgraph of H , and • for every edge vw of G, there is a vertex x ∈ V (H ) for which v, w ∈ B x .</p><p>The width of such an H -decomposition is max{|B x | : x ∈ V (H )} -1. The elements of V (H ) are called nodes, while the elements of V (G) are called vertices.</p><p>A tree-decomposition is a T -decomposition for some tree T . The treewidth of a graph G is the minimum width of a tree-decomposition of G. Treewidth measures how similar a given graph is to a tree. It is particularly important in structural and algorithmic graph theory; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[96]</ref>, for surveys. Tree decompositions were introduced by Robertson and Seymour <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[99]</ref>; the more general notion of H -decomposition was introduced by Diestel and Kühn <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>As mentioned in Section 1, Dujmović et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> first proved that graphs of bounded treewidth have bounded queue-number. Their bound on the queue-number was doubly exponential in the treewidth. Wiechert <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[107]</ref> improved this bound to singly exponential. <ref type="bibr">Lemma 4 ([107]</ref>). Every graph with treewidth k has queue-number at most 2 k -1.</p><p>Alam et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> also improved the bound in the case of planar 3-trees. (A k-tree is an edge-maximal graph of tree-width k.) The following lemma, which will be useful later, is implied by this result and the fact that every planar graph of treewidth at most 3 is a subgraph of a planar 3-tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[82]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Lemma 5 ([2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">82]</ref>). Every planar graph with treewidth at most 3 has queue-number at most 5.</p><p>Graphs with bounded treewidth provide important examples of minor-closed classes. However, planar graphs have unbounded treewidth. For example, the n × n planar grid graph has treewidth n. So the above results do not resolve the question of whether planar graphs have bounded queuenumber.</p><p>Dujmović et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> and Shahrokhi <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[105]</ref> independently introduced the following concept. The layered treewidth of a graph G is the minimum integer k such that G has a tree-decomposition (B x : x ∈ V (T )) and a layering (V 0 , V 1 , . . . ) such that |B x ∩ V i | k for every bag B x and layer V i . Applications of layered treewidth include graph colouring <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">83]</ref>, graph drawing <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>, book embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, and intersection graph theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[105]</ref>. The related notion of layered pathwidth has also been studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. Most relevant to this article, Dujmović et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> proved that every graph with n vertices and layered treewidth k has queue-number at most O (k log n). They then proved that planar graphs have layered treewidth at most 3, that graphs of Euler genus д have layered treewidth at most 2д + 3, and more generally that a minor-closed class has bounded layered treewidth if and only if it excludes some apex graph. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">4</ref> This implies O (log n) bounds on the queue-number for all these graphs, and was the basis for the log O (1) n bound for proper minorclosed classes mentioned in Section 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Partitions and Layered Partitions</head><p>The following definitions are central notions in this article. A vertex-partition, or simply partition, of a graph G is a set P of non-empty sets of vertices in G such that each vertex of G is in exactly one element of P. Each element of P is called a part. The quotient (sometimes called the touching pattern) of P is the graph, denoted by G/P, with vertex set P where distinct parts A, B ∈ P are adjacent in G/P if and only if some vertex in A is adjacent in G to some vertex in B.</p><p>A partition of G is connected if the subgraph induced by each part is connected. In this case, the quotient is the minor of G obtained by contracting each part into a single vertex. Most of our results for queue layouts do not depend on the connectivity of partitions. But we consider it to be of independent interest that many of the partitions constructed in this article are connected. Then the quotient is a minor of the original graph.</p><p>A partition P of a graph G is called an H -partition if H is a graph that contains a spanning subgraph isomorphic to the quotient G/P. Alternatively, an H -partition of a graph G is a partition (A x : x ∈ V (H )) of V (G) indexed by the vertices of H , such that, for every edge vw ∈ E (G), if Planar Graphs Have Bounded Queue-Number 22:7 v ∈ A x and w ∈ A y , then x = y (and vw is called an intra-bag edge) or xy ∈ E(H ) (and vw is called an inter-bag edge). The width of such an H -partition is max{|A x | : x ∈ V (H )}. Note that a layering is equivalent to a path-partition.</p><p>A tree-partition is a T -partition for some tree T . Tree-partitions are well studied with several applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">104,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">111]</ref>. For example, every graph with treewidth k and maximum degree Δ has a tree-partition of width O (kΔ); see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[111]</ref>. This easily leads to a O (kΔ) upper bound on the queue-number <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. However, dependence on Δ seems unavoidable when studying tree-partitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[111]</ref>, so we instead consider H -partitions where H has bounded treewidth greater than 1. This idea has been used by many authors in a variety of applications, including cops and robbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, fractional colouring <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[97,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">103]</ref>, generalised colouring numbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>, and defective and clustered colouring <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> for more on partitions of graphs in a proper minorclosed class.</p><p>A key innovation of this article is to consider a layered variant of partitions (analogous to layered treewidth being a layered variant of treewidth). The layered width of a partition P of a graph G is the minimum integer such that for some layering (V 0 , V 1 , . . . ) of G, each part in P has at most vertices in each layer V i .</p><p>The n × n grid graph G provides an instructive example. The columns determine a partition P of layered width 1 with respect to the layering determined by the rows. The quotient G/P is an n-vertex path.</p><p>Throughout this article, we consider partitions with bounded layered width such that the quotient has bounded treewidth. We therefore introduce the following definition: A class G of graphs is said to admit bounded layered partitions if there exist k, ∈ N such that every graph G ∈ G has a partition P with layered width at most such that G/P has treewidth at most k. We first show that this property immediately implies bounded layered treewidth. Lemma 6. If a graph G has an H -partition with layered width at most such that H has treewidth at most k, then G has layered treewidth at most (k + 1) .</p><p>Proof. Let (B x : x ∈ V (T )) be a tree-decomposition of H with bags of size at most k + 1. Replace each instance of a vertex v of H in a bag B x by the part corresponding to v in the H -partition. Keep the same layering of G. Since |B x | k + 1, we obtain a tree-decomposition of G with layered width at most (k + 1) . Lemma 6 means that any property that holds for graph classes with bounded layered treewidth also holds for graph classes that admit bounded layered partitions. For example, Norin proved that every n-vertex graph with layered treewidth at most k has treewidth less than 2 √ kn (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>). With Lemma 6, this implies that if an n-vertex graph G has a partition with layered width such that the quotient graph has treewidth at most k, then G has treewidth at most 2 (k + 1) n. This in turn leads to O ( √ n) balanced separator theorems for such graphs. Lemma 6 suggests that having a partition of bounded layered width, whose quotient has bounded treewidth, seems to be a more stringent requirement than having bounded layered treewidth. Indeed the former structure leads to O (1) bounds on the queue-number, instead of O (log n) bounds obtained via layered treewidth. That said, it is open whether graphs of bounded layered treewidth have bounded queue-number.</p><p>Before continuing, we show that if one does not care about the exact treewidth bound, then it suffices to consider partitions with layered width 1. Lemma 7. If a graph G has an H -partition of layered width with respect to a layering (V 0 , V 1 , . . . ), for some graph H of treewidth at most k, then G has an H -partition of layered width 1 with respect to the same layering, for some graph H of treewidth at most (k + 1) -1. Proof. Let (A v : v ∈ V (H )) be an H -partition of G of layered width with respect to (V 0 , V 1 , . . . ), for some graph H of treewidth at most k. Let (B x : x ∈ V (T )) be a tree-decomposition of H with width at most k. Let H be the graph obtained from H by replacing each vertex v of H by an -clique X v and replacing each edge vw of H by a complete bipartite graph K , between X v and X w . For each x ∈ V (T ), let B x := ∪{X v : v ∈ B x }. Observe that (B x : x ∈ V (T )) is a treedecomposition of H of width at most (k + 1) -1. For each vertex v of H , and layer V i , there are at most vertices in A v ∩ V i . Assign each vertex in A v ∩ V i to a distinct element of X v . We obtain an H -partition of G with layered width 1, and the treewidth of H is at most (k + 1) -1.</p></div>

For each edge v i v j ∈ E(H ), add an edge to G between each vertex in B i and each vertex in B j . Then, the vertex-ordering of G obtained from v 1 , . . . ,v n by replacing each v i by B i admits an -queue layout of G.</p><p>Proof. A rainbow in a vertex ordering of a graph G is a set of pairwise nested edges (and thus a matching). Say R is a rainbow in the ordering of V (G). Heath and Rosenberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> proved that a vertex ordering of any graph admits a k-queue layout if and only if every rainbow has size at most k. Thus it suffices to prove that |R| . If the right endpoints of R belong to at least two different blocks, and the left endpoints of R belong to at least two different blocks, then no endpoint of the innermost edge in R and no endpoint of the outermost edge in R are in a common block, implying that the corresponding edges in H have no endpoint in common, and therefore are nested. Since no two edges in H are nested, without loss of generality, the left endpoints of R belong to one block. Hence, there are at most left endpoints of R, implying |R| , as desired.</p><p>In what follows, the graph G in Lemma 9 is called an -blowup of H .</p><p>Proof of Lemma 8.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">PROOF OF THEOREM 1: PLANAR GRAPHS</head><p>Our proof that planar graphs have bounded queue-number employs Corollary 10. Thus, our goal is to show that planar graphs admit bounded layered partitions, which is achieved in the following key contribution of this article.</p><p>Theorem 11. Every planar graph G has a connected partition P with layered width 1 such that G/P has treewidth at most 8. Moreover, there is such a partition for every BFS layering of G.</p><p>This theorem and Corollary 10 imply that planar graphs have bounded queue-number (Theorem 1) with an upper bound of 3(2 8 -1) + 3 2 3 = 766. We now set out to prove Theorem 11. The proof is inspired by the following elegant result of Pilipczuk and Siebertz <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[94]</ref>: Every planar graph G has a partition P into geodesics such that G/P has treewidth at most 8. Here, a geodesic is a path of minimum length between its endpoints. We consider the following particular type of geodesic. If T is a tree rooted at a vertex r , then a nonempty path (x 1 , . . . , x p ) in T is vertical if for some d 0 for all i ∈ {0, . . . ,p} we have dist T (x i , r ) = d + i. The vertex x 1 is called the upper endpoint of the path and x p is its lower endpoint. Note that every vertical path in a BFS spanning tree is a geodesic. Thus, the next theorem strengthens the result of Pilipczuk and Siebertz <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[94]</ref>.</p><p>Theorem 12. Let T be a rooted spanning tree in a connected planar graph G. Then G has a partition P into vertical paths in T such that G/P has treewidth at most 8.</p><p>Proof of Theorem 11 Assuming Theorem 12. We may assume that G is connected (since if each component of G has the desired partition, then so does G). Let T be a BFS spanning tree of G. By Theorem 12, G has a partition P into vertical paths in T such that G/P has treewidth at most 8. Each path in P is connected and has at most one vertex in each BFS layer corresponding to T . Hence P is connected and has layered width 1.</p><p>The proof of Theorem 12 is an inductive proof of a stronger statement given in Lemma 13 below. A plane graph is a graph embedded in the plane with no crossings. A near-triangulation is a plane graph, where the outer-face is a simple cycle, and every internal face is a triangle. For a cycle C, we write C = [P 1 , . . . , P k ] if P 1 , . . . , P k are pairwise disjoint non-empty paths in C, and the endpoints of each path P i can be labelled x i and y i so that y i x i+1 ∈ E(C) for i ∈ {1, . . . , k }, where x k+1 means x 1 . This implies that V (C) = k i=1 V (P i ). Lemma 13. Let G + be a plane triangulation, let T be a spanning tree of G + rooted at some vertex r on the outer-face of G + , and let P 1 , . . . , P k for some k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 6}, be pairwise disjoint vertical paths in T such that F = [P 1 , . . . , P k ] is a cycle in G + . Let G be the near-triangulation consisting of all the edges and vertices of G + contained in F and the interior of F .</p><p>Then G has a partition P into paths in G that are vertical in T , such that P 1 , . . . , P k ∈ P and the quotient H := G/P has a tree-decomposition in which every bag has size at most 9 and some bag contains all the vertices of H corresponding to P 1 , . . . , P k .</p><p>Proof of Theorem 12 Assuming Lemma 13. The result is trivial if |V (G)| &lt; 3. Now assume |V (G)| 3. Let r be the root of T . Let G + be a plane triangulation containing G as a spanning subgraph with r on the outer-face of G. The three vertices on the outer-face of G are vertical (singleton) paths in T . Thus, G + satisfies the assumptions of Lemma 13 with k = 3, which implies that G + has a partition P into vertical paths in T such that G + /P has treewidth at most 8. Note that G/P is a subgraph of G + /P. Hence, G/P has treewidth at most 8.</p><p>Our proof of Lemma 13 employs the following well-known variation of Sperner's Lemma (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>): Lemma 14 (Sperner's Lemma). Let G be a near-triangulation whose vertices are coloured 1,2,3, with the outer-face F = [P 1 , P 2 , P 3 ] where each vertex in P i is coloured i. Then, G contains an internal face whose vertices are coloured 1,2,3.</p><p>Proof of Lemma 13. The proof is by induction on n = |V (G)|. If n = 3, then G is a 3-cycle and k 3. The partition into vertical paths is P = {P 1 , . . . , P k }. The tree-decomposition of H consists of a single bag that contains the k 3 vertices corresponding to P 1 , . . . , P k .</p><p>For n &gt; 3, we wish to make use of Sperner's Lemma on some (not necessarily proper) 3colouring of the vertices of G. We begin by colouring the vertices of F , as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. There are three cases to consider:</p><p>(1) If k = 1, then, since F is a cycle, P 1 has at least three vertices, so P 1 = [v, P 1 , w] for two distinct vertices v and w. We set R 1 := v, R 2 := P 1 , and R 3 := w. (2) If k = 2, then we may assume without loss of generality that P 1 has at least two vertices so For i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, colour each vertex in R i by i. Now, for each remaining vertex v in G, consider the path P v from v to the root of T . Since r is on the outer-face of G + , P v contains at least one vertex of F . If the first vertex of P v that belongs to F is in R i , then assign the colour i to v. In this way, we obtain a 3-colouring of the vertices of G that satisfies the conditions of Sperner's Lemma. Therefore, by Sperner's Lemma, there exists a triangular face τ = v 1 v 2 v 3 of G whose vertices are coloured 1, 2, 3, respectively.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">P 1 = [v, P 1 ].

If Q i and Q i+1 are non-empty, then each is a vertical path in T . Furthermore, each of R - i and R + i+1 consists of at most two vertical paths in T . Thus, F i is the concatenation of at most six vertical paths in T . Let G i be the near-triangulation consisting of all the edges and vertices of G + contained in F i and the interior of F i . Observe that G i contains v i and v i+1 but not the third vertex of τ . Therefore, F i satisfies the conditions of the lemma and has fewer than n vertices. So we may apply induction on F i to obtain a partition P i of G i into vertical paths in T , such that H i := G i /P i has a tree-decomposition (B i x : x ∈ V (J i )) in which every bag has size at most 9, and some bag B i u i contains the vertices of H i corresponding to the at most six vertical paths that form F i . We do this for each non-degenerate F i .</p><p>We now construct the desired partition P of G. Initialise P := {P 1 , . . . , P k }. Then, add each nonempty Q i to P. Now, for each non-degenerate F i , each path in P i is either an external path (that is, fully contained in F i ) or is an internal path with none of its vertices in F i . Add all the internal paths of P i to P. By construction, P partitions V (G) into vertical paths in T and P contains P 1 , . . . , P k . Let H := G/P. Next, we exhibit the desired tree-decomposition (B x : x ∈ V (J )) of H . Let J be the tree obtained from the disjoint union of J i , taken over the i ∈ {1, 2, 3} such that F i is nondegenerate, by adding one new node u adjacent to each u i .

This completes the description of (B x : x ∈ V (J )). By construction, |B x | 9 for every x ∈ V (J ).</p><p>First, we show that for each vertex a in H , the set X := {x ∈ V (J ) : a ∈ B x } forms a subtree of J . If a corresponds to a path distinct from P 1 , . . . , P k , Q 1 , Q 2 , Q 3 , then X is fully contained in J i for some i ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Thus, by induction, X is non-empty and connected in J i , so it is in J . If a corresponds to P, which is one of the paths among P 1 , . . . , P k , Q 1 , Q 2 , Q 3 , then u ∈ X and whenever X contains a vertex of J i it is because some external path of P i was replaced by P. In particular, we would have u i ∈ X in that case. Again, by induction each X ∩ J i is connected and since uu i ∈ E(T ), we conclude that X induces a (connected) subtree of J .</p><p>Finally, we show that, for every edge ab of H , there is a bag B x that contains a and b. If a and b are both obtained by contracting any of P 1 , . . . , P k , Q 1 , Q 2 , Q 3 , then a and b both appear in B u . If a and b are both in H i for some i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, then some bag B i</p><p>x contains both a and b. Finally, when a is obtained by contracting a path P a in G i -V (F i ) and b is obtained by contracting a path P b not in G i , then the cycle F i separates P a from P b so the edge ab is not present in H . This concludes the proof that (B x : x ∈ V (J )) is the desired tree-decomposition of H .</p></div>

Also note that Theorem 15 is tight in terms of the treewidth of H : For every , there exists a planar graph G such that, if G has a partition P of layered width , then G/P has treewidth at least 3. We give this construction at the end of this section, and prove Theorem 15 first. Theorem 11 was proved via an inductive proof of a stronger statement given in Lemma 13. Similarly, the proof of Theorem 15 is via an inductive proof of a stronger statement given in Lemma 17, below.</p><p>While Theorem 12 partitions the vertices of a planar graph into vertical paths, to prove Theorem 15 we instead partition the vertices of a triangulation G + into parts each of which is a union of up to three vertical paths. Formally, in a rooted spanning tree T of a graph G, a tripod consists of up to three pairwise disjoint vertical paths in T whose lower endpoints form a clique in G. Theorem 15 quickly follows from the next result. Theorem 16. Let T be a rooted spanning tree in a triangulation G. Then, G has a partition P into tripods in T such that G/P has treewidth at most 3.</p><p>Proof of Theorem 15 Assuming Theorem 16. We may assume that G is connected (since if each component of G has the desired partition, then so does G). Let T be a BFS spanning tree of G. Let (V 0 , V 1 , . . . ) be the BFS layering corresponding to T . Let G be a plane triangulation containing G as a spanning subgraph. By Theorem 16, G has a partition P into tripods in T such that G /P is planar with treewidth at most 3. Then P is a partition of G such that G/P is planar with treewidth at most 3. Each part in P corresponds to a tripod, which has at most three vertices in each layer V i . Hence, P has layered width at most 3.</p><p>Theorem 16 is proved via the following lemma: Lemma 17. Let G + be a plane triangulation, let T be a spanning tree of G + rooted at some vertex r on the boundary of the outer-face of G + , and let P 1 , . . . , P k , for some k ∈ {1, 2, 3}, be pairwise disjoint bipods such that F = [P 1 , . . . , P k ] is a cycle in G + with r in its exterior.

LetT be a spanning tree in a triangulation G rooted at vertex v. We may assume that v is on the boundary of the outer-face of G. Let G + be the plane triangulation obtained from G by adding one new vertex r into the outer-face of G and adjacent to each vertex on the boundary of the outer-face of G. Let T + be the spanning tree of G + obtained from T by adding r and the edge rv. Consider T + to be rooted at r . Let P 1 , P 2 , P 3 be the singleton paths consisting of the three vertices on the boundary of the outer-face of G. Then, P 1 , P 2 , P 3 are disjoint bipods such that F = [P 1 , P 2 , P 3 ] is a cycle in G + with r in its exterior. Moreover, the near triangulation consisting of all the edges and vertices of G + contained in F and the interior of F is G itself. Thus, G and G + satisfy the assumptions of Lemma 17, which implies that G has a partition P into tripods in T such G/P has treewidth at most 3.</p><p>The remainder of this section is devoted to proving Lemma 17.</p><p>Proof of Lemma 17. This proof follows the same approach as the proof of Lemma 13, by induction on n = |V (G)|. We focus mainly on the differences here. The base case n = 3 is trivial.</p><p>As before, we partition the vertices of F into paths R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 . If k = 3, then R i := P i for i ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Otherwise, as before, we split P 1 into two (when k = 2) or three (when k = 1) paths.</p><p>We apply the same colouring as in the proof of Lemma 13. Then, Sperner's Lemma gives a face τ = v 1 v 2 v 3 of G whose vertices are coloured 1, 2, 3, respectively. As in the proof of Lemma 13, we obtain vertical paths Q 1 , Q 2 , and Q 3 where each Q i is a path in T from v i to R i . Remove the last vertex from each Q i to obtain (possibly empty) paths Q 1 , Q 2 , and</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">Q 3 . Let Y be the tripod consisting of Q 1 ∪ Q 2 ∪ Q 3 plus the edges of τ between non-empty Q 1 , Q 2 , Q 3 .</formula><p>As before, we consider the graph consisting of the edges and vertices of τ , the edges and vertices of F and the edges and vertices of Q 1 , Q 2 , Q 3 .

As before, let G i be the subgraph of G whose vertices and edges are in F i or its interior.</p><p>For i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, if F i is non-empty, then G i and</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">F i = [R + i , R - i+1 , I i ]</formula><p>satisfy the conditions of the lemma, and G i has fewer vertices than G. Thus, we may apply induction to G i . (Note that one or two of R + i , R - i+1 , and I i may be empty, in which case we apply the inductive hypothesis with k = 2 or k = 1, respectively.) This gives a partition P i of G i such that H i := G i /P i satisfies the conclusions of the lemma. Let (B i x : x ∈ V (J i )) be a tree-decomposition of H i , in which every bag has size at most 4, and some bag B i u i contains the vertices of H i corresponding to R + i , R - i+1 , and I i (if they are non-empty).</p><p>We construct P as before. Initialise P := {P 1 , . . . , P k , Y }. Then, for i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, each tripod in P i is either fully contained in F i or it is internal with none of its vertices in F i . Add all these internal tripods in P i to P. By construction, P partitions V (G) into tripods. The graph H := G/P is planar since G is planar and each tripod in P induces a connected subgraph of G.</p><p>Next we produce the tree-decomposition (B x : x ∈ V (J )) of H that satisfies the requirements of the lemma. Let J be the tree obtained from the disjoint union of J 1 , J 2 , and J 3 by adding one new node u adjacent to u 1 , u 2 , and u 3 . Let B u be the set of at most four vertices of H corresponding to Y , P 1 , . . . , P k . For i ∈ {1, 2, 3} and for each node x ∈ V (J i ), initialise B x := B i x . As in the proof of Lemma 13, the resulting structure, (B x : x ∈ V (J )), is not yet a treedecomposition of H since some bags may contain vertices of H i that are not necessarily vertices of H . Note that, unlike in Lemma 13, this does not only include elements of P i that are contained in F . In particular, I i is also not an element of P and thus does not correspond to a vertex of H . We remedy this as follows: For x ∈ V (J ), in bag B x , replace each instance of the vertex of H i corresponding to I i by the vertex of H corresponding to Y . Similarly, by construction, R + i is a subgraph of P α i for some α i ∈ {1, . . . , k }. For x ∈ V (J ), in bag B x , replace each instance of the vertex of H i corresponding to R + i by the vertex of H corresponding to P α i . Finally, R - i+1 is a subgraph of P β i for some β i ∈ {1, . . . , k }. For x ∈ V (J ), in bag B x , replace each instance of the vertex of H i corresponding to R - i+1 by the vertex of H corresponding to P β i . This completes the description of (B x : x ∈ V (J )). Clearly, every bag B x has size at most 4. The proof that (B x : x ∈ V (J )) is indeed a tree-decomposition of H is completely analogous to the proof in Lemma 13.</p><p>The following lemma, which is implied by Theorem 15 and Lemmas 4 and 8, will be helpful for generalising our results to bounded genus graphs.

For all integers k 2 and 1, there is a graph G with treewidth k such that, if G has a partition P with layered width at most , then G/P contains K k+1 and thus has treewidth at least k. Moreover, if k = 2, then G is outer-planar; and if k = 3, then G is planar.</p><p>Proof. We proceed by induction on k. Consider the base case with k = 2. Let G be the graph obtained from the path on 9 2 + 3 vertices by adding one dominant vertex v (the so-called fan graph). Consider an H -partition (A x : x ∈ V (H )) of G with layered width at most . Since v is dominant in G, each vertex is on the layer containing v, the previous layer, or the subsequent layer. Thus, we may assume there are at most three layers, and each part A x has at most 3 vertices. Say v is in part A x . Consider deleting A x from G. This deletes at most 3 -1 vertices from the path Gv. Thus, G -A x is the union of at most 3 paths, with at least 9 2 + 1 vertices in total. Therefore, one such path P in G -A x has at least 3 + 1 vertices. Thus, there is an edge yz in Hx, such that P ∩ A y ∅ and P ∩ A z ∅. Since v is dominant, x is dominant in H . Hence, {x, y, z} induces K 3 in H . Now assume the result for k -1. Thus, there is a graph Q with treewidth k -1 such that, if Q has an H -partition with width at most , then H contains K k . Let G be obtained by taking 3 copies of Q and adding one dominant vertex v. Thus, G has treewidth k. Consider an H -partition (A x : x ∈ V (H )) of G with layered width at most . Since v is dominant, there are at most three layers, and each part has at most 3 vertices. Say v is in part A x . Since |A x | 3 , some copy of Q avoids A x . Thus, this copy of Q has an (Hx )-partition of layered width at most . By assumption, Hx contains K k . Since v is dominant, x is dominant in H . Therefore, H contains K k+1 , as desired.</p><p>In the k = 2 case, G is outer-planar. Thus, in the k = 3 case, G is planar.</p></div>

Taking this argument one step further, there is an infinite graph T k with treewidth k that contains every (finite) graph with treewidth k as a subgraph. Similarly, the infinite path Q contains every (finite) path as a subgraph. Thus, our results imply that T 8 Q contains every planar graph.

Thus, f (x i , x i+1 ) = f (y i , y i+1 ) and q(x i x i+1 ) = q(y i y i+1 ) and h(x i x i+1 ) = h(y i y i+1 ) for i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , }. Thus, x i x i+1 and y i y i+1 are not nested. Since v = x 0 ≺ y 0 = p, we have x 1 y 1 . Since h(x 0 x 1 ) = h(y 0 y 1 ) and both x 1 and y 1 have degree at most Δ in G 0 , we have x 1 ≺ y 1 . It follows by induction that x i ≺ y i for i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , + 1}, where, in the last step, we use the assumption that w q. In particular, w = x +1 ≺ y +1 = q. Thus, vw and pq are not nested.

Start with a graph G 0 embedded in a surface of Euler genus д, with each face labelled a "nation" or a "lake", where each vertex of G 0 is incident with at most d nations. Let G be the graph whose vertices are the nations of G 0 , where two vertices are adjacent in G if the corresponding faces in G 0 share a vertex. Then, G is called a (д, d )-map graph. A (0, d )-map graph is called a (plane) d-map graph; such graphs have been extensively studied <ref type="bibr">[23-25, 27, 61]</ref>. The (д, 3)-map graphs are precisely the graphs of Euler genus at most д (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>). So (д, d )-map graphs provide a natural generalisation of graphs embedded in a surface. Proposition 45. Every (д, d )-map graph G has queue-number at most 2(8д + 98)(d + 1)). 3   Proof. It is known that G is the half-square of a bipartite graph G 0 with Euler genus д (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>). This means that G 0 has a bipartition {A, B}, such that every vertex in B has degree at most k, V (G) = A, and for every edge vw ∈ E (G), there is a common neighbour of v and w in B.

For all integers д 0 and k 2, every (д, k )-string graph has queue-number at most 2(40д + 490) 2k+1 .</p><p>Proof. We may assume that in the representation of G, no curve is self-intersecting, no three curves intersect at a common point, and no two curves intersect at an endpoint of one of the curves. Let G 0 be the graph obtained by adding a vertex at the intersection point of any two distinct curves, and at the endpoints of each curve.

Associate each vertex v of G with a vertex v 0 of G 0 at the endpoint of the curve representing v. For each edge vw of G, there is v 0 w 0 -path in G 0 of length at most 2k, such that every internal vertex on P has degree at most 4. By Theorem 2, G 0 has a (4д + 49)-queue layout. The result then follows from Lemma 43 with Δ = 4 and c = 2k.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">APPLICATIONS AND CONNECTIONS</head><p>In this section, we show that layered partitions lead to a simple proof of a known result about low treewidth colourings, and we discuss implications of our results such as resolving open problems about 3-dimensional graph drawings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.1">Low Treewidth Colourings</head><p>DeVos et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> proved that every graph in a proper minor-closed class can be edge 2-coloured so that each monochromatic subgraph has bounded treewidth, and more generally, that for fixed c 2, every such graph can be edge c-coloured such that the union of any c -1 colour classes has bounded treewidth. They also showed analogous vertex-colouring results. (Of course, in both cases, by a colouring, we mean a non-proper colouring). Here, we show that these results can be easily proved using layered partitions. The reader should not confuse this result with a different Borodin <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> proved that planar graphs have acyclic chromatic number at most 5, which with Lemma 52 and Theorem 1 implies: Theorem 53. Every planar graph has track-number at most 5(2 • 49) 4 = 461, 184, 080.</p><p>Note that the best lower bound on the track-number of planar graphs is 8, due to Pupyrev <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[95]</ref>. Heawood <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> and Alon et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, respectively, proved that every graph with Euler genus д has chromatic number O (д 1/2 ) and acyclic chromatic number O (д 4/<ref type="foot" target="#foot_9">7</ref> ). We now briefly show that (д, k )-planar graphs have bounded track-number. First, note that every graph with layered treewidth k has acyclic chromatic number at most 5k [Proof. Van den Heuvel and Wood <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref> proved that every graph with layered treewidth k has strong r -colouring number at most k (2r + 1), and Kierstead and Yang <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[76]</ref> proved that every graph has acyclic chromatic number at most its strong 2-colouring number.] Dujmović et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> proved that every (д, k )-planar graph G has layered treewidth at most (4д + 6)(k + 1). Thus, G has acyclic chromatic number at most 5(4д + 6)(k + 1), and has bounded track-number by Lemma 52 and Proposition 44. Dujmović et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> also proved that every (д, d )-map graph and every (д, k )-planar graph has bounded layered treewidth. By the same argument, such graphs have bounded track-number.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.3">Three-Dimensional Graph Drawing</head><p>Further motivation for studying queue and track layouts is their connection with 3-dimensional graph drawing. A 3-dimensional grid drawing of a graph G represents the vertices of G by distinct grid points in Z 3 and represents each edge of G by the open segment between its endpoints so that no two edges intersect. The volume of a 3-dimensional grid drawing is the number of grid points in the smallest axis-aligned grid-box that encloses the drawing. For example, Cohen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> proved that the complete graph K n has a 3-dimensional grid drawing with volume O (n 3 ) and this bound is optimal. Pach et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[91]</ref> proved that every graph with bounded chromatic number has a 3-dimensional grid drawing with volume O (n 2 ), and this bound is optimal for K n/2,n/2 .</p><p>Track layouts and 3-dimensional graph drawings are connected by the following lemma.</p><p>Lemma 56 <ref type="bibr">([48, 53]</ref>). If a c-colourable n-vertex graph G has a t-track layout, then G has 3dimensional grid drawings with O (t 2 n) volume and with O (c 7 tn) volume. Conversely, if a graph G has a 3-dimensional grid drawing with A × B × C bounding box, then G has track-number at most 2AB. Lemma 56 is the foundation for all of the following results. Dujmović and Wood <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> proved that every graph with bounded maximum degree has a 3-dimensional grid drawing with volume O (n 3/2 ), and the same bound holds for graphs from a proper minor-closed class. In fact, for fixed d, every d-degenerate graph 7 has a 3-dimensional grid drawing with O (n 3/2 ) volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Dujmović et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> proved that every graph with bounded treewidth has a 3-dimensional grid drawing with volume O (n).</p><p>Prior to this work, whether planar graphs have 3-dimensional grid drawings with O (n) volume was a major open problem, due to Felsner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. The previous best known bound on the volume results of Knauer et al. imply that planar posets of height h have queue-number O (h); see Theorem 6 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[77]</ref>. Heath and Pemmaraju <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> also conjecture that every poset of width w (the maximum number of pairwise incomparable elements) has queue-number at most w. The best known upper bounds are O (w 2 ) for general posets and 3w -2 for planar posets <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[77]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> It is natural to ask for the largest class of graphs with bounded queue-number. First note that Theorem 3 cannot be extended to the setting of an excluded topological minor, since graphs with bounded degree have arbitrarily high queue-number <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">109]</ref>. However, it is possible that every class of graphs with strongly sub-linear separators has bounded queuenumber. Here a class G of graphs has strongly sub-linear separators if G is closed under taking subgraphs, and there exists constants c, β &gt; 0, such that every n-vertex graph in G has a balanced separator of order cn 1-β . Already the β = 1 2 case looks challenging, since this would imply Theorem 3. ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) Is there a polynomial function f such that every graph with treewidth k has queue-number at most f (k )? The best lower and upper bounds on f (k ) are k + 1 and 2 k -1, both due to Wiechert <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[107]</ref>. (8) Do the results in the present article have algorithmic applications? Consider the method of Baker <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for designing polynomial-time approximation schemes for problems on planar graphs. This method partitions the graph into BFS layers, such that the problem can be solved optimally on each layer (since the induced subgraph has bounded treewidth), and then combines the solutions from each layer. Our results (Theorem 11) give a more precise description of the layered structure of planar graphs (and other more general classes). It is conceivable that this extra structural information is useful when designing algorithms. Note that all our proofs lead to polynomial-time algorithms for computing the desired decomposition and queue layout. Pilipczuk and Siebertz <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[94]</ref> claim O (n 2 ) time complexity for their decomposition. The same is true for Lemma 13: Given the colours of the vertices on F , we can walk down the BFS tree T in linear time and colour every vertex. Another linear-time enumeration of the faces contained in F finds the trichromatic triangle. It is easily seen that Lemma 21 has polynomial-time complexity (given the embedding). Polynomial-time algorithms for our other results follow based on the linear-time algorithm of Mohar <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[85]</ref> to test if a given graph has Euler genus at most any fixed number д, and the polynomial-time algorithm of Demaine et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> for computing the decomposition in the graph minor structure theorem (Theorem 23).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 . 1 -</head><label>11</label><figDesc>Fig. 1. 1-Queue layout of grid graph.</figDesc></figure>

Note that (V 0 ∪ X , V 1 , V 2 , . . . ) is a layering of G (since all the neighbours of vertices in X are in V 0 ∪ V 1 ∪ X ). We now add the vertices in X to the partition of G + 0 to obtain the desired partition of G. We add each such vertex as a singleton part. Formally, let H be the graph with V (H ) := V (H 0 ) ∪ X . For each vertex v ∈ X , let A v := {v}. Initialise E (H ) := E (H 0 ). For each edge vw in some vortex G i , if x and y are the vertices of H for which v ∈ A x and w ∈ A y , then add the edge xy to H . Now (A x : x ∈ V (H )) is a connected H -partition of G with width max{2д + 4p -4, 1} with respect to (V 0 ∪ X , V 1 , V 2 , V 3 , . . . ) (since each new part is a singleton).</p><p>We now modify the tree-decomposition of H 0 to obtain the desired tree-decomposition of H . Let (C y : y ∈ V (T )) be the tree-decomposition of H obtained from (C y : y ∈ V (T )) as follows. Initialise C y := C y for each y ∈ V (T ). For i ∈ {1, . . . , s} and for each vertex u ∈ V (F i ) and for each node y ∈ V (T ) with u ∈ C y , add B i u to C y . Since |C y | 10 and |B i u | k + 1, we have |C y | 11(k + 1). We now show that (C y : y ∈ V (T )) is a tree-decomposition of H . Consider a vertex v ∈ X . So v is in G i for some i ∈ {1, . . . , s}.

Let T j be the subtree of T corresponding to bags that contain x j . Since u j u j+1 is an edge of G 0 , either x j = x j+1 or x j x j+1 is an edge of H . In each case, by the definition of tree-decomposition, T j and T j+1 share a vertex in common. Thus,</p><p>precisely the subtree of T corresponding to bags that contain v.

Since each edge of G 1 ∪ • • • ∪ G s has both its endpoints in some bag B i u , and some bag C y contains B i u , the 'edge-property' of (C y : y ∈ V (T )) also holds. Hence, (C y : y ∈ V (T )) is a tree-decomposition of H with width at most 11k + 10. Lemmas 8 and 24 imply the following result, where the edges incident to each apex vertex are put in their own queue: Lemma 25.

Thus, each graph G i has a set A i of at most max{a(X , Σ i ) -1, 0} max{a(X ) -1, 0} vertices, such that G i -A i is strongly (д, p, k, a)-almostembeddable. By Lemma 28, G i -A i has a connected partition P i with layered width at most max{2д + 4p -4, 1}, such that (G i -A i )/P i has treewidth at most 11k + a + 10. The result follows from Lemma 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">STRONG PRODUCTS</head><p>This section provides an alternative and helpful perspective on layered partitions. The strong product of graphs A and B, denoted by A B, is the graph with vertex set V (A) × V (B), where distinct vertices (v, x ), (w, y) ∈ V (A) × V (B) are adjacent if:</p><p>The next observation follows immediately from the definitions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Observation 35. For every graph H , a graph G has an H -partition of layered width at most if and only if G is a subgraph of H P K for some path P.</head><p>result by DeVos et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> that has subsequently been generalised for any bounded expansion class by Nešetřil and Ossona de Mendez <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[88]</ref>. Lemma 47. For every k-almost-embeddable graph G and integer c 2, there are induced subgraphs G 1 , . . . ,G c of G, such that G = c j=1 G j , and for j ∈ {1, . . . , c} if</p><p>then X j is an induced subgraph of G and X j has a tree-decomposition (B j x : x ∈ V (T j )) of width at most 66k (k + 1)(2c -1) + k -1.</p><p>Proof. Note that we allow G i and G j to have vertices and edges in common. Let A be the set of apex vertices in G (as described in the definition of k-almost-embeddable). Thus, |A| k. By Lemma 24, G -A has an H -partition (Z h : h ∈ V (H )) of layered width at most 6k, for some graph H with treewidth at most 11k + 10. Let (V 0 , V 1 , . . . ) be the corresponding layering of G -A.

Since X i, j consists of 2c -1 layers, and our H -partition has layered width at most 6k, we have |Z h ∩ V (X i, j )| 6k (2c -1). Thus, (D x : x ∈ V (T i, j )) has width at most 66k (k + 1)(2c -1) -1.</p><p>For j ∈ {1, . . . , c}, let (B j x : x ∈ V (T j )) be the tree-decomposition of X j obtained as follows: First, let T j be the tree obtained from the disjoint union i ∈Z T i, j by adding an edge between T i, j and T i+1, j for all i ∈ Z. Then, for each node x of T j , let B j x := D x ∪ A, where D x is the bag corresponding to x in the tree-decomposition of X i, j where i is such that x ∈ V (T i, j ). Since X i, j and X i , j are disjoint for i i , and A is a subset of every bag, (B j x : x ∈ V (T j )) is a tree-decomposition of X j with width at most 66k</p><p>Lemma 48. Fix an integer c 2. For i ∈ {1, 2}, let G i be a graph for which there are induced subgraphs G i 1 , . . . ,G i c satisfying Lemma 47. Let G be a clique-sum of G 1 and G 2 . Then, G has induced subgraphs G 1 , . . . ,G c satisfying Lemma 47.</p><p>Proof. Let C 1 and C 2 be the cliques respectively in G 1 and G 2 involved in the clique-sum.

For j ∈ {1, . . . , c}, let G j := G 1 j ∪ G 2 j . This means that for vertices v 1 ∈ C 1 and v 2 ∈ C 2 , if v 1 and v 2 are identified into v in the clique-sum, and</p><p>and v 2 are identified into v in the clique-sum, and w 1 and w 2 are identified into w in the clique-sum, and</p><p>Take the disjoint union of the tree-decompositions of X 1 j and X 2 j and add an edge between a bag containing C 1 ∩ V (X 1 j ) and a bag containing C 2 ∩ V (X 2 j ) to obtain a tree-decomposition of X j of width 66k (k + 1)(2c -1) + k -1. Such bags exist since C i ∩ V (X i j ) is a clique of X i j and is thus a subset of some bag. We now prove the main result of this section. Theorem 49 <ref type="bibr">([31]</ref>). For every proper minor-closed class G and integer c 2, there is a constant k such that every graph in G can be edge c-coloured or vertex c-coloured so that the union of any c -1 colour classes has treewidth at most k.</p><p>Proof. Theorem 23 and Lemmas 47 and 48 imply that there exists an integer k such that every graph G ∈ G has subgraphs G 1 , . . . ,G c , such that G = c j=1 G j , and for j ∈ {1, . . . , c} the subgraph</p><p>First we prove the edge-colouring result. Colour each edge e of G by an integer j for which e ∈ E (G j ). The subgraph of G induced by the edges not coloured j is a subgraph of X j , and thus has treewidth at most 66k</p><p>For the vertex-colouring result, colour each vertex v of G by an integer j for which v ∈ V (G j ). The subgraph of G induced by the vertices not coloured j is a subgraph of X j , and thus has treewidth at most 66k (k + 1)(2c -1) + k -1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.2">Track Layouts</head><p>Track layouts are a type of graph layout closely related to queue layouts. A vertex k-colouring of a graph G is a partition {V 1 , . . . ,V k } of V (G) into independent sets; that is, for every edge vw ∈ E (G), if v ∈ V i and w ∈ V j then i j. A track in G is an independent set equipped with a linear ordering. A partition</p><p>That is, for all distinct edges vw, xy ∈ E (G) with v, x ∈ V i and</p><p>The minimum k such that G has a k-track layout is called the track-number of G, denoted by tn(G). Dujmović et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> proved the following connection to queue-number. <ref type="bibr">Lemma 50 ([48]</ref>). For every graph G, qn(G) tn(G) -1.</p><p>The proof of Lemma 50 simply puts the tracks one after the other to produce a queue layout. In this sense, track layouts can be thought of as a richer structure than queue layouts. This structure was the key to an inductive proof by Dujmović et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> that graphs of bounded treewidth have bounded track-number (which implies bounded queue-number by Lemma 50). Nevertheless, Dujmović et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> proved the following converse to Lemma 50:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 51 ([51]</head><p>). There is a function f such that tn(G) f (qn(G)) for every graph G. In particular, every graph with queue-number at most k has track-number at most 4k • 4 k (2k-1)(4k-1) .</p><p>Lemmas 50 and 51 together say that queue-number and track-number are tied. The following lemma often gives better bounds on the track-number than Lemma 51. A proper graph colouring is acyclic if every cycle gets at least three colours. The acyclic chromatic number of a graph G is the minimum integer c such that G has an acyclic c-colouring. <ref type="bibr">Lemma 52 ([48]</ref>). Every graph G with acyclic chromatic number at most c and queue-number at most k has track-number at most c (2k ) f (qn(G)) for every graph G. Heath et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> proved that every 1-queue graph has stacknumber at most 2. Dujmović and Wood <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> showed that there is such a function f if and only if every 2-queue graph has bounded stack-number. Similarly, it is open whether there is a function f such that qn(G) f (sn(G)) for every graph G. Heath et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> proved that every 1-stack graph has queue-number at most 2. Since 2-stack graphs are planar, this paper solves the first open case of this question. Dujmović and Wood <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> showed that there is such a function f if and only if every 3-stack graph has bounded queue-number.</p><p>(3) Ossona de Mendez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[90]</ref> introduced the following definition: A graph G is said to be k-close to Euler genus д if every subgraph H of G has a drawing in a surface of Euler genus д with at most k |E(H )| crossings (that is, with O (k ) crossings per edge on average). Does every such graph have queue-number at most f (д, k ) for some function f ? (4) Is there a proof of Theorem 3 that does not use the graph minor structure theorem and with more reasonable bounds? (5) Queue layouts naturally extend to posets. The cover graph G P of a poset P is the undirected graph with vertex set P, where vw ∈ E (G) if v &lt; P w and v &lt; P x &lt; P w for no x ∈ P (or w &lt; P v and w &lt; P x &lt; P v for no x ∈ P). Thus, the cover graph encodes relations in P that are not implied by transitivity. A k-queue layout of a poset P consists of a linear extension of P and a partition E 1 , E 2 , . . . , E k of E(G P ) into queues with respect to . The queuenumber of a poset P is the minimum integer k such that P has a k-queue layout. Heath and Pemmaraju <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> conjectured that the queue-number of a planar poset is at most its height (the maximum number of pairwise comparable elements). This was disproved by Knauer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[77]</ref> who presented a poset of height 2 and queue-number 4. Theorem 1 and</p></div>			</div>
