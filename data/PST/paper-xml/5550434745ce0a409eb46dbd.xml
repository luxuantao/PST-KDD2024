<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>It is well known that the trapezoidal rule converges geometrically when applied to analytic functions on periodic intervals or the real line.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1. Introduction. Many people experienced in numerical computation have encountered a remarkable phenomenon: if the composite trapezoidal rule for integration is applied to a periodic integrand, or an integral over the whole real line, it is often exponentially accurate. Some have discovered this for themselves. Others learned it from a textbook or a colleague, though they may not quite recall which, or who.</p><p>It appears to have been Poisson, in the 1820s, who first identified this effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[139]</ref>. The example Poisson chose has remained a favorite ever since: the perimeter of an ellipse, which he took to have axis lengths 1/π and 0.6/π, giving the integral</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">I = 1 2π 2π 0 1 -0.36 sin 2 θ dθ. (1.1)</formula><p>Poisson used this now-standard notation for definite integrals, but apparently it was not yet standard in the 1820s, for he comments that pour indiquer [les limites de l'intégrale] en même temps que l'intégrale, nous emploierons la notation très-commode que M. Fourrier a proposée. 1   Perhaps in 1826 the spelling of Fourier's name wasn't yet standardized either!</p><p>The exact solution of (1.1) is I = 2 π E(0.36) = 0.90277992777219 . . ., <ref type="bibr">(1.2)</ref> where E is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind. As trapezoidal rule approximations we can take</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">I N = 1 N N k=1</formula><p>1 -0.36 sin 2 (2πk/N ) for any positive integer N , or, equivalently, if N is divisible by 4, exploiting the four-fold symmetry as Poisson did,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">I N = 4 N N/4 k=0</formula><p>1 -0.36 sin 2 (2πk/N ).</p><p>The prime on the summation indicates that the terms with k = 0 and k = N/4 are multiplied by 1/2. For N = 4, 8, . . . , 20 we get the following rounded results, with digits that match the exact solution shown in boldface:</p><p>since the integrand has branch points in the complex θ-plane at points lying above and below the real axis at a distance cosh -1 (1/0.6) = log <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. Thus each new row in the table brings an improvement by nearly two digits, a factor of 3 4 = 81, as confirmed in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.1. One could hardly ask for more, and, indeed, the trapezoidal rule is an excellent method for computing complete elliptic integrals (see section <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17)</ref>. ) The first three are the canonical domains considered in sections 2-7. The fourth, equally important in practice, is the Hankel contour used for evaluation of integrals such as inverse Laplace transforms in the left half-plane (see sections <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. For Hankel contours, the trapezoidal rule is applied after a change of variables, an idea also used in other contexts including exponential and double exponential quadrature rules for nonperiodic functions on an interval (see section <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>.</p><p>Our aim in the first half of this article is to present the mathematical foundations of the geometrically convergent trapezoidal rule (sections <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The geometric convergence applies to four canonical classes of analytic functions:</p><p>(a) on a circle in the complex plane, (b) on an interval, periodic, (c) on the real line, with sufficient decay at ±∞, (d) on a Hankel contour wrapping around (-∞, 0] in the complex plane. (Each of classes (a)-(c) further comes in a nonsymmetric or symmetric variant: disk or annulus; periodic half-plane or periodic strip; half-plane or infinite strip.) Theorems explaining the fast convergence have been based on four kinds of arguments:</p><p>(i) series and aliasing (or, for the real line, transforms and aliasing), (ii) contour integrals and residue calculus, (iii) interpolation, (iv) the Euler-Maclaurin formula and related ideas. These two lists suggest an array of related theorems and proofs. The case (d) of a Hankel contour is usually handled by reducing it to case (c), the real line, but even if we ignore (d), this still leaves twelve types of proofs that might be considered. In the early sections of this paper we shall give examples of nine of these twelve (see Table <ref type="table">11</ref>.1) as we set forth a collection of these ideas in as systematic a manner as possible. Our focus is always on geometric rates of convergence associated with analytic functions, not on the next-order algebraic estimates that depend on behavior at the edge of analyticity. We are not aware of any previous wide-ranging survey of this material. Downloaded 10/02/14 to 64.106.42.43. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php Interspersed with the foundational material in the first half of the article are sections detailing a numerical example (section 4) and a brief review of the history (section 11). Who first noticed the geometric convergence of the trapezoidal rule, and what theorems were proved along the way? We do not know all the answers, but there are some clear post-Poisson milestones such as the papers of Turing in 1943 and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Davis in 1959.</ref> We summarize what we have found in <ref type="bibr">Table 11.1.</ref> Up to this point one might imagine that the geometrically convergent trapezoidal rule is a rather isolated topic, more or less a curiosity in the field of numerical analysis. Our aim in the second half of this article is to show that, in fact, it plays a significant role in scientific computing. We focus on eight areas of application, from Cauchy integrals in complex analysis to the solution of integral equations and time-dependent PDEs (sections <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>A word about terminology. In the context of periodic or infinite domains, there is little difference between the "trapezoidal" and the "midpoint" or "rectangle" rules, and we use the first of these terms mainly because it has become more standard. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> If one makes a distinction, sometimes the trapezoidal variant may have the advantage that it more readily reuses function values as N is doubled, whereas the midpoint variant has slightly simpler symmetry properties and no inconvenient divisions by 0 at endpoints after certain changes of variables (section 15). For the purposes of this article, however, these distinctions are not very important, and we will just speak of the trapezoidal rule.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Integrals over a Circle in the Complex Plane.</head><p>From the user's point of view, integrals of functions periodic on an interval represent perhaps the most basic form of the exponentially convergent trapezoidal rule. Mathematically, however, integrals over circles in the complex plane are arguably even simpler. We therefore begin with this case, though the reader who chooses to move directly to the case of the periodic interval in section 3 will not lose much. The circle is also the setting of the z-transform, an indispensable tool in digital signal processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[174]</ref>.</p><p>Let u be a real or complex function defined on the unit circle, which we shall denote by the abbreviated expression |z| = 1, and, setting z = e iθ , define</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">I = - |z|=1 iz -1 u(z)dz = 2π 0</formula><p>u(e iθ )dθ. <ref type="bibr">(2.1)</ref> (Here and throughout this paper, a complex contour such as |z| = 1 is always to be understood as traversed once in the counterclockwise direction.) Note that I can be interpreted as 2π times the mean of u over the unit circle. For any positive integer N , we define the trapezoidal rule approximation to I by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">I N = 2π N N k=1 u(z k ), (2.2)</formula><p>where {z k } are the N th roots of unity, z k = e 2πik/N . (Because of the periodicity, no special factors of 1/2 are needed at the endpoints as one would have with the nonperiodic trapezoidal rule.) This approximation will be exponentially accurate if u is Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.1 At the N th roots of unity, z N , z 2N , and so on are indistinguishable from the constant function 1-the phenomenon of aliasing. The error in the trapezoidal rule on the unit circle consists in counting a contribution of 2π from each such term in a series for u(z) instead of the correct value of 0.</p><p>analytic in a neighborhood of |z| = 1, i.e., in an annulus. For the simplest argument we consider first the case in which it is analytic in a disk. Theorem 2.1. Suppose u is analytic and satisfies |u(z)| ≤ M in the disk |z| &lt; r for some r &gt; 1. Then for any N ≥ 1,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">|I N -I | ≤ 2πM r N -1 , (2.3)</formula><p>and the constant 2π is as small as possible.</p><p>We begin with the most elementary proof, summarized in </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">I = -i |z|=1 z -1 u(z)dz = 2πc 0 , (2.6)</formula><p>and from (2.2) and <ref type="bibr">(2.4)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">I N = 2π N ∞ j=0 c j N k=1 z j k . (2.7)</formula><p>If j is a multiple of N , the numbers z j k are all equal to 1, and the second sum in this formula is equal to N . On the other hand, if j is not a multiple of N , they are evenly spaced around the unit circle and sum to 0. This is the phenomenon of aliasing: z j+N , z j+2N , z j+3N , and so on are indistinguishable from z j at the N th roots of unity. Thus (2.7) reduces to</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">I N = 2π ∞ j=0 c jN , (2.8)</formula><p>which together with <ref type="bibr">(2.6)</ref> gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">I N -I = 2π ∞ j=1 c jN . (2.9)</formula><p>To estimate the error, all we need is a bound on the coefficients c jN , which must decay geometrically since u is analytic in a disk of radius r &gt; 1. For a precise inequality we can deform the contour of integration in (2.5) to |z| = r , where r &lt; r is arbitrarily close to r; or if u is analytic in the closed disk, we can simply take r = r. This leads to the bound known as Cauchy's estimate,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">|c j | ≤ M r -j , j ≥ 0.</formula><p>(2.10) Thus (2.9) implies</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">|I N -I | ≤ 2πM ∞ j=1 r -jN ,</formula><p>and summing this series gives <ref type="bibr">(2.3)</ref>. This completes the proof apart from the assertion that the constant 2π cannot be improved. For this it is enough to consider u(z) = z N and any r &gt; 1, which gives I = 0, I N = 2π, M = r N , and thus |I N -I | = 2πM/r N . As N → ∞, this is asymptotic to the bound <ref type="bibr">(2.3)</ref>.</p><p>The proof just given represents one of the two most fundamental approaches to establishing theorems about exponential accuracy of the trapezoidal rule. The other, superficially a more surprising and ingenious method, is to use contour integrals and residue calculus. The idea, which can be traced at least in part to Cauchy in 1826, <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">4</ref>goes as follows. We wish to compare an integral with a sum. We do this by converting the sum to another integral, so that we are left with the comparison of two integrals. How does one convert a sum to an integral? By multiplying by a function that has simple poles at the summation points, and then using residue calculus. In other words, every quadrature formula applied to an analytic function u is equivalent to a contour integral of m(z)u(z) for some rational or meromorphic function m, known as a characteristic function for the quadrature formula. The nodes are the poles of m inside the contour, and the weights are the residues times 2πi. We shall use arguments of this kind many times in this article, and the characteristic functions involved are summarized in Table <ref type="table">13</ref>.1.</p><p>Proof of Theorem 2.1 by residue calculus. The function</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">m(z) = -iz -1 1 -z -N (2.11)</formula><p>has simple poles at the N th roots of unity with residues equal to -i/N , i.e., the weights of the trapezoidal rule (2.2) divided by 2πi. By residue calculus, this implies <ref type="bibr">(2.12)</ref> for any r with 1 &lt; r &lt; r. Similarly, in <ref type="bibr">(2.6)</ref>, since u is analytic, we can enlarge LLOYD N. TREFETHEN AND J. A. C. WEIDEMAN |z| = 1 to the circle |z| = r without changing the value. Thus, combining (2.6) and (2.12) gives a representation of I N -I as an integral,</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">I N = |z|=r m(z)u(z)dz</formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">I N -I = |z|=r [m(z) + iz -1 ]u(z)dz = |z|=r iz -1 1 -z N u(z)dz. (2.13)</formula><p>From here <ref type="bibr">(2.3)</ref> follows.</p><p>Why would one want to integrate a function over a circle in the complex plane? As we shall discuss in section 12, one reason is the Cauchy integrals and other kinds of contour integrals that are the basis of so much of complex function theory, with applications throughout applied mathematics. The simplest case of such an integral, already alluded to, is the mean value theorem for analytic functions: if u is analytic in a neighborhood of the unit disk, then in the notation of (2.1), u(0) = I/2π. We may illustrate this identity by an example. The function u(z) = z e z -1 <ref type="bibr">(2.14)</ref> has a removable singularity at z = 0; if we define u(0) = 1, it becomes analytic throughout the disk |z| &lt; 2π. If we evaluate u(z) for small values of z on a computer in 16-digit arithmetic, however, there is cancellation error and we may lose many digits of accuracy. By contrast, full precision is achieved by taking a mean over 18 points on the unit circle. We shall consider a more extreme example of this kind in section 12.</p><p>If u(0) is to be calculated by a mean over a circle, one might ask, why should that circle have radius 1? Any other radius that stays within the domain of analyticity is mathematically acceptable, and in the first integral of (2.1), this invariance is reflected in the presence of the scale-dependent term -iz -1 , which balances the scale-dependent contribution from dz. If |z| = 1 is replaced by |z| = ρ for some ρ &gt; 0, the change that results is that the powers z N k , z 2N k , and so on of (2.7) sum to Nρ j instead of just N , and the summand in (2.8) and (2.9) changes from c jN to c jN ρ jN . The end result is that (2.3) becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">|I N -I | ≤ 2πM (r/ρ) N -1 . (2.15)</formula><p>Thus, at least if cancellation errors on a computer are not a concern, the trapezoidal rule converges geometrically as N → ∞ at a rate determined by r/ρ, and it is advantageous to take ρ as small as possible. Of course, this conclusion only applies if u is analytic throughout a disk. For more about the choice of ρ, see section 12 and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51]</ref>.</p><p>Let us now turn to the case of a function u(z) on the unit circle that may be analytic not throughout a disk, but just in an annulus. For example, if u(z) is real and nonconstant on the circle, this will necessarily be the case. For simplicity, we suppose that the annulus of analyticity is symmetric about the unit circle, taking the form r -1 &lt; |z| &lt; r for some r &gt; 1. The assumption of boundedness in such an annulus is enough to give the same result as before, except that the factor 2π now doubles to 4π.</p><p>Theorem 2.2. Suppose u is analytic and satisfies |u(z)| ≤ M in the annulus r -1 &lt; |z| &lt; r for some r &gt; 1. Then for any N ≥ 1,</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">|I N -I | ≤ 4πM r N -1 , (2.16)</formula><p>and the constant 4π is as small as possible. </p><formula xml:id="formula_17">I N -I = 2π ∞ j=1 (c jN + c -jN ). (2.17)</formula><p>We can complete the proof by generalizing (2.10) to negative as well as positive j,</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">|c j | ≤ M r -|j| , -∞ &lt; j &lt; ∞, (2.18)</formula><p>an inequality that follows in the case j &lt; 0 from shrinking |z| = 1 to 1/r for r arbitrarily close to r. Finally, concerning the sharpness of the constant 4π, it is enough to consider the example u(z) = z N + z -N and any r &gt; 1, which gives I = 0,</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">I N = 4π, M = r N + r -N , and thus |I N -I | ∼ 4πM/r N as N → ∞.</formula><p>An alternative approach to Theorem 2.2 is to note that any function u analytic in the annulus r -1 &lt; |z| &lt; r can be split into u = u + + u -, where the analytic part u + is analytic in |z| &lt; r and the coanalytic part u -is analytic in r -1 &lt; |z| ≤ ∞. Since u + and u -can both be represented by Cauchy integrals, i.e., as appropriately weighted means of u(z) on circles, they satisfy |u ± (z)| ≤ M in the annulus, and from here, Theorem 2.2 can be obtained as a corollary of Theorem 2.1.</p><p>Another alternative is to prove Theorem 2.2 directly by residue calculus. This can be done following the pattern of the proof of Theorem 2.1 by residue calculus, but replacing the characteristic function m(z) of (2.11) by the function listed in the (2,1) position of Table <ref type="table">13</ref>.1. Such an argument is spelled out in full in section 3 for the equivalent problem of integration of a function periodic on a real interval.</p><p>Equation (2.17) (or Theorem 2.2 itself, after some easy estimates) has the following interesting corollary.</p><p>Corollary 2.3. If u is a polynomial or Laurent polynomial of degree n (i.e., a linear combination of z -n , . . . , z n ), the N -point trapezoidal rule (2.2) is exact for all N &gt; n.</p><p>There is a sharpening of Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 that is often applicable. If u is analytic but not bounded in the open disk |z| &lt; r, Theorem 2.1 implies convergence at the rate O((rε) -N ) for any ε &gt; 0, but not necessarily O(r -N ). However, if the singularities of u on the circle |z| = r are just simple poles, the convergence rate is O(r -N ) after all. In the proof by Taylor series and aliasing, this follows from the fact that the Taylor coefficients associated with a pole (zz 0 ) -1 with |z 0 | = r are of size O(r -n ); compare <ref type="bibr">[161, eq. (4.3)</ref>] and <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[170,</ref><ref type="bibr">Exercise 8.15</ref>]. In the proof by contour integrals, we can integrate over a slightly larger circle |z| = r + ε for some ε &gt; 0, while also including keyhole contributions from small circles around each pole with |z| = r; compare <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. The O(r -N ) convergence of the trapezoidal rule also applies if there are a finite number of singularities on |z| = r that are weaker than poles in the sense that u satisfies u(z) = O(|z -ζ| α ) for |z| ≤ r with α &gt; -1 at each such singularity ζ. This can be proved by noting that since |u| is integrable along |z| = r across such a singularity, (2.5) leads to</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">|c j | = 1 2π |z|=r z -j-1 u(z)dz ≤ 1 2π z -j-1 ∞ u 1 = r -j-1 2π u 1 (2.19)</formula><p>by Hölder's inequality, with the 1-and ∞-norms defined over |z| = r. By (2.9), this implies |I N -I| ≤ r -1 u 1 /(r N -1). All these observations for Theorem 2.1 and the Downloaded 10/02/14 to 64.106.42.43.

On the unit circle, this happens if u(z) = u(z).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Integrals over a Periodic Interval.</head><p>Having treated integrals over a circle in section 2, we now turn to the case of an integral of a function periodic on an interval.

First, it is often possible to convert a slowly decaying integrand into a quickly decaying one by an appropriate change of variables. Such transformation methods are discussed in section 14. A particular one, a sinh mapping, is mentioned at the end of section 14 and applied to Downloaded 10/02/14 to 64.106.42.43.

An alternative strategy for dealing with slowly decaying integrands is to apply convergence acceleration to the sequence of partial sums of (5.4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[70]</ref>. This effectively eliminates the truncation error, so that the total error is dominated by the discretization error.</p><p>7. Polynomial, Trigonometric, and Sinc Interpolation. We have followed two routes to the exponentially convergent trapezoidal rule: series (or transforms, in the case of the real line) and contour integrals. A third idea is to make use of the following property: the trapezoidal rule approximation is the exact integral of an interpolant through the given data values. On the unit circle, the interpolant is a polynomial or a Laurent polynomial. On the periodic interval [-π, π], it is a one-sided or twosided trigonometric polynomial, i.e., a linear combination of functions e ikx for various integers k either of a single sign or both positive and negative. On the real line, it is an infinite series of translates of sinc functions. These ideas are sketched in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.1.</p><p>This section is unfortunately rather dry, as it seemed desirable to set down six versions of the formulas corresponding to three variants of the trapezoidal rule (complex unit circle, periodic interval, and real line) and two types of domains of analyticity (nonsymmetric and symmetric). Though individual results of this kind can be found here and there in the literature, we do not know any previous publications where such information has been collected systematically.</p><p>As usual, we organize the presentation by beginning with the case of a function on the unit circle. Consider the context of Theorem 2.1, a function u(z) analytic and bounded in absolute value by M in the disk |z| &lt; r with r &gt; 1. One approximation by a polynomial of degree ≤ N -1 is obtained by truncating the Taylor series (2.4),</p><formula xml:id="formula_78">p taylor (z) = N -1 j=0 c j z j . (7.1)</formula><p>It follows from the estimate (2.10) that the error in this approximation is bounded by</p><formula xml:id="formula_79">p taylor -u ≤ M r -N 1 -r -1 , (7.2)</formula><p>where • denotes the supremum norm over |z| = 1 (or |z| ≤ 1, by the maximum modulus principle). Another approximation of u would be the unique polynomial of degree ≤ N -1 that interpolates u in the roots of unity {z k }. It is possible to write down an explicit formula for the coefficients of this interpolant by noting that it can be derived by aliasing z N , z 2N , . . . to z 0 ; z N +1 , z 2N +1 , . . . to z 1 ; and so on. The result is the formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_80">p interp (z) = N -1 j=0 ∞ k=0 c j+kN z j . (7.3)</formula><p>For this approximation, (2.10) implies</p><formula xml:id="formula_81">p interp -u ≤ 2M r -N 1 -r -1 . (7.4)</formula><p>Examining (7.2) and (7.4), we see that both polynomial interpolants in roots of unity and truncated Taylor series are enough to establish the result that functions analytic on the closed unit disk can be approximated by polynomials with exponentially decreasing error as N → ∞. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> What is special about p interp for our purposes is that when the trapezoidal rule is applied to u, the resulting approximation I N is exactly the integral of p interp , as can be derived from (2.8) and (7.3).

(7.10)</formula><p>Perhaps it is worth noting explicitly that when the trapezoidal rule is applied to a set of data at roots of unity, the formula involved has no notion of whether the data come from a function that is analytic in a disk, analytic in an annulus, or not analytic at all. The quadrature result I N is just a number computed from the data, and the bounds (7.5) and (7.10) differ not because I N differs in the two cases, but because different conclusions about its accuracy can be reached based on different hypotheses.</p><p>In passing from (7.2), <ref type="bibr">(7.4)</ref>, and (7.5) to (7.7), (7.9), and (7.10), the convergence rate has approximately halved, from r -N to r -(N +1)/2 , so that twice as many points are needed for a good approximation of u on an annulus as on a disk. Yet from Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 we know that the actual rate of convergence of |I N -I | to zero is the same in both cases, r -N . The distinction is genuine: moving from the disk to the annulus halves the rate of convergence of the interpolants without halving the rate of convergence of the trapezoidal rule. This sounds paradoxical, but it can be explained by returning to the observation mentioned in section 3 in connection with the Nyquist limit of two points per wavelength. If u is analytic in just an annulus rather than a disk, then we need negative powers of z as well as positive ones for accurate interpolation, halving the rate of convergence of the interpolants as N → ∞. However, the components z (N +1)/2 , z (N +3)/2 , . . . , z N -1 of u(z) that are now mishandled by our interpolant p interp2 contribute nothing to the integral, so the rate of convergence of the trapezoidal rule is unaffected.</p><p>For the remainder of this section we spell out analogues of the above results, first for functions periodic on an interval, then for functions on the real line. It is worthwhile to record these formulas, but the reader with no special interest in them is encouraged to turn to the next section.</p><p>Here are the analogues of (7.1)-(7.10) for periodic functions on an interval.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Connections with Gauss and Clenshaw-Curtis</head><p>Quadrature. First in section 3, and again repeatedly in section 7, we mentioned a certain factor-of-two property for the trapezoidal rule on a circle or a periodic interval: the formula requires just "one point per wavelength" for exactness, not two. Another way to put it is that the accuracy of the N -point quadrature formula is approximately equal to the accuracy of the trigonometric interpolant through not N but 2N points. We shall now sketch how this can be viewed as the same advantage enjoyed by Gauss (more precisely, Gauss-Legendre) quadrature for a nonperiodic function defined on [-1, 1] in comparison with other methods for such functions such as Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature.</p><p>Consider, for example, the case of a periodic function v on [0, 2π]. On an equispaced grid of N points, with N taken to be odd for simplicity, the trapezoidal rule can be interpreted as interpolating v by a trigonometric polynomial of degree (N -1)/2 and then integrating the interpolant exactly (section 7). Thus if v is given by a convergent Fourier series, the terms in the series of orders (N + 1)/2, (N + 3)/2, . . . can be viewed as aliased by the grid to orders (-N + 1)/2, (-N + 3)/2, . . . . However, though these terms are aliased, they are still integrated correctly by the trapezoidal rule to zero, until one reaches the term of order N , which aliases to 0 and erroneously gets a nonzero integral.</p><p>Gauss quadrature has an analogous property. Suppose we have a function y(ξ) defined on [-1, 1]. On an N -point Gauss grid in [-1, 1], i.e., the grid of roots of the Legendre polynomial P N , Gauss quadrature can be interpreted as interpolating y by a polynomial of degree N -1, then integrating the interpolant exactly. Thus if y is Downloaded 10/02/14 to 64.106.42.43. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php given by a convergent series of Legendre polynomials, the terms in the series of degree N , N + 1, and so on can be viewed as aliased to lower degrees when sampled on the grid. More precisely, from the three-term recurrence relation associated with these orthogonal polynomials, one can see that P N is aliased to zero, P N +1 to a multiple of P N -1 , P N +2 to a linear combination of P N -2 and P N -1 , and, in general, for any k ≤ N , P N +k to a linear combination of P N -k , . . . , P N -1 . Again, however, these aliases introduce no errors for k &lt; N, because the alias of each Legendre polynomial integrates to the correct value of zero. This is because all Legendre polynomials other than P 0 have zero integrals over [-1, 1], since they are orthogonal to P 0 . The first error is introduced at k = N , where we find that P 2N ought to integrate to zero but is aliased to a sum of Legendre polynomials that includes a nonzero component of P 0 . We can contrast this behavior with what happens with Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature on [-1, 1], that is, the formula obtained by applying the trapezoidal rule on [0, 2π] to the function v(θ) obtained by transplanting y(ξ) under the change of variables ξ = cos(θ). In the ξ variable on [-1, 1], this is equivalent to sampling at the Chebyshev points cos(θ k ), interpolating by a sum of Chebyshev polynomials T k , and integrating the interpolant exactly. As in the Gauss-Legendre case, T N +k aliases to a linear combination of T N -k , . . . , T N -1 ; actually, the situation is even simpler, for T N +k aliases to T N -k alone. The difference is that this time, an integration error is introduced by this aliasing, since T N +k and T N -k have nonzero and distinct integrals (when N + k is even). This is why Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature has half the polynomial order of accuracy as Gauss quadrature. 6  In summary, for |z| = 1 or θ ∈ [0, 2π], the trapezoidal rule is Gauss quadrature: it combines algebraic simplicity with the characteristic Gauss quadrature factor-of-2 bonus in formal order of accuracy. This fast rate of convergence is summarized in Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>.1. For nonperiodic functions on [-1, 1], one can have either the algebraic 6 The full story is subtler than this, however, for although T N-k has nonzero integral, the integral is of size O(N -3 ) for fixed k as N → ∞ and of size O(N -2 ) in a certain sense averaged over all k. As a consequence Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature, despite its lower polynomial order of accuracy, is in practice nearly as accurate as Gauss quadrature in many cases, with errors often closer to the lower dots than the upper ones in plots like those of Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>.1.

Now we turn to another context in which the factor of 2 is lost. 9. Unevenly Spaced Quadrature Points. The periodic trapezoidal rule is defined by equispaced points and equal quadrature weights. However, its exponential convergence for analytic integrands does not depend on equal spacing. The convergence is still exponential for certain periodic nonequispaced point sets, provided the quadrature weights are adjusted according to the design principle of section 7: interpolate the data by a trigonometric polynomial, then integrate the interpolant. Let us call the resulting periodic quadrature formula for nonuniform points quadrature by trigonometric interpolation. Note that this is different from the more elementary trapezoidal rule for unevenly spaced points, based on approximating the function by trapezoids, whose accuracy is just O(h 2 ).</p><p>We begin with a numerical illustration. The upper image of Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>.1 shows the periodic integrand v(θ) = e cos(θ) of section 4 sampled on a 12-point trapezoidal grid, the same grid sketched in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.1. The error listed for the trapezoidal rule reveals 11-digit accuracy for this problem. The lower image of the figure shows the same result for a perturbed grid (the third, eighth, and ninth points have moved left by distances 0.2, 0.4, and 0.2, respectively). Now the accuracy cuts in half, to 6 digits. In other words, the quadrature now approximately matches the accuracy of the trigonometric interpolant, as described in the last section. Perturbing the grid has eliminated the "Gauss quadrature factor of 2," but it has not eliminated the exponential convergence.</p><p>To make these observations precise, ideally, we would state generalizations of (7. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref>)-(7.20) for quadrature by trigonometric interpolation. We are not aware of such generalizations, but let us summarize some of what is known that is relevant to this problem. It is not clear that anything has been published that explicitly addresses  The first concerns interpolation of analytic functions and features theorems that might be regarded as mainly of theoretical interest, because they are unstable with respect to perturbations.

There is no assumption that the points are well separated or even distinct. Let u(z) be analytic in |z| ≤ r for some r &gt; 1, and let p N -1 be the degree N -1 polynomial interpolant to u in the grid {z</p><formula xml:id="formula_99">(N ) k }. (If two</formula><p>nodes are equal, one interpolates both f and f there, and similarly for confluences of higher order.) Then the interpolants satisfy u -</p><formula xml:id="formula_100">p N -1 = O(r -N ) as N → ∞.</formula><p>This result is generally attributed to Fejér in 1918 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>, though Fejér stated it without proof, commenting that he was building on ideas of Sierpiński and Weyl and would publish a proof on another occasion. (Fejér's main concern was generalizations by conformal mapping to regions other than the disk.) A proof was perhaps first spelled out by Kalmár in 1926 together with a converse to the effect that O(r -N ) convergence for all functions analytic in |z| ≤ r implies uniform distribution of the grids <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[89]</ref>, so the result is sometimes known as the Fejér-Kalmár theorem; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54]</ref> for discussions.</p><p>The same conclusion carries over from a disk to an annulus or a periodic interval: analyticity and uniform distribution of the interpolation points are enough to guarantee convergence at the expected geometric rate.

The condition of uniform distribution does not prevent grid points coalescing, and if this happens, a vanishing denominator will appear in any interpolation formula.

This leads us to the question of what degree of perturbation of {θ (N ) k } from the equispaced configuration can be permitted. Apart from the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, we do not know of any literature on this question from the perspective of approximation theory or quadrature, but there is a related literature on sampling theory going back many years. A basic question in this area asks, what properties of an interpolatory process suffice to guarantee that it will reproduce a sampled function exactly? Our Corollaries 2.3, 3.3, and 5.3 concerning band-limited functions are of this form, and such results have been generalized to irregular grids in work beginning with Paley and Wiener, Levinson, and Kadec, among others. These and other references are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. When stability is brought into the picture, key concepts that arise are the notions of Riesz bases and frames, which are related to boundedness of the reconstruction process in L 2 and other norms. Closely related is the literature of algorithms associated with the so-called nonuniform fast Fourier transform (FFT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>The emphasis on band-limited functions, exact reconstruction, and integral norms gives the literature of sampling theory a different style from that of our interest here in the rate of convergence of the trapezoidal rule for smooth but non-band-limited functions. We do not know what analogues there are of Theorem 9.1 for quadrature by trigonometric interpolation with a robustness condition.</p><p>10. The Euler-Maclaurin Formula. When people set out to explain the fast convergence of the trapezoidal rule for periodic integrands, an argument commonly used is based on the Euler-Maclaurin formula. Indeed, this was Poisson's approach in the 1820s, for the formula was already well established in his day, having originated independently with Euler and Maclaurin in the 1730s and 1740s. By such reasoning one can see that the periodic trapezoidal rule has accuracy O(N -m ) for any m when applied to a C ∞ function, though it is not easy to see that the accuracy is O(exp(-CN )) if the function is analytic.</p><p>Returning to the setting of section 3, let v be a continuous function on the real line, which initially we do not require to be periodic, and define</p><formula xml:id="formula_103">I = 2π 0 v(θ)dθ, I N = h N k=0 v(kh),</formula><p>where h = 2π/N and the prime indicates that the terms k = 0 and N are multiplied by 1/2.

History. At this stage in the paper, we would like to be able to summarize who were the earliest authors to investigate the fast convergence of the trapezoidal rule in the three special cases of the periodic interval, the unit circle, and the real line. We find this surprisingly difficult. The roots of the fast trapezoidal rule go back to Euler and Maclaurin, if not Archimedes, but it is hard to find explicit discussions. One source of information on early works on quadrature in general is the 1961 bibliography by Stroud <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[159]</ref>.</p><p>For the periodic interval, as told in the introduction, the first such discussion may be that of Poisson in the 1820s <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[138,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">139]</ref>. Many mathematicians of the 19th century must have been aware of Poisson's work, but we do not know what use was made of it, and there seems to be no author who explicitly stated the geometric convergence for analytic functions until Davis in 1959 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Early papers in the computer era include those of Fettis in 1955 <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref> and Moran in 1958 <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[127]</ref>, but their discussions, based on the Poisson summation formula, do not include general convergence statements. This 150-year gap seems odd, and it is hardly surprising that Davis (who does not cite Poisson) calls the result "folklore." Davis' paper considers both intervals and circles, and, as in section 2, he makes use of convergent series. Our Theorem 3.2 is essentially his Theorem 1, which is restated in section 4.6 of the book by Davis and Rabinowitz <ref type="bibr">[38, p. 243]</ref>. One can also find essentially the same result as Theorem 9.28 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[99]</ref> and Exercise 12.6 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[168]</ref>.</p><p>For the unit circle, after Davis, a key early figure was James Lyness in the 1960s <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">113,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">114,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">116,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">117]</ref>. In a succession of papers, some of them written jointly with Delves, Moler, and Sande, Lyness advocated the use of the trapezoidal rule on the unit circle to evaluate contour integrals numerically for applications including evaluation of functions, calculation of derivatives, and zerofinding. Such techniques are the subject of the next section. These methods are closely linked to the FFT, Downloaded 10/02/14 to 64.106.42.43.

The field of digital signal processing developed rapidly in that era, and many of its algorithms are based on computation with data at roots of unity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>In the case of the real line, interest in the equispaced sampling of functions originated about a century ago. One line of research arose from the introduction of cardinal interpolants of equispaced data by E. T. Whittaker in 1915 <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">[185]</ref>. Whittaker's starting point was the construction of functions by applying finite difference formulas on wider and wider equispaced grids, and his work was closely related to operational calculus and divergent series, subjects of interest to British mathematicians including Heaviside, Hardy, Littlewood, Milne-Thomson, and Titchmarsh. We wish Hardy were here to ask about the trapezoidal rule! Whittaker's son J. M. Whittaker wrote a tract some years later on what he called interpolatory function theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[186]</ref>, with a bibliography listing work by many authors including Copson, Ferrar, Hurwitz, and Takenaka. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the subject of sampling theory was being invented beginning in the 1920s by Hartley, Nyquist, and Shannon (not to mention less-often cited authors Kotelnikov, Raabe, Gabor, and Someya <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[174]</ref>), wherein Whittaker's cardinal function is interpreted as a band-limited interpolant, and Paley and Wiener's Fourier Transforms in the Complex Domain appeared in 1934 <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[136]</ref>.</p><p>The people who first used the trapezoidal rule on the real line for numerical calculation of integrals may have been the early British statisticians, who were concerned with the estimation of moments of a distribution such as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. The first publication we have found that discusses the matter is Aitken's 1939 book Statistical Mathematics <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Though Aitken does not speak of geometric convergence or state general theorems, he touches upon the same issues we have discussed in sections 5 and 6, and we hope the reader looking at Figure <ref type="figure">11</ref>.1 will share some of the pleasure we felt in encountering this material in Aitken's book.</p><p>A more focused analysis of the fast convergence of the trapezoidal rule on the real line appears in a paper by Turing written in 1939 and published in 1943 <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[173]</ref>. Turing's aim was a numerical exploration of the Riemann hypothesis, and he introduced a method for evaluating the zeta function based on the trapezoidal rule applied to a smooth function on the real line. He wrote, "We approximate to the integral by the obvious sum</p><formula xml:id="formula_112">K k=-K 1 K h k K</formula><p>and we find that. . .this gives a remarkably accurate result; when the number of terms taken is T = 2K + 1 the error is of the order of magnitude of e -1 2 πT ." He derived a bound with the flavor of Theorem 5.1, with a proof using contour integrals, and alluded to the use of the trapezoidal rule on more general contours (section 15).</p><p>Several times in the course of writing this article we have encountered leads to the mathematical literature of the Soviet Union, including the names of Bakhvalov, Fok (also spelled Fock), Korobov, and Malozemov. It is quite possible that Fok, for example (known in the West through Hartree-Fock methods), worked with the geometrically convergent trapezoidal rule before Turing. However, our links to the Soviet literature are not as strong as we would like, and we have failed to turn up a definitive publication.</p><p>Our overall assessment of the situation in the first half of the 20th century is that the fast convergence of the trapezoidal rule would have been readily understood by many mathematicians, but that, before the introduction of computers, it did not stand out as a topic worthy of much special attention. This kind of mathematics was used more often to approximate sums by integrals than integrals by sums, and convergence as h → 0 was not a prominent issue. Indeed, the use of the actual term "trapezoidal rule" in this context was not so common until later, perhaps in the 1950s. Davis uses Downloaded 10/02/14 to 64.106.42.43.

After Turing, a paper often cited as an early contribution to the trapezoidal rule on the real line is that of Goodwin in 1949 <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[67]</ref>, who begins, "It is well known to computers that the approximate formula [the trapezoidal rule] yields a surprising degree of accuracy. . . ." This use of the word "computers" is in the charming older sense of the term. Goodwin and Turing were colleagues at the National Physical Laboratory during 1945-48, working on the ACE computer project, and Goodwin states that his purpose is to give the details of a generalization of Turing's method. In his formulation of the matter, it is assumed that the integrand decays at the rate exp(-x 2 ), a condition that will usually hold in statistical applications.

It seems ideally suited to this task, since contour integrals are often posed over circles in the complex plane, and by the nature of the problem, the integrand is analytic.

Even when there are no singularities to avoid, the choice of radius can make a big difference to both the accuracy and the numerical stability of these methods, as has been recognized from the start. An adaptive algorithm for choosing a good radius ρ was published by Fornberg in 1981 <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51]</ref>. Recently this matter has been investigated comprehensively by Bornemann <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, who has shown that for a wide class of functions u, an optimal choice of ρ enables computation of derivatives of all orders with condition number essentially O(1). 9 As the order of the derivative increases, so does ρ. 9 An extreme choice of radius is utilized in the method of complex step differentiation, which goes back at least to Squire and Trapp in 1998 <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[154]</ref>. Here, the first derivative of a real analytic function f at a real argument x is computed to machine accuracy by the formula (f (x + iε)f (xiε))/(2iε), where ε is a number smaller than machine epsilon, such as 10 -100 in standard 16-digit IEEE arithmetic. From the point of view of machine arithmetic, the reason the method works is that the real and imaginary parts of a function evaluation are decoupled, so the subtraction is performed with negligible cancellation error. From the point of view of the mathematics of the trapezoidal rule, one may interpret this as the two-point trapezoidal rule (more precisely, the two-point midpoint rule) evaluated over a circle of radius ρ = 10 -100 , with high accuracy guaranteed by (2.15).

Changing 1/f (z) to g(z) gives an algorithm for finding a pole of a meromorphic function, related to the FEAST algorithm for computing matrix eigenvalues mentioned at the end of section 18. Besides works by Lyness and Kravanja and their coauthors, there are also a number of other contributions in this area, such as a method proposed by Henrici [75, section 3.2].

Rational Approximation. Every quadrature formula can be related to rational or meromorphic functions. In this section we spell out some of these connections for the trapezoidal rule and show how it has been used to derive approximate solutions to two famous problems of rational approximation theory.</p><p>To begin the discussion, recall one of our proofs involving contour integrals, say, the proof of Theorem 2.1 for the integral over the unit circle of a function u(z) analytic in |z| &lt; r for some r &gt; 1. The key idea was to multiply u(z) by the rational function m(z) of (2.11), which is listed in the upper-left position of Table <ref type="table">13</ref>.1. This function has simple poles at the quadrature points (the N th roots of unity) with residues equal to (2πi) -1 times the corresponding quadrature weights 2π/N . It follows that the contour integral of m(z)u(z) around the circle |z| = r is equal to I N , the result of the trapezoidal rule. The other entries of Table <ref type="table">13</ref>.1 list analogous functions for the other five fundamental cases of this paper. Now the true integral I can also be represented by a contour integral of u times a characteristic function, which we shall call μ. For the case of the unit circle just discussed, by (2.6), we have μ(z) = -iz -1 . This function is listed in the upper-left position of Table <ref type="table">13</ref>.2, and the remaining entries show the other five cases.</p><p>Contour integral estimates for the accuracy of the trapezoidal rule for analytic integrands are based on comparing a function in Table <ref type="table">13</ref>.1 with the corresponding function in Table <ref type="table">13</ref>.2. For example, consider the middle of the bottom row in the two tables, corresponding to integration of a 2π-periodic function v(θ) analytic in a strip of half-width a around the real axis in the complex θ-plane (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[88]</ref>). By the definitions of m(θ) and μ(θ), the error of the trapezoidal rule can be expressed as the integral</p><formula xml:id="formula_127">I N -I = Γ v(θ)[m(θ) -μ(θ)]dθ, (<label>13</label></formula><p>.1) Downloaded 10/02/14 to 64.106.42.43.

(We can ignore the ends of the rectangle, as their contributions cancel by periodicity.) As Im(θ) → ∞, m(θ) approaches -1/2 exponentially, and as Im(θ) → -∞, it approaches 1/2. Thus m(θ)μ(θ) is exponentially small for large |Im(θ)|. It follows that if v is analytic in a wide region around [0, 2π] and does not itself grow too fast with |Im(θ)|, (13.1) delivers a powerful accuracy bound. In other words, contour integrals connect quadrature to the subject of rational or, more generally, meromorphic approximation. The function to be approximated is μ, with a jump discontinuity along the integration interval. (The discontinuity is explicit in the second row of Table <ref type="table">13</ref>.2 and implicit in the first row.) The function m approximates that jump discontinuity by a sequence of poles. 10 In the upper-left position of the tables, for example, after dividing by -iz -1 , we note that (1-z -N ) -1 is a rational function that is close to 1 outside the unit disk and close to 0 inside. 11 10 These formulations can be regarded as uses of the theory of hyperfunctions, which are generalized functions defined by analytic functions in the lower and upper half-planes that may have singularities or discontinuities along the real axis <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref>. Table <ref type="table">13</ref>.1 is thus a list of hyperfunction approximations to the hyperfunctions of Table <ref type="table">13</ref>.2.</p><p>11 Why, one might wonder, would one wish to approximate the simple rational function -iz -1 by the more complicated rational function -iz -1 /(1z -N )? This question is not idle, but reflects the fact that by the mean value theorem, if u(z) is analytic in |z| ≤ 1, its integral over |z| = 1 can be evaluated by a single point evaluation at z = 0. So, indeed, sometimes one would not want to use the more complicated function. Downloaded 10/02/14 to 64.106.42.43. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php Connections between quadrature formulas and rational functions have been a part of quadrature theory for 200 years. Most classically, for integration of a nonperiodic function on the interval [-1, 1], the function μ(ξ) that arises is log((ξ -1)/(ξ + 1)), with a branch cut along [-1, 1] and analytic elsewhere in the extended complex plane. When Gauss invented Gauss quadrature in 1814, he did it by approximating μ by what we would now call its type (N -1, N) Padé approximant at ξ = ∞, though he used the language of continued fractions. (We say that a rational function is of type (m, n) if it can be written as a quotient of a polynomial of degree at most m and a polynomial of degree at most n, not necessarily in lowest terms.) Comparisons of m(ξ) and μ(ξ) for other quadrature formulas on [-1, 1] were investigated by Takahasi and Mori <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[162]</ref>. For the special case of Gauss vs. Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature, Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[169]</ref>.</p><p>We now turn to two particular problems in the subject of rational approximation where the trapezoidal rule can be used to powerful effect, following the discussion in the chapter on "Two Famous Problems" in <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[170]</ref>.</p><p>The first problem is an approximation of y(ξ) = |ξ| on [-1, 1] by type (n, n) rational functions, a prototypical rational approximation problem for nonsmooth functions. Let E nn (|ξ|) denote the minimal value of |ξ|r(ξ) over all rational functions r of type (n, n), where • is the ∞-norm on [-1, 1]. It was a striking surprise when Donald Newman proved in 1964 that the accuracy of these approximations can improve root-exponentially with n <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[132]</ref>. Since polynomials can never do better than O(n -1 ), this established that rational functions can be far more powerful than polynomials in certain applications, a theme implicit in a number of parts of this article. Later, Stahl found the precise asymptotic behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[155]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_130">E nn (|ξ|) ∼ 8e -π √ n . (13.2)</formula><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[170]</ref> and arguments by Stenger <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[157]</ref>, it is now apparent that a simpler argument than Newman's would have sufficed to establish the root-exponential behavior, as follows. We start from the identity</p><formula xml:id="formula_131">|ξ| = 2ξ 2 π ∞ -∞ e x dx e 2x + ξ 2 ,</formula><p>which can be established by an elementary substitution that converts the integral on the right to an arctangent. This is an attractive integral to work with because the integrand decays exponentially as |x| → ∞. We now get a rational approximation of |ξ| by approximating this integral by the trapezoidal rule with node spacing h &gt; 0:</p><formula xml:id="formula_132">r(ξ) = 2hξ 2 π (n-2)/4 k=-(n-2)/4</formula><p>e kh e 2kh + ξ 2 . <ref type="bibr">(13.3)</ref> Here n is a positive even number and there are n/2 terms in the sum, so r(ξ) is a rational function of ξ of type (n, n). There are two sources of error that make r(ξ) differ from |ξ|. The fact that the sum has been terminated at a limit n &lt; ∞ introduces an error on the order of e -nh/4 , and the finite step size h &gt; 0 introduces an error on the order of e -π 2 /h . (The integrand is analytic in the strip around the real x-axis of half-width a = π/2, corresponding to a convergence rate e -2πa/h .) Balancing these sources of error as in section 6 suggests the condition e -nh/4 ∼ e -π 2 /h , that is, </p><formula xml:id="formula_133">h ∼ 2π √ n , n → ∞,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_134">f -r = O(e -(π/2) √ n ).</formula><p>This achieves the root-exponential behavior of (13.2), falling short of the actual optimal convergence rate by a factor of 4 in the sense that it requires n to be 4 times larger than in (13.2) to achieve the same error.</p><p>The second famous problem is the approximation of e t on (-∞, 0]. This problem was introduced in a 1969 paper of Cody, Meinardus, and Varga <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, which drew attention to the connection of such approximations with the numerical solution of PDEs and showed that the convergence was at least geometric. What is the optimal rate? The idea that it might be O(9 -n ) became known in the 1970s as the 1/9 conjecture. In fact, the optimal convergence rate turned out to be O(H n ) with H ≈ 1/9.28903, a number now known as Halphen's constant, as was conjectured numerically by Trefethen and Gutknecht <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[171]</ref> and proved by Gonchar and Rakhmanov <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[65]</ref>.</p><p>Again we can derive the exponential behavior from the trapezoidal rule, employing methods to be detailed in section 15.

By taking a = O( √ n), we can make the errors due to grid spacing exponentially small too, and in this fashion we can achieve geometric convergence.

Exponential and Double Exponential Quadrature Rules. When a function y(ξ) defined on [-1, 1] is smooth, there are all kinds of ways to integrate it efficiently, such as Gauss-Legendre or Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[170,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 19]</ref>. If there are singularities at the endpoints, however, such methods converge very slowly. One of the striking applications of the trapezoidal rule is to the integration of functions with endpoint singularities, by first transplanting y(ξ) to a function w(x) on the real line as in section 5 or sometimes to a periodic function v(θ) on an interval as in section 3. Methods of this kind were introduced in the 1960s <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[143,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">148]</ref> and developed much further in the 1970s by Mori, Takahasi, and other Japanese researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">128,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">131,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">161,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">162,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">163]</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">12</ref> They can be amazingly effective at treating nearly arbitrary endpoint singularities.

(14.3)</formula><p>On the left, there are inverse square root singularities at both ends-integrable, but not even bounded. On the right, the integrand decays like O(e -|x| ) as |x| → ∞, and it is analytic in a strip of half-width a = 1 2 π. By Theorem 5.1, the trapezoidal rule will converge geometrically at a rate O(exp(-π 2 /h)), and if it is truncated to N = 2n + 1 points as in (5.4), the choice h = π/ √ n as in the first row of Table <ref type="table">6</ref>.1 gives exp(-π √ n) convergence. Square root singularities could be integrated in many ways, such as Gauss-Jacobi quadrature. The point about transplantation methods is that they are very general, requiring no particular structure in the integrand. For the tanh rule, the following theorem shows that the root-exponential convergence just described is typical. In practice, almost any integrand of interest will satisfy the conditions of this theorem, since it places no restriction on the nature of any branch cuts or other singular behavior along (-∞, -1] and <ref type="bibr">[1, ∞)</ref>.

The two poles nearest the real axis are located at x = arcsin( 1 2 π/μ)i and its conjugate. The maximum distance these poles can be from the real axis is 1  2 π, which is the case for all 0 &lt; μ ≤ 1 2 π; as μ increases beyond the value 1  2 π, the poles approach the real axis. The choice μ = 1 2 π therefore maximizes the width of the strip of analyticity and at the same time guarantees rapid decay of the integrand.</p><p>To estimate the optimal step size for (14.7), we match discretization and truncation errors as usual. We have seen that the half-width of the strip of analyticity for entire functions is 1  2 π, but singularities of y(φ(x)) in the x-plane may limit it further. Hence we estimate the discretization error as usual by O(exp(-2πa/h)), where now a ≤ 1  2 π. The truncation error can be estimated as φ (nh) = O(exp(- where W is the Lambert W -function. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_9">14</ref> This choice of step size perhaps does not appear in the literature except in <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[141]</ref>; instead, in the original paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[163]</ref> and later, (14.8) is solved by asymptotic iteration after taking the logarithm. With a starting value h = 1/n, one improvement leads to h = log(4an) n , (14.10) which agrees with (14.9) in view of the fact that W (x) ∼ log(x) as x → ∞. Despite this equivalence for large n, it turns out that (14.9) often leads to markedly superior results for intermediate n, as we shall see below.

In the latter case, the integrand is as small as 8.5 × 10 -50 at the truncation point, which is quite incommensurate with the expected discretization error of exp(-π 2 /h) = 1.3 × 10 -12 .

This example shows that, curiously, a singular function such as 1ξ 2 can in fact be more suitable for this type of integration than an entire function such as a constant, even if the difference is only slight. Pursuing arguments such as these, it is possible to show that if y(ξ) is of the form (1ξ 2 ) α-1 g(ξ) for some α &gt; 0, where g(ξ) is bounded away from 0 at ξ = ±1, the estimates (14.8)-(14.9) can be improved to 2πa/h = (π/2)αe nh and h = W (4an/α)/n, with a small gain in accuracy. If y(ξ) has a zero at only one of the endpoints, one can exploit this by truncating the sum (14.7) at different values of n left and right.</p><p>The discussion above is rather informal and intended for practical situations. A rigorous error bound of the form C exp(-c 1 n/ log(c 2 n)) for (14.7) can be established, but for functions y(ξ) in a certain class. This is the class of functions defined on (-1, 1) that can be extended analytically into a domain defined by the image of the strip |Im(x)| &lt; a under the transformation = tanh( 1 2 π sinh(x)), which is an infinitely sheeted Riemann surface that wraps around ξ = ±1.

It owes its success to its fast convergence, robustness against endpoint singularities, and simplicity, since the weights and nodes are explicitly given, unlike those of Gauss-Legendre quadrature, for example. For a comparison of the performance of tanh-sinh transformation with erf transformation and Gauss quadrature in the high-accuracy setting, we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. . Cases (a) and (b) correspond to symmetric truncations of (14.7) with h given by (14.10) and (14.9), respectively. For case (c), h, n + , and n -have been chosen corresponding to a nonsymmetric truncation of (14.7) to exploit the different decay rates of the integrand as x → ±∞. In each case the curves show theoretical approximations based on balancing various error estimates and the dots are the actual computed errors.</p><p>Motivated by these high-accuracy computations, let us consider as an example an integral from <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, Convergence curves for the tanh-sinh rule for different choices of h are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">14</ref>.1. To quantify the convergence rates seen, we note that the half-width of the strip of analyticity is determined by the point where the argument of the arctan term in (14.13) assumes the values ±i; the value is a = arcsin(2/3) ≈ 0.7297. Two of the curves in the figure correspond to the choices (14.9) and (14.10), reaffirming the superiority of the choice based on the Lambert function. In the third and best error curve, we have taken into account the fact that unequal truncation points in (14.7) are advantageous for this integrand; see the discussion above and below (14.12). In particular, the sixfold zero at ξ = 1 in (14.13) allows one to truncate (14.7) at n = -n -and n = n + with n + n -. By balancing discretization and truncation errors, it is possible to find the optimal relationship between n -and n + , which was used to generate the error curve (c) in Figure <ref type="figure">14</ref>.1 (with N = 1 + n -+ n + ).</p><p>The great drawback of exponential and double exponential quadrature rules is their difficulties with underflow, overflow, and cancellation errors in floating point arithmetic.

This difficulty has prevented variable transformation methods from becoming general tools in floating point arithmetic.</p><p>The mappings of Table <ref type="table">14</ref>.1 all map [-1, 1] to R. The so-called periodizing transformations, on the other hand, map R to [-π, π]. One example is the tan rule: x = tan(θ/2), <ref type="bibr">(14.14)</ref> intended for slowly decaying integrands on R. The following is a test example from <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[163]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_149">∞ -∞ dx 1 + x 4 = 1 2 π -π 1 + tan 2 (θ/2) 1 + tan 4 (θ/2)</formula><p>dθ. <ref type="bibr">(14.15)</ref> The transplanted integrand is 2π-periodic, and the singularities at θ = ±π are removable, so Theorem 4.2 predicts a convergence rate of O(e -aN ) ≈ O(e -0.88N ), where a = arctanh(2 -1/2 ). This agrees perfectly with the numerical results reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[163]</ref>. The singularities at θ = ±π in (14.15) are not always removable, however, as is shown by the example</p><formula xml:id="formula_150">∞ -∞ e -x 2 1 + x 2 dx = 1 2 π -π</formula><p>e -tan 2 (θ/2) dθ. <ref type="bibr">(14.16)</ref> Here, the essential singularities at x = ±∞ have been transplanted to θ = ±π, and Theorem 3.2 is not applicable as there is no analyticity in any strip around [-π, π].

This particular integral was analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">[179]</ref>, where it was shown that the convergence rate is O(e -3 2 N 2/3 ), similar to the second example in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>.1. There are also periodizing transformations that map finite intervals to finite intervals. The first of these, one of the earliest examples of a transformation method, is by Sag and Szekeres <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[143]</ref>.

Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php (i) The factor f (s) is analytic not only in the half-plane Re(s) &gt; σ 0 , but also, in many cases, in much of the rest of the complex plane. (ii) The factor e st is likewise analytic and decays rapidly as Re(s) → -∞. These properties allow one to deform the Bromwich line Re(s) = σ into a contour that is better suited for computation, exploiting the rapid decay to turn the integral into the kind treated by the trapezoidal rule in sections 3-6 and section 14. For all kinds of applications, this idea has proved effective. Many of the examples of sections 16 and 17 are of this type.</p><p>The idea of deforming the contour and applying the trapezoidal rule seems to have originated independently in two different hemispheres in the mid-1950s. In England, Alan Talbot and his doctoral student J. S. Green considered integrating the Bromwich integral on a steepest descent contour <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref>. Around the same time, at a conference in Australia, John Butcher suggested a Hankel contour in the form of a parabola . . . which bends towards the negative half-plane [thus introducing] an exponentially decreasing factor which may speed up the overall convergence of the integral <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Butcher never returned to this work, but Talbot did, and twenty years later he published a much cited paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref> in which he generalized and improved the earlier work of Green.</p><p>Consider a Hankel contour parameterized by a real variable x,</p><formula xml:id="formula_152">Γ : s = s(x), x ∈ R,<label>(15.2)</label></formula><p>with the property that s(±∞) = -∞ ± iγ for some positive γ (possibly infinite).

Our plan for the remainder of this section is, first, to outline five particular choices of contours, summarized in Table <ref type="table">15</ref>.1: parabolas, hyperbolas, circles, and so-called Talbot contours and modified Talbot contours. The first two are based on transplantations to the real line as in <ref type="bibr">(15.3)</ref>, and the other three on transplantations to [-π, π]. Then, focusing on the simplest case of parabolas, we will show the kind of analysis that can be used to derive the optimal parameters listed in the table. To show in the most concrete way how effective these formulas can be, we consider as an example the plot of |Γ(z)| shown in Figure <ref type="figure">15</ref>.1, the absolute value of the gamma function in the complex plane. This example is based on the Laplace transform formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_156">t z-1 Γ(z) = 1</formula><p>2πi Γ e st s -z ds, <ref type="bibr">(15.6)</ref> which can be found in most tables of integrals. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[146,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">168]</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure">15</ref>.1 has been computed by evaluating this integral, with t = 1, on a modified Talbot contour discretization with 32 points. The figure shows |Γ(z)| on a grid with spacing 0.1 in each direction of the complex plane. (The symmetry with respect to the real axis in the figure is not exploited.) The complete MATLAB code (except for plotting commands) is as follows: If the function is costly to evaluate at each node, as would be the case when solving PDEs (section 16), the for loop can be replaced by a parallel for loop.</p><p>This code segment is based on the contour</p><formula xml:id="formula_157">s = σ + μθ cot(βθ) + ν iθ, θ ∈ [-π, π].

The version with 0 &lt; β &lt; 1 is known as the modified Talbot contour <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The optimal choices of parameters in the modified contour appear in the code and in Table <ref type="table">15</ref>.1, where the expected rate of convergence is also listed. At a fixed value of z, say 1 + i, the absolute errors in 1/Γ(z) for n = 5 and n = 10 are about 1.6 × 10 -5 and 2.2 × 10 -11 , respectively. This represents an empirical convergence rate of O(e -2.70n ), which is in excellent agreement with the theoretical O(e -2.72n ) listed in the table.</p><p>Another idea listed in Table <ref type="table">15</ref>.1 is a parabolic contour,</p><formula xml:id="formula_158">s = (ix + a) 2 , x ∈ R, (15.8)</formula><p>with a &gt; 0, already used in section 13.

(This formula does indeed describe a hyperbola, as becomes clear when the sine term is expanded in its real and imaginary parts.) The parameter α ∈ (0, 1  2 π) can be adjusted to control the asymptotic angle of the hyperbola, which makes this a popular choice for transforms f with singularities in a wedge-like region around the negative real axis. These arise when solving differential or integral equations involving sectorial operators as in section 16. (However, in practice it does not matter much if one uses a hyperbolic, parabolic, or other contour for inverse Laplace transforms of sectorial operators, since e s &lt; 10 -<ref type="foot" target="#foot_11">16</ref> for Res &lt; -37. In machine arithmetic, the complex plane is a half-plane.)</p><p>One way to compare these various contours is to view their connection with the double exponential quadrature formulas of section 14. 16 To see the connection, note that on the parabolic contour (15.8) and the hyperbolic contour (15.9), the integral (15.3) has Gaussian and double exponential decay, respectively, as can be seen from</p><formula xml:id="formula_159">|e st | = O(e -tx 2 ), |e st | = O(e -1 2 μt(sin α)e |x|</formula><p>), |x| → ∞. <ref type="bibr">(15.10)</ref> This is assuming that the transform f (s) does not contribute to the decay rate.

As it is not a true Hankel contour, it commits a branch cut "crime" in crossing the negative real axis. By moving the crossing point further into the left half-plane, however, the magnitude of the crime can be made as small as desired, and to derive the optimal center and radius listed in Table <ref type="table">15</ref>.1, we balanced it against the discretization and truncation errors. The circle is inferior to the Hankel contours not because of the branch crime, but because it wastes so many of its nodes far in the left half-plane. Using an optimal half-circle improves the convergence rate marginally, to O(e -1.11n ).</p><p>As mentioned earlier, we will now conclude the section by outlining an example of the kind of analysis by which good parameters for these contours can be found. Even though the parabola does not represent the fastest convergence in the present group of methods, we shall restrict our analysis to this contour because of its simplicity. Also, it leads to explicit formulas, which is not the case for the other contours.</p><p>We follow the argument of <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">[180]</ref> and consider the conformal mapping (15.8), with x now extended into the complex plane. See Figure <ref type="figure">15</ref>.3 for a schematic representation of this map. A strip of analyticity in the x-plane is mapped to the cut s-plane, with the cut along the negative real axis. Note that the strip on the right is bounded from above by the singularity at Im(x) = a, but there is no restriction in the lower half-plane. The latter property is inherited from the fact that the integrand in the s-plane is analytic in the exterior of the parabola. We now estimate discretization errors by applying Theorem 5.1; specifically, the generalization of that theorem to the case of an unsymmetric strip of analyticity, as discussed below <ref type="bibr">(5.15)</ref>. Hence, consider in Figure <ref type="figure">15</ref>.3 (right diagram) the halfstrips Im(x) ∈ [0, a + ] and Im(x) ∈ [-a -, 0], where 0 &lt; a + &lt; a, 0 &lt; a -.

The agreement between theory and experiment is striking. This would be a good time, however, to point out the limitations of the analysis. It was assumed that the transform f (s) made only O(1) contributions to the various discretization and truncation error estimates; the only information of f (s) that was actually used is the fact that its Downloaded 10/02/14 to 64.106.42.43.

This is a valid assumption for a transform like f (s) = (s + λ) -1 , with λ &gt; 0, which is the appropriate model problem for parabolic PDEs; see section <ref type="bibr">16 and [182]</ref>. In the case of the gamma function, however, f (s) = s -z can have large or small magnitude when z is far in the left or right halfplanes and the contour parameters (15.13) can become less reliable <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[145]</ref>. The same thing was pointed out in the case of the generalized Mittag-Leffler function in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref>.</p><p>If f (s) has singularities off the real axis, the contour parameters (15.13) are likewise not applicable. If the singularities lie in a parabolic region enclosing the negative real axis, however, the analysis can be adapted by limiting the value of a + by a value strictly less than a. This situation arises, for example, in solving linear advection-diffusion PDEs by the method described in section 14. Formulas for optimal parabolas were derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b186">181]</ref>, where it was shown that the convergence is still geometric but the decay constant gets smaller the wider the region.

In this section we concentrate on methods exploiting Hankel contour integrals as described in the last section.</p><p>Consider the system of ODEs</p><formula xml:id="formula_164">du dt = Au, u(0) = u 0 , (16.1) u ∈ C m , A ∈ C m×m ,</formula><p>which arises upon semidiscretization of a PDE such as u t = Au. This could be the heat equation, with A the Laplacian operator in some coordinate system and A its matrix approximation based on finite differences, finite elements, or spectral methods. The solution of (16.1) is u(t) = exp(At)u 0 , so what we are about to describe can be seen as a method for computing the action of the matrix exponential on a vector without computing the exponential itself. More general functions f (A) besides the exponential are the subject of section 18.</p><p>Taking the Laplace transform of (16.1) with respect to t leads to the integral</p><formula xml:id="formula_165">u(t) = 1 2πi σ+i∞ σ-i∞ e st u(s)ds, u(s) = (sI -A) -1 u 0 , (16.2)</formula><p>where the contour passes to the right of all eigenvalues of A. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_12">17</ref> Deforming the contour to the type of Hankel curve described in section 15 leads to</p><formula xml:id="formula_166">u(t) ≈ h π Im n k=0 e s k t s k u k , (<label>16.3)</label></formula><p>where we have used the symmetry considerations alluded to below (15.5) to reduce the cost. The numbers s k and s k are defined by (15.5), and the vectors u k are the solutions of the equations (s k I -A) u k = u 0 , k = 0, 1, . . . , n. <ref type="bibr">(16.4)</ref> The major expense in a practical implementation of (16.3) is the solution of the shifted systems <ref type="bibr">(16.4)</ref>, which are typically large and require complex arithmetic even when A is real. When the structure of A is such that these systems can be solved efficiently by a direct method, the summation (16.3) can be implemented in a parallel for loop as the summands may be computed independently. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_13">18</ref> When direct methods are impractical, Krylov subspace iteration can be considered. A key point is that because of shift-invariance, only one Krylov basis needs to be constructed for all the systems <ref type="bibr">(16.4)</ref>. This reduces the problem to solving, instead of (16.4), a sequence of upper-Hessenberg systems of much smaller dimension; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[125,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">153]</ref>. For a comparison of Krylov methods with parallel direct methods we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[83]</ref>, where the important issue of preconditioning is also addressed.</p><p>Another way to reduce the cost is to pick a good contour so that the number of linear systems <ref type="bibr">(16.4</ref>) to be solved is small. If A arises from discretization of the heat equation, its spectrum is typically on the negative real axis, and an optimal contour can be constructed by the type of analysis that led to <ref type="bibr">(15.13)</ref>.</p><p>The formula (16.3) computes the solution directly at a given value of t. In certain applications this can give the method an advantage over the method-of-lines approach, in which (16.1) is integrated on all of [0, t] by some Runge-Kutta or multistep formula. While (16.3) can be applied at two or more values of t for the same set of u k , one should keep in mind that the optimal contours are t-dependent; cf. (15.13), for example. If the contour is picked optimally for a particular value of t, the accuracy may drop significantly for other values of t; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b187">182]</ref>.</p><p>As far as we are aware, the first mention of the use of (16.2) as a method for solving the heat equation goes back to the original paper of Talbot <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref>, but no numerical results were reported there. Since then, numerous variants of the method have been proposed and numerical results presented for the heat equation and more general parabolic PDEs.

A recent monograph devoted to the topic is <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref>.</p><p>The greatest impact of the contour integral method has been in the area of parabolic problems. However, there also exists a contour integral formulation for elliptic PDEs defined on cylindrical domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref>. To illustrate this, consider the second-order analogue of (16.1),</p><formula xml:id="formula_167">d 2 u dξ 2 + Au = 0, u(0) = 0, u(1) = u 1 , (16.5)</formula><p>with ξ ∈ (0, 1). If A is an approximation to an elliptic operator in d dimensions with suitable boundary conditions, the system of ODEs (16.5) is an approximation to an elliptic PDE in d + 1 dimensions. Again, one should think of A as a suitable discretization of the Laplacian. The assumption that the boundary conditions are independent of ξ restricts the problem to a cylindrical domain.</p><p>Taking the Laplace transform of (16.5), one obtains, in analogy to (16. The contour in <ref type="bibr">(16.6)</ref> passes to the right of the spectrum of A, as before. What is new is that E(ξ; s) now has singularities, which lie at s = π 2 and its positive multiples, putting a further restriction on the location of the contour. In practice one would therefore select a contour that intersects the real axis in (0, π 2 ).</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref> a method based on contour deformation of (16.6) is proposed and analyzed. Because the function E(ξ; s) in (16.6) does not decay as rapidly in the left half-plane as the function e st in (16.2), however, the contour deformation is perhaps less crucial here. Instead, one can solve the problem on a vertical line in combination with a sinh transformation as in section 14. Based on the type of parameter tuning arguments seen elsewhere in the paper, we propose</p><formula xml:id="formula_168">s(x) = 1 2 π 2 (1 + i sinh(x)), x ∈ R.</formula><p>The approximation is then where s k = s(kh) and s k = s (kh) = 1 2 π 2 cosh(kh)i, and u k = (s k I -A) -1 u 1 . Note that in this method the dimension of the problems to be solved has been reduced by 1. A two-dimensional elliptic problem can be solved by solving a sequence of one-dimensional problems, namely, one resolvent system for each quadrature node. Likewise, a three-dimensional problem can be reduced to two-dimensional problems, etc. The method gives one the option of computing the solution at a specified value of ξ, without having to compute it through the entire domain as is the case with many other methods. Accuracy is lost as ξ → 1, however. As with (16.2), the resolvent systems can be solved in parallel.</p><formula xml:id="formula_169">u(ξ) ≈ h π Im n k=0 E(ξ; s k )s k u k , (<label>16</label></formula><p>As an example, consider the last problem of the SIAM 100-Digit Challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. This involved a particle in a 10 × 1 rectangle undergoing a two-dimensional Brownian motion. Assuming the motion starts from the center, the problem was to compute the probability that the particle will reach one of the ends before it touches the sides. To make the problem more challenging, we consider here the three-dimensional version, i.e., a rectangular box of dimensions 10 × 1 × 1; see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">16.</ref>1.</p><p>The problem can be posed as a Laplace problem for the determination of a harmonic measure; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 10]</ref>. We consider a box of dimensions 2b × 2a × 2a and, making use of the symmetries, we reduce the problem to solving (16.5) on the domain [-b, b] × [0, a] × [0, a] with boundary conditions 0 on one end and 1 on the other. Here A is an approximation to the Laplacian on the square [0, a] × [0, a] with Dirichlet conditions on two adjacent sides and Neumann conditions on the others. For A, we therefore use</p><formula xml:id="formula_170">A = I ⊗ D + D ⊗ I, (16.9)</formula><p>where D is the Chebyshev spectral differentiation matrix on [0, a] that incorporates homogeneous Neumann and Dirichlet conditions at the left and right endpoints, respectively.

Note that the total cost involved is the solution of 30 resolvent systems, each of size 64 × 64.

By taking a Laplace transform of (16.10), one can derive a contour integral representation and its approximation identical to (16.2) and (16.3), but the transform is now <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[118]</ref> u(s) = (sIs 1-α A) -1 u 0 . <ref type="bibr">(16.11)</ref> Note that if α = 1, this reduces to the standard heat equation (16.2).

With n = 16 nodes on a midpoint discretization of the Talbot contour the results are as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">16</ref>.2. Note that because of symmetry, only eight resolvent systems were solved for each α, each of which involved a matrix of size 32 2 × 32 2 .</p><p>The numerical examples presented in this section are primarily of academic interest. One area of more realistic applications is mathematical finance, where convectiondiffusion equations such as the Black-Scholes and Heston PDEs can be solved by these techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">103]</ref>.</p><p>A related integral transform method, in which the trapezoidal rule is applied on a hyperbolic contour, has been applied by Fokas and colleagues to solve a variety of evolutionary and stationary PDEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49]</ref>. Another variation on the theme is the use of the method known as convolution quadrature <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[107]</ref>. This approach is not restricted to parabolic operators to the same extent as the method (16.3), and applications to wave equations are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. Parallelization in time is effected by clever use of the z-transform, which is inverted numerically by applying the trapezoidal rule on a circle. 17. Special Functions. Integrals evaluated by variants of the trapezoidal rule are one of the mainstays of special function evaluation. Such applications have been illustrated already by Poisson's example in section 1 (elliptic functions), the Bessel function example of section 4, and the gamma function of section 15.</p><p>Some of the early attempts in the computer era at table generation were directly based on this strategy. An example is the complex error function, also known as the plasma dispersion or Faddeeva function, w(z) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">167]</ref>. For z in the upper half-plane, the function can be expressed as the Hilbert transform of the Gaussian,</p><formula xml:id="formula_174">w(z) = i π ∞ -∞ e -t 2 z -t dt, (17.1)</formula><p>with the integral to be interpreted in the principal value sense when z is real. It can also be written in terms of the complementary error function,</p><formula xml:id="formula_175">w(z) = e -z 2 erfc(-iz) = e -z 2 1 + 2i √ π z 0 e t 2 dt .</formula><p>Several other functions can be related to it, such as the Fresnel and Voigt functions, as well as Dawson's integral. In 1954, Faddeeva and Terent'ev compiled a set of tables for w(z) in the rectangle z = x + iy, 0 ≤ x ≤ 5, 1 ≤ y ≤ 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. (For 0 ≤ y ≤ 1 they used Taylor series, which are more effective, and in the other quadrants symmetry formulas can be applied.) By bounding the error with the Euler-Maclaurin formula, they were able to generate values to an accuracy of about 10 -8 , an impressive feat at the time. The success of the trapezoidal rule when applied to (17.1) is partially due to the Gaussian decay of the integrand (just as in the example of section 4). The fact that the integrand in (17.1) has a pole at z, however, limits the width of the strip of analyticity and hence the convergence rate. This is why, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, the trapezoidal rule was used only for y ≥ 1. Later authors explicitly removed the pole by a residue subtraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">121,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">129]</ref>. One must be mindful, however, of the possibility of floating point cancellation errors in the resulting formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[166]</ref>.</p><p>When the decay of the integrand is not as rapid as Gaussian, a useful strategy to force a more rapid decay is contour deformation. Methods of this kind based on general Hankel contours were discussed at length in section 15. Another contour deformation strategy is to integrate along a path of steepest descent or stationary phase in order to eliminate oscillations. Downloaded 10/02/14 to 64.106.42.43.

Methods exist that can solve (z j I -A)x j = v for x j even when A has dimension in the millions, as will often be the case for matrices arising in the discretization of PDEs. Thus the magic of (18.4) is that it reduces the matrix function problem for the general function f to the case of the matrix function we know almost everything about, z -1 . An additional bonus is that the algorithm is easily parallelizable on a computer, as mentioned in section 16, since each of the summands may be computed independently. A drawback is that complex arithmetic is usually required, which may be more costly than real arithmetic. However, in many cases one may recover a factor of 2 by exploiting the symmetry between two solves involving z j and z j .</p><formula xml:id="formula_177">f N (A)v = N j=1 c j x j , (z j I -A)x j = v.</formula><p>Here is a prototypical theorem on the geometrical convergence of these methods, a generalization of Theorem 12.2.

In fact, the first three editions of the landmark text by Golub and Van Loan described this formula as "fairly useless from the computational point of view." In the past decade, however, contour integrals have come to be recognized as practical methods for computing matrix functions, and the comment was dropped from the 2013 fourth edition <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[64]</ref>.</p><p>Sometimes, the trapezoidal rule can be applied directly on a circle as described above. For example, this method is used for computing phi functions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">146]</ref>.</p><p>In other applications, the trapezoidal rule becomes competitive after a change of variables corresponding to a conformal map. This idea was put forward in <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[71]</ref>. In the problem considered in that paper, A is a matrix whose spectrum lies in an interval [m, M ] of the positive real axis, and f is a function that is analytic in the complex plane minus the negative real axis (-∞, 0]. This configuration covers the important cases of log(A), A 1/2 , or more generally A α for a symmetric positive definite matrix A, whose condition number will be at most κ = M/m. Now suppose one applies the trapezoidal rule directly. To enclose the spectrum while staying away from the line of singularities of f , the circle of integration will have to pass through the gap between z = 0 and z = m, as in Figure <ref type="figure">18</ref> will require N = O(κ) quadrature points per digit of accuracy, an intolerably slow rate of convergence for ill-conditioned matrices. A conformal map, however, can improve this figure drastically to N = O(log(κ)) quadrature points per digit, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">18</ref>.2. Let the whole complex plane, minus the negative real axis and the interval [m, M ], be conformally mapped onto an annulus in the s-plane, with [m, M ] mapping to the inner boundary and (-∞, 0] to the outer one, and let the trapezoidal rule be applied on a circle in the annulus. (The details of the conformal map, which involves a Jacobi elliptic function, are spelled out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[71]</ref>.) Now the convergence is quite satisfactory. Experiments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[71]</ref> show 10-digit accuracy achieved for A 1/2 or log(A) for a matrix with condition number 10 4 .</p><p>The technique just outlined is called "Method 1" in <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[71]</ref> and applies for functions f with arbitrary singularities on (-∞, 0]. In the common situation where (-∞, 0] is just a branch cut of f , with no singularity except at z = 0, a modified conformal map can be used that leads to a "Method 2" converging twice as fast. For the particular case f (z) = z 1/2 , a further "Method 3" simplification reduces the whole problem to one of real arithmetic, and an example is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[71]</ref> where it takes one second to compute the square root of a matrix of dimension 4096 on a computer for which the MATLAB sqrt command, employing a Schur decomposition of the matrix, requires 26 minutes.

Different conformal maps are needed for the analysis of insulators, whose Hamiltonians have a gap in the spectrum, and conductors, where there is no such gap.</p><p>Up to now, we have spoken of functions of matrices that couple all the eigencomponents, which correspond mathematically to an integral (18.1) in which the contour Γ encloses all the eigenvalues of A. Another door is opened when one considers the same integral with Γ enclosing just some of the eigenvalues, which leads to a projection of f (A) onto the eigenspace associated with those eigenvalues. In the simplest case f (z) = I, (18.1) becomes P = 1 2πi Γ (zI -A) -1 dz. <ref type="bibr">(18.6)</ref> If A is an n × n matrix regarded as a linear operator on C n , then P is precisely the projection of C n onto the eigenspace just mentioned.</p><p>This idea is a powerful one in computational science, where some components of a large matrix or linear operator are often the dominant ones for the application at hand. In the simplest application of this kind of thinking, suppose one wants to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors enclosed by Γ of a large matrix A, which we suppose are known to be k in number. If P is applied to k randomly chosen vectors in C n , then with probability 1, the resulting k vectors will exactly span the eigenspace in question, and from that point, eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be determined by standard methods of numerical linear algebra (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>). This idea has been proposed as the basis for numerical algorithms by Sakurai and coauthors (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">144]</ref> and other publications in the Japanese literature) and Polizzi, whose FEAST algorithm has applied such ideas to large-scale applications in physics <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[140]</ref>. In practical algorithms, P is not applied exactly but is approximated by a quadrature formula, and an outer iteration is introduced to improve the approximation. An obvious choice for some applications is the trapezoidal rule in a circle, though FEAST itself is based on Gauss quadrature. Nonlinear analogues have been considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">188]</ref>, and spectral projectors are analyzed from other angles in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.

The system has coefficient matrix A = πI + 2hB with b kj = 1/(5 -3 cos((k + j)h)), and the right-hand side has entries 2 + sin(kh).

With a different right-hand side in <ref type="bibr">(19.4)</ref>, the convergence rate may be determined not by the denominator in <ref type="bibr">(19.3)</ref>, but rather by the singularities of the numerator, μ(φ). We emphasize, however, that it is not obvious a priori that the convergence order for the quadrature rule carries over to that of the approximation solution of the integral equation; this is a theorem that requires proof <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">100]</ref>.</p><p>Although this example is a simple one, the same ideas of Nyström's method combined with the trapezoidal rule feature in advanced applications as well. For example, an application in three-dimensional scattering is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. It is impossible to do justice here to the vast field of integral equations, which encompasses topics including singular integral equations, boundary integral equations, equations of convolution type, and many others. We already noted the concept of convolution quadrature in section 16, and for its application to integral equations of Abel-Volterra, Wiener-Hopf, and other types, we refer the reader to the many papers by <ref type="bibr">Lubich and coworkers ([107]</ref> reviews many of these developments and contains a large number of references). Likewise, we noted the Hilbert transform at the end of section 15, which arises in the the study of airfoils and potential theory and many other applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="20.">Afterword.</head><p>It would be hard to argue that the fast-converging trapezoidal rule is ever indispensable. It is only a quadrature formula, and there are others. Gauss quadrature is always an option, for example, and now that algorithms with O(N ) complexity are available in Chebfun and elsewhere that make it easy to compute Gauss nodes and weights even for millions of points <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">72]</ref>, the traditional avoidance of Gauss quadrature for problems with large N has lost its justification. Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature has much the same behavior as Gauss quadrature in many circumstances, and is easy to implement <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[169,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">170]</ref>. Indeed, Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature is equivalent to the trapezoidal rule combined with the Joukowski transformation. Finally, for many problems where an algorithm based on quadrature is effective, there may be equally good or better alternatives based on series, best approximations, or other ideas. For example, the trapezoidal rule method used to compute the gamma function for Figure <ref type="figure">15</ref>.1 is not the best possible algorithm for that problem, and alternatives are discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[146]</ref>.</p><p>One reason why the fast-converging trapezoidal rule is nevertheless so valuable is that in some applications it is clearly the most natural tool to use. This is especially apparent for problems involving integration over a periodic interval or a circle. If v(θ) is periodic on [0, 2π], one could ignore the periodicity and apply Gauss or Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature anyway, at the cost of just a constant factor approximating π/2. But this would seem a very odd approach, and in some applications a factor of π/2 might matter a great deal. On the real line or a Hankel contour, on the other hand, the conceptual or practical advantages of the trapezoidal rule are more nuanced.</p><p>The most obvious advantage of the trapezoidal rule is its great simplicity, which has been at the heart of its appeal all along. One aspect of its simplicity is its ready accessibility when a user wants to figure out how to get the job done. Another is more mathematical. Since the trapezoidal rule converges at a geometric rate associated with a disk, annulus, half-plane, or strip of analyticity, its use almost automatically brings along a known convergence rate for many problems. This easily understood behavior is what makes it so straightforward to determine what step size and truncation point to use in a sum like (5.4), for example, to achieve O(exp(-CN 1/2 )) convergence. Other methods may be able to achieve the same convergence rate, but rarely with such easy analysis. Relatedly, the mathematical simplicity of the trapezoidal rule means that in theoretical applications it may provide explicit formulas. For example, in section 13 we saw how it could be used to derive the explicit formulas (13.3) and (13.4) for nearly optimal rational approximations to |ξ| on [-1, 1] and e t on (-∞, 0].</p><p>Finally, an easy tool in widespread use can reveal connections between topics.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="18.">Functions and Eigenvalues of Matrices and Operators.</head><p>One of the most powerful applications of the trapezoidal rule in scientific computing involves the computation of functions f (A), where A is a matrix or linear operator and f is a function such as exp(z), log(z), or z 1/2 . For a comprehensive presentation of this problem, including precise definitions of f (A), see Higham's book Functions of Matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[77]</ref>. A related application concerns the computation of eigenvalues.</p><p>The power of these techniques stems from a conjunction of two circumstances (already relevant in section 16, though not discussed explicitly there). On one hand is the mathematical fact that a special kind of Cauchy integral, sometimes known as the Dunford-Taylor integral, provides a representation for general functions. If A is a matrix or a bounded operator in a Banach space and f is analytic in a region of the complex plane that encloses the spectrum of A, then</p><p>where Γ is any contour in the complex plane that encloses the spectrum while lying within the region of analyticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[91]</ref>. This equation is a natural candidate for quadrature by the trapezoidal rule, which approximates (18.1) by matrices or operators of the form</p><p>for appropriate weights c j (depending on f ). In simple cases Γ may be a circle, and in other situations it may be a Hankel contour as considered in sections 15 and 16, which can be regarded as devoted to the important special case f (z) = e z . (Here one may employ a generalization of (18.1) to unbounded operators.) Note that whereas the integrand of (12.8) has a single pole inside the contour of integration, that of (18.1) will have as many as n poles if A is an n × n matrix, namely, the eigenvalues of A.</p><p>The other circumstance that makes (18.2) so powerful is a fact of numerical linear algebra.
