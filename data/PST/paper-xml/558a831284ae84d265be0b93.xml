O'Brien, Jr., Fellow, IEEE Abstract-This paper considers the problem of detecting lines in speckle imagery, such as that produced by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or ultrasound techniques. Using the physical principles that account for the speckle phenomenon, we derive the optimal detector for lines in fully developed speckle, and we compare the optimal detector to several suboptimal detection rules that are more computationally efficient. We show that when the noise is uncorrelated, a very simple suboptimal detection rule is nearly optimal, and that even in colored speckle, a related class of detectors can approach optimal performance. Finally, we also discuss the application of this technique to medical ultrasonic images, where the detection of tissue boundaries is considered as a problem of line detection.</p><p>Index Terms-Optimal detection, ultrasound.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HE PROBLEM of detecting linear features in an image is of interest because these features may contain important information. For example, in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scenery, it may be known a priori that roads travel along straight lines. In seismic exploration <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, geological formations dominated by specific rock types (i.e., sandstone, shale, crystalline rock, etc.) are often found in layers separated by boundaries that appear as linear features in the images collected. Similarly, medical ultrasound systems display tissue boundaries as broad curves that appear as straight line segments if observed at a sufficiently small scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The detection of these features may be an essential first step in segmenting an image for reconnaissance or diagnostic purposes.</p><p>Feature detection in acoustical or SAR imagery is a challenging problem because of the presence of speckle noise. The physical mechanism of laser speckle, common to all forms of coherent imaging speckle, was surveyed by Goodman <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The statistical treatment in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> was adapted by Burckhardt <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and Wagner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to better describe the statistics of ultrasound speckle. Later, Wagner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> introduced the concept of correlation length to describe the distance over which image pixels show statistical correlation, in terms of imaging parameters such as frequency of interrogation and transducer array size.</p><p>Even though speckle can be treated statistically, and is often said to "corrupt" an image, it is important to note that speckle is not noise in the sense in which engineers often use the term. In SAR imaging, for instance, Munson and Sanz <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> showed that speckle is necessary to be able to form an image at all. In medical ultrasonics, it is widely believed that the speckle "texture" conveys information about the region being imaged, although the exact method of interpreting that information is in dispute <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>A few authors have proposed processing schemes motivated by statistical considerations, notably Kuan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, who derive adaptive techniques for the restoration of speckle imagery, and Donohue <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, who computes the maximum likelihood estimator for coherently reflecting targets from Amode ultrasound backscatter, enabling statistical detection of targets in raw RF data.</p><p>Other processing schemes make simplified assumptions on the speckle statistics to develop useful processing techniques. A survey of some of these techniques is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Bovik and Munson <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, Bovik <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and Donohue <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> assumed a multiplicative model for speckle to produce useful techniques for edge detection, in spite of flaws in the multiplicative noise model <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> is arguably the state of the art in detecting step discontinuities in speckle imagery; however, none of these techniques consider second or higher order speckle statistics in the development of processing techniques.</p><p>This paper represents a comprehensive study of detection methods in speckle noise. In particular, we discuss the optimal and near optimal detection of lines. We also describe a suboptimal approach, similar in principle to the Hough transform <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, which works well when the speckle field is uncorrelated, and which offers reasonable performance at low computational complexity in colored noise. We also find that theoretically, the performance of this technique can be significantly improved by "prewhitening" the speckle field.</p><p>A related technique has been in use in pattern recognition by Lee and Rhodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and by Hou and Bamberger <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Our own work is the first use of this idea in medical imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and includes a strong argument for the near optimality of this approach, at least in the case of ultrasound speckle, which is lacking in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. STATISTICS OF IMAGING SPECKLE</head><p>In order to evaluate the relative performance of different detection rules, we will generate a simulated speckle environment. The following section describes a realistic but idealized model for speckle, which provides a noise environment for the simulations about as challenging as true speckle, but with exactly known statistics that can be provided to the detectors. Actual imaging speckle is only approximately described by this model, as we will invoke certain assumptions that may not be valid under all circumstances. The actual distribution of speckle under various conditions, such as a small number of scatterers per resolution cell, or a nonrandom spatial distribution of scatterers, is the subject of much current research <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. This paper will not consider the sensitivity of the optimal detector to noise modeling errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Fully Developed Speckle</head><p>Imaging speckle is a phenomenon that occurs when a coherent source and noncoherent detector are used to interrogate a medium which is rough on the scale of the wavelength. Speckle accounts for the grainy appearance of images produced with synthetic aperture radar, medical ultrasound, or laser holography systems. A so-called "fully developed" speckle pattern is formed when each resolution cell contains many point scatterers, none of which produces a significant reflection by itself. The received signal is thus the superposition of many small reflections, whose phases relative to the source are approximately uniformly distributed over the ensemble of reflections. The uniform distribution of phases results from the assumptions that there are many scatterers per resolution cell, and that the scatterers in each cell are independent of each other and closer together than a spatial pulse length.</p><p>The sum of all reflections in each resolution cell can be thought of in terms of a two-dimensional (2-D) random walk <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, with each scatterer representing a step of a random magnitude and direction. The resultant of the random walk, the sum of a large number of independent components, is equivalently modeled as a complex Gaussian random variable with independent and identically distributed real and imaginary components.</p><p>Upon detection, the phase information of this complex quantity is lost and an image is formed by displaying the magnitude of the reflected signal in each resolution cell as a pixel intensity. A coherent imaging system may instead produce a squared magnitude image (for example, laser or radar based imaging systems use detectors sensitive to the intensity of incident energy). Since the magnitude and squared magnitude images can be obtained from each other, we will assume without loss of generality that the image is formed by taking the squared magnitude of the underlying complex Gaussian field.</p><p>Statistical correlation between adjacent pixels is a result of diffraction effects in the transverse direction, and intersymbolinterference-like effects in the range direction. A fully developed speckle pattern is thus the magnitude of a complex Gaussian field with correlation structure dependent on the pulse shape, the imaging optics, and the distances involved. Notably, it is independent of the medium being imaged.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Statistics of Specular Reflections</head><p>When a resolution cell contains a target that produces a strong reflection, a different statistical model must be used. If the resolution cell also contains a large number of weak point reflectors, the received signal for that cell can be modeled by a 2-D random walk as described above, but with a nonzero bias. That is, the specular reflector produces an offset with a random phase, to which an unbiased random walk adds complex Gaussian variation. The phases of the specular components are themselves random variables, which we assume to be uncorrelated from point to point, and uniformly distributed on</p><p>The assumption of uncorrelatedness is based on the fact that, in general, there is uncertainty in the position of the source and receiver on the order of a wavelength. In some imaging modalities, this may not be a valid assumption. For instance, in ultrasound B-mode scanning, the phases of specular reflections may be uncorrelated in the transverse direction, but correlated in the axial direction. However, since ultrasound is incapable of imaging linear structures oriented parallel to the beam, we ignore the phase correlation in the axial direction and assume the phase is uncorrelated everywhere in the image. In general, even exact knowledge of the phase does not increase the detector performance significantly, so the assumption of uncorrelated phase is not overly restrictive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Moments of the Speckle Field</head><p>A speckle field, like any other random process, can be described by its statistical moments. The moments of a speckle field can be obtained in terms of the moments of the underlying Gaussian distribution function by using the moment generating function for the complex Gaussian density function <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Let represent points from a speckle pattern, meaning they are related to correlated complex Gaussian random variables by The vector . . . . . .</p><p>has density function <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> where is the mean of is the mean of and is the dimension of The th moment can be calculated using The problem of detecting lines in images is related to a simpler problem, that of determining whether or not a line passes through each pixel. We consider a neighborhood around each pixel and search for lines passing through the center of that neighborhood. This is an -ary hypothesis testing problem, where each of the hypotheses represents a possible line orientation. More general -ary detection problems can be considered by substituting a different set of hypotheses for the straight line segments considered here.</p><p>For simplicity, we take the neighborhood to be an square region, and the number of possible orientations, equal to the number of hypotheses, to scale linearly with We refer to the set of lines as "sticks" because although they are long compared with the correlation length of the speckle field, they are short on the scale of the features of interest; in a sense, large-scale linear features are "built up" of sticks at different locations and orientations. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a set of sticks of length 5.</p><p>In the sections that follow, several different detection strategies are discussed. In each case, except for the rotating kernel transformations, the desired test is performed by comparing the maximum test statistic value at each point to a threshold. For the rotating kernel transformations, the test is implemented by subtracting the minimum test statistic from the maximum test statistic and comparing the result to a threshold.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Optimal Detection</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Optimal</head><p>-ary hypothesis testing is accomplished by selecting the hypothesis which maximizes the likelihood ratio function <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> (5)</p><p>where the signal vector is a set of image points in a neighborhood, and the th hypothesis represents the th orientation straight line passing through the center of the neighborhood.</p><p>The likelihood ratio function is the ratio of the probability density of a particular realization under hypothesis to its probability density under the null hypothesis In the stick detection problem, we wish to distinguish between the null hypothesis and hypotheses through each of which corresponds to the presence of a straight line. The different hypotheses are characterized statistically by (6) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> where is a zero mean complex Gaussian random vector whose real and imaginary parts are Gaussian, independent, and identically distributed, is the binary valued mask corresponding to a stick at the th orientation. This corresponds to the case of specular reflection of sound from a boundary.</p><p>Note that we have "unrolled" the square image regions into vectors for ease of manipulation. This is done without loss of generality, since all the spatial correlations of the 2-D discrete Gaussian random field can be expressed in a correlation matrix. Note also that we will be performing the hypothesis test on the squared magnitude of the image rather than the magnitude. This invertible transformation is done to simplify computation.</p><p>The probability density function of the signal vector under hypothesis can be computed from the underlying normal distribution on the constituents of : (8) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> expressed in terms of an integral over a nuisance parameter with known Gaussian distribution. Note that in (8), we have assumed that the reflection is coherent in phase with the inphase noise component. Since the noise has a circular Gaussian distribution in the complex plane, the projection of the noise onto any two perpendicular axes forms a set of independent, identically distributed Gaussian random variables; thus (8) can be written without loss of generality.</p><p>The density function under the null hypothesis is obtained from ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) by setting to the zero vector: <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> The likelihood ratio function for each hypothesis is thus the ratio of two -dimensional integrals, where is the length of the stick. The most probable hypothesis for any given image region is the hypothesis which maximizes the likelihood ratio function. If all the likelihood ratio functions are less than some threshold, then the null hypothesis should be selected. Thus the optimal stick detection scheme is to evaluate a family of integrals for each point, compute the maximum result and compare to a threshold.</p><p>The true likelihood ratio function requires tremendous calculation (on the order of multiplications by Gaussian quadrature integration, where is the stick length) to evaluate because of all the interpixel correlations that make ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) iterated integrals rather than products of one-dimensional integrals. However, if the speckle is known to have uncorrelated pixels, optimal detection can be performed at more modest cost.</p><p>A speckle field tends to decorrelate spatially rather quickly, so one way of dealing with speckle is to decimate the image to the point where the interpixel correlations are insignificant. In this case, the speckle field can be modeled as the squared magnitude of a white Gaussian field. Thus, the pixels are independent, and the problem reduces to a multidimensional Rayleigh/Rician detection problem, well-known in noncoherent communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Note that it is the magnitude (not squared magnitude) of a Gaussian random variable that has a Rayleigh or Rician distribution. Thus, the likelihood ratio below is expressed in terms of where is the square of the image pixels, consistent with the definition above.</p><p>For white speckle noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, the likelihood function is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> where is a modified Bessel function, and is the th component of the stick at the th orientation. Collecting terms, we obtain <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> where is a constant with respect to which can be incorporated into the threshold.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Quadratic Detection</head><p>The optimal detector in the colored noise case is prohibitively expensive to implement. Even in the case of uncorrelated speckle, optimal detection requires the evaluation of a set of Bessel functions for each image point. Thus, a suboptimal detection rule may be desirable for detection in colored noise if it offers reasonable performance at significant computational savings.</p><p>We now center our attention on the class of linear-quadratic detectors, since they are much simpler computationally than the optimal colored-noise detectors, require no special function evaluations, and can offer high performance. One well-known technique for designing linear-quadratic detectors is to use the deflection criterion. Historically, deflection was first used to design optimal linear-quadratic systems for detecting Gaussian signals in Gaussian noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. However, the approach of Picinbono and Duvaut <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> allows the technique to be generalized to the case of arbitrarily distributed noise, provided certain noise statistics are known.</p><p>A linear-quadratic test statistic has the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> where and the trace term is included to ensure that under the null hypothesis. The subscript is used to denote a particular hypothesis. The deflection-optimal linear-quadratic detection rule has the form of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, and uses values of and , which maximize deflection <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> For Gaussian signals in Gaussian noise, is a signalto-noise ratio (SNR); in general detection problems, it is globally maximized by the likelihood ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In the case of speckle, a linear-quadratic test can not be globally optimal. It may, however, offer a computationally tractable suboptimal solution.</p><p>Picinbono and Duvaut <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> showed that the deflection optimal and can be obtained by solving the following linear equations simultaneously:</p><p>(15) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> where</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22)</formula><p>These statistics can be calculated using the moment generating function <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. Note that since speckle patterns are strictly positive, the mean under the null hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> must be subtracted from the observation so that (17) holds. We define and derive the moments above for instead of Without lengthy derivation, we calculate</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(24) (25) (<label>26</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">) (27) (28)<label>(29)</label></formula><p>where is the th element of the orientation stick, and is the "correlation coefficient" between two points in the complex speckle pattern, taking on values between 1 and 1: <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> Since the detector coefficients and derived from the statistics computed in ( <ref type="formula">24</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">29</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Generalized Likelihood Ratio Detection</head><p>In many cases where a likelihood ratio test is intractable, a computationally simpler generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) can be used instead. The GLRT is the ratio of the active to null hypothesis conditional pdf's, conditioned on maximum likelihood estimates of which active and null hypotheses are present <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Mathematically, the GLRT is written <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> where and are conditional active and null hypothesis probability density functions (pdf's). A significant advantage of the GLRT is its ability to deal with unknown parameters.</p><p>In this subsection, we compute the GLRT for a stick of unknown amplitude in additive colored Gaussian speckle. Like the deflection criterion, this method may provide a useful technique in spite of unrealistic assumptions on the noise statistics. The signal model is the following: (33) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> where is a colored Gaussian random vector, is the unitmagnitude stick of orientation and is a positive quantity denoting the unknown magnitude of the stick.</p><p>The GLRT is obtained by thresholding the following quantity: <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref> Since is a discrete valued parameter (the index into a family of sticks), we maximize first with respect to ; the maximum occurs when <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref> Because the exponential is a monotonically increasing function, we can implement an equivalent GLRT by thresholding only its argument; thus, the GLRT is <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref> Note that we have assumed that however, it is possible for negative values to occur. Since is a positive semidefinite correlation matrix, implies that We will treat this as an error condition implying that no signal is present at that orientation.</p><p>With this assumption, the GLRT can be implemented as <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref> where <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref> If the noise is circularly distributed, is constant with respect to and can be neglected, leading to a particularly simple linear test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Linear Detection 1) Sticks:</head><p>If the noise is assumed to be white, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref> reduces to a simple linear projection operation. At each point, the detection statistic is produced by adding all the pixel intensities falling along a stick of one orientation and maximizing the sum over all possible stick rotations:</p><p>(40)</p><p>Although speckle is neither additive, Gaussian nor white, we have found the "sticks" technique to be useful for detection of linear components as well as for image enhancement <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>2) Prewhitened Matched Filtering: Although the sticks technique has yielded useful results, it is based on questionable assumptions, particularly that the speckle is Gaussian and uncorrelated. A more sophisticated linear detection rule can be constructed by "prewhitening" the image to remove the interpixel correlations, and then applying a matched filter. The prewhitening filter is implemented by retaining the term in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref> but assuming from ( <ref type="formula">39</ref>) is constant with respect to : This can be evaluated elementwise by application of the statistics calculated in ( <ref type="formula">24</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">29</ref>):</p><p>(43) Note that the correlation expression in (43) is independent of the presence or absence of a line. The prewhitening operation assumes the noise has Gaussian distribution with mean and covariance calculated by the moment generating function, applies a whitening filter to the observation, then applies a matched filter. The technique is still suboptimal since speckle does not have a Gaussian distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Rotating Kernel Transformations</head><p>The use of rotating kernel transformations, introduced by Lee and Rhodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> for pattern recognition and enhancement of linear features, represents a generalization of the sticks technique. The transformations involve the convolution of the original image with a long narrow operator at various orientations. The convolutions produce a set of output values for each pixel; the enhanced image is computed pointwise as a function of the output values at each point. Until the present work, the use of these techniques has been statistically uncharacterized. The rotating kernel transformations described below all have the form (44)</p><p>where the choice of and distinguishes the transformations. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> summarizes a few of these algorithms.</p><p>Lee and Rhodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> proposed a "rotating kernel minmax transformation" (RKMT) similar to sticks, except that the detection statistic is the arithmetic difference between the largest and smallest stick projections, instead of the maximum. This technique may offer better performance when the original image has varying degrees of brightness at different points of the image, or a varying SNR. A tapering function can be used with the RKMT by applying a taper to the stick instead of using a rectangular contour. Rectangular, Gaussian and triangular tapering functions are compared in Section IV-C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Other Operators</head><p>The number of potential line detection operators is virtually unlimited. For example, we have experimented with the use of a median operation in place of the line sum used by sticks <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, and with estimating the prior probabilities of each line orientation to help in detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. At this time, we will defer analysis of these techniques, and simply comment that they illustrate the variety of related techniques that can be developed. A comparison of techniques showing their performance in processing real images will be presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. COMPARISON OF RESULTS</head><p>This section presents a comparison of the techniques described above by way of Monte Carlo simulation. In each case, the detector performance is summarized in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, in which the probability of correctly detecting a line segment is plotted versus the probability of falsely detecting a segment when none is present</p><p>The threshold is a parameter which increases along the ROC curve with increasing values of More powerful detectors have higher ROC curves (i.e., for a given false alarm probability, they yield a higher probability of correct detection). For cases where the ROC curves for two detectors cross, detector performance can be quantified in a figure of merit (FoM) equal to the area under the curve.</p><p>To obtain a ROC for a given detector, an experiment was run 1000 times in which a speckle pattern was simulated according to the model in ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. For each experiment, a set of simulations was performed where a line segment of every possible orientation (in the sense of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) was immersed in the noise realization. Each resulting signal-in-noise realization was compared to a noise-only case consisting of simulated speckle with no line segment present. The detector in question was applied to the set of noise-only and signal-in-noise realizations, and the numerical detector output from each case was recorded. The simulations used a random number generator from Numerical Recipes <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and linear algebra subroutines from LAPACK <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and Matlab <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>For each detector, the result of the simulation was two sets of detector outputs, one for each line orientation in each separate experiment, and for each experiment obtained by applying to the noise-only speckle realization. This procedure is equivalent to generating 1000 detection statistics for each active hypothesis, and for the null hypothesis. For any fixed threshold, the expected number of correctly detected signals in the active hypothesis realizations is where is the probability of correct detection. Similarly, the expected number of false alarms in the null hypothesis realizations is where is the probability of false alarm. Thus, and can be estimated by The variance of these estimates, and are upper bounded by since and lie between zero and one. The probabilities and are actually functions of the threshold applied; the locus of obtained by varying the threshold is the ROC curve. The area under the curve, used as a figure of merit, also has variance upper bounded by 2.5 10 ; this is actually a loose upper bound, however, as it assumes no correlation between and at different thresholds. Note that the ROC curves given here represent average detector performance over all possible stick orientations. Note also that we have not considered the problem of correctly classifying target orientation; if a statistic mismatched in orientation to the target returns the maximum value, it is simply accepted as a correct detection. The different detectors The simulation parameters used here are: stick length = 5, kernel size = 1 (white noise), signal amplitude = 1.0. The poor performance of even the optimal detector is due to the very poor image quality.</p><p>do not appear to differ in their classification ability; however, no complete study of this topic has been undertaken.</p><p>The severity of the noise and power of the detectors evaluated was controlled by setting several parameters. First, the "stick length," or linear size of the operator, affects the performance of the detector in a direct way. A long stick will smooth speckle better than a short stick, but possibly at the expense of also smoothing out edge features. In practice, we expect that the edges are only locally approximated by the linear model; i.e., we assume some curvature to the edges. Therefore in actual image processing, this parameter should be set longer than the correlation length of the speckle, but no longer than the length over which the edges are expected to be roughly straight <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In the simulations here, the signal is always matched perfectly in length by the detection template. Thus, if all noise parameters are set equivalently, a longer is much more representative of ultrasound image quality than that portrayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>. The diagonal line is visible, though still significantly noise corrupted. Uncorrelatedness of the noise could be achieved in practice by decimating the image to the theoretical resolution limit of used in producing the image. stick will outperform a shorter stick, since it averages over more data.</p><p>In the simulations presented here, the correlation length of the speckle was controlled by changing the size of the smoothing kernel used to introduce correlation to the underlying Gaussian noise; a size of one implies white noise with variance one. The smoothing kernel is Gaussian in shape, and is truncated at some point. To keep the simulations to manageable length, the kernel size could not be made big enough to allow the noise correlation to taper gradually to zero. However, since the goal of the simulations was to compare detector performance in arbitrarily correlated noise, the shortterm correlation is sufficient to model reality.</p></div>

As in the low-signal-amplitude case, the three detectors offer very similar performance; since the Sticks detector is much more computationally simple than the deflection and optimal detection rules, we conclude that the simple linear matched filter (sticks) is sufficient to obtain near optimal performance in the case of white speckle. kernel size = 3, signal amplitude = 5:0. The signal present is again a diagonal line from upper left to lower right. This noise level is more representative of ultrasound image quality than that in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>(b), but still represents a rather low SNR.

We conclude that in the medium SNR case, the noise coloring is much more important as a corrupting influence than non-Gaussianity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Comparison of Detectors in Colored Speckle Noise</head><p>Figs. 4(a), 5(a), and 6(a) show ROC's comparing the performance of sticks with that of the deflection-optimal detector and the prewhitened sticks detector in the low, medium-, and high-signal-amplitude colored noise cases. Noise realizations at these noise levels are presented in Figs. 4(b), 5(b), and 6(b). The stick length has been changed from the setting used in the white noise case to ensure that it is longer than the correlation length induced by the coloring kernel.</p><p>For the low-signal-amplitude case, we see a clear increase in performance as we move from the simple linear sticks detector to the more sophisticated linear prewhitened sticks detector to the quadratic deflection-optimal detector. This is reasonable, since in general, the optimal quadratic detector must be no worse than the optimal linear detector and may in fact be more powerful. What is surprising is that, especially in the medium The simulation parameters used here are: stick length = 7, kernel size = 3, signal amplitude = 8:0. The signal present is again a diagonal line from upper left to lower right. This noise level is more representative of ultrasound image quality than the noise in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>. As in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>, the deflection and prewhitened sticks detectors perform nearly optimally. and high SNR cases, the deflection-optimal and prewhitened sticks detectors perform almost equally well. This indicates that the optimal linear-quadratic detector is dominated by its linear component, which is approximately the same as the prewhitened sticks detector.</p><p>This result, along with the near optimality of sticks detection of lines in white speckle noise, implies that the coloring of speckle affects the performance of a detection rule more than the non-Gaussianity of the noise. It also suggests that prewhitened sticks may approach optimality in the colored speckle case as nearly as does sticks detection of lines in the white noise case.</p><p>It must be noted that the success of any statistically motivated detection rule is highly sensitive both to errors in estimating noise statistics and defining the target model. In many situations, including ultrasound image processing, it may not be possible to reliably estimate the noise statistics without averaging over an area of image containing unwanted variations in image statistics (such as targets and varying SNR). One possible solution is to use an adaptive whitening filter to decorrelate the noise. Since the noise correlation is separable into axial and transverse components, a onedimensional (1-D) filter can be applied successively in each direction, and will be able to operate on the entire image in spite of the changes in noise correlation or SNR that occur from region to region.</p><p>Finally, a difficulty arises because the stick model for line segments is itself imprecise. If the actual targets are broader than a single pixel, for example, the performance of the detector can be dramatically reduced. The ROC curves presented here thus represent performance bounds on detection rules of a fixed order, searching a known statistical environment for a precisely defined target. Actual performance under realistic circumstances will be somewhat degraded.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Comparison of Techniques by Figures of Merit</head><p>The comparison of detection rules in this section is summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>, in which figures of merit are tabulated for each detector in each experiment by calculating the area under the corresponding ROC curve. In the white noise case when an optimal detector is available, it always offers the highest FoM. Otherwise, the deflection detector generally features the highest FoM, followed by the prewhitened sticks detector (in the colored noise case), the Sticks detector, and finally the suboptimal RKMT detectors. In a few cases, the deflection detector has a lower FoM than another detector. This is likely due to the fact that the deflection operators are selected to maximize the deflection criterion, not this particular figure of merit, which is a more appropriate measure of detector power in non-Gaussian noise. These findings are in agreement with standard results from detection theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>In the colored noise cases, the deflection and prewhitened sticks detectors yield the best performance of any technique surveyed here. The deflection detector is quadratic in the observation, and requires higher complexity than the linear techniques to compute the test statistic at each point. Furthermore, the coefficients used in the deflection detector are obtained by solving a large set of equations; solving for the coefficients is straightforward, but computation-intensive. The other detectors surveyed do not require such elaborate computation to determine the detection rule.</p><p>By comparison, the new prewhitened sticks detection rule is a linear function of the observation, requires low computational complexity multiplies per pixel, where is the stick length), and offers excellent performance. When secondorder statistics for the speckle field can be exactly estimated, the prewhitened sticks detector is the technique of choice. Finally, we note that when SNR is high, the added expense of estimating statistics for the prewhitened sticks or deflection detectors may not be worthwhile, since sticks itself compares favorably, especially in the white noise case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Enhancement of Real Images</head><p>The sticks technique has been very successful in our work in enhancing images for boundary detection. While it is impossible to define the "right" answer as precisely as in simulations, an image formed by plotting the sticks detection statistic at each point is much smoother and visually more easily interpretable. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>(a) shows a 512 442 pixel image of a pig muscle collected with a commercial medical ultrasound scanning system. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>(b) shows a sticks-processed image, using an operator of length 15 pixels. This operator size was determined by subjectively estimating the length over which the boundaries appear to be composed of straight line segments. In practice, the stick length can often be set using prior knowledge of the specific problem being addressed. A comparison of the results with different stick lengths will be presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>Note the thin boundary between two layers of subcutaneous fat which is emphasized even though it is only a few pixels wide. An equivalent size (for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> 4 pixel) median or linear lowpass filter would be incapable of enhancing long straight components as well as the present technique, while filtering with a larger operator, such as a <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> 15 filter, would obliterate features such as dark gaps between lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Adaptive or sticklike median filters <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> are an alternative to stick-projection processing. Finally, the text displayed at the bottom of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>(a) is also processed and displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8(b)</ref>. The tendency of the sticks to resolve image features into lines is evident in the processed text, where connections are made between letters, and between unconnected parts of letters. In medical imaging, tightly curving features such as lettering are uncommon. In more general image processing applications, such as SAR, intersections of lines at acute angles might be more common, and thus the Sticks technique must be used with care, especially in the vicinity of line intersections where the templates model the image features very poorly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Threshold Selection for Line Detection</head><p>Great care must be used in applying a threshold in real data analysis, as a fixed threshold may not be appropriate at every point of the image. Sticks-processed images were successfully used to estimate fat and muscle thicknesses in ultrasound scans of beef carcasses in connection with the Beef Ultrasound Grading Project at the Bioacoustics Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The data varied significantly in quality during this project, and so tissue boundaries were identified by extracting a cross-sectional trace, and selecting with the highest point that 1) exceeded a low threshold, 2) was a local maximum, and 3) fell between a region known with high probability to contain the desired feature.</p><p>More analytically, it is possible to use a threshold that achieves a constant false alarm rate (CFAR). A threshold is selected which produces a certain acceptable number of false alarms in a region known not to contain a boundary. This threshold is then used throughout the image. The performance of this thresholding technique can be analyzed as follows. Assume the speckle is Gaussian distributed with first-and second-order statistics as described in Section II. Here, we will consider the image itself, without the mean subtracted as in that earlier discussion, and neglect interpixel correlations We set a threshold two standard deviations above the mean:</p><p>(47) where is the variance of the underlying complex Gaussian random field, is the stick of the selected orientation and is the amplitude of the stick operator itself. This threshold corresponds to a probability of false alarm of 0.004.</p><p>The probability of correct detection can be computed with knowledge of the first-and second-order moments under the Under this threshold, the probability of correct detection can be computed as (50) which is independent of the template amplitude; equally powerful tests can thus be implemented with unit-amplitude sticks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper has discussed the theory of line detection for the case of speckle noise such as that which corrupts acoustical and radar images. It represents a comprehensive survey of optimal and suboptimal approaches to detecting lines and boundaries in speckle noise. The optimal detectors are computationally expensive to implement in practice, so suboptimal detectors of linear and quadratic order are surveyed as well. A statistical analysis is performed to compare the relative performances of the optimal and suboptimal detection rules under various noise colorings and powers; the resulting receiver operating characteristic curves are bounds on the performance of the detectors under ideal circumstances. While the analysis as given here is valid only for the case of detecting lines and piecewise sticklike curves in Rayleigh speckle, it can be generalized to other multiple or composite hypothesis testing problems by using a different set of templates in place of the sticks discussed here, and by adapting the noise model to fit the true statistics.</p><p>The performance comparison indicates that a linear scheme ("sticks"), with the form of a matched filter in additive white Gaussian noise, performs near optimally when the speckle is uncorrelated, for instance if the image has been decimated. In the case of colored speckle, a prewhitening step prior to the matched filter can yield dramatic improvement in performance if the speckle statistics are exactly known. In the absence of such knowledge, however, the sticks detector is a useful approach that offers reasonable performance in a variety of noise environments. The image formed by plotting the sticks output shows even very thin details from the original image clearly, while still smoothing the speckle. As a result, the machine detectability of image contours is substantially improved.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
