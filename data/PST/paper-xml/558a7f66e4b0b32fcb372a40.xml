<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HE theory for Gaussian dispersive channels, whether time-invariant or variant, has been well established for decades with new touches motivated by practical technological achievements, reported systematically over the years (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[94]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[114]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[122]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[223]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">[225]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b271">[267]</ref> for some recent developments). Neither the treatment of statistical time-varying channels is new in information theory, and in fact by now this topic is considered as classic <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref>, with Shannon himself contributing to some of its aspects <ref type="bibr" target="#b265">[261]</ref> (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref> for a recent tutorial exposition, and references therein). Fading phenomena were also carefully studied by informationtheoretic tools for a long time. However, it is only relatively recently that information-theoretic study of increasingly complicated fading channel models, under a variety of interesting and strongly practically related constraints has accelerated to a degree where its impact of the whole issue of communications in a fading regime is notable also by nonspecialists of information theory. Harnessing information-theoretic tools to the investigation of fading channels, in the widest sense of this notion, has not only resulted in an enhanced understanding of the potential and limitations of those channels, but in fact Information Theory provided in numerous occasions the right guidance to the specific design of efficient communications systems. Doubtless, the rapid advance in technology on the one hand and the exploding demand for efficient high-quality and volume of digital wireless communications over almost every possible media and for a variety of purposes (be it cellular, personal, data networks, including the ambitious wireless high rate ATM networks, point-to-point microwave systems, underwater communications, satellite communications, etc.) plays a dramatic role in this trend. Evidently these technological developments and the digital wireless communications demand motivate and encourage vigorous information-theoretical studies of the most relevant issues in an effort to identify and assess the potential of optimal or close-tooptimal communications methods. This renaissance of studies bore fruits and has already led to interesting and very relevant results which matured to a large degree the understanding of communications through fading media, under a variety of constraints and models. The footprints of information-theoretic considerations are evidenced in many state-of-the-art coding systems. Typical examples are the space-time codes, which attempt to benefit from the dramatic increase in capacity of spatial diversity in transmission and reception, i.e., multiple transmit and receive antennas <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[92]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">[226]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b284">[280]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">[281]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b287">[283]</ref>. The recently introduced efficient turbo-coded multilevel modulation schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[133]</ref> and the bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>, as a special case, were motivated by informationtheoretic arguments demonstrating remarkable close to the ultimate capacity limit performance in the Gaussian and fading channels. Equalization whether explicit or implicit is an inherent part of communications over time-varying fading channels, and information theory has a role here as well. This is mainly reflected by the sensitivity of the information-theoretic predictions to errors in the estimated channel parameters on one hand, and the extra effort (if any) ratewise, needed to track accurately the time-varying channel. Clearly, information theory provides also a yardstick by which the efficiency of equalization methods is to be measured, and that is by determining the ultimate limit of communications on the given channel model, under prescribed assumptions (say channel state parameters not available to either transmitter or receiver), without an explicit partition to equalization and decoding. In fact, the intimate relation among pure information-theoretic arguments, specific coding and equalization methods motivates the tripartite structure of this paper.</p><p>This intensive study, documented by our reference list, not only affected the understanding of ultimate limits and preferred communication techniques over these channels embracing a wide variety of communication media and models, but has enriched information theory itself, and introduced interesting notions. This is illustrated by the notion of delaylimited capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[127]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>, the polymatroidal property of the multiple-user capacity region <ref type="bibr" target="#b294">[290]</ref>, and the like. It is the practical constraints to which various communications systems are subjected which gave rise to new notions, as the "delaylimited capacity region" <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[127]</ref>, capacity versus outage <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[210]</ref>, generalized random TDMA accessing <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[155]</ref>, and attached practical meaning to purely theoretical results, as capacity regions with mismatched nearest neighbor decoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[161]</ref> and many related techniques, and results derived for finitestate, compound, and arbitrarily varying channels. The body of the recently developed information-theoretic results not only enriched the field of information theory by introducing new techniques, useful also in other settings, and provided interesting, unexpected outcomes (as, for example, the beneficial effect of fading in certain simple cellular models <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[268]</ref>), but also made information theory a viable and relevant tool, not only to information theorists, scientists, and mathematicians, as it always was since its advent by C. E. <ref type="bibr">Shannon 50</ref> years ago, but also to the communication system engineer and designer. On the other hand, this extensive (maybe too extensive) information-theoretic study of this wide-ranging issue of fading channels, does not always bear worthy fruits. There is a substantial amount of overlap among studies, and not all contributions (mildly speaking) provide interesting, novel, and insightful results. One of the more important goals of this exposition is to try to minimize the overlap in research by providing a reasonable, even if only very partial, scan of directly relevant literature. There are also numerous misconceptions spread in the literature of some informationtheoretic predictions and their implication on practical systems. In our exposition here we hope to dispel some of these, while drawing attention to the delicate interplay between central notions and their interpretation in the realm of practical systems operating on fading channels.</p><p>Our goal here is to review the most peculiar and interesting information-theoretic features of fading channels, and provide reference for other information-theoretic developments which follow a more standard classical line. We wish also to emphasize the inherent connection and direct implications of information-theoretic arguments on specific coding and equalization procedures for the wide class of fading channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b343">[337]</ref>. This exposition certainly reflects subjective taste and inclinations, and we apologize to those readers and workers in the field with different preferences. The reference list here is by no means complete. It is enough to say that only a small fraction of the relevant classical Russian literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[73]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[76]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">[199]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">[203]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">[209]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">[265]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b297">[293]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b299">[295]</ref> usually overlooked by most Western workers in this specific topic, appears in our reference list. For more references, see the list in <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[75]</ref>. However, an effort has been made to make this reference list, as combined with the reference lists of all the hereby referenced papers, a rather extensive exposition of the literature (still not full, as many of the contributions are unpublished reports or theses. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">[227]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b286">[282]</ref> for examples). Therefore, and due to space limitations, we sometimes refrain from mentioning relevant references that can be found in the cited papers or by searching standard databases. Neither do we present references in their historical order of development, and in general, when relevant, we reference books or later references, where the original and older references can be traced, without giving the well-deserved credit to the original first contribution. Due to the extensive information-theoretic study of this subject, accelerating at an increased pace in recent years, no tutorial exposition and a reference list can be considered updated by the day it is published, and ours is no exception.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces several models of fading multipath channels used in the subsequent sections of the paper. Section III focuses on information-theoretic aspects of communication through fading channels. Section IV deals with channel coding and decoding techniques and their performance. Finally, Section V focuses on equalization techniques for suppressing intersymbol interference and multiple-access interference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. CHANNEL MODELS</head><p>Statistical models for fading multipath channels are described in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[223]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b448">[441]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b466">[459]</ref>. In this section we shall briefly describe the statistical models of fading multipath channels which are frequently used in the analysis and design of communication systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Scattering Function and Related Channel Parameters</head><p>A fading multipath channel is generally characterized as a linear, time-varying system having an (equivalent lowpass) impulse response (or a time-varying frequency response ) which is a wide-sense stationary random process in the -variable. Time variations in the channel impulse response or frequency response result in frequency spreading, generally called Doppler spreading, of the signal transmitted through the channel. Multipath propagation results in spreading the transmitted signal in time. Consequently, a fading multipath channel may be generally characterized as a doubly spread channel in time and frequency.</p><p>By assuming that the multipath signals propagating through the channel at different delays are uncorrelated (a widesense stationary uncorrelated scattering, or WSSUS, channel) a doubly spread channel may be characterized by the scattering function , which is a measure of the power spectrum of the channel at delay and frequency offset (relative to the carrier frequency). From the scattering function, we obtain the delay power spectrum of the channel (also called the multipath intensity profile) by simply averaging over , i.e.,</p><p>(2.1.1)</p><p>Similarly, the Doppler power spectrum is (2.1.</p><p>2)</p><p>The range of values over which the delay power spectrum is nonzero is defined as the multipath spread of the channel. Similarly, the range of values over which the Doppler power spectrum is nonzero is defined as the Doppler spread of the channel. The value of the Doppler spread provides a measure of how rapidly the channel impulse response varies in time. The larger the value of , the more rapidly the channel impulse response is changing with time. This leads us to define another channel parameter, called the channel coherence time as</p><p>(2.1.3)</p><p>Thus a slowly fading channel has a large coherence time and a fast fading channel has a small coherence time. The relationship in (2.1.3) is rigorously established in <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[223]</ref> from the channel correlation functions and the Doppler power spectrum.</p><p>In a similar manner, we define the channel coherence bandwidth as the reciprocal of the multipath spread, i.e., <ref type="bibr">(2.1.4)</ref> provides us with a measure of the width of the band of frequencies which are similarly affected by the channel response, i.e., the width of the frequency band over which the fading is highly correlated.</p><p>The product is called the spread factor of the channel. If , the channel is said to be underspread; otherwise, it is overspread. Generally, if the spread factor , the channel impulse response can be easily measured and that measurement can be used at the receiver in the demodulation of the received signal and at the transmitter to optimize the transmitted signal. Measurement of the channel impulse response is extremely difficult and unreliable, if not impossible, when the spread factor</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Frequency-Nonselective Channel: Multiplicative Channel Model</head><p>Let us now consider the effect of the transmitted signal characteristics on the selection of the channel model that is appropriate for the specified signal. Let be the equivalent lowpass signal transmitted over the channel and let denote its frequency content. Then, the equivalent lowpass received signal, exclusive of additive noise, is (2.2.1) Now, suppose that the bandwidth of is much smaller than the coherence bandwidth of the channel, i.e., Then all the frequency components in undergo the same attenuation and phase shift in transmission through the channel. But this implies that, within the bandwidth occupied by , the time-variant transfer function of the channel is constant in the frequency variable. Such a channel is called frequency-nonselective or flat fading. where, by definition, represents the envelope and represents the phase of the equivalent lowpass channel response.</p><p>Thus a frequency-nonselective fading channel has a timevarying multiplicative effect on the transmitted signal. In this case, the multipath components of the channel are not resolvable because the signal bandwidth Equivalently, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates the multiplicative channel model.</p><p>A frequency-nonselective channel is said to be slowly fading if the time duration of a transmitted symbol, defined as , is much smaller than the coherence time of the channel, i.e., Equivalently, or Since, in general, the signal bandwidth , it follows that a slowly fading, frequency-nonselective channel is underspread.</p><p>We may also define a rapidly fading channel as one which satisfies the relation</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Frequency-Selective Channel: The Tapped Delay Line Channel Model</head><p>When the transmitted signal has a bandwidth greater than the coherence bandwidth of the channel, the frequency components of with frequency separation exceeding are subjected to different gains and phase shifts. In such a case, the channel is said to be frequencyselective. Additional distortion is caused by the time variations in , which is the fading effect that is evidenced as a time variation in the received signal strength of the frequency components in When , the multipath components in the channel response that are separated in delay by at least are resolvable. In this case, the sampling theorem may be used to represent the resolvable received signal components. Such a development leads to a representation of the time-varying channel impulse response as <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[223]</ref> (2.3.1) where is the complex-valued channel gain of the th multipath component and is the number of resolvable multipath components. Since the multipath spread is and the time resolution of the multipath is , it follows that (2.3.3)</p><p>A channel having the impulse response given by (2.3.1) may be represented by a tapped-delay line with taps and complexvalued, time-varying tap coefficients Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> illustrates the tapped-delay-line channel model that is appropriate for the frequency-selective channel. The randomly time-varying tap gains may also be represented by <ref type="bibr">(2.3.4)</ref> where represent the amplitudes and represent the corresponding phases.</p><p>The tap gains are usually modeled as stationary (wide-sense) mutually uncorrelated random processes having autorrelation functions <ref type="bibr">(2.3.5)</ref> and Doppler power spectra <ref type="bibr">(2.3.6)</ref> Thus each resolvable multipath component may be modeled with its own appropriate Doppler power spectrum and corresponding Doppler spread.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Statistical Models for the Fading Signal Components</head><p>There are several probability distributions that have been used to model the statistical characteristics of the fading channel. When there are a large number of scatterers in the channel that contribute to the signal at the receiver, as is the case in ionospheric or tropospheric signal propagation, application of the central limit theorem leads to a Gaussian process model for the channel impulse response. If the process is zero-mean, then the envelope of the channel impulse response at any time instant has a Rayleigh probability distribution and the phase is uniformly distributed in the interval That is, the envelope We observe that the Rayleigh distribution is characterized by the single parameter It should be noted that for the frequency-nonselective channel, the envelope is simply the magnitude of the channel multiplicative gain, i.e., <ref type="bibr">(2.4.4)</ref> and for the frequency-selective (tapped-delay-line) channel model, each of the tap gains has a magnitude that is modeled as Rayleigh fading.</p><p>An alternative statistical model for the envelope of the channel response is the Nakagami-distribution. The pdf for this distribution is <ref type="bibr">(2.4.5)</ref> where is defined as in <ref type="bibr">(2.4.3)</ref> and the parameter is defined as the ratio of moments, called the fading figure, <ref type="bibr">(2.4.6)</ref> In contrast to the Rayleigh distribution, which has a single parameter that can be used to match the fading-channel statistics, the Nakagami-is a two-parameter distribution, with the parameters and As a consequence, this distribution provides more flexibility and accuracy in matching the observed signal statistics. The Nakagami-distribution can be used to model fading-channel conditions that are either more or less severe than the Rayleigh distribution, and it includes the Rayleigh distribution as a special case For example, Turin <ref type="bibr" target="#b525">[518]</ref> and Suzuki <ref type="bibr" target="#b520">[513]</ref> have shown that the Nakagamidistribution provides the best fit for data signals received in urban radio channels.</p><p>The Rice distribution is also a two-parameter distribution that may be used to characterize the signal in a fading multipath channel. This distribution is appropriate for modeling a Gaussian fading channel in which the impulse response has a nonzero mean component, usually called a specular component. The pdf for the Rice distribution is <ref type="bibr">(2.4.7)</ref> where represents the power in the nonfading (specular) signal components and is the variance of the corresponding zero-mean Gaussian components. Note that when , (2.4.7) reduces to the Rayleigh pdf with</p><p>The Rice distribution is a particularly appropriate model for line-of-sight (LOS) communication links, where there is a direct propagating signal component (the specular component) and multipath components arising from secondary reflections from surrounding terrain that arrive with different delays.</p><p>In conclusion, the Rayleigh, Rice, and Nakagami-distributions are the most widely used statistical models for signals transmitted through fading multipath channels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. INFORMATION-THEORETIC ASPECTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Introduction</head><p>This part of the paper focuses on information-theoretic concepts for the fading channel and emphasizes capacity, which is, however, only one information-theoretic measure, though the most important. We will not elaborate on other information-theoretic measures as the error exponents and cutoff rates; rather, we provide some comments on special features of these measures in certain situations in the examined fading models, and mainly present some references which the interested reader can use to track down the very extensive literature available on this subject.</p><p>The outline of the material to be discussed in this section is as follows: After a description of the channel model and signaling constraints, elaborating on the more special signaling constraints as delay, peak versus (short-or long-term) average power, we shall specialize to simple, though rather representative, cases. For these, results will be given. We also reference more general cases for which a conceptually similar treatment either has been reported, or can be done straightforwardly. Notions of the variability of the fading process during the transmitted block, and their strong implications on information-theoretic arguments, will be addressed, where emphasis will be placed on the ergodic capacity, distribution of capacity (giving rise to the "capacity-versusoutage" approach), delay-limited capacity, and the broadcast approach. Some of the latter notions are intimately connected to variants of compound channels. We shall give the flavor of the general unifying results by considering a simple single-user channel with statistically corrupted Channel State Information (CSI) available at both transmitting and receiving ends. We shall present some information-theoretic considerations related to the estimation of channel state information, and discuss the information-theoretic implications of wideband versus narrowband signaling in a realm of time-varying channels. The role of feedback of channel state information from receiver to transmitter will be mentioned. Robust decoders, universal detectors, efficient decoders based on mismatched metrics, primarily the variants of the nearest neighbor metric, and their information-theoretic implications, will mainly be referenced and accompanied by some guiding comments. Information-theory-inspired signaling and techniques, such as PAM, interleaving, precoding, DFE, orthogonalized systems, multicarrier, wideband, narrowband, and peaky signaling in time and frequency, will be examined from an informationtheoretic viewpoint. (The coding and equalization aspects will be dealt with in the subsequent parts of the paper). Since one of the main implications of information theory in fading channels is the understanding of the full promise of diversity systems, and in particular transmitter diversity, this issue will be highlighted. Other information-theoretic measures as error exponents and cutoff rates will only be mentioned succinctly, emphasizing special aspects in fading channel.</p><p>While we start our treatment with the single-user case, the more important and interesting part is the multiple-user case. After extending most of the above-mentioned material to the multiple-user realm, we shall focus on features special to multiple-user systems. Strategies and accessing protocols, as code-division multiple access (CDMA), time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), rate splitting <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">[232]</ref>, successive cancellation <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>, and -out-ofmodels <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref> will be addressed in connection to the fading environment. The notion of delay-limited capacity region will be introduced, adhering to the unifying compound-channel formulation, and its implication in certain fading models highlighted. Broadcast fading channels will then be briefly mentioned.</p><p>We shall pay special attention to cellular fading models, due to their ubiquitous global spread in current and future cellular-based communications systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[113]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[170]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b277">[273]</ref>. Specific attention will be given to Wyner's model <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">[331]</ref> and its fading variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[268]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>, focusing on the information-theoretic aspects of channel accessing inter-and intracell protocols such as CDMA and TDMA. Inter/intracell and multicell cooperation, as time and frequency reuse are to be addressed emphasizing their emergence out of pure information-theoretic arguments. Signaling and accessing techniques spurred by information-theoretic arguments for the fading multiple-user case will be explicitly highlighted.</p><p>We end this section with concluding remarks and state briefly some interesting and relevant open problems related to the arbitrarily varying channel (AVC), compound channel, and finite-state channel, as they specialize to standard fading models. Further, unsolved and not fully understood issues, crucial to the understanding of communications networks operating over time-varying channels as aspects of combined queueing and information theory, interference channels, as well as random CDMA, will also be briefly mentioned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Fading Channel Models, Signaling Constraints, and Their Information-Theoretic Aspects</head><p>In the previous section, general models for the time-varying fading channel were introduced. In this subsection we focus on those models and assumptions which are relevant for a standard information-theoretic approach and elaborate on those assumptions which lead to the required simplifications, giving rise to a rigorous mathematical treatment.</p><p>The general fading, time-varying information channels fall within the framework of multiway (network) multiple-user time-varying channels, where there are senders designated by indices belonging to a set where sender has at its disposal transmitting antennas and it attempts to communicate with receiving sites each of which is equipped with , receiving antennas. The channel between a particular receiving antenna and a particular transmitting antenna, where and are determined by some ordering of the transmitting antennas and the receiving antennas, is characterized by a time-varying linear filter with an impulse response modeled as in Section II. The assumption imposed on and the constraints imposed on the transmitted signals of each of the users as well as the configuration and connectivity of the system dictates strongly the information-theoretic nature of the scheme which may vary drastically.</p><p>To demonstrate this point we first assume that is given and fixed. The general framework here encompasses the multiple-user system with diversity at the transmitter and receiver. In fact, if the receiving sites cooperate and are supposed to reliably decode all users, then the resultant channel is the classical multiple-access channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>. If a user is to convey different information rates to various locations, the problem gives rise to a broadcast channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>, when a single user is active, or to the combination of a multiple-access and broadcast channels when several users are transmitting simultaneously. This, however, is not the most general case of interest as not all the received signals at a given site (each equipped with many antennas) or group of receiving sites are to be decoded, and that adds an interference ingredient into the problem turning it into a general multiple-access/broadcast/interference channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>. Needless to mention that even the simplest setting of this combination is not yet fully understood from the information-theoretic viewpoint, as even the capacity regions of simple interference and broadcast Gaussian channels are not yet known in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">[191]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">[192]</ref>. In this setting, we have not explicitly stated the degree of cooperation of the users, if any, at all receiving sites. Within this framework, the network aspect, which has not been mentioned so far, plays a primary role. The availability of feedback between receiving and transmitting points on one hand, and the actual transmission demand by users, complicate the problem not only mathematically but conceptually, calling for a serious unification between information and network theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[95]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[84]</ref> and so far only very rare pioneering efforts have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b289">[285]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b283">[279]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>We have not yet touched upon signaling constraints, imposed on each user which transmits several signals through the available transmitting antennas.

The bandwidth constraints can be given in terms of a distribution defining the percentage of time that a certain bandwidth (in any reasonable definition) is allocated to the system. d) Delay constraints, which in fact pose a limitation on any practical system, dictate via the optimal error behavior (error exponent <ref type="bibr" target="#b406">[399]</ref>), how close capacity can be approached in theory with finite-length codes. Here in cases where the channel is characterized by the collection of which might be time-varying in a stochastic manner, the delay constraint is even more important dictating the very existence of the notions of Shannon capacity and giving rise to new informationtheoretic expressions, as the capacity versus outage and delay-limited capacity.</p><p>The focus of this paper is on fading time-varying channels: in fact, the previous discussion treating as a deterministic function should be reinterpreted, with viewed as a realization of a random two-parameter process (random field) or a parametrized random process in the variable (See Section II). This random approach opens a whole spectrum of avenues which refer to time-varying channels. What notions should be used depends on the knowledge available about all and its statistical behavior. We mainly refer to cases where the statistics of the twoparameter processes (dropping the indices for convenience) are known, which again gives rise to a whole collection of problems discriminated by specifying which information is available at the transmitting/receiving site. The spectrum of cases varies from ideal channel-state information (i.e., the realization of ) available to both receiver/transmitter to the case of full ignorance of the specific realizations at both sides. In fact, in an information-theoretic setting there is in principle (but not always) a difference whether CSI information at the transmitter, even if ideal, is provided in a causal or noncausal mode.

Clearly, for the deterministic, time-invariant channel, ergodicity does not depend on , as the channel exhibits the same realization independent of While in general we assume slow fading here, implying a negligible effect of the Doppler spread, this will not be the case as far as ergodicity is concerned. The nonergodic case gives rise to interesting information-theoretic settings as capacity versus outage, broadcast interpretation, and delay-limited capacities, all relying on notions of compound channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref>. The fact that a specific channel is underspread in the terminology of Section II, i.e., , implies that it can be treated as a flat slow-fading process, but nevertheless the total transmission duration may be so large that ; thus the channel can overall be viewed as ergodic, giving rise to standard notions of the ergodic, or average, capacity. Although not mentioned here explicitly, the standard discrete-time interpretation is always possible either through classical sampling arguments, which account for the Doppler spread <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[186]</ref>, when that is needed, or via orthogonalization techniques, as the Karhunen-Loève or similar <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[146]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[147]</ref>.

In this case, corresponding mutual information expressions can be treated as random entities, giving rise to capacity-versus-outage considerations. In this setting, power control, provided some CSI is given to the transmitter, plays a major role <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>. This is demonstrated in the case where full state information is available at the transmitter site. The transmitter may then attempt to invert the channel by eliminating the fading absolutely, which gives rise to the delaylimited capacity notion.

This is immediately reflected by the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>, where the state is interpreted as part of the channel output (which happens to be statistically independent of the channel input). Hence, a simple standard (Gaussian) long codebook will be efficient in this case. However, we should emphasize that contrary to the standard additive Gaussian noise channel, obtained here by letting , the length of the codebook dramatically depends on the dynamics of the fading process: in fact, it must be long enough for the fading to reflect its ergodic nature (i.e., , or equivalently,</p><p>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[149]</ref>. Perfect channel-state information available to transmitter and receiver: Again, we assume that the channel state information is available to both receiver and transmitter in a causal manner.

This is immediately realized by introducing at the input of the channel an (amplitude) amplifier, whose gain is controlled by the observed fading power This amplifier is interpreted as part of the channel, the state of which is revealed now to the receiver only. That is, the effective power gain replaces in the logarithmic term of (3.3.10), determining the capacity of the channel with states known to the receiver only. This implies that also in this case a standard Gaussian code can achieve capacity, provided it is long enough to reveal the ergodic properties of the channel, and hence put the averaging effect into action. Suboptimal power control strategies, as channel inversion and truncated channel inversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[112]</ref> may be useful in certain circumstances. These strategies are further discussed with reference to other cases in the following.</p><p>It is worth noting here that the availability of channel-state information at the transmitter in addition to the receiver gives only little advantage in terms of average reliable transmitted rate (see figures in <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[111]</ref> for lognormal, Rayleigh, and Nakagami fading examples), and this small advantage is in particular pronounced for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values, where the unfaded Gaussian capacity SNR may be surpassed <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[111]</ref>. This occurs because the average received power, with the optimal power-control strategy, surpasses , which is the average received power in the unfaded case. An obvious upper bound on is given by applying Jensen inequality to</p><p>This reflects the fact that with fixed received (rather than transmitted) power the fading effect is always deleterious.</p><p>Ideal CSI available to receiver with noiseless delayed feedback at the transmitter: A generalization of the previous case where perfect CSI was available to both transmitter and receiver takes place where delay is introduced and the CSI at the transmitter site, though unharmed, is available with a certain latency. This serves as a better model to common practice in those cases where CSI is fed back through another auxiliary channel (essentially noiseless, as it operates at very low rates), from the receiver to the transmitter.</p><p>We assume here that (returning here to the generic finite-state notations) is Markov, and that at time is made available to the transmitter (the nonnegative integer denotes the delay). For , no delay is introduced and the results given above hold (only ergodicity of is required for</p><p>). This problem has been solved by <ref type="bibr" target="#b316">[312]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref> the problem was shown to specialize to the Markov setting treated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[142]</ref>, where in this case of ideal CSI available to the receiver, no "strategies" are required and simple signaling over the original alphabet of the input achieves capacity. The capacity for the Gaussian complex fading channel with average input-power constraint is given by <ref type="bibr">(3.3.13)</ref> where we define and , and the time index is immaterial here. The operators and stand, respectively, for the expectations with respect to and the conditional expectation of with respect to The supremum is over all power assignments of (a function of which is available to the transmitter) satisfying the average power constraint <ref type="bibr">(3.3.14)</ref> In <ref type="bibr">(3.3.13)</ref> we have used the fact that the probability of when conditioned on is a function of only, for circularly symmetric (proper) Gaussian state process Several sample examples have been worked out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b316">[312]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>, but no full solution has been found for , as an elegant analytical solution for , the optimal power control, does not seem to exist. Clearly, bounds where suboptimal power-allocation strategy is applied are straightforward. A reasonable candidate is the optimal power-allocation strategy of the ideal no-feedback case , where in this case the suboptimal in (3.3.13) is based on the expected value of , that is, , where is given by (3.1.12).</p><p>Unavailable channel-state information: In the case treated now, the channel-state information is not available to either transmitter and/or receiver. The case is conceptually simple, and for i.i.d. states the full solution is available for circularly complex distribution of , that is, Rayleigh and correspondingly exponential In fact, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[87]</ref> it is shown that the capacity-achieving distribution has a discrete i.i.d. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">3</ref>power and irrelevant phase. For relatively low values of the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) dB values, only two signaling levels and with respective probabilities suffice, where For asymptotic behavior with see <ref type="bibr" target="#b282">[278]</ref>. Clearly, the capacity-achieving codes in this case deviate markedly from Gaussian codes, which achieve capacity when CSI is available either to the receiver or to both receiver and transmitter.

Some information-theoretic notions to be treated in the following, as capacity-versus-outage, delay-limited capacity, and expected capacity, are intimately related with compound <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref> and composite <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[61]</ref> channels, and they apply directly to the case where CSI is available to the transmitter only. This setting, when the fading CSI is available to the transmitter only, poses some interesting information-theoretic problems.</p><p>Concluding remarks: Although in this subsection we have only used simple channel models which cannot accommodate multipath, intersymbol interference, and the like, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[127]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[146]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[210]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b294">[290]</ref>), the basic structure of these capacity results is maintained also when they are extended to more general settings, as will be demonstrated succinctly in the following sections. We have also assumed that the fading coefficients are ergodic or even i.i.d. or Markov, which poses significant restrictions on the applicability of the results presented. We shall see that the basic structure is kept also in various cases where these restrictions are alleviated to some degree. For example, in the block-faded case with absolute no fading dynamics (that is, when the fading coefficient is essentially invariant during the whole transmission period of the coded block) the expression of <ref type="bibr">(3.3.22)</ref> for perfect CSI available to both receiver and transmitter (say) becomes a function of and a random variable itself, which under some conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[210]</ref> leads to the notion of capacity-versus-outage. The interesting notion of delaylimited capacity becomes then a special case corresponding to the zero-outage result. In that case, power inversion (i.e., , when possible) is used (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> for a full treatment). When CSI is available to the receiver only, the capacity-versus-outage results are obtained by no power adaptation, that is,</p><p>The results here and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[69]</ref> will also be useful, though to a lesser extent, in the understanding of the extensive capacity results in the multiple-access channel. In the next subsection we extend our treatment to some other important informationtheoretic notions, which do not demand strict ergodicity of the fading process as in the case treated so far.</p><p>2) Information-Theoretic Notions in Fading Channels: In this section we review and demonstrate some of the more important information-theoretic notions as they manifest in fading channels. Again, our focus is on maximum rates, and hence capacities; the discussion of other important notions, as error exponents and cutoff rates, is deferred to a later section. Specifically, we address here the ergodic-capacity, capacity-versus-outage, delay-limited-capacity, and broadcast approach.</p><p>We will demonstrate the results in a unified fashion for simple single-user applications, while the multiple users, the more interesting case, will be discussed in the following subsection. We shall not elaborate much on the structure of the results, as these are essentially applications, manifestations, and/or extensions of the expressions in the general model of Subsection III-C.1). We shall conclude this subsection by mentioning the relevance of classical information-theoretic frameworks such as the compound and arbitrary-varying channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref>, where the compound channel, along with its variants form, in fact, the underlying models giving rise to the different notions of capacity to be addressed.</p><p>Ergodic capacity: The basic assumption here is that , meaning that the transmission time is so long as to reveal the long-term ergodic properties of the fading process which is assumed to be an ergodic process in In this classical case, treated in the majority of references (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[75]</ref>, and references therein, <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[85]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[112]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[118]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[119]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[137]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[155]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[171]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[210]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b341">[335]</ref>), standard capacity results in Shannon's sense are valid and coding theorems are proved by rather standard methods for time-varying and/or finite-(or infinite-) state channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b333">[327]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b314">[310]</ref>. This means that, at rates lower than capacity, the error probability is exponentially decaying with the transmission length, for a good (or usually also random) code. We consider here the simple single-transmit/receive, single-user multipath channel with slow fading, that is, with</p><p>The capacity, with channel state known to the receiver, is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[210]</ref> (3. <ref type="bibr">3.23)</ref> where is the frequency response at time , given by <ref type="bibr">(3.3.24)</ref> and where stands for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) spectral density. The expectation is taken with respect to the statistics of the random process . Note that under the ergodic assumption these statistics are independent of either or , and the result is exactly as in <ref type="bibr">(3.3.10)</ref> for the flat-fading case <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[210]</ref>. The same holds where the ideal channel-state information is available to both transmitter and receiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[112]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[155]</ref> but the optimal power control should assign a different power level at each frequency according to the very same rule as in (3.1.12), correctly normalizing the total average power. For the ergodic case, multipath channels give no advantage for their inherent diversity: this rather surprising fact can be explained by considering the multipath case as a parallel channel generated by slicing the frequency band. The parallelism can be in time, frequency, or both, and, since the capacity in the ergodic case depends only on the first-order statistics of the fading state parameters, the equivalence is evident. In fact, also here, the ultimate capacity can be achieved by a fixed rate, variable-power scheme: it suffices to extend the same device used to deal with the flat-fading channel to the case at hand here, where now a frequency-shaping power amplifier is used by the transmitter to implement the optimal power-control strategy. The conclusion follows by viewing this amplifier as part of the channel, then by considering a resulting equivalent channel, whose states are known to the receiver only.</p><p>We have resorted here to the most simple case of a slowly fading , ergodic channel giving rise first to the very notion of Shannon's sense channel capacity on one hand and the decoupling of the time-varying and the frequency-selective features of the channel on the other.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Capacity versus outage (capacity distribution):</head><p>The ergodic assumption is not necessarily satisfied in practical communication systems operating on fading channels. In fact, if stringent delay constraints are demanded, as is the case in speech transmission over wireless channels, the ergodicity requirement cannot be satisfied. In this case, where no significant channel variability occurs during the whole transmission, there may not be a classical Shannon meaning attached to capacity in typical situations. In fact, there may be a nonnegligible probability that the value of the actual transmitted rate, no matter how small, exceeds the instantaneous mutual information. This situation gives rise to error probabilities which do not decay with the increase of the blocklength. In these circumstances, the channel capacity is viewed as a random entity, as it depends on the instantaneous random channel parameters. The capacity-versus-outage performance is then determined by the probability that the channel cannot support a given rate: that is, we associate an outage probabilities to any given rate.</p><p>The above notion is strictly connected to the classical compound channel with a priori associated with its transitionprobability-characterizing parameter This is a standard approach: see <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[61]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">[247]</ref>; in <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83]</ref> this channel is called a composite channel. The capacity-versus-outage approach has the simple interpretation that follows. With any given rate we associate a set That set is the largest possible set for which , the capacity of the compound channel with parameter , satisfies The outage probability is then determined by (Note that the largest set might not be uniquely defined when the capacityachieving distribution may vary with the parameter ; in this case the set is chosen as the one which minimizes the outage probability .) Consider the simple case of a flat Rayleigh fading with no dynamics , with channel-state information available to the receiver only. The channel capacity, viewed as a random variable, is given by SNR <ref type="bibr">(3.3.25)</ref> where SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio and is exponentially distributed. The capacity (nats per unit bandwidth) per outage probability is given by SNR SNR <ref type="bibr">(3.3.26)</ref> In this case only the zero rate is compatible with , thus eliminating any reliable communication in Shannon's sense. It is instructive to note that the ergodic Shannon capacity is no more than the expectation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[210]</ref>. In fact, when the capacity-achieving distribution is Gaussian and remains fixed for all fading realizations, provided CSI is not available to the transmitter. The capacity of a compound channel is then given by the worst case capacity in the class , and the largest set is then uniquely defined. As mentioned above, ergodic capacities are invariant to the frequency-selective features of the channel in symmetrical cases (that is, when the single-dimensional statistics of are invariant to the values of and ). Now, a markedly different behavior is exhibited by the capacityversus-outage notion. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[210]</ref>, the two-ray propagation model has been analytically examined, and it was demonstrated that the inherent diversity provided by multipath fading is instrumental in dramatically improving the capacity-versusoutage performance. The general case where the fading does exhibit some time variability-though not yet satisfying the ergodic condition-is treated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[210]</ref> within the block-fading model. In this rather simplistic model the channel parameters are constant within a block while varying for different blocks (which, for example, can be transmitted blockwiseinterleaved). The delay constraint to which the communication system is subjected determines the number of such blocks that can be used (more on this in Section IV). The case yields the fixed channel parameters discussed before, while gives rise to the ergodic case. The parameter is then used to comprehend the way the ergodic capacity is approached, while for finite it provides the effective inherent diversity that improves considerably the capacity-versus-outage performance. For , optimal and suboptimal transmission techniques were examined and compared to the simple suboptimal repetition (twice for transmission), while even the latter is shown to be rather efficient (at least in the same region of the parameters). The influence of correlation among the fading values in both blocks is also investigated, and it is shown that the significant advantage of over is maintained up to rather high values of the correlation coefficient. Spacediversity techniques, which also improve dramatically on the capacity-versus-outage performance, are also treated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[210]</ref> by reinterpreting the results for the block-fading channel. See also <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[93]</ref>.</p><p>So far, we have addressed the case of side information available to the receiver only. For absolutely unavailable CSI, the capacity-versus-outage results may still be valid as is. The underlying argument which leads to this conclusion is the observation that the capacity of the compound channel does not depend on whether the transition-distribution governing parameter is available or not to the detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref>. The rationale for this is the observation that since is constant, its rate for long codes, , goes to zero, and therefore it can be accurately estimated at the receiver site. Transmit, for example, a training sequence with length proportional to <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[61]</ref> to facilitate the accurate estimation of , at no cost of rate as</p><p>In fact, the value of is not at all required at the receiver, which employs universal decoders <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[88]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[164,</ref> and references therein], <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[166]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b344">[338]</ref>. The quantification of this rationale, rigorized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">[216]</ref>, is based on the observation that <ref type="bibr">(3.3.27)</ref> where, if the channel state process , is of asymptotically zero rate (or "strongly singular" in the terminology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">[216]</ref>) Under the rather common "strong singularity" assumption, the ergodic capacity of the channel with or without states available to the receiver is the same. In some cases, we can even estimate the rate at which the capacity with perfect CSI available to the receiver is approached. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[176]</ref> for the single-user Rayleigh fading case, where the capacity is calculated for flat fading with strict coherence time (the block-fading model). The usefulness and relevance of the capacity-versus-outage results, as well as variants to the expected capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[61]</ref> to be discussed later in the context of fading <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">[247]</ref>, are usually not emphasized explicitly in the literature in the context of unavailable CSI, in spite of their considerable theoretical importance and practical relevance. This has motivated the elaboration in our exposition.</p><p>For channel-state information available to both transmitter and receiver, the results are even more interesting, as the addition of a degree of freedom, the transmitter power control, may dramatically influence the tradeoff between capacity and outage. In some cases, power control may save the notion of Shannon capacity by yielding positive rates at zero outage, while this is inherently impossible for constant-transmit-power techniques (which are usually optimal when no channel-state information is available at the transmitter).</p><p>The block flat-fading channel with channel-state information available to both receiver and transmitter is examined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> (which includes also the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b317">[313]</ref>). In this reference, under the assumption that the channel-state information of all blocks is available to the transmitter prior to encoding, the optimal power-control (power-allocation) strategy which minimizes outage probability for a given rate is determined. It is shown that a Gaussian-like, fixed-rate code achieves optimal performance, where a state-dependent amplifier controls the power according to the optimal power-control assignment. The optimal power-control strategy depends on the fading statistics only through a threshold value, below which the transmission is turned off. The rate which corresponds to zero outage is associated with the delay-limited capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[127]</ref>: in fact, the power-control strategy which gives rise to a zero outage probability gives also rise to the standard (Shannonsense) capacity. For the case of (single block) the optimal strategy is channel inversion, so that the transmitted power is <ref type="bibr">(3.3.28)</ref> and the corresponding zero-outage capacity is <ref type="bibr">(3.3.29)</ref> where stands for the long-term average power constraint. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>, a clear distinction is made between a short-term power constraint (bounding the power of the codebook) and a longterm power constraint (dictating a bound on the expected power, i.e., characterizing the average power of many transmitted codewords). Space-diversity systems are also examined and for that, in the Rayleigh fading regime, it is shown that <ref type="bibr">(3.3.30)</ref> where the integer designates the diversity level stands for no diversity). Note that in the absence of diversity, in the Rayleigh regime, , as no channel inversion is possible with finite power, as implied by the fact that For , the outage-minimizing power control is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> otherwise <ref type="bibr">(3.3.31)</ref> where is the solution of <ref type="bibr">(3.3.32)</ref> and the corresponding outage is given by <ref type="bibr">(3.3.33)</ref> Here for While, as seen before <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[112]</ref>, channel-state information gives little advantage, especially at low SNR, in terms of ergodic capacity (average rates), the performance enhancement exhibited in terms of capacity-versus-outage is dramatic. Suboptimal coding as repetition diversity was also examined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>, and it has been determined that the optimal powerallocation strategy in this case is selection diversity. Further, it was shown that for the general -block fading channel there is an optimal diversity order which minimizes outage. The latter conclusion may be interpreted as the existence of an optimal spreading/coding tradeoff in coded direct-sequence CDMA, where the direct-sequence spreading is equivalent (in a single-user regime) to a repetition code. Considerable advantage of channel-state information available to the transmitter, in terms of capacity versus outage, was demonstrated for the long-term average-power constraint. This advantage disappears almost entirely, when a short-term average-power constraint is dictated. The block-fading channel model with all channel-state information available also to the transmitter suits well multicarrier systems, where different carriers (frequency diversity) play the role of time-separated blocks (time diversity), and where the assumption in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> that the CSI in all blocks is available to transmitter beforehand is more realistic.</p><p>The capacity-versus-outage characteristics for a frequencyselective fading channel is studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>, where it is demonstrated that the inherent diversity present in the multipath fading model improves dramatically on capacity-versus-outage performance when compared to the flat-fading model. In fact, this diversity gives rise to a positive delay-limited capacity even in the Rayleigh fading regime <ref type="bibr">(3.3.30)</ref>. There are numerous interesting open problems in this category, some of which will be mentioned in our concluding remarks.</p><p>It is appropriate to mention here that the general results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b314">[310]</ref> are also applicable to devise coding theorems in the setting of capacity versus outage. This is explained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[210]</ref>, because the notion of -capacity is directly related to the capacity versus outage. This notion is treated within the framework of <ref type="bibr" target="#b314">[310]</ref>, as the transition probabilities for the code block transmitted are explicitly given and fully characterized statistically. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83]</ref> for further discussion. See also <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[167]</ref> for coding theorems of compound channels with memory.</p><p>Delay-limited capacities: The notion of a delay-limited capacity has already been referred to before, in the context of capacity versus outage where the outage probability is set to zero. Any positive rate that corresponds to zero outage gives rise to a positive delay-limited capacity, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>. For single-user channels, this notion is associated with channel inversion when this is possible with channelstate information available at the transmitter <ref type="bibr">(3.3.28)</ref>. By using the terminology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>, this gives rise to "fixed-rate" transmission. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">4</ref> The interpretation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[127]</ref> of the "delay-limited" capacity is associated with that reliable transmitted rate which is invariant and independent of the actual realization of the fading random phenomenon. Clearly, in the single-user case this policy leads to power inversion, thus making the observed channel absolutely independent of the realization of the fading process. As concluded from <ref type="bibr">(3.3.28)</ref>, this policy cannot be applied unless the channel is invertible with finite power (that is,</p><p>). So far, we have assumed full knowledge of the channel-state information at the transmitter. In case the transmitter is absolutely ignorant of such information while the receiver still maintains perfect knowledge of the CSI, the delay-limited capacity nullifies, unless the fading is bounded away from zero with probability . In such a case, say where with probability , adhering to the simple model of Section III-B we find that <ref type="bibr">(3.3.34)</ref> An interesting open problem is to determine under which general conditions the delay-limited capacity is positive with noisy CSI (in the framework of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>) available to both transmitter and receiver. As discussed before, diversity gives rise to increased values of delay-limited capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>, and in the limit of infinite diversity delay-limited capacity equals the ergodic capacity. In fact, the channel is transformed to a Gaussian channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>, for which both notions of delay-limited capacity and Shannon capacity coincide (see, e.g., (3.3.30) with</p><p>). Multipath provides indeed inherent diversity, and, as demonstrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b253">[249]</ref>, this diversity gives rise to a positive delay-limited capacity even in a Rayleigh regime, which otherwise would yield a zero delay-limited capacity.</p><p>It is appropriate to emphasize that the delay-limited capacity is to be fully interpreted within Shannon's framework as a rate for which the error probability can asymptotically be driven to zero. Hence it is precisely the capacity of a compound channel where the CSI associated with the fading is the parameter governing the transition probability of that channel. In this case, no prior (statistical characterization of these parameters) is needed, but for the determination of the optimal power control under long-term average-power constraints. It is also important to realize the significant advantage in having transmitter side information, in cases where a longterm average-power input constraint is in effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>. If CSI is available at the transmitter, then the capacity of the associated compound channel is the capacity of the worst case channel in the class, which might be larger than the capacity of a compound channel with no such information <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref>, as the transmitter can adapt its input statistics to the actual operating channel. For short-term power constraints, advantages, if at all present, are small, owing to the inability of coping with bad realizations of fading values <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>. In case of unvarying or very slowly varying channels, these results remain valid also when the receiver has no access to CSI.</p><p>As will shall elaborate further, interesting informationtheoretic models result in the case of absolutely unknown statistical characterization of the fading process (say, for the sake of simplicity, discrete-time models). Here the notion of arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) is called for (see discussion of <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref>), but we advocate the inclusion of further constraints on the states, in the AVC terminology, which account for the fading in our setting. This is to be discussed later.</p><p>The broadcast approach: The broadcast approach for a compound channel is introduced in Cover's original paper on the broadcast channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[61]</ref>. The maximization of the expected capacity is advocated, attaching a prior to the unknown state that governs the compound channel transition probability. This class of channels with a prior was called composite channels in <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83]</ref>. This approach inherently facilitates to deliver information rates which depend on the actual realization of the channel and that is without the transmitter being aware of what that realization is. As such, this approach is particularly appealing for block-fading channels where the Doppler bandwidth is either strictly zero or small, that is, the channel exhibits only marginal dynamics. The application of the broadcast approach is advocated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">[247]</ref> for this setting. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b240">[236]</ref> it is applied for an interleaved scenario where the ergodic assumption is valid and hence the ergodic capacity can be achieved, undermining, to a large extent, the inherent advantage of this approach. In fact, as mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">[247]</ref>, this approach is a matched candidate to successive-refinement source-coding techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b232">[228]</ref> where the transmitted rate and, therefore, the distortion of the decoded information depends inherently on the fading realization. In this setting, optimization of the expected distortion is of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">[247]</ref>. It should be noted that in the case where no channel dynamics are present (i.e., in the fading model), the results do not depend on whether side-information about the actual realization of the channel is provided to the receiver or not. This conclusion does not hold when the transmitter is equipped with this information, as in this case (rate-and power-) adapted transmission can be attempted.</p><p>This broadcast approach has been pursued in the case of a flat-fading Gaussian channel with no fading dynamics in <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">[247]</ref>. In fact, as stated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">[247]</ref>, this strategy enables one to implement a continuum of capacity-versus-outage values rather than a single pair as in the case of the standard capacity-versus-outage approach discussed previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[210]</ref>. A continuum of parallel transmitted rates is implemented at the transmitter where an optimal infinitesimal power is associated with an infinitesimal rate. The expected rate was shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">[247]</ref> to be given by <ref type="bibr">(3.3.35)</ref> with</p><p>, where SNR is associated with the normalized power distribution SNR of the infinitesimal transmitted rates. Here stands for the cumulative distribution function of the fading power and SNR is the power assigned to the parallel transmitter rate indexed by (a continuous-valued index). The optimal power distribution that maximizes is found explicitly for Rayleigh fading, i.e., stands for the expected rate conditioned on the realization of the fading power satisfying Optimizing over the inputpower distribution SNR combines in fact the broadcast approach which gives rise to expected capacities <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[61]</ref> with the capacity-versus-outage approach, which manifests itself with an associated outage probability of This original approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">[247]</ref>, as well as the expected capacity of the broadcast approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[61]</ref>, extends straightforwardly to a class of general channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83]</ref>.</p><p>Other information-theoretic models: In <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref> classical information-theoretical models as the compound and arbitrarily varying channels are advocated for describing practical systems operating on fading time-varying channels, as are mobile wireless systems. The specific classification as indicated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref> depends on some basic system parameters as detailed therein. For relatively slowly time-varying channels compound models are suitable whether finite state, in case of frequency selectivity , or regular DMC in case of flat fading. In cases of fast fading, the channel models advocated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref> depend on the ergodicity behavior if (where is the so-called "ergodic duration" <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref>), a compound model with the set of states corresponding to the set of attenuation levels, is suggested. Otherwise, where , an AVC memoryless or finite state, depending on the multipath spread factor, might be used. The latter as pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref>, may though lead to overly conservative estimates. Using classical models can be of great value in cases where this setting provides insight to a preferred transmission/reception mechanism. Universal detectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref>, which were shown to approach optimal performance in terms of capacity and error exponents in a wide class of compound memoryless and finite-state channels, serve here as an excellent example to this point. So are randomized strategies in the AVC case, which may provide inherent advantages over fixed strategies. However, strict adherence to these classical models may lead to problematic, overpessimistic conclusions. This may be the case because transmission of useful information does not always demand classical Shannon-sense definitions of reliable communications. In many cases, practical systems can easily incorporate and cope with outages, high levels of distortion coming not in a stationary fashion, changing delays and priorities, and the like.</p><p>These variations carry instrumental information-theoretic implications, as they give rise to notions such as capacity versus outage and expected capacity. Further, in many cases, the available statistical characterization in practice is much richer than what is required for general models, such as compound channels and AVC. This feature is demonstrated, for example, in cases where the unknown parameter governing the transition probabilities of the channel is viewed as a random variable, the probability distribution of which is available. Input constraints entail also fundamental information-theoretic implications. In classical information-theoretic models these constraints are referred to as short-term constraints (that is, effective for each of the possible codewords) <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[94]</ref>, while some practical systems may allow for long-term constraints, which are formulated in terms of expectations, and therefore are less stringent. This relaxed set of constraints is satisfied then in average sense, over many transmitted messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>. A similar situation exists in the AVC setting with randomized codes, where relaxed constraints are satisfied not for a particular codebook but for the expectation of all possible codebooks <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref>.</p><p>An example is the case, discussed before, where an averagepower-constrained user (single user) operates over flat fading with essentially no dynamics (i.e.,</p><p>) and with a fading process which may assume values arbitrarily close to zero (as, for instance, in the Rayleigh case). The strict notion of the compound channel capacity will yield null capacity: in fact, there is a chance, no matter how small, that the actual fading realization could not support any pre-assigned rate (irrespective of how small that may be). However, notions intimately connected to that of a compound (composite) channel, as of capacity versus outage on the one hand and expected capacities (with or without an associated outage) on the other, yield useful information-theoretic notions. These are not only applicable to the design and analysis of efficient communications systems over these relevant channels, but also may provide sharp insights on how to approach in practice (through suitable coding/decoding schemes) those ultimate theoretical predictions.</p><p>By no means do we imply that classical models as compound channels and/or AVC's are not valuable in deepening the understanding of the ultimate limitations and potential of communications systems over practical fading time-varying channels and provide fundamental insight into the actual coding/decoding methods that achieve those limits. On the contrary, as we have directly seen in the cases of capacity versus outage and expected capacity, these are valuable assets, that may grant just the right tools and techniques as to furnish valuable results in different interesting settings. This, however, may demand some adaptation mounted on the physical understanding of the problem at hand, which may manifest itself in a set of constraints of the coding/decoding and channel characteristics. Associating priors to the compound channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[61]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83]</ref> yielding the composite channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83]</ref> and giving rise to capacity versus outage and expected capacity results, as discussed here, demonstrate this argument.</p><p>To further demonstrate this point, we consider once again our simple channel model of (3.3.9).</p><p>We assume an average-input-power constraint and the fading variables satisfy, as before, , where , but we do not impose further assumptions on their time variability. Instead, we assume stationarity in terms of single-dimensional distribution , which is assumed to be meaningful and available. Further, assume that Under ergodic conditions, the capacity with state available to the receiver only satisfies (3.3.10), i.e., <ref type="bibr">(3.3.36)</ref> where the right-hand-side (RHS) term follows from Jensen's inequality by observing that is a convex function of Under no ergodic assumption and with CSI available to the receiver only, the capacity-versus-outage curve is given by (3.3.26)</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(3.3.37)</formula><p>The notions of expected capacity and expected capacity versus outage as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">[247]</ref> are also directly applicable here. Note that, as already mentioned, both of these notions apply without change to the case where CSI is available to none, either transmitter or receiver. In fact, under this model the channel is composite (unvarying with time), and hence the channel-state information rate is zero.</p><p>When channel-state information is available to the transmitter and then under the ergodic assumption, the capacity with optimal power control is given by <ref type="bibr">(3.3.11)</ref>. The delay-limited capacity equals here <ref type="bibr">(3.3.38)</ref> Note that the delay-limited capacity is a viable notion irrespective of the time-variant properties of the channel (that is, irrespective of whether the ergodic assumption holds or not). Moreover, it does not require the availability of the CSI at the receiver (observing in this case a standard AWGN channel). Note that only a "long-term" average-input-power constraint gives rise to the (3.3.38) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>, as otherwise for shortterm constraints marginal advantages in terms of the general capacity versus outage are evidenced. In the latter case, static fading is assumed. The channel in the example gives, in fact, rise to an interesting formulation which falls under the purview of AVC. Consider the standard AVC formulation with additional (standard in AVC terminology <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref>) state constraint, i.e., <ref type="bibr">(3.3.39)</ref> where is the relevant state space, and is some nonnegative function. The input constraint is also given similarly, by for almost all <ref type="bibr">(3.3.40)</ref> where (3.3.40) is satisfied for almost all possible messages in the message space corresponding to the codeword which may include a random mapping to account for randomized and stochastic encoders. Here is a nonnegative function, say , to account for the average power constraint. The AVC capacity <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">5</ref> for a randomized code is given then by the classical single-letter equation <ref type="bibr">(3.3.41)</ref> which, in fact, looks for the worst case state distribution that satisfies constraint <ref type="bibr">(3.3.39)</ref>. What is also interesting here is that the input constraints take a "short-term" interpretation. Note that the AVC notion does not depend on any ergodic assumption and gives a robust model. In fact, when there is a stochastic characterization of the states, the notion can be combined with an "outage probability" approach, as then the probability that the state constraint <ref type="bibr">(3.3.39)</ref> is not satisfied and is associated with an outage probability. We do not imply here that the solution of a problem similar to (3.3.41) is simple. Usually it is not. Yet this approach, where state constraints are introduced, is interesting, and has a theoretical as well as a practical value. A special example, associated with the delaylimited approach, occurs when , which, along with (3.3.39), implies that no fading variable can be extremely small and still the overall constraint is satisfied. The probability of this event can be computed or bounded. Associated with the AVC interpretation are all the settings which involve average and max error probability (as a performance measure), randomized and stochastic-versus-deterministic coding. All these notions are of interest in practice, and may provide insight to the preferred coding/decoding approaches: we wish only to note that, as the information-carrying signal appears in a product form with the fading variable , which implies that the channel is symmetrizable 6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref>, thus providing theoretical support for a randomizing coding approach. This example demonstrates the value of general information-theoretic concepts when combined with relevant notions as the outage probability, giving all together an interesting communication model, which we believe to be of both theoretical and practical interest.</p><p>3) Information-Theoretic Inspired Signaling: Optimal Parameter Selection: In general, the capacity as well as the capacity-achieving distribution imply some underlying structure of optimal coding/signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b257">[253]</ref>. This is valid also in the realm of fading, and even more so, as information theory dictates some parameters of close-to-optimal coding systems. This is best demonstrated by the results for the case of CSI available to both the transmitter and the receiver, where information theory provides the precise optimal powercontrol strategy, and in addition indicates the exact transmitter structure that may approach the ultimate optimal performance with fixed-rate codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>. The delay-limited capacity <ref type="bibr">(3.3.38)</ref> where perfect channel inversion is attempted, exhibits (when applicable) for the receiver a classical AWGN channel for which, with modern coding techniques, capacity can be closely approached <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[90]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[60]</ref>. Here we will highlight some recent results of primary practical importance, in the case where no channel state information is available.</p><p>First, for the fast flat-fading model, (i.e., the fading coefficients are circularly symmetric i.i.d. Gaussian), the discreteness and peaky nature of the capacity-achieving inputs envelope gives rise to orthogonal coded pulse-position-like modulations (with efficient iterative detection as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">[214]</ref>). Even more interesting is the case of the block-fading model, where the coherence time is some integer greater than , thus modeling slow fading. The elegant result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[176]</ref> not only gives the structure of the capacity-achieving signals, but in fact provides insight into the gradual tendency of the capacity to the ideal CSI available to the receiver with the increase of In the following we shall emphasize some recent insights into the peaky nature of capacity-achieving signaling in the 6 Take the conditional distribution U(sjx) ds in terminology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref> to be dF G (s=x) where F G ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) is some generic probability distribution. realm of broadband time-varying channels, or more generally in cases where the channel characteristics incorporate a set of random parameters, the number of which is at least proportional to the transmission time (this entails a positive rate).</p><p>One of the more interesting models is that of "bandwidthscaling" <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">[187]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[99]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b290">[286]</ref>, where the random channel characterization implies that capacity-achieving signaling should be peaky in time and/or frequency. We shall demonstrate this feature adhering to an insightful formulation which is extended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b256">[252]</ref> to account for many other models. Consider a simplified discrete-time channel model <ref type="bibr">(3.3.42)</ref> where stands for the th sample (out of th blocklength) of the th channel (out of ). The input is a complex variable which stands for the th channel input at time The fading coefficients, designated by , are assumed to be complex i.i.d. Gaussian random variables, satisfying . The corresponding i.i.d. Gaussian noise components with variance per sample are . The input is average-power constrained in the sense <ref type="bibr">(3.3.43)</ref> This simple parallel-channel model can be interpreted as an orthogonal frequency division, where designates the th frequency band. In this model, each frequency is subjected to independent fast flat fading and orthogonal ambient noise. Within this interpretation is commensurate with the available bandwidth. Common sense advocates the use of the full bandwidth with uniform power distribution per coordinate, and bounded inputs per coordinate. The boundedness is based on the "intuition" that for low signal-to-noise ratio (which is evident here for large and finite in (3.3.43)), peak limitation does not imply severe degradation in capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b252">[248]</ref>.</p><p>We shall see not only why this "intuition" is misleading, but our viewpoint will immediately indicate the right way to go. The capacity here is given by <ref type="bibr">(3.3.44)</ref> where are -dimensional vectors with complex components. Now we use the same methodology that has already provided us the right insight 7 in the case of <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[87]</ref>. Let Recalling that the capacity in parallel channels with CSI available at the receiver only is achieved by equi-power Gaussian inputs, we have <ref type="bibr">(3.3.48)</ref> where for the sake of clarity we omit the irrelevant time index. We first try equally spread signals, where are i.i.d., , and where we assume that is not "peaky" in the sense of <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[99]</ref>, that is, for some (a relaxed feature as compared to strict peak-limitedness, that is with probability , for some ). Since we take , modeling broadband systems, we conclude that which demonstrates the absolute uselessness of this signaling strategy, in this setting. Now, let us use orthogonal signaling with orthogonal signals, that is, at each time only one value of (out of ) of is active. Since orthogonal signaling is known to achieve capacity over the unlimited bandwidth AWGN, it is rather straightforward to show that for this signaling, as ,</p><p>where we assume for a moment that overall power is used, that is,</p><p>The other term, however, is</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">(3.3.50)</formula><p>where we note here that only for one , say , the value of is not identically zero. These inequalities and (3.3.45) yield</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">(3.3.51)</formula><p>Note that this equation is no more than a special case 8 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b318">[314]</ref>. Now instead of orthogonal signaling at each time epoch , let us assume that signaling is done with a duty factor , i.e., signaling is attempted only once per epochs, where satisfies the overall average-power constraint. The relevant mutual information in this case follows by <ref type="bibr">(3.3.51)</ref> and equals (3.3.52) 8 In fact, Viterbi's result <ref type="bibr" target="#b318">[314]</ref> follows immediately by the representation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b256">[252]</ref> along with the classical Duncan-Kailath connection between average mutual information and causal minimum mean-square errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[81]</ref>. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b256">[252]</ref> for details.</p><p>where we recognize the familiar behavior. This behavior has been achieved however with a "peaky" signal, both in frequency (orthogonal signaling) and in time . The same result could be achieved by using peakedness in time, only letting be all i.i.d. satisfying the peaky binary 9 capacity-achieving distribution. This distribution is naturally expected, as the channels in (3.3.42) are independent and memoryless and, therefore, independent inputs over the index should achieve capacity, which indeed is the case here, noting that the average-power constraint <ref type="bibr">(3.3.43)</ref> does not impose additional restrictions regarding the statistical dependence of the signal components This simple model is also well suited to address the case of correlated , as is suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[99]</ref>. Assume block correlation, i.e., for where is the th partition of the possible indices into (assumed integer) groups of say consecutive indices. The fading coefficients in different groups are assumed i.i.d. This models a blockwise correlation. The capacityachieving distribution can be found by adopting the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[176]</ref>, reviewed shortly in the following subsection in reference to diversity. That is, the input -vectors , with is distributed according to the result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[176]</ref>, which reads , where is an -dimensional isotropically distributed unit vector and is an independent scalar random variable. This scalar random variable is chosen so as to satisfy the average-power constraint per group Over different groups the input vectors , for different values of , are i.i.d. This model provides insight on how the standard AWGN capacity is approached.</p><p>Clearly, with and , we approach essentially a Gaussian behavior of the capacity-achieving signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[176]</ref>, while for and , the peakiness in amplitude is evident. In all cases, of course, for , the classical capacity value is attained, but the capacityattaining signals have markedly different properties.</p><p>It is worth noting that the peakiness has nothing to do with multipath phenomena: in <ref type="bibr" target="#b290">[286]</ref> it has been demonstrated that the same conclusion holds for a single-path channel even with a fixed gain but a random time-varying delay. The view taken in <ref type="bibr" target="#b256">[252]</ref>, which is mounted on a generalization of the relation (3.3.45) in the simple channel example treated here, attributes this behavior to general cases where the channel random features possess an effective "Shannon bandwidth" (we are borrowing this terminology form <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[177]</ref>) comparable to that of the information-conveying signal itself. The "peakiness" nature of capacity-achieving signals is essential in neutralizing the deleterious effect of the random behavior of those channel models, and that is in contrast to the intuition based on efficient signaling over the AWGN channel.</p><p>There is a variety of different wideband fading models, starting from classical works <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[153]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">[215]</ref>, examining orthogonal signaling in a fading dispersive environment. In most settings the ultimate capacity is achievable, where is as before the AWGN power spectral density and where , the signaling bandwidth, goes to infinity. This is the case 9 For m ! 1 the power per channel Pav=m ! 0, and the capacityachieving distribution is binary <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[87]</ref>.</p><p>even for suboptimal energy-based detectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">[215]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">[216]</ref>. See, for example, the orthogonal MFSK result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b318">[314]</ref>, which yields the limiting performance for -frequency orthogonal signals of power , each impaired by a complex random Gaussian fading process of power spectral density (at all frequency translations) normalized to</p><p>The result of Viterbi reads</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">(3.3.53)</formula><p>Again with the strategy as in (3.3.52), that is, transmitting at duty factor with power while transmission takes place, one reaches the well-recognized relation <ref type="bibr">(3.3.54)</ref> This result is not achievable when peak constraints are imposed on the signals. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b286">[282]</ref> for the exact capacity and error-exponent formulas in the case of unrestricted-bandwidth communications in the fast-fading environment.</p><p>Clearly, even in the broad (infinite) bandwidth case when no dynamics is experienced by the fading process , usually 10 no reliable communication in Shannon's sense is possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[63]</ref> and notions such as capacity-versus-outage and expected capacity emerge. Regretfully, in our exposition we could not elaborate on many relevant results, some developed decades ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[73]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[76]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">[199]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">[203]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">[209]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">[227]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">[265]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b297">[293]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b299">[295]</ref> as space limitations and the limited scope of this paper preclude a comprehensive treatment.</p><p>4) Other Information-Theoretic Inspired Signaling: In the preceding subsection we have focused on special features and in particular on the "peakiness" nature of the capacityachieving signaling over special models of fading wideband channels. In fact, information theory provided over the last five decades much more than that, and here we succinctly scan some highlights, with particular attention paid to the fading regime.</p><p>Multicarrier modulation: This modulation method is motivated by Shannon's classical approach of calculating the capacity of a frequency-selective channel by slicing it to infinitesimal bands <ref type="bibr" target="#b266">[262]</ref>. Shannon has demonstrated that this signaling strategy can approach capacity for a dispersive Gaussian channel. Multicarrier modulation has been considered rather extensively in connection to fading. See, for some recent examples <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[71]</ref>, where multicarrier transmission is considered over multipath channels, with channel-state information given to both transmitter and receiver or just to the receiver. The loss of orthogonality and interchannel interference are considered. See also <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[103]</ref>, where a multicarrier system is considered, and concatenated codes 10 Unless channel inversion is possible with either long-or short-term average power constraints. Channel inversion is possible with short-term power constraint if the fading energy realization is bounded away from zero with probability 1.</p><p>are employed for each carrier. The inner repetition code is softdecoded, while the outer code operates on hard decisions. The equivalent BSC capacity throughput is maximized over the number of users and the number of frequency repetitions. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[65]</ref> adaptive Orthogonal Frequency-Shift Keying (OFDM) is considered for a wideband channel. We have mentioned here very few of the more recent references and have left the rest of the extensive literature on this matter to the references and the reference lists within those references.</p><p>Interleaving: This is one of the major factors appearing in many practical communication systems which are designed to operate over approximately stationary memoryless channels. Information theory provides the relevant tools to assess the effects of such a practically appealing technique.</p><p>For example, insightful results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref> indicate that, with ideal CSI available to the receiver or to both receiver and transmitter, interleaving entails no degradation, as the respective capacities are insensitive to the memory structure of the fading process. If perfect CSI is available to the receiver, information theory is used to devise very efficient signaling structures that have the potential, when combined with modern techniques such as "turbo" coding and iterative decoding, to approach channel capacity. This is demonstrated in the elegant Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> to be described in Section IV, as well as in multilevel coding with multistage decoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[133]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[159]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b325">[321]</ref>. This case differs markedly when no CSI is available. Consider the block-fading model, the capacity of which with no interleaving and CSI is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[176]</ref> and for relatively long blocks it equals essentially the capacity for a given channel state information at the receiver. Interleaving in this case inflicts an inherent degradation, whose severity increases with the blocklength over which the fading stays invariant. Full ideal interleaving results in the capacity of <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[87]</ref>, which, as indicated above, may be markedly lower. In this case as well, the interleaving degradation disappears as Interleaving plays a major role also in other informationtheoretic measures as cutoff rate and error exponents to be shortly discussed in what follows. In fact, the very blockfading model introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[210]</ref> is related to the obstacles in achieving efficient interleaving in the presence of stringent delay constraints.</p><p>Gaussian-like interference: Efficient signaling on the AWGN channel is by now well understood, and recent developments make it possible to come remarkably close to the ultimate capacity limits <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[90]</ref>. This is the primary motivation to make the deleterious interferers look Gaussian. While the classical known saddle-point argument proves that the Gaussian interference is in fact the worst averagepower-constraint additive noise, a recent result by Lapidoth <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[161]</ref> proves that a Gaussian-based nearest neighbor decoder yields in the average of all Gaussian-distributed codebooks the Gaussian capacity irrespective of the statistical nature of the independent and ergodic noise. Thus in a sense one can guarantee the Gaussian performance even without trying to optimally utilize the noise statistics, which might not be available. We shall further elaborate on these results, which apply also for a flat-fading channel with full side-information available to the receiver. In order to transform the multiplicative fading effect into an additive Gaussianlike noise one has to resort to some versions of central limit theorems. A recent idea uses spreading methods via filtering of the transmitted signal, spreading it in time, thus providing the diversity needed to mitigate the fading effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b334">[328]</ref>. This serves as an alternative to interleaving, and this technique effectively transforms the fading channel into a marginally Gaussian channel over which standard coding methods are useful. A similar spreading effect is achieved by classical directsequence spread-spectrum methods with large processing gain factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b246">[242]</ref>, where again the time diversity makes performance depend on many independent fading realizations which by various variants of the central limit theorem manifest themselves in a constant gain factor with some penalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b334">[328]</ref> which may not be too large. The diversity effect is not necessarily achieved in the time domain: the frequency domain serves this purpose equally well; so do combined time/frequency spreading methods, as these are based on variants of wavelet transforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b336">[330]</ref>. Nevertheless, spacediversity methods, to be discussed later, also play a similar role providing the setting to average a reasonably large number of fading realizations. Some strategies employed in the multipleuser realm are left to the subsequent part of this section.</p><p>It is worth mentioning here (although this will be expanded upon in the next section) that coding provides inherently the necessary diversity to cope with fading, in a usually much more efficient way than various other diversity techniques, as direct-sequence spreading <ref type="bibr">[177, and references therein]</ref>. The latter may be interpreted as an equivalent repetition code, which inherently points to its suboptimality. In certain cases, and in particular where no knowledge on the exact statistics and/or realizations of the fading variables at the receiver site is available, various time/frequency-spreading methods which transform the fading time-variable channel at hand into the familiar AWGN channel, are recommended, especially from the practical implementation point of view.</p><p>Spectrally efficient modulation: As for the AWGN channel, information theory provides fundamental guidelines for the design of such systems in the realm of a faded time-varying channel. One of the most typical recent examples is multilevel signaling, which is an appealing scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[133]</ref> not only in the AWGN case, but also in the presence of fading. In fact, <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[159]</ref> uses the chain rule of mutual information to demonstrate that capacity for the flat-fading channel can be achieved with a multilevel modulation scheme using multistage decoding (with hard decisions). Interleavers are introduced on all stages, and rate selection is done, via an information-theoretic criterion (average mutual information for the stage conditioned on previously decoded stages), which if endowed with powerful binary codes, may achieve rates close to capacity, as inherent diversity is provided by the per-stage interleaver. (See also <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">[241]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b325">[321]</ref>, where multilevel coding with independent stage decoding in the realm of unfaded and faded channels is considered.) Rates are selected by mutual information criteria, and compared to the achievable results with multistage decoding.</p><p>In the contribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>, the scheme originally advocated by Zehavi, where a coded-modulation signaling is bit-interleaved and each channel is separately treated, is investigated via information-theoretic tools in the AWGN and flat-fading channel, with known and unknown channel-state information at the receiver. It is concluded that Gray labeling (or pseudo-Gray labeling if the former cannot be achieved) yields overall rates similar to the rates achieved by the signal set itself, while Ungerboeck's set partitioning inflicts significant degradation. (The cutoff rate is also investigated, and it is demonstrated that the cutoff rate, when exceeds , and with Gray or pseudo-Gray mapping, surpasses the corresponding cutoff rate of the signal set itself.) This is a remarkable observation which gives rise to parallel decoding of all stages with no side information passed between stages. This technique can also mitigate delay constraints, as each level is decoded on an individual basis. Further results are reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">[241]</ref> where multilevel coding with independent stage decoding in the realm of unfaded and faded channels is considered. Rates are selected by mutual information criteria, and performance is compared to the achievable results with multistage decoding. For a tutorial exposition on multilevel coding, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[133]</ref>.</p><p>As we have already concluded, techniques and methods used for deterministic channels with or without dispersion are directly applicable to the time-varying framework, whether by taking one further expectation with respect to the random process characterizing this dispersive response or, alternatively, the final result is a random variable depending of course on the fact that channel characterization is treated as a random entity. Over the last five decades, information theory has been providing a solid theoretical ground and results motivating specific signaling methods with the goal of approaching capacity. We shall mention here only a few representative examples, while many others can be traced by scanning the information-theoretic literature. The classical orthogonalization which decomposes the original dispersive channel into parallel channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[94]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">[226]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[132]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[152]</ref> is fundamental not only for a conceptually rigorous derivation of capacity, but carries over basic insight into the very implementation of information-theoretic inspired signaling methods. The information-theoretic implications of tail-canceling and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) decision feedback as well as precoding techniques at the transmitter (cf. Tomlinson-Harashima equalization and the like) are very thoroughly addressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">[250]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[58]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b264">[260]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[57]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[90]</ref>. While the results for fixed dispersive channels are directly applicable in the case where CSI is known both to the receiver and transmitter, this may not be valid in general for other cases. Clearly, many results, as that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b264">[260]</ref>, are applicable also to the case where CSI is available to the receiver only, as the transmitter employs a fixed strategy which is not channel-state adaptive. In fact, in a situation of slow time variations of the channel characteristics (that is,</p><p>), those results are applicable also when no CSI is available, as this case falls within the compoundchannel model, with the frequency response playing the role of the parameter characterizing the channel (i.e., its transition probability) <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref>.</p><p>These examples demonstrate clearly that most of the classical results developed over the last five decades of informationtheoretic research are applicable as they are, or with some minor modifications, to the realm of faded time-varying channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[139]</ref>. This holds also for contributions which examine signaling used to communicate over a dispersive channel subject to constraints other than average power. References <ref type="bibr" target="#b252">[248]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">[211]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b260">[256]</ref> and reference lists therein provide some examples, where the main signaling constraints are peak-power in many variations, combined or not with bandlimitedness.</p><p>5) Unavailable Channel-State Information: Information-Theoretic Aspects: In previous subsections we have addressed the capacity problem of a time-varying fading channel with a certain assumption about the availability, or nonavailability, of accurate CSI at the receiver and/or transmitter sites. The case of unavailable CSI accounts for the practical model and provides ultimate limits for cases where there are no separate channels to convey CSI to the receiver. Estimates of the degradation inflicted by lacking CSI are available (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[185]</ref>). Yet the receiver, if its structure requires such a CSI explicitly, must retrieve it from the received signal itself. Many approaches use different variants of training sequences to facilitate simple learning by the receiver of the CSI. As discussed in [164, and references therein], those approaches are in particular appealing for the case where , that is, the time-varying features of the channel are relatively slow. While having in such a case a negligible effect on capacity, as the training sequences are sent infrequently, yet the error exponent may suffer significant degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref>. Information theory does provide the tools to address such problems, and in a recent contribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[140]</ref> the information detection issue and CSI estimation are treated in a unified information-theoretic framework. Specifically, the optimal determination of CSI where side information or redundancy at a prescribed rate are available to the receiver is examined. Information-theoretic measures characterizing detection and estimation are presented, and associated bounds are found. It is concluded that in a variety of cases the above stated method of training sequences is suboptimal. Other papers, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b291">[287]</ref>, use information-theoretic measures to compare different procedures to estimate the CSI, which is a dispersive vector channel in <ref type="bibr" target="#b291">[287]</ref>. Full statistical characterization of the channel may not always exist, or even if it does exist, it might be unavailable. The compound or composite channels are classical examples, as once the transition statistics is determined, it characterizes performance through the whole transmission. While a whole class of decoders achieves the capacity of the compound channel and, primarily, that decoder matched to the saddle-point solution (3.3.41) of the worst case channel/best input statistics, a considerably more interesting class are universal decoders <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref>.</p><p>The universal decoder is able to achieve usually not only the capacity but the whole random-coding error exponent, which is associated with the optimal maximum-likelihood decoder matched to the actual channel, and this without any prior knowledge of the statistics of that operating channel. Indeed, universal decoders do not use the naive approach of decoupling the channel estimation and the decoding process. We shall reference here only a few such classical universal decoders as the maximizer of mutual information <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref>, the universal decoding based on Lempel/Ziv parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b344">[338]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[166]</ref> applicable to a variety of finite-state channels, and a recent contribution in <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[88]</ref> applicable to channels with memory. We leave the details to the excellent tutorial <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref>.</p><p>Mismatched decoding: An interesting informationtheoretical problem (mismatched decoders) accounts for the fact that a matched and/or universal decoder might be very complex and in fact unfeasible, and addresses a whole spectrum of cases where either the channel statistics are not precisely known and/or implementation constraints dictate a given decoder. Here a receiver employs a given decoding metric irrespective of its suboptimality. The full extent of the information-theoretic problem, as reflected by the ultimate mismatched achievable rates, is not yet solved, but for binary inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. However, numerous bounds and fundamental insights into that problem have been reported. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref> for a selected list of references and for further details.</p><p>One of the more interesting and relevant mismatched decoders is one that bases its decision on a Gaussian optimal minimum-distance metric. A class of results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[161]</ref> demonstrates that the Gaussian capacity cannot be surpassed for random Gaussian codes performance (performance is averaged over all codebooks), even if the additive noise departs considerably from the Gaussian statistics giving rise to a much higher matched capacity. In fact, with perfect CSI at the receiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[161]</ref>, the same result holds for the ergodic fading channel with a general ergodic independent noise. That is, the associated capacity for the Gaussian case is attained, and cannot be surpassed by a random Gaussian code irrespective of the actual statistics of the additive noise. We shall further refer to similar results in the context of imperfect CSI at the receiver. The Gaussian-based mismatched metric has been applied for a variety of cases; see examples in <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[150]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">[190]</ref>.</p><p>In a variety of cases with special practical implications, the receiver has at its disposal imperfect channel-state information, which it uses to devise the associated decoding metric. Many works examine the associated reliable rate using different information-theoretic criteria as the mismatch capacity, mismatched cutoff rate (or generalized cutoff rate) <ref type="bibr" target="#b255">[251]</ref>, and error exponents <ref type="bibr">[150, and references therein]</ref>. Even here there are many approaches which depend on the knowledge available at the receiving side. If the receiver is equipped with the full statistical description of the pair where stands for the given or estimated state (relevant fading coefficients, for the case at hand) at the receiver, standard informationtheoretic expressions apply, via the interpretation of as part of the observables at the receiver. This however is seldom the case, and in most instances this statistical characterization is either unavailable or yields complex detectors. Here also, mismatch detection serves as an interesting viable option.</p><p>The mismatched decoder based on an integer metric, which is used on digital VLSI complexity-controlled implementations <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">[238]</ref>, has been considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> in the binary-input fading channel with or without diversity. In such a setting the best space partition which maximizes the exact mismatched capacity has been found, and it has been shown to be reasonably robust to the optimizing criterion (either mismatch capacity or mismatched cutoff rate). Again, we shall refer to some other relevant recent results <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[186]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[165]</ref> and present some of the results in their most simple setting.</p><p>Consider the usual complex flat-fading channel (3.3.9), where it is assumed that the fading and the additive-noise processes and are independent and ergodic, and so is the input process , assumed to be circularly symmetric Gaussian with power</p><p>In our model we assume further that the receiver has an independent estimate of which is optimal in the sense that (for example, is produced by a conditional expectation over a given sigma-algebra of measurements independent of , that is, a side-information channel which conveys information on via , where belongs to some set of indices). We assume that are jointly ergodic. We interpret as the known portion of the channel at the receiver, while the CSI estimation error is given by the sequence</p><p>The above assumption guarantees that , and it is straightforward to show that</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">(3.3.55)</formula><p>Here results by noticing that , and the inequality follows by noticing that among the family of uncorrelated additive noises impairing a Gaussian input, the Gaussian noise with the same power yields the worst case <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[186]</ref>. This is a generalization of the result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[186]</ref>, which considered the special case of real signals, Gaussian additive noise the estimate where stands for a nonnegative fading variable. In this case, the external expectation in (3.3.55) is superfluous. While (3.3.55) provides a lower bound on the mutual information and due to the ergodic nature of the problem, this expression lower-bounds the capacity in this setting. The bound (3.3.55) depends on basic features <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">11</ref> of the problem and the conditional error ; yet to realize this bound, the decoder has to use the optimal statistics based on the channel transition probability <ref type="bibr">(3.3.56)</ref> where we notice by the channel setting that , where denote appropriate density or conditioned density.</p><p>An interesting result showed recently in <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[165]</ref> proves that the expression in <ref type="bibr">(3.3.55)</ref> is in fact an upper bound on the achievable rates of a mismatched decoder which employs a matched metric for the Gaussian fading channel that assumes that the channel is For the case of optimal phase estimation, that is, , which is evidently satisfied for the single-dimensional model where is a nonnegative real fading variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[186]</ref>, the bound (3.3.55) is strictly tight (i.e., equals the mismatched rate). This bound holds for the random Gaussian codebook and it demonstrates on one hand the usefulness of the mismatch decoding notion in practical applications and on the other hand it dictates, by noticing that the expression in (3.3.55) is power-limited and upper-bounded by <ref type="bibr">(3.3.57)</ref> that this model is extremely sensitive to the channel estimation error, which is contrary to common belief. In fact, <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[165]</ref> extends the treatment providing similar bounds on achievable rates for the mismatched nearest neighbor-based decoder in certain cases where the estimation of is done causally by observing the received signals This extension serves to eliminate the assumption of an independent side-information channel, and allows for causal learning of the a priori unknown fading realizations. Therefore, its practical implications should be evident.</p><p>This concludes our very short review of some relevant information-theoretic considerations referred to suboptimal detection (as mismatched decoding) and the role of imprecise CSI. The material available in the literature for this case is especially rich (see relevant entries in our reference list, and references therein) and in general this forms a classical example where information-theoretic arguments provide valuable insights yielding a strong practical impact.</p><p>6) Diversity: Diversity, being a major means in coping with the deleterious effect of fading and time-varying characteristics of the channel, attracted naturally much informationtheoretic attention. We do not intend here to provide a comprehensive review of these results (some of their practical implications to coding will be discussed in the next section), but rather mention just a few sample references putting the emphasis on the interesting case, catching of late much attention, of transmitter diversity. That is, transmitter diversity provides substantial enhancement of the achievable rates, which without any doubt will become extremely appealing in future communication systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">[220]</ref>. As said, space diversity at the receiver is now common practice, which in fact has beenstudied for its information-theoretic aspects in many dozens of references in the literature. We shall, at best, mention only a small sample of those.</p><p>Diversity at the receiver with CSI available to the receiver is considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[210]</ref>, where capacities and capacity distributions are provided for two diversity branches with optimal (maximal-gain) or suboptimal (selection) combining, where both diversity branches may be correlated. It was demonstrated that the beneficial effect of diversity vanishes only at very high correlations. Capacity with CSI at the receiver for Ricean as well and Nakagami-distributions with independent diversity reception is evaluated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[171]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[118]</ref>. Capacity close to Gaussian was evidenced for moderate degrees of diversity. Here channel-state information available to the receiver is assumed. In fact, in these models the receiver diversity manifests itself essentially in changing the distribution of fading. Tendency to Gaussianity with the increase of diversity is mentioned also in <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[153]</ref> and others. Some additional results are reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, where capacity for Nakagami channels with or without diversity for different power strategies, as optimal power/rate adaptation, constant rate, and constant power, is evaluated. See also <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, where capacity is evaluated for three strategies: optimal power and rate adaptation, optimal rate adaptation, and channel inversion or constrained channel inversion. Maximal-ratio and selection combining techniques are examined, and the capacities are compared to the capacity of AWGN channels under similar conditions. It is concluded that, for moderate diversity, the channel inversion works very well and is almost optimal. As expected, capacity of the AWGN channel is approached with the increase of the number of diversity branches. See also <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">[302]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[72]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[174]</ref>, and many other references provided in the reference list here and reference lists of the cited papers. With no CSI, it has been demonstrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[87]</ref> that for the Rayleigh fast flat-fading channel, the capacityachieving distribution remains discrete in its input norm for receiver space diversity as well.</p><p>While space diversity at the receiver provides considerable gain in performance when the diversity branches are not too highly correlated, space diversity at the transmitter yields a dramatic increase in the reliable achievable rates provided that CSI is available at least to the receiver site, which also employs diversity. The unpublished report <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">[239]</ref> considers the singleuser multi-input multi-output Gaussian channel. Shannon capacity and also the capacity distributions are examined for the double-ray propagation channel model, and the implications of space diversity are explicitly pointed out. Much more recent literature, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b332">[326]</ref> where the capacity distribution for multiple transmit/receive antennas is considered, shows the substantial benefit of this diversity, which in fact may yield information rates that increase linearly with the number of (transmit/receive) antennas. See also <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[92]</ref>, where capacity calculations of systems with transmitter and receiver antennas, with the receiver equipped with full CSI, is evaluated. A nice lower bound is presented, which gives rise to a suboptimal yet efficient signaling scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[91]</ref>. Substantial gains are observed, pointing out to this diversity technique as a crucial part of future communications systems. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[198]</ref>, information-theoretic calculations for the multiple-transmit antenna case, where channel-state information is available to receiver only is undertaken. Suboptimal schemes as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b332">[326]</ref>, where delayed versions of the same transmission are sent through different antennas, and Hiroike's method where phase shift replaces delay, are also considered. Asymptotically (with the number of antennas) with linear antenna processing it is shown that the nonselective fading channel is transformed into a white Gaussian channel with no ISI.</p><p>The case where CSI is provided also to the transmitter is considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>. The optimal power control strategy for a single-user block-fading channel is found in the context of capacity versus outage. The major value of power control is put in evidence when capacity versus outage is considered, and this is much more pronounced when performance is measured in terms of capacity versus outage. The results apply to the multiple transmitting/receiving antennas case, thus facilitating the comparison of the performance of specific coding approaches (as the recently introduced space/time coding technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">[281]</ref>), to the ultimate optimum. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">[226]</ref>, a discrete model for the time-invariant multipath fading, with paths and, respectively, and transmit and receive antennas is considered. The information capacity is studied and forms of spatiotemporal codes are suggested. Contrary to what is claimed there, and as evidenced by our reference list, this is not the first observation of the dramatic improvement due to multiple transmit/receive antennas in a multipath fading channel. That paper demonstrates that for , the capacity increases linearly with the minimum diversity supplied by the multiple transmit/receive antennas as is well known. The coding scheme advocated in the paper should be compared with that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b284">[280]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">[281]</ref>. Elegant rigorous analytical results are provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b287">[283]</ref>, where the multi-input multi-output single-user fading Gaussian channel is investigated with CSI available to the receiver. Equations for the capacity, capacity distribution (i.e., capacity versus outage), and error exponents are provided. The methodology is based on the distribution of the eigenvalues of random matrices. The exact nonasymptotic distribution of the unordered eigenvalue is known <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[82]</ref> and used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b287">[283]</ref> to compute the capacity of a single-user Gaussian channel with transmitters and receivers, where each transmitter reaches each receiver via an independent and identically distributed Rayleigh fading complex Gaussian channel. The capacity assumes the expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b287">[283]</ref> (3.3.58) where is the average transmitted power (all Rayleigh fading coefficients are normalized to unit power), and is the associated Laguerre polynomial. Using the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of <ref type="bibr" target="#b270">[266]</ref> yields, for example, for , the result</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">(3.3.59)</formula><p>which demonstrates the substantial linear (in ) increase in the reliable rate.</p><p>In fact <ref type="bibr" target="#b292">[288]</ref>, the result in (3.3.59) is invariant to the actual fading distribution as long as the i.i.d. rule is maintained, which is a direct outcome of the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b270">[266]</ref>. This makes the conclusions much more stable and interesting as far as practical applications and implications are concerned. The asymptotic result is easily extendible to the case where while is a fixed number, not necessarily unity, as in in the example above <ref type="bibr" target="#b287">[283]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b288">[284]</ref> While the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b287">[283]</ref> apply to the case where perfect CSI is available at the receiver, <ref type="bibr" target="#b292">[288]</ref> examines also the asymptotic case ( very large) where perfect channel state is available to both the transmitter and receiver, and hence the transmitter employs the optimal "water-pouring" strategy to maximize capacity. It is concluded, as expected, that for low signal-to-noise ratio , there is a substantial four-fold increase in capacity, while, for , the advantage in revealing the CSI to the transmitter disappears. Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b292">[288]</ref> reports also some straightforward extensions to the frequency-selective fading channel.</p><p>The most interesting single-user diversity case is that of absolutely unavailable CSI to either transmitter and/or receiver. In this case, the time correlation of the fading coefficients (i.e., coherence time</p><p>) is fundamental, as this dependence, if it exists, provides the mechanism through which one can cope with the fading process more efficiently as compared to the fully i.i.d. (or interleaved) case. The study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[176]</ref> examines this case for the block-fading model, that is, when complex Gaussian fading coefficients are kept fixed for the coherence time and selected independently for each coherence-time block interval. The insightful results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[176]</ref> characterize the capacity-attaining signal, which should take the forms of an isotropically distributed unitary matrix multiplied by an independent real nonnegative diagonal matrix. The striking conclusion of <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[176]</ref> is that there is no advantage in providing a transmit diversity which surpasses the coherence-time limits, that is, (assumed to be an integer) is optimum (though it may not be unique). This important conclusion places inherent limits on the actual benefit from increasing the transmit diversity in certain systems experiencing relatively fast fading. Clearly, if is large, the substantial gain of transmit diversity is attainable, as the ideal assumption of perfectly known CSI (say, at receiver only <ref type="bibr" target="#b287">[283]</ref>) is realistic and can be closely approached in practice. Also, this striking outcome can be understood within the framework of the relation <ref type="bibr">(3.3.27)</ref>, which yields here <ref type="bibr">(3.3.60)</ref> where is the associated random fading parameter and and are the transmitted components and the receiver components vectors, respectively. Increasing under a total average transmit-power constraint yields no advantage, as the subtracting part in the RHS of (3.3.60) outbalances the increase (about linear in for large enough ) in the expansion associated with the capacity of perfect CSI available to the receiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b287">[283]</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[176]</ref> bounds on capacity are also given, by using specific signaling (lower bound) or letting the fading parameters be available to the receiver (upper bound). The capacity of the latter case (channel parameters known to receiver) is approached for increasing</p><p>The results are extended to cases with vanishing autocorrelation. The work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[87]</ref> deals with , and a single-antenna case, but allows for multiple receive antennas. Note that the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[87]</ref> provide indications that the optimal random variables in the diagonal matrix in the capacity-achieving distribution of <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[176]</ref> should take on discrete values, but no proof for this conjecture is yet available.</p><p>We conclude this subsection by emphasizing again that diversity is an instrumental tool in enhancing performance of communication systems in the realm of fading. The gain is substantial with transmit-diversity techniques when the coherence time of the fading process is adequately large as to allow for reasonable levels of transmit diversity.</p><p>7) Error Exponents and Cutoff Rates: While we put emphasis on different notions of capacity for the time-varying fading channel, much literature has been devoted to the investigation of other information-theoretic measures of primary importance; namely, error exponents and cutoff rates. The error exponent is one of the more important information-theoretic measures, as it sets ultimate bounds on the performance of communications systems employing codes of finite memory (say, block or constraint lengths). While only rarely is the exact error exponent known <ref type="bibr" target="#b286">[282]</ref>, classical bounds are available. The standard random coding error exponent serving as a lower bound on the optimal error exponent and the sphere-packing upper bound coincide for rates larger than the critical rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[94]</ref> thus giving the correct exponential behavior for these class of channels. (See <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[94]</ref> for extensions.) The cutoff rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b324">[320]</ref>, determining both an achievable rate and the magnitude of the random-coding error exponent, serves as another interesting information-theoretic notion. Although, contrary to past belief <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[178]</ref>, it is no more considered as an upper bound on practically achievable rates, yet it provides a useful bound to the rates where sequential decoding can be practically used. In any case, it is a most valuable parameter, which may provide insight complementary to that acquired by the investigation of capacity.</p><p>Error exponents for fading channels have been addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[153]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">[227]</ref> for various cases; in <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">[227]</ref> the unknown CSI has been examined. In a recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b286">[282]</ref>, the error exponent for the case of infinite bandwidth but finite power has been evaluated in the no-CSI scenario. This model, where performance is measured per-unit cost (power) as otherwise the system is unrestricted, is one of the few fading-channel models for which the exact capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b308">[304]</ref> and error exponent <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[96]</ref> can be evaluated. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[176]</ref> the random coding error exponent has been studied for the case of multiple transmit and receive antennas and for the block fading channel. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[85]</ref>, the random-coding error exponent for a single-dimensional fading channel is evaluated with ideal CSI available to the receiver, and the corresponding error exponent for Gaussian-distributed inputs is given in the region above the critical rate through capacity. Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[148]</ref> examines the block-fading model in terms of capacity, cutoff rates, and error exponents. It has been established that, though capacity is invariant in terms of the memory in the block-fading model, the error exponent suffers a dramatic decrease, indicating that the effective codelength is reduced by about the coherence blocklength factor. This phenomenon, resembling some previous observations made on the block interference channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">[183]</ref>, indicates the necessity to allow for large delay, that is, to use long block codes, in order to allow reasonable performance. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[148]</ref> it is concluded that with relaxed delay constraints, while the capacity characterizes the horizontal axis of the reliability function (rate), the vertical axis (magnitude) is better described by the cutoff rate in the block-fading model. The error-exponent distribution, giving rise to performance versus outage, has also been investigated, and commensurate behavior of both capacity and cutoff rate, which behave similarly in terms of the outage criterion, was demonstrated. Space-and time-diversity methods are investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[149]</ref>, and shown to be most effective in the case of stringent delay constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[149]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the randomcoding error exponent for the quadrature fading Gaussian channel with perfectly known channel-state information at the receiver, is evaluated. Average-and peak-power constraints are examined, and bounds on the random-coding error exponent are provided. Also investigated are optimal (maximal-ratio combining) diversity schemes. It is demonstrated, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[148]</ref>, that the error exponent, in contrast to capacity, is largely reduced by the fading phenomenon. The case of correlated fading is also examined via a bound on the error exponent, and Monte Carlo simulation. For some additional references see the extensive reference list in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>In another work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[168]</ref>, capacity and error exponents for Rayleigh fading channels with states known at receiver and fed back to transmitter are examined. Variable power and variable rate, controlled by means of varying the bit duration, are considered. The peak-power constraint, as well as feedback delays, are discussed, but the finite feedback capacity problem is solved correctly in <ref type="bibr" target="#b316">[312]</ref>. The optimal power allocation suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[168]</ref>, which is channel inversion, is misleading (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[112]</ref> for the correct solution).</p><p>In the nice contribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[175]</ref>, upper and lower exponential (reliability type) bounds are derived for the block-fading channel with diversity branches. The improved upper bound is found by letting the parameters ( in Gallager's notation <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[94]</ref>) to be channel-state-dependent. The lower bound hinges on the outage probability and the strong converse. Both bounds are shown to be rather close. The optimum diversity factor was found to depend also on the code rate and not only on the number of available parallel independent channels (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[156]</ref> for a similar conclusion). Outages as well as cutoff rates are also considered.</p><p>In a recent contribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> the block-fading channel is considered, where CSI is available to both transmitter and receiver. The random-coding error exponent is investigated, and a practical power-control scheme is suggested. In this case, the channel is inverted just for the strongest fading values, and the result has the flavor of a delay-limited error exponent. A dramatic increase in the error exponent is reported (as expected). Further optimizing the Gallager parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[94]</ref>, making it fading-vector-dependent, improves considerably the tightness, as has been already indicated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[175]</ref> for the binary case.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[151]</ref>, investigation of exponential bounds, as well as capacity and cutoff rates, in the realm of correlated fading with ideal CSI at the receiver is reported. Bounds are given, with and without a piecewise-constant approximation of the channel behavior.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b287">[283]</ref>, the single-user channel with multiple transmit and receive additive Gaussian channels is examined also in terms of error exponents. It is shown that transmitter diversity has a substantial effect on the error exponent as well as on the capacity as discussed previously.</p><p>In the above we have scanned succinctly only very few of the contributions that address error exponents in the realm of random time-varying fading channels. However, this sample, small though it is, indicates the amount of effort invested into enhancing the understanding of performance of practical systems over this class of channels where more insight the mere reliable rate is sought. In fact, the results <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[148]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">[183]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[168]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[175]</ref> for the error exponent reveal the need for considerable effective time diversity in any practical coding system, which dictates long delays for slow-varying fading models, as to achieve reliable communication in the classical Shannon's sense. The importance of CSI at the transmitter in terms of dramatic increase in the error exponent <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> similar to the capacity versus outage performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> also deserves special attention of practical-system designers, and that is opposed to the negligible increase in the ergodic capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[112]</ref> in this setting. Cutoff rate, being a much easier notion to evaluate in the fading-channel realm, has been very thoroughly investigated for several decades. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[78]</ref> for example, and the reference list <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[122]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[149]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[151]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">[182]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">[172]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">[302]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b307">[303]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">[201]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[202]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[77]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[141]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[67]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[193]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[160]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b274">[270]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b278">[274]</ref> which forms just a small unrepresentative sample of the available literature. As already said, cutoff rates were denied in recent years (especially with the advent of turbo codes and iterative decoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[60]</ref>) their status as ultimate bounds on the practically achievable reliable communication. Yet, their importance as indicators of the error exponent behavior is maintained <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[148]</ref>. Since cutoff rates are relatively easy to evaluate in more or less closed forms, as compared to the full random-coding error exponent for example, current results in the literature are of interest, and further research addressing this notion in a variety of interesting settings in the fading time-varying channel is called for.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Multiple Users</head><p>In the previous subsection we have addressed only the single-user case: the main factor giving rise to the whole spectrum of information-theoretic notions, techniques, approaches, and results, was the randomly varying nature of the channel. With multiple-access communication, everything discussed so far extends conceptually, almost as is, to the multipleuser case. In addition, the existence of several users adds an extra significant dimension to the problem, which may modify not only the conclusions, but in some cases even the questions asked. Even for classical memoryless time-invariant channels, the realm of multiple-user communications affects in a most substantial way the methodology and informationtheoretic approach. New notions as the multiple-access, broadcast, interference, relay, and general multiterminal network information theory emerge along with associated rate-regions, which replace the simple capacity notion used in the singleuser case <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref>. The presence of fading in its general form affects in certain cases the problem at hand in a very substantial way which cannot be decoupled from its network (multiple-user) aspects. This is demonstrated (and described in some detail in the following) by the observation that in case of available CSI at receiver and average-power-constrained users, classical orthogonal TDMA can no more achieve the maximum throughput, in contrast to the unfaded case <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>.</p><p>We will further see that the very presence of multiple users gives rise to new models that incorporate inherently the fading time-varying phenomenon into the multiple-user informationtheoretic setting. Clearly, the wealth of the available material prevents any exhaustive, or even close-to-exhaustive, treatment of this topic. Here, to an extent even greater than before in this section, we shall discuss only a few select results, leaving the major part of results, techniques, and methodology to the references and reference lists therein. In essence, we shall follow the same path as in our previous exposition, by emphasizing only the information-theoretic aspects typical of multiple users operating in a fading regime. Though there are a variety of interesting multiple-user information-theoretic models, we shall focus on the multiple-access channel, and, to a lesser extent, on the broadcast channel, mentioning also some relevant features of the interference channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>. We shall put special emphasis on recently introduced cellular communication models, which have gained much attention lately.</p><p>1) The Multiple-Access Finite-State Channel: In parallel to the treatment in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>, providing a general framework which accounts for available/not available/partially available channelstate information (CSI) at transmitters and/or receivers, the preliminary results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[69]</ref> provide the framework and the general structure of the results in the multiple-access fading channel with/without CSI available to receiver/transmitter under the ergodic regime. The framework of <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[69]</ref> encompasses finite-state channels with finite-cardinality input, output, and state spaces, yet the structure of the results provides insight to the expressions derived for standard multiple-user (continuous) fading models with different degrees of CSI available at receivers/transmitters.</p><p>In fact, some of the results can be extended to continuous real-valued alphabets <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[69]</ref> and, in parallel to <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[69]</ref> some special cases are identified where "strategies" (in the terminology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b241">[237]</ref>) are not needed, and signaling over the original input alphabet suffices to achieve capacity. Some of those specific cases, particularized to a simple ergodic flat-fading model, are presented in the following.</p><p>It is appropriate to mention here that the multiple-access channel, even in its simplistic memoryless setting, demonstrates some intricacies: for example, a possible difference between the capacity regions with average-or maximumerror criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[80]</ref>, which are equivalent in the single-user setting. We shall not address further these issues (see <ref type="bibr">[164,</ref> and references therein]) but focus on the simplest cases, and in this respect on the average error probability criterion.</p><p>2) Ergodic Capacities: In parallel to the single-user case, the ergodic capacity region of the multiple-user (network) problem is well defined, and assumes the standard interpretation of Shannon capacity region. We shall scan here several cases with CSI available/nonavailable to receiver and/or transmitter. The issues treated here are special cases of the general model stated in Section II and in Section III-B. We shall mainly focus on the multiple-access channel, and mention briefly the broadcast-and the interference-channel models.</p><p>Multiple-access fading channels: Consider the following channel model <ref type="bibr">(3.4.1)</ref> where stands for the channel input of the th (out-of-) user and designates the fading value at discrete-time instant of user</p><p>The additive-noise sample is designated by , while represents the received signal at discrete-time instant We assume that all processes are complex circularly symmetric (proper). The ergodic assumption here means that we assume to be jointly ergodic in the time index and also independent from user to user (in the index ). We assume that all the input is subjected to equal average-power constraints only, that is, . First we address the case where CSI is available to the receiver only. Here it means that all fading realizations are available to the receiver, whose intention is to decode all users. The achievable rate region is given here by</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">(3.4.2)</formula><p>where is a subset of the set and where designates the received fading power and is the noise variance. The irrelevant time index is suppressed here. The expectation operates over all fading powers The normalized sum rate per user indicates the maximum achievable equal rate per user and it is given by letting be the whole set, yielding <ref type="bibr">(3.4.3)</ref> It is interesting to note that, by a careful use of the central limit theorem, as increases we have <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref> (3.4.4)</p><p>where the RHS is the result for the regular AWGN channel and, by Jensen's inequality, is an upper bound to in <ref type="bibr">(3.4.3)</ref>. We see that the deleterious effect of fading is mitigated by the averaging inter-user effect, which is basically different from time/frequency/space averaging in the single-user case (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b335">[329]</ref>). Equation (3.4.3) already demonstrates the advantage of CDMA channel access techniques over orthogonal TDMA or FDMA. In this simple setting, the orthogonal TDMA or FDMA give rise to a rate per user</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">(3.4.5)</formula><p>With TDMA, a user transmits once per slots with power , while with FDMA a user occupies of the frequency band with equivalent noise of power</p><p>We assume that either each frequency slice or time slot undergoes simple flat fading, hence giving rise to <ref type="bibr">(3.4.5)</ref>. By Jensen's inequality it follows immediately <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b287">[283]</ref> that is a nondecreasing function of for i.i.d. nonnegative random variables thus establishing the advantage of CDMA over TDMA and FDMA under this fading model. For further details, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[97]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[86]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b302">[298]</ref>.</p><p>A natural question that arises here is how orthogonal CDMA compares to the optimum (3.4.3) and to orthogonal TDMA and FDMA (3.4.5). In orthogonal CDMA, all users use orthogonal direct-sequence spreading (say, by Hadamard (Walsh) bipolar sequences). This method, assuming not only ergodic, but i.i.d. fading also in time, gives rise to the expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref> (3. <ref type="bibr">4.6)</ref> where the entries of the matrix is the Schür (elementwise) product of an i.i.d. complex fading matrix and an orthogonal (e.g., Hadamard) matrix. The identity matrix is designated by A surprising result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref> is that it is not necessarily true that for all i.i.d. fading distributions, and an example, for a distribution of fading for which for , is given in [255, Pt. II]. The reason is that the flat, discrete-time fading processes, as modeled here, can never destroy the inherent orthogonality of orthogonal FDMA or orthogonal TDMA, but can do so in the case of orthogonal CDMA. For further details on random CDMA in a flat-fading regime, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b258">[254]</ref>. Another model, where orthogonal CDMA, TDMA, and FDMA are interpreted as different ways of using degrees of freedom in a fading regime, is considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[86]</ref>, where it is shown that, as far as aggregate rates (or equal rates) are concerned, with symmetric resources all the orthogonal methods (CDMA, TDMA, and FDMA) are equivalent. As it will be mentioned, orthogonal CDMA exhibits advantage over orthogonal TDMA and FDMA in terms of capacity versus outage. It is interesting to examine the model yielding <ref type="bibr">(3.4.6)</ref> in terms of capacity versus outage.</p><p>We proceed now to the case where the CSI is available at all transmitter sites. That is, is available at each of the transmitters. Here we have another optimization element, viz. power control. In view of the former result for CSI available at the receiver only, it is rather interesting that the optimal power control as found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[155]</ref> to optimize the throughput, dictates a TDMA-like approach. For equal average power for all users, the user that transmits is the one that enjoys the best fading conditions, and the assigned power depends on that fading value. The instantaneous power assigned to the th user, observing the realization of the fading Clearly, if the best fading falls below the threshold no user transmits at all, where is a constant determined by the average-power constraint as follows:</p><p>(3.4.9)</p><p>The power control in (3.4.7) describes a randomized TDMA where indeed only one user at most transmits at each time slot, but the identity of this user is determined randomly by the realization of the fading process. This strategy does not depend on the fading statistics (as far as joint ergodicity is maintained), but for the constant which depends on the marginal distribution of the fading energy and this optimal strategy is valid also for nonequal average powers, where then the fading values should be properly normalized in (3.4.7) by the respective Lagrange coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[155]</ref>.</p><p>In contrast to the single-user case <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[112]</ref>, where optimal power control resulted in just a marginal increase in the average rate, here, in the multiple-users realm, the optimal power control yields a substantial growth in capacity, increasing with the number of users , with respect to the fixed-transmitted-power case with the optimal CDMA strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[97]</ref> also over the Gaussian classical unfaded maximum sum rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>. The intuition for this result <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[155]</ref> is that if is large, then with high probability at least one of the i.i.d. fading powers will be large, providing thus an excellent channel for the respective user at that time instant. Such a channel is in fact advantageous even over the unfaded Gaussian channel with an average power gain.</p><p>The extension to frequency-selective channels is quite straightforward under the assumption that the Doppler spread is much smaller than the multipath bandwidth spread , decoupling in fact the frequency-selective features and the time variation (assumed to follow an ergodic pattern). The result, as determined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[157]</ref>, is in fact exactly as in the flat-fading case: however, this strategy is employed per frequency slice (whose bandwidth is of the order of the coherence bandwidth). That is, at any time epoch many users may transmit, but at each band is occupied only by a single user, the one that enjoys the best (fading-wise) conditions at that particular band and time. As in the singleuser case, since statistically all frequencies are equivalent, the ergodic capacity remains invariant to whether the channel exhibits flat-or selective-fading features. However, in the selective-fading case the average waiting time for a user to transmit reduces, as now for a wideband system there are many frequency bands (about the total bandwidth divided by the coherence bandwidth) over which transmission may take place. Algorithms to control the waiting time associated with this random TDMA accessing over the flat-fading channel are suggested and analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and discussed in the following. It is shown, contrary to the single-user case, that optimal power control, made possible when ideal CSI is available to all transmitters, yields considerable advantages with respect to the ergodic throughputs for many users, when fixed power is used (optimal for CSI available to receiver only). The optimal power allocation is no more than the extension of the "water filling" idea to this setting, where in the frequency-selective case water filling is done in both time and frequency. See also some results by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref> on this matter, and for the first extension (of water filling) to the multiple-user case over fixed intersymbol-affected Gaussian channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[56]</ref>.</p><p>While <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[155]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[157]</ref> considered the throughput (sum rate), in a remarkable work <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> the polymatroidal structure of the multiaccess Gaussian capacity region was exploited so as to provide an elegant characterization of the capacity region along with the optimal power allocation that achieves the boundary points of this region. The results are derived for the flat and frequency-dispersive cases, under the standard slowtime-variation assumption. A variety of other most interesting and multiple-access models exists <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref>, where one of the most relevant for practical applications is the " -out-of-multipleaccess channel" model. Here out of potential users, at most are simultaneously active, and the achievable reliable rate region, irrespective of the identity of the active users, is of interest. The information-theoretic classification of this channel, in which the set of active users is random (but upperbounded by ), is standard: in fact, it falls under the purview of normal channel networks (we adhere here to the terminology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref>) (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b221">[217]</ref> for some additional results including error exponents). This model has been investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53]</ref>, in combination with CDMA, where <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref> focuses on the fading effect. Parallel to <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[97]</ref>, it is demonstrated that CDMA is inherently advantageous over FDMA in the presence of fading.</p><p>Up to now we have assumed a fixed number of users transmitting to a receiver. In common models for communication (network) systems, a user accesses the channel randomly, as it gets a message to be transmitted <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[95]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[84]</ref>. The random access of users is a fundamental issue which is not yet satisfactorily treated in terms of information-theoretic concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[95]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[84]</ref>. Indeed, the -out-of-model discussed is motivated here in a sense by random-access aspects, but it does not capture the fact that the number of transmitting users might itself be random and not fixed. Rather, it resorts to an upper bound to the number of active users (this is its maximum possible number ), which dictates in a sense of worst case achievable rates. Here we demonstrate originally this situation where it is assumed that -the number of transmitting users-is an integer-valued positive random variable known both to the transmitters and the receiver. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">12</ref> We further resort to the case of CSI for all active users available at the receiver site only. The achievable throughput (where RURCSI stands for Random Users Receiver Channel State Information) is given by <ref type="bibr">(3.4.10)</ref> where we have explicitly designated by the expectation with respect to the number of users. By using [255, Pt. II, Appendix 2, Lemma] we see that <ref type="bibr">(3.4.11)</ref> where stands for the throughput associated with the average <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">13</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>number of users</head><p>In many situations we are interested in the average rate per user. While in the case of a fixed number of transmitting users, the maximum equal rate per user is given by the throughput divided by the number of users, this is no more the case when is random. The maximal equal rate per user is given here by (3.4.12)</p><p>Now using the convexity of , in a similar proof as in [255, Pt. II, Appendix 2, Lemma ], it is verified that <ref type="bibr">(3.4.13)</ref> This demonstrates the rather surprising fact that random accessing helps in terms of average achievable rates per user when compared to average performance. This was also concluded in <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref> for another setting where the random number of faded interfering users (other cell users) was considered. Clearly, it follows by <ref type="bibr">(3.4.11</ref>) and (3.4.13) that <ref type="bibr">(3.4.14)</ref> Here we have demonstrated only a glimpse of the surprising features which are associated with information-theoretic consideration of random accessing in multiple-access channels in general and fading MAC in particular (for more examples see <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>). These interesting observations motivate serious study into this yet immature branch of information theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[95]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[84]</ref>. Another possibility is to consider the average rate per a specific user, where this rate is measured only while that user is active. Under the assumption of all individual users independently accessing or not the channel, the average rate is given by (3.4.12) with replaced by , accounting for the fact that the inspected user is active by definition. There are different variants to the problem, and the expression to be used depends on the interpretation. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for another simplistic model where other users are considered as additional noise.</p><p>The multiple-user case gives rise to different cases in terms of the available CSI. We shall demonstrate this by the following example. The results of (3.4.7)-(3.4.9) describe the situation where full CSI is available to the receiver and to each of the user's transmitters facilitating thus a centralized power control strategy. Another case of interest, briefly studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">[331]</ref>, considers the noncentralized power control. Here, each transmitter has access only to that fading variable that affects its own signal. Thus the power control can be based just on that knowledge. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[127]</ref>, it was demonstrated that for the simple case of fading random variables that take on discrete values from a set of finite cardinality and for asymptotically many users, the optimal strategy tends to the extremal case that transmission takes place only if the fading power assumes its maximum possible value. It was also claimed that under these asymptotic conditions decentralized power control entails no inherent degradation (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[126]</ref>). Randomized decentralized power control strategies are addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b253">[249]</ref>.</p><p>In general, no ideal CSI is available and only partial information is accessible to the decoder/encoder. This case can again be treated in a standard way in the multiple-user setting in parallel to the single-user situation, as has been discussed in the previous section. This falls within the framework treated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[69]</ref>, for example, in case of partial CSI (denoted by ) available at the receiver only. The standard interpretation, where the received signal is interpreted as the tuple , yields the desired results within the standard multiple-access Shannon theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref> under ergodic assumptions.</p><p>The interesting and important case of multiple-access fading channel model, as given in (3.4.1), with no CSI available to either transmitter or receiver, gained relatively little attention, contrary to the single-user case. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[185]</ref> some inequalities of average mutual information were used to assess the effect of not knowing exactly the CSI for the single-and multiple-user case. For the multiple-user case, interference-cancellation techniques are advocated, even where CSI is not precise. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[186]</ref>, the implications of unknown CSI are assessed via bounds. The lower bound is of the type of (3.3.55) with , which associates the unknown part with equivalent additive Gaussian noise. Mismatched metric is often used in practice, where CSI is not precisely known or when the matched metric is too complicated to be efficiently implemented. For results on mismatched metric applied to the multiple-access channel, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[162]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[161]</ref>, and also <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[161]</ref>, the optimal Gaussian-based metric in a fading environment with ideal CSI at the receiver is studied, and the achievability of the Gaussian fading channel capacity region is established for non-Gaussian additive noise under some ergodic assumptions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref> for more details). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, the binary-input multipleaccess channel is considered for a Rayleigh fading and the random phase impairments. The fading or random phase processes are assumed to be i.i.d., and it is shown that in both cases the sum rate (throughput) is bounded and does not increase logarithmically with the number of users (as is the case in the Gaussian multiple access channel). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b286">[282]</ref>, the i.i.d. Rayleigh fading multiple-access channel is considered, and the asymptotic (with the number of users) throughput is determined for the case of unrestricted bandwidth.</p><p>We focus now on the simple model in (3.4.1) with all fading CSI i.i.d. in both and the discrete-time index As usual, we consider the average-power constraint and are interested here in the sum-rate (throughput), which is equivalent to times the maximal equal rate per user. A rather surprising result is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b263">[259]</ref>, based on reinterpreting the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[176]</ref> where the number of transmit antennas is taken to be -the number of users. This result demonstrates the optimality of the TDMA channel accessing technique here, where each user transmits of the time in its assigned time slot and when transmitting the average power used is</p><p>The throughput is then given by the solution of <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[87]</ref> where the per-user SNR is , and where the optimal capacity-achieving input distribution is discrete. It is instructive to learn that, while for available CSI at the receiver the CDMA channel accessing technique is advantageous in a fading environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[97]</ref>, TDMA prevails in the case of no CSI. If CSI is available both to transmitters and receiver (in a centralized manner), again a TDMA-like (i.e., randomized TDMA) becomes optimal <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[155]</ref>, where the randomization is governed by the rule allowing only the one enjoying the most favorable fading conditions to transmit.</p><p>For ideal CSI available to the receiver and/or transmitters, the memory structure of the fading process is irrelevant for capacity calculations, which depend only on the singledimensional marginal statistics. This is not the case when CSI is absent: here, the results depend strongly on the fading memory. The block-fading channel model, as introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[210]</ref>, is readily extended to the multiple-user case by assuming that the fading coefficients stay unvaried for blocks of length and are independent for different blocks. In this case, the mixed CDMA/TDMA strategy where at each time epoch users are active simultaneously, is studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b263">[259]</ref>, where for the CDMA technique takes over, and all users transmit simultaneously.</p><p>3) Notion of Capacities and Related Properties: In parallel to the single-user case, the ergodic capacity or capacity region of the multiple-access channel, though important, comprises just a small part of the relevant information-theoretic treatment of meaningful expressions which indicate on the information transfer capabilities of the information network operating under fading conditions. We will first concisely extend the view of the single-user case to the multiple-access case, accounting specifically for capacity versus outage, delaylimited capacity, and a compound/broadcast approach. Then, the very nature of the multiterminal/multiple-user realm is shown to give rise to very relevant information-theoretic models, to be addressed briefly. Some of the examples to be considered are the broadcast and the interference channels, operating under fading conditions. Due to space and scope limitations, the presentation here will be very short and restricted to very few (mainly recent) works.</p><p>Capacity versus outage: The notion of capacity versus outage is easily extended to the multiple-access case. Some of the early references treating this problem are <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49]</ref>, the outage probability for each user in the symmetric -user setting is associated with the required average power for operation at a given rate. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref>, the corresponding outage probability of the optimized signature waveform is discussed, which turns out to be overlapping in frequency in the fading two-user case. Capacity versus outage for orthogonal accessing techniques (CDMA, TDMA, and FDMA) is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[86]</ref>, where the advantage of TDMA is demonstrated.</p><p>The multiple-access compound-channel model treated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[124]</ref> is fundamental in the interpretation of the capacityversus-outage region as it is intimately connected with the -capacity region discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[124]</ref>. In parallel to the singleuser case for invariant fading , we associate with a rate vector (whose dimension is equal to the number of users ) a set A vector parameter , standing for all relevant fading realizations, belongs to provided that gives rise to using the standard multiple-access capacity-region equation. The associated outage probability for this vector is designated by . For no channel dynamics , the capacityachieving distribution with CSI nonavailable to the transmitter is Gaussian, and remains the same for all fading realizations. Otherwise, in more general models of fading, or when partial CSI is available to the transmitter, should be interpreted as the largest set, with a meaning similar to that of the singleuser case discussed before. If ideal CSI is available to the transmitter, the associated compound channel capacity is the capacity with the worst case fading realization in the class , as then the transmitter may adapt its input statistics to achieve the actual capacity per fading state realization. Further work on this notion in the realm of multiple-access fading channels is called for, so as to encompass cases of frequency selectivity and allowing for time variation of the fading parameters, yet not satisfying the ergodic assumptions. Studies paralleling <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>, which treats the single-user case, are also needed as to assess theoretically the value, expected to be significant, of CSI at transmitter, given in terms of capacity region versus outage, in the multiple-user setting.</p><p>The capacity versus outage of the Knopp-Humblet <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[155]</ref> optimized accessing algorithm in the flat-fading MAC is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, where it is assessed in terms of the distribution of the reliable transmitted rate in a window of -time slots (say). A study of the capacity-versus-outage approach in the interesting -out-of-multiple-access channel model is conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref>. It is demonstrated that the advantage of CDMA over FDMA in the symmetric two-user case is greater in terms of capacity versus outage than in terms of ergodic capacity. See also <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[86]</ref> for the capacity-outage performance of various orthogonal accessing methods in the fading regime.</p><p>Delay-limited capacity and related notions: The notion of delay-limited capacity is thoroughly investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[127]</ref>, where a full solution is given for the case of CSI available to both receiver as well as transmitters. In parallel to the singleuser case, the delay-limited capacity region is achievable irrespective of the dynamics of the fading. The polymatroid structure of the underlying problem is exploited to show that the optimal decoding is, in fact, successive interference cancellation <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b319">[315]</ref>. The optimal power allocation is such that it facilitates successive decoding with the proper ordering, which has explicitly been found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[128]</ref>. In a simple symmetrical case, where all users are subjected to the same average-power constraints and where we are interested in the delay-limited throughput (that is, equal rate per user), the result for the complex fading channel (3.4.1) takes on a simple form <ref type="bibr">(3.4.15)</ref> where stands for the probability distribution function of the fading power assumed to be independent for all users. The optimal power allocation is geometric <ref type="bibr" target="#b319">[315]</ref> (3.4.16)</p><p>where we assume proper ordering of the user according to the fading power such that</p><p>The study <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[127]</ref> introduces also a notion of a statistically based delay-limited multiple-user capacity. This notion requires no power control at the transmitters, and the achievable rate region is guaranteed via the statistical multiplexing of many independent users, which are affected by independent fading processes. For any desirable performance threshold as the average error probability, there exists a code of sufficient length and a sufficiently large number of users, such that the average probability of a decoding error does not exceed the prescribed threshold (small though it may be), provided the rates belong to the statistical delay-limited capacity region. That limiting region is, in fact, independent of the realization of the fading process. Clearly, this notion inherently relies upon the existance of multiple users and has no single-user counterpart. A problem related to the delaylimited multiple-access capacity is the "call admission" and "minimum resource (power) distribution" problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[128]</ref>. In the latter context under given average power constraints and a desired bit rate vector (which should be admissible-in the call admission problem-that is, it should belong to the associated delay-limited capacity region), the minimum possible power that achieves is sought. The criteria to determine the minimum power is minmax, where the max is taken over the users and the min over respective powers. The algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[128]</ref> for the optimal resource allocating solves simultaneously also the call admission problem. Related results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[197]</ref> address another criterion, the minimum transmit energy for a given rate vector and given realizations of the fading (referred to in <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[197]</ref> as channel attenuations). It is shown similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[128]</ref> that the best energy assignments give rise to successive decoding. This conclusion does not extend to receiver diversity.</p><p>While the ergodic capacity of the sample flat-fading MAC model with fading CSI available to both transmitters and receiver gives rise to the optimized centralized power controlled random TDMA approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[155]</ref>, the random nature arises since only the user that enjoys the best fading conditions transmits, provided that the fading value is above a threshold. Yet, on the average, each of the -users occupies exactly of the time slots, as in TDMA. Contrary to standard TDMA transmission is done in a random fashion, thus causing inherent increased delays: in fact, a certain user may wait a long time before he enjoys the most favorable fading conditions, and hence transmits. In the frequency-selective case <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[157]</ref>, having more opportunities to transmit, this undesired prolonging of delay is mitigated to some extent. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, modified access algorithms were suggested to alleviate the increased delay associated with the optimized accessing <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[155]</ref>. The first version <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> defines a delay parameter of slots, where it is demanded that all users should transmit within a window of slots. If this is satisfied at a certain epoch, the transmitting user will be the one enjoying the best fading conditions as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[155]</ref>, and if it is not satisfied, the transmitting user will be the one satisfying the maximum -slot delay constraint independently of its fading realization..</p><p>Another version of a delay-reducing algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> examines a standard -slot TDMA: in each time slot it is checked whether the user assigned to that slot has transmitted in a moving past -slots delay window. If the answer is positive, then the user that enjoys the best fading condition, irrespective of its index as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[155]</ref>, transmits. Otherwise, only the user with the same index as the current time slot (as in regular TDMA) is allowed to transmit. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> these variants of a delay-reducing algorithm are analyzed in terms of average rate versus the delay constraint , relying on Markov and innovation properties of the channel-access algorithm. Power control is also incorporated and compared to the results of fixed transmitted power. The capacity versus outage of the proposed delayreducing algorithms is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and compared to these features in the optimized (without any delay constraints) algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[155]</ref>. As in the single-user case, the delay-limited capacity is associated with the multiple-access compound capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[124]</ref>, where the channel's statistical characterization is uniquely defined by the fading parameters, constituting here the parameter space of the compound channel.</p><p>The broadcast approach: While fading broadcast models are treated separately, the extensions of the expected capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[61]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">[247]</ref> to the multiple-user case is of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">[247]</ref>. The basic model is a combined multiple-access and broadcast channel where several users convey simultaneously information at different rates to receivers. The general vector capacity region of the multiple-access/broadcast channel has not yet been fully characterized. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">[247]</ref>, a convenient suboptimal approach is taken, extending the single-user strategy. That is, each user transmits simultaneously a continuum of different information rates. The receiver is parametrized by a vector of fading uses, where each affects independently the associated transmitted signal. The realization of this fading vector determines the instantaneous rate region (for the users) that the receiver can reliably decode using the successive interference-cancellation technique. The power distribution of the transmitters having no access to the fadingcoefficients realization can be optimized to maximize the expected capacity per user (all users are assumed symmetric), in a fashion similar to the single-user case <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">[247]</ref>. In this model, as in the single-user case, no CSI is available to the transmitter, and the result holds for both given and unavailable CSI at the receiver when the fading parameters stay constant over the whole transmission. As commented before for the single-user case, this approach addresses the expected capacity region which combines broadcast and compound channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[61]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">[247]</ref> when a prior on the compound-channel parameter set is available.</p><p>4) Other Information-Theoretic Models: The Compound, Composite, and Arbitrarily Varying Channel Models: In parallel to the single-user case, the compound and the composite MAC are useful notions and as such the rather rich material treating these models <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref> is of direct relevance. The composite MAC gives rise to rigorous treatment of capacity region distributions (in the sense of broadcast approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">[247]</ref>) and clearly coding theorems, in such a setting, are of interest. The results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[124]</ref> based on information spectrum provide a very appealing approach for deriving coding theorems in this kind of problems, the MAC being the natural extension of the single-user formalism.</p><p>In the multiple-access case, arbitrarily varying channels (AVC's) play an even greater role than their single-user counterpart, as here the existence of additional users induces new interesting dimensions. Also here, as in the single-user case, we advocate the introduction of state constraints in addition to the input-average-power (or other) constraints. This extension, formulated in a straightforward way similarly to the single-user case, is especially interesting in the multiple-user case. Not only may it give a better, i.e., less pessimistic, model for practical applications, but, as argued for the single-user case, this model also introduces the notion of AVC capacity region versus outage, where now the outage probability is associated with the probability that the state sequence (fading realizations in our setting) does not satisfy the assigned constraints. This example also demonstrates an interesting new features of this informationtheoretic problem, as for example, the state-constrained AVC capacity region is nonconvex in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[117]</ref>. The possibly different results for deterministic versus random codes as well as average and maximum error probability criteria (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref> for details) implies here operational practical insight of preferable signaling/coding approaches depending on the different service-quality measures and planning. As detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref>, there are many yet unresolved problems in the context of multiple-user AVC, even in the time-invariant unfaded regime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5) Signaling Strategies and Channel-Accessing Protocols:</head><p>As mentioned before, the network (multiple-user) informationtheoretic approach to the fading channel inherently provides new facets to the problem as it highlights various options of channel accessing. This is not unique to the fading channel: in fact, many of the most interesting relatively recent techniques were developed for the classical multiple-access AWGN channel. In this subsection we shall briefly describe some of the interesting accessing techniques which have been attracting interest for the fading environment.</p><p>CDMA, TDMA, and FDMA: The classical techniques of CDMA, TDMA, and FDMA are commonplace in a multipleaccess channel model without or with fading. While for nonfaded channels orthogonal channel accessing, which guarantees no interuser interference, meets the throughput capacity limit, under average-power constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>, as we have seen in the previous section, this is no more so when fading is present. It was demonstrated, for example, that CDMA is advantageous <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[97]</ref> for known CSI at the receiver, while TDMA is preferred when no CSI is available <ref type="bibr" target="#b263">[259]</ref>. Under the standard terminology, by CDMA we mean full coding, that is, all redundancy being used by coding. Other schemes, where direct-sequence spreading is combined with coding, that is, when the available redundancy is split between spreading and coding, are of primary theoretical and practical interest. Extensive study of this issue has been undertaken, as evidenced in the small sample of references <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">[234]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">[179]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">[180]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b239">[235]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b320">[316]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b309">[305]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b310">[306]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[134]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b322">[318]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">[181]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b305">[301]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b311">[307]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[104]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b303">[299]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b312">[308]</ref>, and references therein. Characterization of the properties of these schemes, which still maintain optimality in terms of throughput on the AWGN channel, was addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">[234]</ref>. It was shown that under symmetric power allocation spreading with processing gain no larger than -the number of users and sequences satisfying the Welch bound-preserves optimality. For the case where the processing gain is exactly or larger, orthogonal spreading sequences maintain optimality. For general results with asymmetric power constraints, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b555">[547]</ref>.</p><p>The question now is, what happens in a fading regime? In <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref> it is shown, for example, that when fading is present orthogonal DS-CDMA is not always (for any i.i.d. fading distribution) advantageous over TDMA, a somewhat counterintuitive result. In another model <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[86]</ref>, where degrees of freedom are distributed in different fashions for orthogonal TDMA, FDMA, and CDMA, all three orthogonal accessing techniques remain equivalent under the fading regime. Many misconceptions appear in reference to fading, one of which is the conclusion that fading can be absolutely mitigated by adequately complex coding systems (see, for example. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>). Fading can be mitigated only under special conditions, for example, in wideband systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[153]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[94]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">[179]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b239">[235]</ref>, a pragmatic approach is suggested for coding for the multiple-access channel. The users employ in a sense a concatenated coding scheme where the outer code is in fact a modulation or "partial modulation" in the terminology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">[180]</ref> and its function is to separate at the decoder the users into groups. In in each group, detection is made on the basis of a "single-user" approach. The classical example for this setting is direct-sequence spread spectrum (DS-SS) where the spreading acts as an inner "partial modulator," and the despreading as the corresponding decoder (pre-processor). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">[179]</ref>, it is argued that the partial modulator/demodulator central function is to create a good single-user channel for the coding system. Separating the burden of decoding the users between the demodulator, which demodulates (decodes) the inner modulation code which is to account for the presence of multiple users, and the standard decoder for the code, is the issue of <ref type="bibr" target="#b239">[235]</ref>, where the linear minimum mean-squareerror demodulator is advocated (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b258">[254]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref>, and references therein). Multiuser information-theoretic aspects of DS-SS coded systems has been thoroughly examined <ref type="bibr" target="#b258">[254]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b312">[308]</ref>). Many studies examine exactly the approach, advocated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">[179]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[134]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b239">[235]</ref>, where the simple multiuser decoding is used and a "single-user" channel is created for the desired user. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b258">[254]</ref>, for example, the matched filter, decorrelator, and minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) linear demodulators are considered, and the performance in terms of throughput or bandwidth efficiency is compared with the optimal detector. Random signature sequences modeling the practically appealing cases of long-signature sequences spreading many coded symbols are stressed. Other nonlinear front-end detectors, as decision-feedback decorrelator and MMSE processors, were also addressed (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">[196]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[254, references]</ref>) and shown to be very efficient. The literature on the information-theoretic aspects of this issue is so vast that the references here, along with the reference lists therein, provide hardly more than a glimpse on this issue (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b312">[308]</ref> and references therein for more details).</p><p>Much less work has been done on the fading regime. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b258">[254]</ref>, two fading models were addressed: the homogeneous model affects each chip independently, while the slow-fading model operates on the coded symbols, where that fading process is either correlative or i.i.d. (in case of ideal interleaving, for example). The results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b258">[254]</ref> demonstrate the inherent asymptotic robustness of the random spreading coded system to any homogeneous fading, and this approach guarantees asymptotically full mitigation of the homogeneous fading effect. It is also pointed out that the difference between optimal spreading and random spreading measured by the information-theoretic predicted bandwidth efficiency diminishes even more in the homogeneous fading regime. There are many misconceptions relating to the information-theoretic aspects of coded DS-SS, random versus deterministic CDMA, the role of multiuser detection in this setting, and the like. Some of these misconceptions are dispelled in <ref type="bibr" target="#b311">[307]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b258">[254]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b312">[308]</ref>, and references therein).</p><p>The struggle to achieve the full promise of information theory in the network multiple-user systems by adhering to the more familiar single-user techniques gave rise not only to the previously discussed combined coded DS-SS with essentially single-user decoder proceeded by simple multiple-user demodulators, but also led to a variety of novel interesting and stimulating channel-accessing techniques. These techniques, a small part of which will be shortly scanned in what follows, are not necessarily connected to fading channels. They do, however, operate in an optimal or at least a rather efficient fashion also in the presence of fading.</p><p>The single-user approach: The strong practical appeal of the single-user approach and the relatively large experience with capacity-approaching coding and modulation methods in an AWGN and fading environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[90]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[60]</ref> motivate vigorous search for efficient single-user coding techniques which do not compromise optimality in the multiple-access regime.</p><p>One of the first observations, which extends directly to the fading channel, is the successive-cancellation idea of <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b339">[333]</ref>. This idea is based on the observation that the corner points (vertices) of the capacity region (a pentagon) are achieved by a single-user system and successive cancellation of the already reliable decoded data streams. The convex combination of the corner points can be achieved by timesharing points in the capacity region, We shall present this well-known simple procedure for the two-user flat-fading ergodic model with channel-state information available at the receiver. This special case of (3.4.1) reads here as <ref type="bibr">(3.4</ref> Time sharing requires mutual time-frame synchronization, which imposes undesirable restrictions on the system which are often physically impossible to meet, as in the case of the spatially spread communication system. The elegant rate-splitting idea of <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">[232]</ref> demonstrates that any point on the asynchronous capacity region (that is, the rate region, excluding the convex-hull operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>) without the need of time sharing and hence not requiring synchronism among users. The idea of <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">[232]</ref> works as is for the fading channel with ideal CSI available to the receiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b234">[230]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">[231]</ref>. This is demonstrated in the following for the simple case of the two-user fading-channel model given in (3.4.17), with known CSI at the receiver. The first user splits into two virtual users with corresponding power and , operating at rates and correspondingly. The second user operates regularly (no rate splitting) with power at rate The successive cancellation mechanism first decodes the rate of user 1, then of user 2 following perfect cancellation of the interference of power Finally, rate of user 1 gets decoded after an ideal cancellation of the interference of power and corresponding to the rate streams and of users one and two, respectively. The corresponding equations specify the rates <ref type="bibr">(3.4.21)</ref> The combined rate of user one is and the rate of user two is It is easily verified, by picking , that the whole region as in <ref type="bibr">(3.4.20</ref>) can be achieved. This is done with no interuser synchronism, which is an important feature in practical multiple-access channels. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">[232]</ref> it is shown that in the -user case all but one user have to split into virtual double users, thus transforming the problem to a -user multiple-access channel, for which any rate in the region of the original -user problem (3.4.21) is a vertex point in the capacity region, giving rise to successive cancellation. This important idea extends directly to dispersive channels with frequency-selective fading with perfect CSI at the receiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b234">[230]</ref>. In fact, this idea motivates different power-control strategies in a multicell scenario <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">[231]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b327">[323]</ref> as will be discussed in reference to cellular communications models. The rate-splitting idea is extended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[115]</ref> to the general discrete memoryless channel, where in this case the two virtual users are combined via some general function to yield the channel input signal of each actual user. This idea impacts also the Gaussian channel with or without fading, and in fact gives rise to an interesting general intrauser time-sharing technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[116]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">[229]</ref> achieving again the asynchronous capacity region with no need for any interuser time synchronization. This interesting idea of <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[116]</ref> is demonstrated for our simple two-user AWGN fading channel. Again, the first user is split into two data streams which now access the channel by time sharing, and not in full synchronism as in the standard successive cancellation procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>. The corresponding rates are <ref type="bibr">(3.4.22)</ref> which access the channel via time sharing at rates of and , respectively. The coded symbols corresponding to and are ideally interleaved according to their respective activity rate fractions and , respectively. The second user signals at the rate The decoding is accomplished by first decoding the rate of user one during of the time where user two with its power acts as an interferer. Then user two is decoded and that is possible by noticing that this user operates at two noise levels (interpreted as channel states). A fraction of is the only noise of the AWGN of power (since the interference of power which corresponds to is absolutely canceled) and a fraction of at noise level (as then user two is the first one to be decoded experiencing the full interference of user one operating at rate</p><p>). No synchronism between users is needed, as user two operates in a two-state noise channel where its states are available to the receiver only, and the ergodic conditions are in principle satisfied by the ideal interleaving employed for user one. Finally, the rate of user one is decoded, where the interference of the already reliably decoded user two is ideally canceled. This elegant idea facilitates achieving the full capacity region in <ref type="bibr">(3.4.20)</ref>, by changing the timesharing parameter in the interval , and that without any common interuser time sharing. This contrasts with the original Cover-Wyner successive cancellation (see <ref type="bibr">(3.4.18)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">(3.4.19)</ref>), which requires interuser frame synchronization to achieve the full capacity region <ref type="bibr">(3.4.20)</ref>. This appealing method, which in fact can be viewed as a special case of the general function needed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[115]</ref>, is extended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">[229]</ref> to the -user case, allowing for a generalized time-sharing modeled by a random switch, the position of which is revealed to the receiver. It is shown that also in the general case each of the users should be split to no more than two virtual time-shared users, while one of the users does not have to be split at all. The framework of <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">[229]</ref> is straightforwardly applicable to the fading MAC. Another generalization, where only single-user codes suffice to achieve any point of the AWGN -user capacity region is reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b340">[334]</ref>. This is in contrast with the codes needed in the direct Wyner-Cover approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b339">[333]</ref>, and the idea extends straightforwardly to the fading channel with CSI available at the receiver.</p><p>Successive cancellation plays a major role in network information theory from both theoretical and practical viewpoints. So far we have addressed some works <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b319">[315]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[116]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">[229]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b301">[297]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[197]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">[232]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b234">[230]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">[231]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[115]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b339">[333]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b340">[334]</ref> which demonstrate the theoretical optimality of this method in a rather general multiple-access framework, which also accounts for flat as well as dispersive fading channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b234">[230]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">[231]</ref>. The practical appeal of these methods stems from their "single-user"-based rationale, and they provide an alternative to classical orthogonal channel-access techniques such as TDMA, FDMA, and orthogonal CDMA. As discussed before, in a fading environment the orthogonal accessing technique may exhibit performance inferior to fully wideband nonorthogonal (general CDMA) accessing techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[97]</ref>.</p><p>Successive cancellation plays a fundamental role in many other information-theoretic models, as in the -out-ofmodel introduced previously. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53]</ref> discusses how the -out-of-capacity region can be achieved by successive cancellation (stripping) using shells of rates. Each of the possible users is divided into data streams, transmitted in different shells, where each shell is detected with a single-user detector, while successive interference cancellation is used for intershell interference reduction. While optimality is achieved for , performance close to optimal was demonstrated for finite This channel-accessing procedure is designed for cases where no interuser synchronization is present and no user ranking can be implemented. This precludes standard successive cancellation methods, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">[232]</ref>, or time-sharing alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[116]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">[229]</ref>. These methods can be straightforwardly used in a fading regime, although this was not directly addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[127]</ref>, it has been shown that the optimal power control which achieves the delay-limited capacity region (with CSI available to transmitter and receiver) implies a successive interference cancellation configuration, which is a consequence of the underlying polymatroidal structure of the delay-limited capacity region. Successive cancellation is relevant to minimal-power regions which corresponds to given rates. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[128]</ref> such a power region is examined, where the rates are based on the delay-limited capacity notion, which are maintained at any fading realization, under a given average power constraint. It is shown that the optimal power strategy with a minmax power allocation criterion manifests itself so that the rates are amenable to successive decoding. A similar result is reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[197]</ref>, where the minimum transmit energy for a given rate vector with different and constant attenuation is considered. While for a single receiver the best energy assignment gives rise to successive decoding, this is no longer true in case of receiving diversity. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b288">[284]</ref>, successive cancellation is considered as a practical useful approach to attain the optimal performance as predicted by information theory in the case of spatial diversity. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">[195]</ref>, CDMA versus orthogonal channel accessing is examined in a slowfading environment. Successive cancellation is considered for asymptotically many users. The transmitted powers are selected so as to yield the right distribution for successive cancellation of received power accounting for the statistics of the fading gain factors. Successive cancellation interpreted in terms of decision feedback in case of a vector correlated multiple channel is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b301">[297]</ref>, where standard known procedures of linear estimation are used to evaluate the sum rate constraining average mutual information expressions. Though <ref type="bibr" target="#b301">[297]</ref> evaluates the results for Gaussian additive noise only, the results extend directly to the fading regime with CSI available to the receiver only or to both transmitter and receiver. Successive cancellation with reference to cellular models is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">[231]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b327">[323]</ref> to be referred to in the following. Some practical implication of successive interference cancellation as the effect of imperfect cancellation and residual noise is addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[98]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b310">[306]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[185]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[188]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b319">[315]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[54]</ref>. The effect of successive cancellation on other information-theoretic measures, such as the cutoff rate is discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[68]</ref>, where this measure does not seem to be a natural information-theoretic criterion to consider in combination with successive cancellation. Successive cancellation is an integral part of the information-theoretic reasoning associated with a broadcast-channel model <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>. This remains valid also for faded broadcast channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[106]</ref>, as well as in certain interference channels to be addressed in the following.</p><p>We have here succinctly scanned a minute fraction of the available material about the information-theoretical as well as practical implications of successive cancellation on network communication systems. Generalizations to cases of frequency-selective channels and nonideal cancellation can be found in the cited references and references therein.</p><p>In parallel to the single-user case, also in the multipleuser network environment information theory provides strong clues to the preferred signaling/accessing techniques. We have already discussed much of the material related to channelaccessing methods. As for information-theoretic-inspired signaling, much of the material referred to in the single-user section extends to the multiple-user case, and that refers to multicarrier modulation, interleaving, Gaussian-like interference, spectrally efficient modulation, and the like. In fact, the singleuser approaches, which are associated with either orthogonal techniques of coded DS-SS or successive cancellation, pave the way to adopt the results discussed so far in reference to the single-user case. This is the reason why here we shall restrict ourselves to mentioning only those results which do not follow directly from single-user information-theoretic results. Clearly, the multiple-user case dictates some profound dissimilarities and new features stemming directly from the existence of several noncooperative users giving another dimension to the information-theoretic problem. This feature is demonstrated, for example, when classical orthogonal methods (e.g. OFDM, orthogonal CDMA) are used. This signaling can either be associated with a single user, or with different users. This view is even more pronounced for the rate-splitting technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b319">[315]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">[232]</ref>, where a given user disguises into multiple users. The aggregate rate is invariant, whether groups of multiple users are in fact interpreted as a single user, or indeed they model absolutely different users. Stripping techniques in the -out-ofmodel, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53]</ref>, where a user information to be transmitted is split among -shells, thus mimicking users with power disparities, also demonstrates this argument. Another example is the implication of interleaving, which more or less follows the discussion of the single-user case, yet with multiple users, interleaving may prove essential to achieve optimal performance with a given multiple-access strategy. This is demonstrated in the generalized per-user time sharing, which demands no interuser synchronization <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[116]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">[229]</ref>, where interleaving (or interlacing) is essential to attain the optimum. Another example, where there is interplay between standard DFE procedures and the multiple-user regime, is the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b301">[297]</ref>, where again it suits the standard vector single-user Gaussian channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b300">[296]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[131]</ref> with i.i.d. inputs of the multipleuser regime <ref type="bibr" target="#b301">[297]</ref>. In all those examples, which were originally developed for Gaussian nonfading channels, the fading effect can be straightforwardly introduced and accounted for.</p><p>Unavailable channel-state information: In parallel to the single-user case, the model where CSI is unavailable is of great practical interest. Indeed, we have demonstrated the surprising result that for fast-varying (changing from symbol to symbol) fading, TDMA is optimal <ref type="bibr" target="#b263">[259]</ref>. In practical models, the variability of the fading is much slower and the assumption is, usually, well approximated. Estimates of the degradation are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[185]</ref> via standard information-theoretic inequalities. Also in the multiple-user case some appealing practical approaches are based on first estimating the CSI either by using training sequences or in a blind procedure. Then these estimates are used for the CSI parameters. Universal as well as fixed-decoding-metric receivers are of interest. For the multiple-access case, the literature on these issues is scarce (see <ref type="bibr">[164, and references within]</ref>). Interesting results for the multiple-user achievable rate region with a given decoding metric are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[162]</ref>. In fact, as to demonstrate the richness of the multiple-access channel model, the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[162]</ref> extend in some cases the lower bounds on the mismatched-metric achievable rates of the single-user case, by treating it as a multiple-access channel. The techniques are directly applicable to operation in a fading environment. This is demonstrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[161]</ref>, where the multiple-access fading channel with CSI available to the receiver is considered. It is shown that the fading AWGN, MAC capacity region is in fact achieved with a random Gaussian codebook, for a general class of additive ergodic and independent noises. Indeed, this nice result finds application in the realm of multicell communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>, where other cell users are modeled as not necessarily Gaussian independent noises.</p><p>Extending the results of the single-user case discussed previously, the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[186]</ref> are evaluated also for the multiuser case while maintaining their basic flavor. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[165]</ref>, the multiple-access fading model of (3.4.1) is investigated: Gaussian codebooks are used and the receiver substitutes estimates of the CSI for the actual unavailable , where it is assumed that for all and an integer Under full joint ergodicity assumptions of and it is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[165]</ref> that the standard Gaussian fading-channel capacity region upper-bounds the achievable mismatched capacity region. Here, are interpreted as the fading parameters, and the equivalent additive noise is, as in <ref type="bibr">(3.3.55)</ref>, This bound is tight in the case of perfect phase estimation, which is equivalent to the assumption that are nonnegative. The case where is considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[186]</ref>, which shows that the above discussed Gaussian fading capacity region lower-bounds the achievable rate region with optimal decoding. This is problematic, as the receiver has usually no idea about the joint statistics of needed to construct the optimal decoding metric. This result is inherently implied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[165]</ref> examining specific, clearly suboptimal, Euclidean-distance (nearest neighbor) based detectors. The results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[165]</ref> are applicable also to various models of CDMA, when successive cancellation is advocated using estimated fading CSI (assumed to be independent of channel observations, or under some further restrictive assumptions causally dependent on those observations) see <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[98]</ref>.</p><p>Many more relevant results not explicitly elaborated on here can be found in our reference list and in the references therein. <ref type="bibr">(3.4.29)</ref> Diversity: Diversity plays a key role in the multiple-user case, as it does for the single-user scenario. While receiver diversity is straightforwardly accounted for within the standard multiple-access information-theoretic framework (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[129]</ref>, and references therein), recent interest was directed to the combined transmit/receive diversity in the presence of fading.

Note, however, that taking , as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[106]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[108]</ref>, is a suboptimal selection. In fact, the optimality of time division for the broadband broadcast channel stems directly by <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[163]</ref>. The rate region of the broadcast channel with CSI available to the receiver only is more intricate, as the whole setting does not, in general, form a degraded broadcast channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>. This problem is under current research; interesting results on inner and outer regions have already been derived.</p><p>The parallel broadcast channels first addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">[218]</ref> can be used to model the presence of memory (intersymbol interference); optimal power allocation, under average power constraint is addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b293">[289]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[110]</ref>. For classical result on the capacity of spectrally shaped broadcast channels see <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">[192]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[100]</ref>, and references therein. The broadcast channel is used to model downlinks in cellular communication (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[108]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[158]</ref>), and this will further be addressed in the following.</p><p>The fading-interference channel: The interference channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">[191]</ref> is a very important model which accounts for the case where the transmitted signals of users in a network interfere before being decoded at their respective destinations. Each decoder here is interested just in its respective user (or, in general, a group of users), while the other users, the codebooks of whom are available to all decoders, act as interferers. We examine here a flat-fading case of a simple symmetric version of the single-dimensional two-user interference channel with fading. Let the two received signals be respectively given by <ref type="bibr">(3.4.31)</ref> where denote nonnegative i.i.d. fading processes, and is the interference coefficient. The additive Gaussian noise samples are modeled by and having a given variance User transmitting its own independent message via the codeword , is to be decoded separately by observing only. The capacity region for the interference channel is unknown in general even when no fading is present, that is, (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">[191]</ref> for a tutorial review). The case of strong interference is solved in the unfaded case <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">[240]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[59]</ref>, and the rationale behind the solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">[240]</ref> extends directly to the case where relevant CSI is available to the receiver only.</p><p>Here receiver one, who processes , is aware of while the fading signals and are provided to the second receiver, who operates on the received samples Here for , the solution follows the same arguments as in the nonfaded case <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">[240]</ref>, that is: If user one (two) can be reliably decoded by receiver one (two), then it can also be reliably decoded by receiver two (one), which enjoys more favorable conditions as far as user one (two) is concerned. In terms of average mutual information relations for , we have, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">[240]</ref> and</p><p>The corresponding rate region is then given by <ref type="bibr">(3.4.32)</ref> where and are, respectively, the average powers of users one and two.

Note that, for CSI available to the receiver only, receivers one and two need only the realizations of the fading variables affecting them. If CSI is available to the transmitters as well, each transmitter may benefit from the knowledge of both fading coefficients: in fact, in this way, the two transmitters which know the fading coefficients can, in a sense, coordinate their powers. Both receivers have now also access to the fading power realization and hence are synchronized with the transmit-power variations. This procedure describes a centralized power control, while in the decentralized power control transmitters and receivers associated with a given user acquire access only to the fading power realization that affects the respective user.</p><p>In the following these interesting broadcast and interference channels models will be mentioned in reference to cellular communications (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[108]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[158]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7) Cellular Fading Models:</head><p>The rapidly emerging cellular communications spurred much theoretical research into fading channels, as the time-varying fading response is the basic ingredient in different models of these systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[113]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>. Numerous information-theoretic studies of single-cell models emerged in recent years in an effort to identify, via a simple tractable model, the basic dominating parameters and capture their effect on the ultimate achievable performance.</p><p>Many of these models (see relevant references in <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>) are, in fact, standard multiple-access models, which are also referred to as single-cell models. Quite often, the multicell models are also described in a single-cell framework where other cell users are simply modeled as additional noise to be combined with the ambient Gaussian noise <ref type="bibr">[255, and references therein]</ref>. For these purposes, the informationtheoretic treatment of the models discussed so far suffices (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[97]</ref>). We shall put emphasis here on those information-theoretic treatments which address specifically the multicell structure in an intrinsic manner, and which inherently address the fading phenomenon. In particular, we elaborate on what is known as Wyner's <ref type="bibr" target="#b338">[332]</ref> cellular model, where fading is also introduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[268]</ref>. Some implications of the broadcast, interference, and -out-of-channel models, as well as successive cancellation, are also briefly addressed. References will be pointed out for many other informationtheoretic studies of a variety of cellular communications models subjected to certain assumptions.</p><p>Wyner's cellular model with fading: In <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">[331]</ref> Wyner introduced a single linear and planar multicell (receiver) configuration to model the uplink in cellular communication. This model captures the intercell interference by assuming that each cell is subjected to interference from its adjacent cells. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">[331]</ref> no fading was considered, and the ultimate possible performance in terms of the symmetric achievable rate was assessed. A fully symmetric power-controlled system with a fixed number of users per cell and an optimal multicell receiver that optimally processes all received signals from all cells was assumed. Similar models were addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[129]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[130]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[125]</ref>. Fading was introduced into Wyner's model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[268]</ref> where its simple linear real version reads <ref type="bibr">(3.4.34)</ref> where stands for the received signal at cell site at time instant and, all signals are assumed to be real-valued. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">14</ref> This signal is composed of users of that cell and users of the two adjacent cells Here stands for the coded signal of the th user belonging to cell at discrete time The Gaussian noise samples are designated by The random variables model the independent flatfading processes to which the users at cell and are subjected. We assume that fading processes for different users are independent, while for a given user the fadings are ergodic processes of time (index ). In the model, stands for the intercell interference attenuation factor, where for the model reduces to the single-cell scenario with no intercell interference. Wyner's unfaded model <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">[331]</ref> results as a special case where It is assumed, unless otherwise stated, that users, subjected to an average equal power constraint , are active per each cell. The system is fully symbol-and frame-synchronized, giving rise to the discrete-time model in <ref type="bibr">(3.4.34)</ref>. Following Wyner, in order to assess the ultimate possible performance a "hyper-receiver," having a delayless ideal access to the received signals at all cell sites integers, is assumed. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[268]</ref> this system is analyzed in terms of bounds on achievable equal rates. First, a TDMA intracell accessing technique is assumed where each of the users in each cell accesses the channel in its respective slot and uses it when actively transmitting power No intercell cooperation or coordination other than synchronism is assumed. While in the unfaded scenario <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">[331]</ref> this accessing is optimal (not unique, however), this is no more the case in the fading regime <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[268]</ref>.</p><p>Under some mild conditions on the fading moments, the achievable rate is expressed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[268]</ref> (3.4.35) where stands for the limit distribution of the unordered eigenvalue of the quadratic form of . The tridiagonal infinite-dimensional random matrix has random entries where are i.i.d. fading coefficients. Unfortunately, the exact expression for is still unknown. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[268]</ref>, two sets of bounds were introduced, viz., the entropy-based and moment bounds. For the special case of no fading, the result reduces to Wyner's<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">15</ref> case <ref type="bibr">(3.4.36)</ref> The surprising results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[268]</ref> demonstrate that for dB and a certain range of relatively high intercell interference, the fading improves on performance as compared to the unfaded case <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">[331]</ref>. These interesting results, demonstrating the efficiency of the time-variable independent nature in which a certain user is received in its own and adjacent cell sites, are attributed to the fact that the diversity provided by the multiple cell-sites receivers changes the interplay between the deleterious mutual interuser interference on one hand, and the SNR enhancement provided by the multisensor receiver on the other. This interplay acts in such a way that independently fluctuating receiving levels (in a way which is revealed to the receiver, while maintaining the average power) help, rather than degrade, the performance. This is observed despite the mentioned fact that intracell TDMA is optimal in the unfaded case <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">[331]</ref>, while it is suboptimal when fading is present <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[268]</ref>. Note that the advantage of fading in this setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[268]</ref> does not require a large number of users</p><p>The wide band (WB), that is CDMA intracell accessing, is also considered, demonstrating advantage over the TDMA intracell accessing. It was proved that WB accessing achieves the ultimate symmetric capacity (i.e., it maximizes the sum-rate) of the faded Wyner model <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[268]</ref>. Bounds on the achievable rates were found. The asymptotically tight (with the number of users ) upper bound <ref type="bibr">(3.4.37)</ref> depends only on the variance and the mean of the fading process. It is demonstrated that upperbounds the Wyner unfaded expression for any value of and , thus demonstrating the surprisingly beneficial effect of the fading in this cellular model. This advantage is maintained also nonasymptotically <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[268]</ref>, but now the advantage is not necessarily uniform over and It should be emphasized that the independence of the three fading processes associated with each user (that is, the fluctuating power which is received in the user's own cell and the two adjacent cells) is crucial for the advantage that fading can provide. This occurs because otherwise the transmitters could themselves mimic the fluctuating-fading effect (in synchronism with the receivers), without altering the average transmitted power, and gain on performance over <ref type="bibr">(3.4.36)</ref> in the unfaded case. By the results of Wyner <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">[331]</ref>, this is clearly impossible.</p><p>The results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">[331]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[268]</ref> extend to the planar configuration. The models, methodology, and techniques apply directly to cases where the intercell interference emerges not only from the adjacent cells but also from cells located further away. This interference is then weighted by a nonincreasing positive sequence , where is proportional to the relative attenuation factor of cells at level from the interfered cell. We have demonstrated here the technique for and</p><p>The Wyner fading model is also the focus of the wide-scope study reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>. This study focuses on a practical method of a single cell-site receiver, where the users assigned to a certain cell (say) are decoded based only on the received signal at this cell site</p><p>The adjacent-cells interfering users are interpreted as Gaussian noises (a worst case assumption, which is motivated also by the mismatched nearest neighbor-based detection of <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[161]</ref>). It is assumed that each cell-site receiver is aware of the fading realizations of its own assigned users, and thus the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio is known at the receiving cell site. The transmitters do not have access to any CSI. The study <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref> provides a general formulation for the achievable rate region (inner-bound) of which all other discussed intracell channel accessing methods as TDMA and CDMA (WB) are special cases. The notion of intercell time sharing (ICTS), which is equivalent in a sense to classical frequency reuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b277">[273]</ref>, rises as an inherent feature of the information characterization of the inner achievable rate region. The ICTS controls the amount of intercell interference from full interference (no ICTS) to no interference (full ICTS, where the even-and odd-number cells signal in nonoverlapped times). In the unfaded case, any orthogonal intercell channel accessing technique is optimal (albeit not unique), while the picture changes considerably when fading is present. With fading and nondominant intercell interference (small ) CDMA is advantageous; a conclusion consistent with the single-cell result <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[97]</ref>. This is since CDMA enjoys an inherent fading-averaging effect, where the averaging takes place over the different users. For an intercell interference factor above a given calculated threshold, TDMA intracell accessing technique is superior. (Under no fading, both approaches, CDMA and TDMA, are equivalent.) For the model examined, intercell sharing protocols (as fractional intercell time sharing (ICTS)) are desirable in cases of significant intercell interference, and those when optimized restore to a large extent the superiority of the CDMA intracell approach in fading conditions, also for the case of strong, intercell interference.</p><p>Extension to detection based on processing the received signal from two adjacent cell sites (two cell-site processing, or TCSP) is also considered. It is assumed that the receiver, processing both and , is equipped with the codebooks as well as precise values of the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratios of all users in both cells This model serves as a compromise between the advantage of incorporating additional information from other cell sites on one hand, and the associated excess processing complexity on the other. The basic conclusions extend also to this case, though the range of parameters (as the intercell interference factor , and the total signal-to-noise ratio ) for which the relevant CDMA-versus-TDMA intracell accessing techniques and fractional intercell time sharing are relatively effective, changes. It is shown that for no ICTS and for SNR in TCSP, the intracell TDMA access is better than CDMA while the opposite is true for full ICTS giving rise to no intercell interference. The implications of space diversity with the two receiving antennas at the cell site, experiencing independent fading, are also considered. The intra-and intercell accessing protocols are characterized in terms of two auxiliary random variables which emerge in a general expression for an achievable rate region. The main results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>, though evaluated under the flat-fading assumption, were shown to hold for the more realistic multipath fading propagation model, with CSI available at the receiver.</p><p>By relaxing the assumption of a fixed number of active users per cell, it has been demonstrated, using interesting convexity properties, that under certain conditions random users' activity is advantageous, in terms of throughput, over a fixed number of active users. Specific results were discussed for a Poisson-distributed users' activity. In the randomaccess model considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>, the random number of users affects the interference, while in the discussion in the previous section, similar conclusions given in terms of achievable rate per user are demonstrated for a fading single cell (no interference) scenario with a random number of simultaneously active users. This random user activity per cell models more closely real cellular communications. The information-theoretic features of orthogonal CDMA in an isolated cell and fading environment were addressed. In this regime, the way orthogonality between users is achieved (i.e., orthogonal TDMA, orthogonal frequency-shift multiple-access FDMA or OCDMA) plays a fundamental role contrary to the unfaded case where all orthogonal channel access techniques are equivalent to the optimal scheme under an average power constraint. The somewhat surprising, already mentioned, result for orthogonal DS-SS CDMA not being uniformly superior to orthogonal TDMA in terms of achievable throughput, has been demonstrated, and was attributed to the orthogonality destruction mechanism due to the fading process which may affect OCDMA but not orthogonal TDMA. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[86]</ref> for a different model where the equivalence of orthogonal accessing techniques (TDMA, FDMA, and CDMA) is maintained also in the fading regime.</p><p>Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref> focuses mainly on TDMA and CDMA, in most cases equivalent results to TDMA can be formulated for FDMA using the well-known time-frequency duality.</p><p>In this work we have restricted our attention to the uplink channel. Yet, some conclusions can be drawn regarding the downlink channel as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[108]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[158]</ref>. The results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref> for a TDMA intracell accessing, yielding a single active transmission per cell, are relevant here. This is because all users are equivalent with respect to the downlink transmitter and, thus, if provided with the proper codebooks, each user can in principle access all the available information. The optimal rate per user is then given by the rate calculated in association with TDMA, where the total signal-to-noise-ratio is replaced by the normalized signal-to-noise ratio used by the downlink transmitter (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[108]</ref> for analysis of an isolated broadcast fading channel).</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>, it was concluded that, with TCSP and a large number of users per cell, fading may actually be beneficial, which resembles the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[268]</ref>, where the ultimate receiver bases its decisions on the information received in all possible cell sites. Note, however, that for the TCSP case the advantage of fading was demonstrated for an asymptotically large number of users per cell , while in <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[268]</ref>, with an ultimate multicell processing receiver, the beneficial effect of fading is experienced also for nonasymptotic values of A two-antenna microdiversity system under the assumption that the two cell-site receiving antennas experience independent fading is also considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr">(3.4.37)</ref>, for the sake of simplicity, we have specialized to Wyner's linear model. Results for the more realistic planar model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">[331]</ref> in the presence of fading are reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[268]</ref> for the ultimate receiver and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref> for the single cell-site processor.</p><p>Other cellular models: Many other models for cellular communication were studied via information-theoretic tools, and the reference list provided here includes dozens of relevant entries. See for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[139]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[123]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b315">[311]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b329">[324]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b281">[277]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[70]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b321">[317]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">[196]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b295">[291]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[145]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[169]</ref>. Some of the most interesting results concern the -out-of-model <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53]</ref>, which captures the fact that although there are many potential users per cell, only a relatively small part of them are actually active. The effect of random accessing has also been considered to some extent in <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>, and here in Subsection III-D.2). Successive cancellation plays a key role not only in the -out-of-models, as well as in other multiple-user settings discussed so far, but this method when combined with rate splitting constitutes an interesting model for cellular communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">[231]</ref>. In fact, various studies show that power control is not necessarily beneficial in a multicell system, <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">[231]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b327">[323]</ref>. By not controlling the power and properly ordering the users and their respective transmitted power, while all users are subjected to an average power constraint, the intercell interference is dramatically reduced. This stems from the fact that in a perfectly power-controlled system the major part of the interference is caused by those users assigned to other cells, located near the boundaries of the interfered cell and therefore transmitting with a relatively strong power. Abandoning the standard power control where the received power of all users at the cell site is kept fixed may improve dramatically <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">[231]</ref> the performance predicted by information theory. This advantage is achieved without any use of the coded signaling structure of the interfering users at the cell site receiver, and treating those interferers just as additional noise. Certainly, optimized power control, which accounts for the intercell interference, will further enhance performance, and this calls for further theoretical efforts. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref>, the geometric power distribution is used, motivated by its optimality under average-power constraints, in the singlecell delay-limited capacity problem as well as under average transmit power constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[197]</ref>. First, the proper ordering of the closest user to the cell-site receiver, operating at high power in the successive cancellation procedure, is decided upon. Those in the vicinity of the cell boundary are decoded last, and therefore suffer from minimal interference from other users of the same cell site, the interference of which has already been canceled. This minimal interference permits their reception with weak power, which implies that the interference they inflict on other adjacent cells is small. The associated increase in capacity is remarkable, and this different powercontrol procedure undermines the arguments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b310">[306]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b323">[319]</ref> claiming limited incentive of employing optimal multiuser processing in case where intercell interference is present. Similar results can be deduced from <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[197]</ref> by reinterpreting the different attenuations to which different users are subjected and accounting also for the multiple-cell interference. The reference to Wyner's model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[197]</ref> is inappropriate, as it does not account for the interference from other cell users when also processing the signals of the other cell-site antennas. Rather, it is a standard receive diversity setting. The downlink cellular fading channel has been naturally modeled within the broadcast channel framework where a "single user," the cell site, transmits to many users (the mobiles). Usually a single-cell scenario is considered, while intercell interference, when accounted for, is added to the ambient Gaussian noise (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[158]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[106]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[107]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[108]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>). In fact, a better model accounting in a more elementary way for the intercell interference is the broadcast/interference model. That is, since the cell site (the "single user") is interested to transmit information to a set of users assigned to this cell (possibly including some common control information directed to all users). The interference part of the model stems from the basic cellular structures, where the downlinks from different cell sites may interfere with each other. Little is known about rate regions of this model, even with no fading present. The same goes for the uplink, where the cell-site receiver should not necessarily treat the other cell users as interfering noise, provided that the receiver is equipped with the codebooks of the interfering users as well. As is well known <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">[191]</ref>, neither decoding of the interfering users is always optimal, but for the strong-interference case, nor treating it as pure ambient noise, but for the very-weak-interference case. It is of primary interest then to consider the case where the receiver is equipped with the codebooks of the adjacent cell users (a mild and practical assumption), though decoding is still based on a single cellsite processing as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>. The problem then falls within the classification of a multiple-access/interference channel where the multiple-access part stems from the (intracell) users to be decoded reliably and the interference part from the users assigned to other cells, the reliable decoding of which is not required. A comprehensive treatment of this interesting, albeit not easy, problem may shed light on the optimal intra-and intercell accessing protocols with or without fading. As demonstrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>, the interference-limited behavior (typical in cases when interference is interpreted as noise) is eliminated within this framework. To exemplify the intimate interplay between the multiple-access and interference features in a multicell model, consider the linear Wyner model, <ref type="bibr">(3.4.34)</ref>, with For a single cell-site processing due to the symmetry (in the case ) of all users (of the th cell and the two adjacent and cells), the interference-channel capacity equals the multiple-access channel capacity with users <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">[191]</ref>, provided all users are active simultaneously in all cells. The achievable equal rate under symmetric power conditions is then given by <ref type="bibr">(3.4.38)</ref> Full ICTS, where odd and even cells (in the linear Wyner model <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">[331]</ref>), transmit in different time zones gives rise to the rate <ref type="bibr">(3.4.39)</ref> where the equation accounts for the fact that the users of cell transmit 50% of the time, and hence use, while transmitting, the power per user. It is clear that might surpass , as is the case for where the fading effect is absolutely mitigated in both (3.4.38) and (3.4.39). In fact, in both cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>. This example demonstrates the intimate relation between multiple access, interference, and the cellular configuration (linear, with only adjacent-cell interference, in this case), and emphasizes the important role played by intercell cooperative protocols such as an optimized fractional ICTS considered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>. These intercell cooperative protocols emerged also in terms of the statistical dependence of auxiliary random variables, which appear in a general characterization of achievable rate regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Concluding Remarks</head><p>In this section we have tried to provide an overview of the information-theoretic approach to communications over fading channels. In our presentation an effort was made to describe not only results, but also concepts, insights, and techniques, with strong emphasis on recent results (some of which have even not yet been formally published). We preferred to emphasize nonclassical material, because the latter is by now well-documented in textbooks (see, for example, the classical techniques treating wideband fading channels reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[153]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[94]</ref>). Even then, in view of the vast amount of recent studies, only those ideas and results which are more special and typical to these time-varying channels were elaborated to some extent. We have tried to put emphasis on new information-theoretic notions, such as the delay-limited capacity, on one hand, and to suggest an underlying unifying view on the other. Through the whole exposition, efforts were made to present ideas and results in their simplest form (as, for example, discrete-time flat-fading models). Extensions, when present, were only pointed out briefly by directing to relevant references.</p><p>First we have tried to unify the different cases of ergodic capacity (that is, when classical Shannon type of capacity definitions provide operative notions, substantiated via coding theorems). The different cases account for different degrees of channel-state information (CSI) available to transmitter(s)/receiver(s). This unifying approach is based on Shannon's framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b265">[261]</ref>, as elaborated and further developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref> for the single-user case and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[69]</ref> for the multiple user problem. A complementary unifying view, which embraces notions as capacity versus outage <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[210]</ref>, delaylimited capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[127]</ref>, and expected capacity based on a broadcast approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">[247]</ref>, hinges on the classical notion of a compound channel with a prior (when relevant) attached to its unknown state. This approach is advocated in many references, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[150]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[61]</ref>, and others, where in <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83]</ref> the compound channels with a prior are called "composite channels." While coding theorems in this setting for the single-user case could be deduced from classical works (see <ref type="bibr">[164, and references therein]</ref>), the spectral-information techniques provide strong tools to treat these models <ref type="bibr" target="#b314">[310]</ref>, and that is particularly pronounced for the multiple-user (network information theory) case <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[124]</ref>. In fact, this very approach gives rise to straightforward observations, not emphasized previously. For example, this view substantiates directly the validity of the capacity-versus-outage results (for the single- <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[210]</ref> and multiple-user <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref> cases), developed originally for given channel-state information (CSI) to the receiver only, also for the case where CSI is not available (in case of static fading, that is, vanishing Doppler spread normalized to the transmission length ). Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b256">[252]</ref>, we have gained insight, based on elementary relations of average mutual information expressions, into the rather important implications on the capacity-achieving signaling properties in fast-time-varying channels with unavailable CSI. This kind of channels gives rise to "peaky" signals in time and/or frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b290">[286]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[99]</ref>. In fact, interesting results on transmit/receive diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[176]</ref>, as well as TDMA optimality in multiple-access fast-varying channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b263">[259]</ref>, can also be interpreted within this framework, as well as classical, well-known results <ref type="bibr" target="#b318">[314]</ref>.</p><p>Numerous new results are scattered throughout this section, as exemplified by the optimality of TDMA in the fast dynamic multiple-access fast-fading channel, when CSI is unavailable, a result which comes in a sharp contrast with the optimality of CDMA (wide band) for the same model but with CSI given to the receiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[97]</ref>, and the optimality of a fading controlled TDMA in case where CSI is available to both transmitter and receiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[155]</ref>. Preliminary treatment of achievable rates with CSI available to the transmitter only was attempted, in an effort to provide some further insight into the role played by the availability of the CSI. Certain new aspects of fading interference channels are also discussed, modifying the classical threshold value which defines a very strong interference for the Gaussian unfaded interference channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[59]</ref> (beyond which the interference effect is absolutely removed). Preliminary new results on random accessing in the MAC in presence of fading were also mentioned.</p><p>Although the flavor of our work is information-theoretic, we have made a special effort to emphasize practical implications and applications. This is because we believe that the insight provided by an information-theoretic approach has a direct and almost immediate impact on practical communications systems in view of the present and near-future technology. This synergy between information-theoretic reasoning and practical communications approaches, especially pronounced here for the timevarying fading channels, is the main motivation to combine, in our exposition, the parts on coding and equalization that follow. In view of this, we have devoted significant room to discuss issues as information-theoretic-inspired signaling and channel accessing, and discussed some of the informationtheoretic implications of practical approaches which combine channel estimation and detection. See, for example, the discussion on the effect on nonideal (estimated) channel parameters, and on robust detectors, as the one based on nearest neighbor decoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[161]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[165]</ref>. As for channel accessing, an interesting example to the practical implications of information-theoretic arguments, happens in Wyner's model <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">[331]</ref> in which fading is introduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>. In this model, with a single cell-site processing (of the uplink cellular channel) the intercell sharing protocols emerge as a natural outcome, under certain conditions of relatively strong intercell interference. Sound theoretical basis for practical approaches such as frequency and/or time reuse is thus provided for practical cases, where only limited information processing is allowed.</p><p>We wish to mention again that our overall exposition of the information-theoretic aspects of fading channels is very limited. Many deserving topics were only mentioned cursorily. Error exponents and cutoff rates are two such examples; others occur in several applications supported by information-theoretic analyses (for example, a decisionfeedback-based approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b301">[297]</ref>, multicarrier systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[71]</ref>, and the like). Also important, practically appealing methods, such as coded spread spectrum (DS-CDMA) for example, enjoying intensive information-theoretic treatment, that account for fading aspects as well (see <ref type="bibr">[254,</ref> and references therein]) were at best mentioned very briefly.</p><p>Our channel models and treatments are mainly motivated by the rapidly emerging cellular/personal/wireless network communications systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[113]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[114]</ref>; however, time-varying fading channels play a central part in many other applications. Also there, including, for example, satellite communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b278">[274]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[89]</ref>, underwater channels, which exhibit particularly harsh conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b294">[290]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b267">[263]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[136]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[173]</ref>  <ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">16</ref> informationtheoretic analysis is providing insight into the limitations and potentials of efficient communications. With this in mind, we have constructed a rather extensive additional reference list, focusing on information-theoretic approaches to time-varying channels. Some additional relevant references not cited in the text are <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[55]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[105]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">[302]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b342">[336]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[169]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">[184]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">[189]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[120]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b280">[276]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b275">[271]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">[212]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b248">[244]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[138]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b250">[246]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[86]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[121]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b345">[339]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">[269]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[66]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">[233]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b279">[275]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b249">[245]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">[264]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">[213]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b228">[224]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[102]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b276">[272]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. By no means is this list complete or even close to complete: hundreds of directly relevant references were not included, but rather appear in the reference lists of the papers cited here. Only few of rather important unpublished technical reports (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">[239]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">[227]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b286">[282]</ref>) were mentioned, and the overall emphasis was put on recent literature. The reader interested in completing the picture of this interesting topic is encouraged to access many additional documents, which can be traced either from the reference list or by accessing standard databases.</p><p>Indeed, the extension of these studies put in evidence the amount of recent interest of the scientific and technical community in a deeper understanding of the theoretical implications of communications over channel models which more accurately approximate current and future communication systems. (See, for example, work related to chaotic dynamical systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b336">[330]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b338">[332]</ref>.) These models cover a whole spectrum of classical media (as HF channels and meteor burst channels, used for many decades), and more recent channels and applications (as microwave wideband channels, wireless multimedia and ATM networks, cellular-based communication networks, underwater channels: see <ref type="bibr">[220, and references therein]</ref>). Unfortunately, some misconceptions based on inaccurate information-theoretic analysis are scattered within these efforts. We hope that, by our short remarks or by providing or referencing correct treatments, we have contributed to dispel to some extent some of those.</p><p>This scope of studies gives the impression that we present here an account on a mature subject. This is certainly not our view. We believe, in fact, that the most interesting and profound information-theoretic problems in the area of timevarying fading channels are yet to be addressed. We have observed that some of the more interesting models, for, e.g., multicell cellular communications, can be formalized in terms of either the multiple-access/interference channel (uplink) or the broadcast/interference channel (downlink). Much is yet unknown for these models, as is evidenced by the yet open problems in reference to the general characterization of the capacity regions of broadcast and interference channels, even in the nonfading environment. These research endeavors are not only nice theoretical problems: on the contrary, when developed, the corresponding results will carry a strong impact on the understanding of efficient channel-accessing techniques. These implications were demonstrated in a small way via the emergence of intercell resource sharing for certain simplistic cellular fading communication models <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">[255]</ref>. Fundamental aspects, as an intimate combinination of information and network (including queuing) theories, essential for a deep understanding of practical communications systems, is at best in its infancy stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[95]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[84]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b289">[285]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Decisive results on the joint source-channel coding in time-varying channels are still needed, which would incorporate various decoding constraints (as delay, etc.) motivated by practical applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b326">[322]</ref>. Also, there are common misconceptions about the validity of the source/channel separation theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[154]</ref>. While with no restrictions on the source and channel coder separation holds for an ergodic source channel problem, this certainly is not the case where a per-state joint source and channel coding is attempted, for example, to reduce overall delay. Recent general results as in [300, and references therein] are useful in this setting. Models which account more closely for classical constraints such as the inherent lack of synchronization, presence of memory, and the associated information-theoretic implications (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[135]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b223">[219]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b310">[306]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b313">[309]</ref>) in the fading regime are yet to be studied.</p><p>Arbitrarily varying channels and compound multiuser channels are intimately related to efficient communication over timevarying channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref>, and, as such, there are many relevant open problems with direct implications on communications in the presence of fading. So is the case with robust and mismatched decoders <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[164]</ref>. Within this class of channels, the issue of randomized versus deterministic coding rises in a natural way, and in the network setting this will bring up also the important issue of randomized channel accessing, treated however from purely information-theoretic viewpoint, and not just classical network/queuing theory. We have noticed that randomized channel accessing is a natural, sometimes advantageous, alternative for decentralized power control problems, and also that time-varying randomized multiuser coding may prove advantageous in an asynchronous environment and under a maximum (rather than average) error-probability criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[52]</ref>.</p><p>Throughout our paper we have scattered numerous much less ambitious information-theoretic problems, which intimately address the fading phenomenon, and the solution of which might considerably enhance the insight in this field.</p><p>A few such problems, some of which are currently under study, are listed as follows.</p><p>1) Capacities of the fading channel with CSI available to the transmitter only in either a causal or noncausal manner, for the single-and multiple-user cases.</p><p>2) The information-theoretic implications of optimal feedback, under constrained rate of the noiseless feedback channel.</p><p>3) Delayed feedback in the multiple-user environment, with specific application to the Markov-Rayleigh fading.</p><p>4) Constrained-states AVC interpretation of results related to the delay-limited capacity with states known or not known at the transmitter.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CODING FOR FADING CHANNELS</head><p>In this section we review a few important issues in coding and modulation for the fading channel. Here we focus our attention to the flat Rayleigh fading channel, and we discuss how some paradigms commonly accepted for the design of coding and modulation for a Gaussian channel should be shifted when dealing with a fading channel. The results presented before in this paper in terms of capacity show the importance of coding on this channel, and the relevance of obtaining channel-state information (CSI) in the demodulation process. Our goal here is to complement the insight that information theory provides about the general features of the capacity-achieving long codes. We describe design rules which apply to relatively short codes, meeting the stringent delay constraints demanded in many an application, like personal and multimedia wireless communications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. General Considerations</head><p>For fading channels the paradigms developed for the Gaussian channel may not be valid anymore, and a fresh look at the coding and modulation design philosophies is called for. Specifically, in the past the choices of system designers were driven by their knowledge of the behavior of coding and modulation (C/M) over the Gaussian channel: that is, they tried to apply to radio channels solutions that were far from optimum on channels where nonlinearities, Doppler shifts, fading, shadowing, and interference from other users made the channel far from Gaussian.</p><p>Of late, a great deal of valuable scholarly work has gone into reversing this perspective, and it is now being widely accepted that C/M solutions for the fading channel may differ markedly from Gaussian solutions. One example of this is the design of "fading codes," i.e., C/M schemes that are specifically optimized for a Rayleigh channel, and hence do not attempt to maximize the Euclidean distance between error events, but rather, as we shall see soon, their Hamming distance.</p><p>In general, the channel model turns out to have a considerable impact on the choice of the preferred solution of the C/M schemes. If the channel model is uncertain, or not stable enough in time to design a C/M scheme closely matched to it, then the best proposition may be that of a "robust" solution, that is, a solution that provides suboptimum performance on a wide variety of channel models. For example, the use of antenna diversity with maximal-ratio combining provides good performance in a wide variety of fading environments. Another solution is offered by bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM). Moreover, the availability of channel-state information (typically, in the form of the values of the attenuation introduced by the fading process) at the transmitter or at the receiver modifies the code design criteria.</p><p>The design of C/M schemes for the fading channel is further complicated when a multiuser environment has to be taken into account. The main problem here, and in general in communication systems that share channel resources, is the presence of multiple-access interference (MAI). This is generated by the fact that every user receives, besides the signal which is specifically directed to that user, some additional power from transmission to other users. This is true not only when CDMA is used, but also with space-division multiple access, in which intelligent antennas are directed toward the intended user. Earlier studies devoted to multiuser transmission simply neglected the presence of MAI. Typically, they were based on the naive assumption that, due to some version of the ubiquitous "central limit theorem," signals adding up from a variety of users would coalesce to a process resembling Gaussian noise. Thus the effect of MAI would be an increase of thermal noise, and any C/M scheme designed to cope with the latter would still be optimal, or at least near-optimal, for multiuser systems.</p><p>Of late, it was recognized that this assumption was groundless, and consequently several of the conclusions that it prompted were wrong. The central development of multiuser theory was the introduction of the optimum multiuser detector: rather than demodulating each user separately and independently, it demodulates all of them simultaneously. Multiuser detection was born in the context of terrestrial cellular communication, and hence implicitly assumed a MAIlimited environment where thermal noise is negligible with respect to MAI (high-SNR condition). For this reason coding was seldom considered, and hence most multiuser detection schemes known from the literature are concerned with symbolby-symbol decisions.</p><p>Reasons of space prevent us from covering the topic of C/M for multiuser channels in detail. However, we should at least mention that multiuser detection has been studied for fading channels as well (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b357">[351]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b358">[352]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b360">[354]</ref>). A recent approach to coding for fading channels uses an iterative decoding procedure which yields excellent performance in the realm of coded multiuser systems. (Also, noniterative multiuser schemes are well documented.) The interested reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">[340]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b353">[347]</ref>.</p><p>Another relevant factor in the choice of a C/M scheme is the decoding delay that one should allow: in fact, recently proposed, extremely powerful codes (the "turbo codes" <ref type="bibr" target="#b365">[359]</ref>) suffer from a considerable decoding delay, and hence their application might be useful for data transmission, but not for real-time speech. For real-time speech transmission, which imposes a strict decoding delay constraint, channel variations with time may be rather slow with respect to the maximum allowed delay. In this case, the channel may be modeled as a "block-fading" channel, in which the fading is nearly constant for a number of symbol intervals. On such a channel, a single codeword may be transmitted after being split into several blocks, each suffering from a different attenuation, thus realizing an effective way of achieving diversity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Frequency-Flat, Slow Rayleigh Fading Channel</head><p>This channel model assumes that the duration of a modulated symbol is much greater than the delay spread caused by the multipath propagation. If this occurs, then all frequency components in the transmitted signal are affected by the same random attenuation and phase shift, and the channel is frequency-flat. If in addition the channel varies very slowly with respect the symbol duration, then the fading remains approximately constant during the transmission of several symbols (if this does not occur, the fading process is called fast).</p><p>The assumption of nonselectivity allows us to model the fading as a process affecting the transmitted signal in a multiplicative form. The assumption of slow fading allows us to model this process as a constant random variable during each symbol interval. In conclusion, if denotes the complex envelope of the modulated signal transmitted during the interval , then the complex envelope of the signal received at the output of a channel affected by slow, flat fading and additive white Gaussian noise can be expressed in the form (4.2.1) where is a complex Gaussian noise, and is a Gaussian random variable, with having a Rice or Rayleigh pdf and unit second moment, i.e., If we can further assume that the fading is so slow that we can estimate the phase with sufficient accuracy, and hence compensate for it, then coherent detection is feasible. (If the phase cannot be easily tracked, then differential or noncoherent demodulation can be used: see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b389">[382]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b402">[395]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b403">[396]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b416">[409]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b440">[433]</ref>.) Thus model (4.2.1) can be further simplified to (4.2.2) It should be immediately apparent that with this simple model of fading channel the only difference with respect to an AWGN channel rests in the fact that , instead of being a constant attenuation, is now a random variable, whose value affects the amplitude, and hence the power, of the received signal. If in addition to coherent detection we assume that the value taken by is known at the receiver and/or at the transmitter, we say that we have perfect CSI. Channel-state information at the receiver front-end can be obtained, for example, by inserting a pilot tone in a notch of the spectrum of the transmitted signal, and by assuming that the signal is faded exactly in the same way as this tone.</p><p>Detection with perfect CSI at the receiver can be performed exactly in the same way as for the AWGN channel: in fact, the constellation shape is perfectly known, as is the attenuation incurred by the signal. The optimum decision rule in this case consists of minimizing the Euclidean distance between the received signal and the transmitted signal, rescaled by a factor or (4.2.3) with respect to the possible transmitted real signals (or vectors ).</p><p>A consequence of this fact is that the error probability with perfect CSI and coherent demodulation of signals affected by frequency-flat slow fading can be evaluated as follows. We first compute the error probability obtained by assuming constant in model (4.2.2), then we take the expectation of , with respect to the random variable The calculation of is performed as if the channel were AWGN, but with the energy changed to Notice finally that the assumptions of a noiseless channel-state information and a noiseless phase-shift estimate make the values of thus obtained as yielding a limiting performance.</p><p>In the absence of CSI, one could pick a decision rule consisting of minimizing or (4.2.4)</p><p>However, with constant envelope signals ( constant), the error probabilities obtained with (4.2.3) and (4.2.4) coincide. In fact, observe that the pairwise error probability between and , i.e., the probability that is preferred to by the receiver when is transmitted, is given by Comparison of error probabilities over the Gaussian channel with those over the Rayleigh fading channel with perfect CSI <ref type="bibr" target="#b364">[358]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[223]</ref> show that the loss in error probability is considerable. Coding can compensate for a substantial amount of this loss.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Designing Fading Codes: The Impact of Hamming Distance</head><p>A commonly approved design criterion is to design coded schemes such that their minimum Euclidean distance is maximized. This is correct on the Gaussian channel with high SNR (although not when the SNR is very low: see <ref type="bibr" target="#b426">[419]</ref>), and is often accepted, faute de mieux, on channels that deviate little from the Gaussian model (e.g., channels with a moderate amount of intersymbol interference). However, the Euclideandistance criterion should be outright rejected over the Rayleigh fading channel. In fact, analysis of coding for the Rayleigh fading channel proves that Hamming distance (also called "code diversity" in this context) plays the central role here.</p><p>It should be kept in mind that, as far as capacity-achieving codes are concerned, the minimum Euclidean distance has little relevance: it is the whole distance spectrum that counts <ref type="bibr" target="#b421">[414]</ref>. This is classically demonstrated by the features of turbo codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b365">[359]</ref>, which exhibit a relatively poor minimum distance and yet approach capacity rather remarkably. In this sense, what we provide in this section is the fading-channel equivalent of the minimum-distance criterion, which is of direct relevance when short (and hence inherently not capacity-achieving) codes are to be designed for a rather high signal-to-noise environment.</p><p>Assume transmission of a coded sequence where the components of are signal vectors selected from a constellation</p><p>We do not distinguish here among block or convolutional codes (with soft decoding), or block-or trellis-coded modulation. We also assume that, thanks to perfect (i.e., infinite-depth) interleaving, the fading random variables affecting the various symbols are independent. Hence we write, for the components of the received sequence <ref type="bibr">(4.3.1)</ref> where the are independent, and, under the assumption that the noise is white, the RV's are also independent. Coherent detection of the coded sequence, with the assumption of perfect channel-state information, is based upon the search for the coded sequence that minimizes the distance</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">(4.3.2)</formula><p>Thus the pairwise error probability can be expressed in this case as <ref type="bibr">(4.3.3)</ref> where is the set of indices such that An example: For illustration purposes, let us compute the Chernoff upper bound to the word error probability of a block code with rate Assume that binary antipodal modulation is used, with waveforms of energies , and that the demodulation is coherent with perfect CSI. Observe that for we have where denotes the average energy per bit. For two codewords at Hamming distance we have and hence, for a linear code, where denotes the set of nonzero Hamming weights of the code, considered with their multiplicities. It can be seen that for high enough signal-to-noise ratio the dominant term in the expression of is the one with exponent , the minimum Hamming distance of the code.</p><p>By recalling the above calculation, the fact that the probability of error decreases inversely with the signal-to-noise ratio raised to power can be expressed by saying that we have introduced a code diversity We may further upper-bound the pairwise error probability by writing <ref type="bibr">(4.3.4)</ref> (which is close to the true Chernoff bound for small enough ). Here is the geometric mean of the nonzero squared Euclidean distances between the components of The latter result shows the important fact that the error probability is (approximately) inversely proportional to the product of the squared Euclidean distances between the components of that differ, and, to a more relevant extent, to a power of the signal-to-noise ratio whose exponent is the Hamming distance between and We stress again the fact that the above results hold when CSI is available to the receiver. With no such availability, the metric differs considerably from that leading to (4.3.4) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b388">[381]</ref>). This is in contrast to what was observed before for the case of constant-envelope signals.</p><p>Further, we know from the results referring to block codes, convolutional codes, and coded modulation that the union bound to error probability for a coded system can be obtained by summing up the pairwise error probabilities associated with all the different "error events." For high signal-to-noise ratios, a few equal terms will dominate the union bound. These correspond to error events with the smallest value of the Hamming distance</p><p>We denote this quantity by to stress the fact that it reflects a diversity residing in the code. We have <ref type="bibr">(4.3.5)</ref> where is the number of dominant error events. For error events with the same Hamming distance, the values taken by and by are also of importance. This observation may be used to design coding schemes for the Rayleigh fading channel: here no role is played by the Euclidean distance, which is the central parameter used in the design of coding schemes for the AWGN channel.</p><p>For uncoded systems , the results above hold with the positions and , which shows that the error probability decreases as A similar result could be obtained for maximal-ratio combining in a system with diversity</p><p>This explains the name of this parameter. In this context, the various diversity schemes may be seen as implementations of the simplest among the coding schemes, the repetition code, which provides a diversity equal to the number of diversity branches (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b386">[379]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b387">[380]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b424">[417]</ref>, and [361, Chs. 9 and 10]).</p><p>From the discussion above, we have learned that over the perfectly interleaved Rayleigh fading channel the choice of a short code (in the sense elucidated above) should be based on the maximization of the code diversity, i.e., the minimum Hamming distance among pairs of error events. Since for the Gaussian channel code diversity does not play the same central role, coding schemes optimized for the Gaussian channel are likely to be suboptimum for the Rayleigh channel. We have noticed in the previous section that optimal (capacityachieving) codes for the channel at hand (4.3.1) are in fact exactly the same codes as designed for the classical AWGN channel when CSI is available to receiver only <ref type="bibr" target="#b419">[412]</ref> or to receiver and transmitter <ref type="bibr" target="#b383">[376]</ref>. This is because those codes, being long, manage to achieve the averaging effect over the fading realizations. Here the conclusions are dufferent, as we focus on short codes, whose different features, like code diversity, help improve performance.</p><p>1) Signal-Space Coding: Design of multidimensional constellations aimed at optimality on the Rayleigh fading channel has been recently developed into an active research area (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b368">[362]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b370">[364]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b377">[370]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b396">[389]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b392">[385]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b436">[429]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b439">[432]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b405">[398]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b438">[431]</ref>).</p><p>This theory assumes the communication system model shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref>.

With denoting component-wise product, we can then write with and With perfect CSI, maximum-likelihood (ML) detection, which requires the minimization of the metric (4.3.6) may be a very complex operation for an arbitrary signal set with a large number of points. A universal lattice decoder was suggested to obtain a more efficient ML detection of lattice constellations in fading channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b437">[430]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b436">[429]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b439">[432]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b370">[364]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b405">[398]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b438">[431]</ref>.</p><p>Signal-space diversity and product distance: With this channel model, the diversity order of a multidimensional signal set is the minimum number of distinct components between any two constellation points. In other words, the diversity order is the minimum Hamming distance between any two coordinate vectors of the constellation points.</p><p>This type of diversity technique can be called modulation, or signal-space diversity. This definition applies to every modulation scheme and affects its performance over the fading channel in conjunction with component interleaving. By use of component interleaving, fading attenuations over different space dimensions become statistically independent. An attractive feature of these schemes is that we have an improvement of error performance without even requiring the use of conventional channel coding.</p><p>Two approaches were proposed to construct high modulation-diversity constellations (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b368">[362]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b369">[363]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b396">[389]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b392">[385]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b436">[429]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b439">[432]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b370">[364]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b377">[370]</ref>). The first was based on the design of high-diversity lattice constellations by applying the canonical embedding to the ring of integers of an algebraic number field. Only later was it realized that high modulation diversity could also be achieved by applying a certain rotation to a classical signal constellation in such a way that any two points achieve the maximum number of distinct components. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref> illustrates this idea applied to a 4-PSK. Two-and four-dimensional rotations were first found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b368">[362]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b405">[398]</ref>, while the search for good high-dimensional rotations needs sophisticated mathematical tools, e.g., algebraic number theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b372">[366]</ref>.</p><p>An interesting feature of the rotation operation is that the rotated signal set has exactly the same performance than the nonrotated one when used over a pure AWGN channel, while as for other types of diversity such as space, time, frequency, and code diversity, the performance over Rayleigh fading channels, for increasingly high modulation diversity order, approaches that achievable over the Gaussian channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b378">[371]</ref>.</p><p>To give a better idea of the influence of on the error probability, we estimate the error probability of the system described in Section IV-C1).

First of all, note that if the lattice generator matrix in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref> is a rotation matrix, then the signal constellation can be viewed as a rotated cubic lattice constellation or a rotated multidimensional quadrature amplitude-modulation (QAM) constellation. This observation enables some of the previous results on high-diversity lattices to be applied to producing high-diversity rotated constellations.</p><p>One point has to be noted when using these rotated constellations: increasing the diversity does not necessarily increase to the same extent the performance: in fact, the minimum product distance decreases and the product kissing number increases. Simulations show that most of the gain is obtained for diversity orders up to .</p><p>2) Block-Fading Channel: This channel model, introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[148]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[210]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b407">[400]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[156]</ref>) belongs to the general class of block-interference channels described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">[183]</ref>. It is motivated by the fact that, in many mobile radio situations, the channel coherence time is much longer than one symbol interval, and hence several transmitted symbols are affected by the same fading value. Use of this channel model allows one to introduce a delay constraint for transmission, which is realistic whenever infinite-depth interleaving is not a reasonable assumption.</p><p>This model assumes that a codeword of length spans blocks of length (a group of blocks will be referred to as a frame). The value of the fading in each block is constant, and each block is sent through an independent channel. An interleaver spreads the code symbols over the blocks. is a measure of the interleaving delay of the system: in fact, (or ) corresponds to no interleaving, while (or ) corresponds to perfect interleaving. Thus results obtained for different values of illustrate the downside of nonideal interleaving, and hence of finite decoding delay.</p><p>For this channel, it is intuitive (and easy to prove) that the pairwise error probability decreases exponentially with exponent , the Hamming distance between codewords on a block basis (in other words, two nonequal blocks contribute to this block Hamming distance by one, irrespective of the symbols in which they differ). If a code with rate bits per dimension is used over this channel in conjunction with anary modulation scheme, then the Singleton bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b407">[400]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[156]</ref> upper-bounds the block Hamming distance <ref type="bibr">(4.3.11)</ref> If this inequality is applied to a code with and</p><p>(the parameters that characterize the GSM standard of second-generation digital cellular systems), it shows that Now, the convolutional code selected for GSM achieves exactly this bound, and hence it can be proved to be optimum in the sense of maximizing the block Hamming distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b407">[400]</ref>. The code was originally found by optimizing the Hamming distance, considering interleaving over eight time slots for full-rate GSM (and over four for half-rate) with one or two erasures. The result was a half-rate code which could decode even if three out of eight slots were bad (fullrate) <ref type="bibr" target="#b398">[391]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b414">[407]</ref>. A larger upper bound would be obtained by choosing , in which case the challenge would be to find a code that achieves this bound.</p><p>Malkamäki and Leib <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[175]</ref> provide a fairly comprehensive analysis of coding for this class of channels, based on randomcoding error bounds. Among the observations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[175]</ref>, it is interesting to note that for high-rate codes the diversity afforded by the use of blocks may not improve the average code performance: since the channel is constant during a block, it may be better to send the whole codeword in a single block rather than to divide it into several blocks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Impact of Diversity</head><p>The design procedure described in the section above, and consisting of adapting the C/M scheme to the channel, may suffer from a basic weakness. If the channel model is not stationary, as may be the case, for example, in a mobileradio environment where it fluctuates in time between the extremes of Rayleigh and AWGN, then a code designed to be optimum for a fixed channel model might perform poorly when the channel varies. Therefore, a code optimal for the AWGN channel may be actually suboptimum for a substantial Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. Effect of antenna diversity on the performance of four-state TCM schemes over the flat, independent Rayleigh fading channel. J4 is optimum for the Rayleigh channel, while U4 is optimum for the Gaussian channel. fraction of time. 17 An alternative solution consists of doing the opposite, i.e., matching the channel to the coding scheme: the latter is still designed for a Gaussian channel, while the former is transformed from a Rayleigh-fading channel (say) into a Gaussian one, thanks to the introduction of antenna diversity and maximal-ratio combining.</p><p>The standard approach to antenna diversity is based on the fact that, with several diversity branches, the probability that the signal will be simultaneously faded on all branches can be made small. Another approach, which was investigated by the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">[302]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b307">[303]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b433">[426]</ref>, is philosophically different, as it is based upon the observation that, under fairly general conditions, a channel affected by fading can be turned into an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel by increasing the number of diversity branches. Consequently, it can be expected (and it was indeed verified by analyses and simulations) that a coded-modulation scheme designed to be optimal for the AWGN channel will perform asymptotically well also on a fading channel with diversity, at the cost of an increase in receiver complexity. An advantage of this solution is its robustness, since changes in the physical channel affect the reception very little.</p><p>This allows one to argue that the use of "Gaussian" codes along with diversity reception provides indeed a solution to the problem of designing robust coding schemes for the mobile radio channel. 17 We recall that, as far as channel capacity is concerned, with CSI available to either the receiver or both receiver and transmitter, it is the capacityachieving code which implicitly does time averaging, even when no diversity is present. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7</ref> shows the block diagram of the transmission scheme with fading and cochannel interference.</p><p>The assumptions are <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">[302]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b307">[303]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b433">[426]</ref> as follows. 1) PSK modulation.</p><p>2) independent diversity branches whose signal-to-noise ratio is inversely proportional to (this assumption is made in order to disregard the SNR increase that actually occurs when multiple receive elements are used).</p><p>3) Flat, independent Rayleigh fading channel. 4) Coherent detection with perfect channel-state information. 5) Synchronous diversity branches. 6) Independent cochannel interference, and a single interferer. The codes examined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">[302]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b307">[303]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b433">[426]</ref> are the following:</p><p>J4: Four-state, rate-TCM scheme based on 8-PSK and optimized for Rayleigh fading channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b404">[397]</ref>. U4: Four-state rate-TCM scheme based on 8-PSK and optimized for the Gaussian channel. U8: Same as above, with eight states. Q64: "Pragmatic" concatenation of the "best" rate-64state convolutional code with 4-PSK modulator and Gray mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b435">[428]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> compares the performance of U4 and J4 (two TCM schemes with the same complexity) over a Rayleigh fading channel with -branch diversity.</p><p>It is seen that, as increases, the performance of U4 comes closer and closer to that of J4. Similar results hold for correlated fading: even for moderate correlation J4 loses its edge on U4, and for as low as U4 performs better than J4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">[302]</ref>. The effect of diversity is more marked when the code used is weaker. As an example, two-antenna diversity provides a gain of 10 dB at BER when U8 is used, and of 2.5 dB when Q64 is used <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">[302]</ref>. The assumption of branch independence, although important, is not critical: in effect, <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">[302]</ref> shows that branch correlations as large as degrade system BER only slightly. The complexity introduced by diversity can be traded for delay: as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">[302]</ref>, in some cases diversity makes interleaving less necessary, so that a lower interleaving depth (and, consequently, a lower overall delay) can be compensated by an increase of When differential or pilot-tone, rather than coherent, detection is used <ref type="bibr" target="#b433">[426]</ref>, a BER floor occurs which can be reduced by introducing diversity. As for the effect of cochannel interference, even its BER floor is reduced as is increased (although for its elimination multiuser detectors should be employed). This shows that antenna diversity with maximalratio combining is highly instrumental in making the fading channel closer to Gaussian.</p><p>1) Transmitter-Antenna Diversity: Multiple transmit antennas can also be used to provide diversity, and hence to improve the performance of a communication system in a fading environment; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b400">[393]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[198]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b441">[434]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b442">[435]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b443">[436]</ref>. Transmitter diversity has been receiving in the recent past a fresh look. As observed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[198]</ref>, "it is generally viewed as more difficult to exploit than receiver diversity, in part because the transmitter is assumed to know less about the channel than the receiver, and in part because of the challenging design problem: the transmitter is permitted to generate a different signal at each antenna."</p><p>The case with transmit antennas and one receive antenna is relatively simple, and especially interesting for applications. A taxonomy of transmitter diversity schemes is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[198]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b417">[410]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[198]</ref> each transmit antenna sees an independent fading channel. The receiver is assumed to have perfect knowledge of the vector of the fading coefficients of the channels, while the transmitter has access only to a random variable correlated with This variable represents side information which might be obtained from feedback from the receiver, reverse-path signal measurements, or approximate multipath directional information. The lack of channel knowledge at the transmitter results in a factor of loss in signal-to-noise ratio relative to perfect channel knowledge.</p><p>General C/M design guidelines for transmit-antenna diversity in fading channels were considered by several authors (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b390">[383]</ref>).</p><p>2) Coding with Transmit-and Receive-Antenna Diversity: Space-Time Codes: As of today, the most promising coding schemes with transmit-and receive-antenna diversity seem to be offered by "space-time codes" <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">[281]</ref>. These can be seen as a generalization of a coding scheme advocated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b425">[418]</ref>, where the same data are transmitted by two antennas with a delay of one-symbol interval introduced in the second path. This corresponds to using a repetition code. The diversity gain provided by space-time codes equals the rank of certain matrices, which translates the code design task into an elegant mathematical problem. Explicit designs are presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">[281]</ref>, based on 4-PSK, 8-PSK, and 16-QAM. They exhibit excellent performance, and can operate within 2-3 dB of the theoretical limits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Coding with CSI at Transmitter and Receiver</head><p>An efficient coding strategy, which can also be used in conjunction with diversity, is based on the simple observation that if CSI is available at the transmitter as well as at the receiver the transmit power may be allocated on a symbolby-symbol basis. Consider the simplest such strategy. Assume that the CSI is known at the transmitter front-end, that is, the transmitter knows the value of during the transmission (this assumption obviously requires that is changing very slowly), and denote by the amplitude transmitted when the channel gain is One possible power-allocation criterion (constant error probability over each symbol) requires to be the inverse of the channel gain. This way, the channel is transformed into an equivalent additive white Gaussian noise channel. This technique ("channel inversion") is conceptually simple, since the encoder and decoder are designed for the AWGN channel, independent of the fading statistics: a version of it is common in spread-spectrum systems with near-far interference imbalances. However, it may suffer from a large capacity penalty. For example, with Rayleigh fading the transmitted power would be infinite, because diverges, and the channel capacity is zero.</p><p>To avoid divergence of the average power (or an inordinately large value thereof) a possible strategy consists of inverting the channel only if the power expenditure does not exceed a certain threshold; otherwise, we compensate only for a part of the channel attenuation. By appropriately choosing the value of the threshold we trade off a decrease of the average received power value for an increase of error probability.</p><p>A different perspective in taken in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>, where a coding strategy is studied which minimizes the outage rate of the -block BF-AWGN. It is shown that minimum outage rate can be achieved by transmitting a fixed codebook, randomly generated with i.i.d. Gaussian components, and by suitably allocating the transmitted power to the blocks. The optimal power-allocation policy is derived under a constraint on the transmitted power. Specifically, two different power constraints are considered. The first one ("short-term" constraint) requires the average power in each frame to be less than a constant</p><p>The second one ("long-term" constraint) requires the average power time-averaged over a sequence of infinitely many frames to be less than</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[111]</ref>, the coding scheme advocated for a channel with CSI at both transmitter and receiver was based on multiplexing different codebooks with different rates and average powers, where the multiplexer and the corresponding demultiplexer are driven by the fading process. Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> shows that the same capacity can also be achieved by a single codebook with i.i.d. Gaussian components, whose th block of symbols is properly scaled before transmission. To see this, it is sufficient to replace the BF-AWGN channel with perfect transmitter and receiver CSI and gain by a BF-AWGN channel with perfect receiver CSI only and gain</p><p>, where denotes the optimum power-control strategy. Since is time-invariant, these channels have the same capacity irrespectively of the fading time correlation, as long as forms an asymptotically ergodic process and no delay constraint is imposed (a rigorous proof, valid in a general setting, is provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>).</p><p>A pragmatic power-allocation scheme for block-fading channels, simple but quite efficient, was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b408">[401]</ref>. It consists of inverting the channel only for a limited number of blocks, while no power is spent to transmit the others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation</head><p>Ever since 1982, when Ungerboeck published his landmark paper on trellis-coded modulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b431">[424]</ref>, it has been generally accepted that modulation and coding should be combined in a single entity for improved performance. Several results followed this line of thought, as documented by a considerable body of work aptly summarized and referenced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b404">[397]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b367">[361,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ch. 10]</ref>). Under the assumption that the symbols were interleaved with a depth exceeding the coherence time of the fading process, new codes were designed for the fading channel so as to maximize their diversity. This implied in particular that parallel transitions should be avoided in the code, and that any increase in diversity would be obtained by increasing the constraint length of the code. One should also observe that for non-Ungerboeck systems, i.e., those separating modulation and coding with binary modulation, Hamming distance is proportional to Euclidean distance, and hence a system optimized for the additive white Gaussian channel is also optimum for the Rayleigh fading channel.</p><p>A notable departure from Ungerboeck's paradigm was the core of <ref type="bibr" target="#b435">[428]</ref>. Schemes were designed in which coded modulation is generated by pairing an -ary signal set with a binary convolutional code with the largest minimum free Hamming distance. Decoding was achieved by designing a metric aimed at keeping as their basic engine an off-the-shelf Viterbi decoder for the de facto standard, 64-state rate-convolutional code. This implied giving up the joint decoder/demodulator in favor of two separate entities.</p><p>Based on the latter concept, Zehavi <ref type="bibr" target="#b444">[437]</ref> first recognized that the code diversity, and hence the reliability of coded modulation over a Rayleigh fading channel, could be further improved. Zehavi's idea was to make the code diversity equal to the smallest number of distinct bits (rather than channel symbols) along any error event. This is achieved by bit-wise interleaving at the encoder output, and by using an appropriate soft-decision bit metric as an input to the Viterbi decoder.</p><p>One of Zehavi's findings, rather surprising a priori, was that on some channels there is a downside to combining demodulation and decoding. This prompted the investigation the results of which are presented in a comprehensive fashion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b363">[357]</ref>).</p><p>An advantage of this solution is its robustness, since changes in the physical channel affect the reception very little. Thus it provides good performance with a fading channel as well as with an AWGN channel (and, consequently, with a Rice fading channel, which can be seen as intermediate between the latter two). This is due to the fact that BICM increases the Hamming distance at the price of a moderate reduction of the Euclidean distance: see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref>. Recently, a scheme which combines bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative ("turbo") decoding was analyzed <ref type="bibr" target="#b411">[404]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b412">[405]</ref>. It was shown that iterative decoding results in a dramatic performance improvement, and even outperforms trellis-coded modulation over Gaussian channels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Conclusions</head><p>This review was aimed at illustrating some concepts that make the design of short codes for the fading channel differ markedly from the same task applied to the Gaussian channel. In particular, we have examined the design of "fading codes," i.e., C/M schemes which maximize the Hamming, rather than the Euclidean, distance, the interaction of antenna diversity with coding (which makes the channel more Gaussian), and the effect of separating coding from modulation in favor of a more robust C/M scheme. The issue of optimality as contrasted to robustness was also discussed to some extent. The connections with the information-theoretic results for the previous section were also pointed out.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EQUALIZATION OF FADING MULTIPATH CHANNELS</head><p>Equalization is generally required to mitigate the effects of intersymbol interference (ISI) resulting from timedispersive channels such as fading multipath channels which are frequency-selective. Equlization is also effective in reducing multiple-access interference (MAI) in multiuser communication systems. In this section, we focus our discussion on equalization techniques that are effective in combatting ISI caused by multipath in fading channels and MAI in multiuser communication systems. Many references to the literature are cited for the benefit of the interested reader who may wish to delve into these topics in greater depth. In reading this section, it should be kept in mind that the optimum coding/modulation/demodulation/decoding, as dictated by information-theoretic arguments, does not imply separation between equalization and decoding. However, the latter approach may yield robust systems with limited complexity, incurring in a small or even negligible loss of optimality. In this respect, we follow here the rationale of the previous section, that is, we attempt at complementing the information-theoretic insights with methods of primarily practical relevance. Thus in this section we shall not address explicitly the presence of code (which would be essential if channel capacity were to be approached). A few remarks on this point will also be provided at the end of this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Channel Characteristics that Impact Equalization</head><p>As previously indicated, signals transmitted on wireless channels are corrupted by time-varying multipath signal propagation, additive noise disturbances, and interference from multiple users of the channel. Time-varying multipath generally results in signal fading.</p><p>The communication system engineer is faced with the task of designing the modulation/demodulation and coding/decoding techniques to achieve reliable communication that satisfies the system requirements, such as the desired data rates, transmitter power, and bandwidth constraints.</p><p>Not all system designs for wireless communications require the use of adaptive equalizers. In fact, if is the channel multipath spread, the system designer may avoid the need for channel equalization by selecting the time duration of the transmitted signaling waveforms to satisfy the condition As a consequence, the intersymbol interference (ISI) is negligible. This is indeed the case in the digital cellular system based on the IS-95 standard, which employs CDMA to accommodate multiple users. This is also the case in digitalaudio broadcast (DAB) systems which employ multicarrier, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) for modulation. On the other hand, if the system designer selects the symbol time duration of the signaling waveforms such that , then there is ISI present in the received signal which can be mitigated by use of an equalizer.</p><p>Another channel parameter that plays an important role in the effectiveness of an equalizer is the channel Doppler spread or its reciprocal , which is the channel coherence time. Since the use of an equalizer at the receiver implies the need to measure the channel characteristics, i.e., the channel impulse or frequency response, the channel time variations must be relatively slow compared to the transmitted symbol duration and, more generally, compared to the multipath spread Consequently, or, equivalently, the spread factor must satisfy the condition that is, the channel must be underspread. Therefore, adaptive equalization is particularly applicable to reducing the effects of ISI in underspread wireless communications channels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Equalization Methods</head><p>Equalization techniques for combatting intersymbol interference (ISI) on time-dispersive channels may be subdivided into two general types-linear equalization and nonlinear equalization. Associated with each type of equalizer is one or more structures for implementing the equalizer. Furthermore, for each structure there is a class of algorithms that may be employed to adaptively adjust the equalizer parameters according to some specified performance criterion. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9</ref> provides an overall categorization of adaptive equalization techniques into types, structures, and algorithms. Linear equalizers find use in applications where the channel distortion is not too severe. In particular, the linear equalizer does not perform well on channels with spectral nulls in their frequency-response characteristics. In compensating for the channel distortion, the linear equalizer places a large gain in the vicinity of the spectral null and, as a consequence, significantly enhances the additive noise present in the received signal. Such is the case in fading multipath channels. Consequently, linear equalizers are generally avoided for fading multipath channels. Instead, nonlinear equalization methods, either decision-feedback equalization or maximum-likelihood sequence detection, are used.</p><p>Maximum-likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) is the optimum equalization technique in the sense that it minimizes the probability of a sequence error <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[223]</ref>. MLSD is efficiently implemented by means of the Viterbi algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[223]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b461">[454]</ref>. However, the computational complexity of MLSD grows exponentially with the number of symbols affected by ISI <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[223]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b461">[454]</ref>. Consequently, its application to practical communication systems is limited to channels for which the ISI spans a relatively small number of symbols, e.g. fewer than ten. Such is the case for the GSM digital cellular system, where MLSD is widely used. This is also the case for the North America IS-54 or IS-136 digital cellular standard, where the ISI spans only two or three symbols <ref type="bibr" target="#b476">[469]</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, there are wireless communication channels in which the ISI spans such a large number of symbols, e.g., 50-100 symbols, that the computational complexity of MLSD is practically prohibitive. In such cases, the decisionfeedback equalizer (DFE) provides a computationally efficient albeit suboptimum, alternative <ref type="bibr" target="#b490">[483]</ref>. The basic idea in decision-feedback equalization is that once an information symbol has been detected, the ISI that it causes on future symbols may be estimated and subtracted out prior to symbol detection. The DFE may be realized either in the direct form or as a lattice <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[223]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b478">[471]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b511">[504]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b512">[505]</ref>. The direct-form structure of the DFE is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10</ref>.</p><p>It consists of a feedforward filter (FFF) and a feedback filter (FBF). The latter is driven by decisions at the output of the detector and its coefficients are adjusted to cancel the ISI on the current symbol that results from past detected symbols (postcursors).</p><p>The computational complexity of the DFE is a linear function of the number of taps of the feedforward and feedback filters, which are typically equal to twice the number of symbols (for fractional spacing) spanned by the ISI. The DFE has been shown to be particularly effective for equalizing the ISI in underwater acoustic communication channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b517">[510]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b519">[512]</ref>. It also provides a computationally simpler alternative to MLSD for use in the GSM digital cellular system, where the multipath spread of the channel may span up to six symbols <ref type="bibr" target="#b451">[444]</ref>. The DFE has also been used in digital communication systems for troposcatter channels operating in the SHF (3-30-GHz) frequency band <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[223]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b470">[463]</ref> and ionospheric channels in the HF (3-30-MHz) frequency band <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[223]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b470">[463]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Fractionally Spaced Equalizers</head><p>It is well known <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[223]</ref> that the optimum receiver for a digital communication signal corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) consists of a matched filter which is sampled periodically at the symbol rate. These samples constitute a set of sufficient statistics for estimating the digital information that was transmitted. If the signal samples at the output of the matched filter are corrupted by intersymbol interference, the symbol-spaced samples are further processed by an equalizer.</p><p>In the presence of channel distortion, such as channel multipath, the matched filter prior to the equalizer must be matched to the channel corrupted signal. However, in practice, the channel impulse response is usually unknown. One approach is to estimate the channel impulse response from the transmission of a sequence of known symbols and to implement the matched filter to the received signal using the estimate of the channel impulse response. This is generally the approach used in the GSM digital cellular system, where digital voice and/or data is transmitted in packets, where each packet contains a sequence of known data symbols that are used to estimate the channel impulse response <ref type="bibr" target="#b456">[449]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b451">[444]</ref>. A second approach is to employ a fractionally spaced equalizer, which in effect consists of a combination of the matched filter and a linear equalizer.</p><p>A fractionally spaced equalizer (FSE) is based on sampling the incoming signal at least as fast as the Nyquist rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[223]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b464">[457]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b504">[497]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b527">[520]</ref>. For example, if the transmitted signal consists of pulses having a raised cosine spectrum with rolloff factor , its spectrum extends to This signal may be sampled at the receiver at the minimum rate of and then passed through an equalizer with tap spacing of For example, if , we require a -spaced equalizer. If</p><p>, we may use a -spaced equalizer, and so forth. In general, a digitally implemented FSE has tap spacings of , where and are integers and Often, a -spaced equalizer is used in many applications, even in cases where a larger tap spacing is possible.</p><p>The frequency response of an FSE is where are the equalizer coefficients, is the number of equalizer tap weights, and Hence, can equalize the received signal spectrum beyond the Nyquist frequency up to</p><p>The equalized spectrum is where is the input analog signal spectrum which is assumed to be bandlimited, is the spectrum of the sampled signal, and is a timing delay. Since for by design, the above expression reduces to Thus the FSE compensates for the channel distortion in the received signal before aliasing effects occur due to symbol rate sampling. In addition, the equalizer with transfer function can compensate for any timing delay , i.e., for any arbitrary timing phase. In effect, the fractionally spaced equalizer incorporates the functions of matched filtering and equalization into a single filter structure.</p><p>The FSE output is sampled at the symbol rate and has a spectrum Its tap coefficients may be adaptively adjusted once per symbol as in a -spaced equalizer. There is no improvement in convergence rate by making adjustments at the input sampling rate of the FSE. Results by Qureshi and Forney <ref type="bibr" target="#b504">[497]</ref> and Gitlin and Weinstein <ref type="bibr" target="#b464">[457]</ref> demonstrate the effectiveness of the FSE relative to a symbol rate equalizer in channels where the channel response is unknown.</p><p>In the implementation of the DFE, the feedforward filter should be fractionally spaced, e.g., -spaced taps, and its length should span the total anticipated channel dispersion The feedback filter has -spaced taps and its length should also span the anticipated channel dispersion <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[223]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Adaptive Algorithms and Lattice Equalizers</head><p>In linear and decision-feedback equalizers, the criterion most commonly used in the optimization of the equalizer coefficients is the minimization of the mean-square error (MSE) between the desired equalizer output and the actual equalizer output. The minimization of the MSE results in the optimum Wiener filter solution for the coefficient vector, which may be expressed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[223]</ref> (5.4.1) where is the autocorrelation matrix of the vector of signal samples in the equalizer at any given time instant and is the vector of cross correlations between the desired data symbol and the signal samples in the equalizer.</p><p>Alternatively, the minimization of the MSE may be accomplished recursively by use of the stochastic gradient algorithm introduced by Widrow and Hoff <ref type="bibr" target="#b543">[534]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b544">[535]</ref>, called the LMS algorithm. This algorithm is described by the coefficient update equation <ref type="bibr">(5.4.2)</ref> where is the vector of the equalizer coefficients at the th iteration, represents the signal vector for the signal samples stored in the equalizer at the th iteration, is the error signal, which is defined as the difference between the th transmitted symbol and its corresponding estimate at the output of the equalizer, and is the step-size parameter that controls the rate of adjustment.

For stability, , where is the largest eigenvalue of the signal covariance matrix. A choice of just below the upper limit provides rapid convergence, but it also introduces large fluctuations in the equalizer coefficients during steady-state operation. These fluctuations constitute a form of self-noise whose variance increases with an increase in Consequently, the choice of involves tradeoff between rapid convergence and the desire to keep the variance of the self-noise small <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[223]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b543">[534]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b544">[535]</ref>.</p><p>The convergence rate of the LMS algorithm is slow due to the fact that there is only a single parameter, namely , that controls the rate of adaptation. A faster converging algorithm is obtained if we employ a recursive least squares (RLS) criterion for adjustment of the equalizer coefficients. The RLS algorithm that is obtained for the minimization of the sum of exponentially weighted squared errors, i.e., may be expressed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[223]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b470">[463]</ref> (5. <ref type="bibr">4.3)</ref> where is the estimate of the th symbol at the output of the equalizer, denotes the transpose of , and</p><p>(5.4.4)</p><p>(5.4.5)</p><p>The exponential weighting factor is selected to be in the range It provides a fading memory in the estimation of the optimum equalizer coefficients.</p><p>is an square matrix which is the inverse of the data autocorrelation matrix <ref type="bibr">(5.4.6)</ref> Initially, may be selected to be proportional to the identity matrix.

We note that the difference in convergence rate is very significant. The recursive update equation for the matrix given by (5.4.5) has poor numerical properties. For this reason, other algorithms with better numerical properties have been derived which are based on a square-root factorization of as , where is a lower triangular matrix. Such algorithms are called square-root RLS algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b470">[463]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b450">[443]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Equalization of Interference in Multiuser Communication Systems</head><p>Adaptive equalizers are also effective in suppressing interference from other users of the channel. The interference may be in the form of either interchannel interference (ICI), or cochannel interference (CCI), or both. ICI frequently arises in multiple-access communication systems that employ either FDMA or TDMA. CCI is generally present in communication systems that employ CDMA, as in the IS-95 digital cellular system, as well as in FDMA or TDMA cellular systems that employ frequency reuse.</p><p>Verdú and many others <ref type="bibr" target="#b535">[527]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b536">[528]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b528">[521]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b532">[525]</ref> have done extensive research into various types of equalizers/detectors and their performance for multiuser systems employing CDMA. In a CDMA system, the channel is shared by simultaneous users. Each user is assigned a signature waveform of duration , where is the symbol interval. A signature waveform may be expressed as <ref type="bibr">(5.5.1)</ref> where is a pseudo-noise (PN) code sequence consisting of chips that take values is a pulse of duration and is the chip interval. Thus we have chips per symbol and The transmitted signal waveform from the th user may be expressed as <ref type="bibr">(5.5.2)</ref> where represents the sequence of information symbols, is the signal amplitude, and is the signal delay of the th user. The total transmitted signal for the users is</p><p>(5.5.3)</p><p>In the forward channel of a CDMA system, i.e., the transmission from the base station to the mobile receivers, the signals for all the users are transmitted synchronously, Hence, the delays As indicated in Section II, a frequency-selective fading multipath channel, which is modeled as a tapped delay line with time-varying tap coefficients, has an impulse response of the form <ref type="bibr">(5.5.4)</ref> where the denote the (complex-valued) amplitudes of the resolvable multipath components at the receiver of the th user of the channel, is the number of resolvable multipath components, and are the propagation delays. For this channel model, the signal received by the th mobile receiver in the forward channel may be expressed as <ref type="bibr">(5.5.5)</ref> where represents the additive noise in the received signal. We observe that the received signal consists of the desired signal component, which is corrupted by the channel multipath, and channel-corrupted signals for the other channel users. The latter is usually called multiple-access interference (MAI).</p><p>An expression similar to (5.5.5) holds for the signal received at the base station from the transmissions of the users. The optimum multiuser receiver for the received signal given by (5.5.5) recovers the data symbols by use of the maximum-likelihood (ML) criterion. However, in the presence of multipath and multiuser interference, the computational complexity of the optimum receiver grows exponentially with the number of users. As a consequence, the focus of practical receiver design has been on suboptimum receivers whose computational complexity is significantly lower. The so-called "decorrelating detector" is a suboptimum receiver that is basically a linear type of equalizer which forces the CCI from other users in a CDMA system to zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b536">[528]</ref>. The complete elimination of CCI among all the users of the channel is achieved at the expense of enhancing the power in the additive noise at the output of the equalizer. Another type of linear equalizer for mitigating the CCI in a CDMA system is based on the minimization of the mean-square error (MSE) between the equalizer outputs and the desired symbols <ref type="bibr" target="#b546">[537]</ref>. By minimizing the total MSE, which includes the additive noise and CCI, one obtains a proper balance between these two errors and, as a consequence, the additive noise enhancement is lower.</p><p>In general, better performance against ISI and CCI in CDMA systems is achieved by employing a decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) in place of a linear equalizer. A number of papers have been published which illustrate the effectiveness of the DFE in combatting such interference. As examples of this work, we cite the papers by Falconer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b459">[452]</ref>, Abdulrahman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b445">[438]</ref>, and Duel Hallen <ref type="bibr" target="#b458">[451]</ref>.</p><p>The use of adaptive DFE's in TDMA and FDMA digital cellular systems have also been considered in the literature.

Poor and Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b501">[494]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b502">[495]</ref> developed an algorithm based on the linear minimum MSE (MMSE) criterion for multiuser detection which is effective in suppressing both NBI and MAI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Iterative Interference Cancellation</head><p>In any multiple-access communication system, if the interference from other users is known at each of the user receivers, such interference can be subtracted from the received signal, thus leaving only the desired user's signal for detection. This basic approach, which is generally called interference cancellation is akin to the cancellation of the ISI from previously detected symbols in a DFE.</p><p>The idea of interference cancellation has been applied to the cancellation of MAI in CDMA systems. Basically, each receiver detects the symbols of every user, regenerates (remodulates) the users' signals, and subtracts them from the received signal to obtain the desired signal for the intended user.</p><p>The successive interference canceler (SIC) begins by acquiring and detecting the sequence of the strongest signal among the signals that it receives. Thus the strongest signal is regenerated and subtracted from the received signal. Once the strongest signal is canceled, the detector detects the symbol sequence of the second strongest signal. From this detected symbol sequence, the corresponding signal is regenerated and subtracted out. The procedure continues until all the MAI is canceled. When all the users are detected and canceled, a residual interference usually exists. This residual MAI may be used to perform a second stage of cancellation. This basic method of interference cancellation was investigated by Varanasi and Aazhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b529">[522]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b530">[523]</ref> where they derived a multistage detector in which hard decisions are used to detect the symbols in the intermediate stages. Instead of hard decisions, one may employ soft decisions as proposed by Kechriotis and Manolakos <ref type="bibr" target="#b474">[467]</ref>. Recently, Müller and Huber <ref type="bibr" target="#b491">[484]</ref> have proposed an improvement in which an adaptive detector is employed that adapts to the decreasing interference power during the iterations. Such cancelers are called iterative soft-decision interference cancelers (ISDIC).</p><p>A major problem with the SIC or the ISDIC methods for MAI cancellation is the delay inherent in the implementation of the canceler. Furthermore, as with the DFE, the SIC and ISDIC are prone to error propagation, especially if there are symbol errors that occur in the detection of the strong users.</p><p>The problems of the detection delay in SIC or ISDIC may be alleviated to some extent by devising methods that perform parallel interference cancellation (PIC), as described by Patel and Holtzman <ref type="bibr" target="#b495">[488]</ref> and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b452">[445]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b472">[465]</ref>.</p><p>The use of iterative methods for MAI cancellation and detection are akin to iterative methods for decoding turbo codes. Therefore, it is not surprising that these approaches have merged in some recent publications <ref type="bibr" target="#b465">[458]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b488">[481]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b507">[500]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b550">[541]</ref>.</p></div>

Spatio-Temporal Equalization in Multiuser Communications</head><p>Multiple antennas provide additional degrees of freedom for suppressing ISI, CCI, and ICI. In general, the spatial dimension allows us to separate signals in multiple-access communication systems, thus reducing CCI and ICI. A communication system that uses multiple antennas at the transmitter and/or the receiver may be viewed as a multichannel communication system.</p><p>Multiple antennas at the transmitter allow the user to focus the transmitted signal in a desired direction and, thus, obtain antenna gain and a reduction in CCI and ICI in areas off from the desired direction. Similarly, multiple antennas at the receiver allow the user to receive signals from desired directions and suppress unwanted signals, i.e., CCI and ICI, arriving from directions other than the desired directions. The use of multiple antennas also provides signal diversity and, thus, reduces the effect of signal fading.</p><p>Numerous papers have been published on the use multiple antennas for wireless communications. We cite a few representative papers below. For additional references, the reader may refer to the paper by Paulraj and Lindskog <ref type="bibr" target="#b496">[489]</ref>, which provides a taxonomy for space-time processing in wireless communication system. Tidestav et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b523">[516]</ref>, analyzed the performance of a multichannel DFE that performs combined temporal and spatial equalization, where the multiple antenna elements may be either at the base-station receiver or at the mobile receiver. The performance of the multichannel DFE was evaluated when the signal has a time slot structure similar to that of the GSM digital cellular system. In this paper, the performance of the multichannel DFE was also evaluated when used for multiuser detection in an asynchronous CDMA system with Rayleigh fading. The paper by Lindskog et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b477">[470]</ref> also treats the use of a multichannel DFE to equalize signals in an antenna array for a TDMA system.</p><p>Ratnavel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b508">[501]</ref> investigate space-time equalization for GSM digital cellular systems based on the mean-square-error (MSE) criterion for optimizing the coefficients of the linear equalizer. Viterbi detection is employed for the ISI in the received signal.</p><p>Spatio-temporal equalization has also proved to be effective in digital communications through underwater acoustic channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b516">[509]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b518">[511]</ref>. The underwater acoustic communication channel is a severely time-spread channel with ISI that spans many symbols. Due to the large delay spread, the only practical type of equalizer that has proved to be effective is the DFE. In such channels, spatial diversity is generally available through the use of multiple hydrophones at the receiver. In the case where a hydroplane array consists of a relatively large number of hydrophones, e.g., greater than five, Stojanovic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b518">[511]</ref> demonstrated that a mutichannel DFE is especially effective in improving the performance of the receiver. In this paper, a reduced complexity receiver is described which consists of a many-to-few to , where precombiner followed by a -channel DFE. The precombiner is akin to a beamformer. The performance of the receiver is evaluated on experimental underwater acoustic data. The experimental results demonstrate the capability of the adaptive receiver to fully exploit the spatial variability of the multipath in the channel while keeping the system complexity to a minimum, thus allowing the efficient use of large hydrophone arrays.</p><p>Many other papers published in the literature treat spatiotemporal equalization of wireless channels. As examples, we cite the references <ref type="bibr" target="#b528">[521]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b532">[525]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H. Blind Equalization</head><p>In most applications where channel equalizers are used to suppress intersymbol interference, a known training sequence is transmitted to the receiver for the purpose of initially adjusting the equalizer coefficients. However, there are some applications, such as multipoint communication networks, where it is desirable for the receiver to synchronize to the received signal and to adjust the equalizer without having a known training sequence available. Equalization techniques based on initial adjustment of the equalizer coefficients without the benefit of a training sequence are said to be self-recovering or blind. It should be emphasized here that informationtheoretic arguments address this situation in a natural setting of unavailable CSI. In general, the optimal information-theoretic approach does not depend on explicit extraction of CSI. Suboptimal, robust practical methods do however resort to algorithms which address explicitly the extraction of CSI, with or without the aid of training sequences.</p><p>There are basically three different classes of adaptive blindequalization algorithms that have been developed over the past 25 years. One class of algorithms is based on the method of steepest descent for adaptation of the equalizer coefficients. Sato's paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b510">[503]</ref> appears to be first published paper on blind equalization of PAM signals based on the method of steepest descent. Subsequently, Sato's work was generalized to two-dimensional (QAM) and multidimensional signal constellations in the papers by Godard <ref type="bibr" target="#b556">[548]</ref>, Benveniste and Goursat <ref type="bibr" target="#b449">[442]</ref>, Sato <ref type="bibr" target="#b557">[549]</ref>, Foschini <ref type="bibr" target="#b462">[455]</ref>, Picchi and Prati <ref type="bibr" target="#b498">[491]</ref>, and Shalvi and Weinstein <ref type="bibr" target="#b514">[507]</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">13</ref> illustrates the basic structure of a linear blind equalizer whose coefficients are adjusted based on a steepest descent algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[223]</ref>. The sampled input sequence to the equalizer is denoted as and its output is a sequence of estimates of the information symbols, denoted by For simplicity, we assume that the transmitted sequence of information symbols is binary, i.e.,</p><p>The output of the equalizer is passed through a memoryless nonlinear device whose output is the sequence</p><p>The sequence serves the role of the "desired symbols" and is used to generate an error signal, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">13</ref>, for use in the LMS algorithm for adjusting the equalizer coefficients. The basic difference among the class of steepest descent algorithms is in the choice of the memoryless nonlinearity for generating </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>the sequence</head><p>The most widely used algorithm in practice is the Godard algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b556">[548]</ref>, sometimes also called the constant-modulus algorithm (CMA). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">14</ref> shows a block diagram of Godard's scheme which includes carrier phase tracking.</p><p>It is apparent from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">13</ref> that the steepest descent algorithms are simple to implement, since they are basically LMStype algorithms. As such, their basic limitation is their relative slow convergence. Consequently, their use in equalization of fading multipath channels is limited to extremely slow fading channels.</p><p>A second class of blind equalization algorithms is based on the use of second-order and higher order (usually, fourthorder) statistics of the received signal to estimate the channel characteristics and, then, to determine the equalizer coefficients based on the channel estimate.</p><p>It is well known that second-order statistics (autocorrelation) of the received signal sequence provide information on the magnitude of the channel characteristics, but not on the phase. However, this statement is not correct if the autocorrelation function of the received signal is periodic, as in the case for a digitally modulated signal. In such a case, it is possible to obtain a measurement of the amplitude and the phase of the channel response from the received signal. This cyclostationarity property of the received signal forms the basis for channel estimation algorithms devised by Tong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b524">[517]</ref>.</p><p>It is also possible to estimate the channel response from the received signal by using higher order statistical methods. In particular, the impulse response of a linear discrete timeinvariant system can be obtained explicitly from cumulants of the received signal, provided that the channel input is non-Gaussian, as is the case when the information sequence is discrete and white. Based on this model, a simple method for estimating the channel impulse response from the received signal using fourth-order cumulants was devised by Giannakis and Hendel <ref type="bibr" target="#b463">[456]</ref>.</p><p>Another approach based on higher order statistics is due to Hatzinakos and Nikias <ref type="bibr" target="#b467">[460]</ref>. They have introduced the first polyspectra-based adaptive blind-equalization method, named the tricepstrum equalization algorithm (TEA). This method estimates the channel magnitude and phase response by using the complex cepstrum of the fourth-order cumulants (tricepstrum) of the received signal sampled sequence From the fourth-order cumulants, TEA separately reconstructs the minimum-phase and maximum-phase characteristics of the channel. The channel equalizer coefficients are then computed from the measured channel characteristics.</p><p>By separating the channel estimation from the channel equalization of the received signal, it is possible to use any type of equalizer to suppress the ISI, i.e., either a linear equalizer or a nonlinear equalizer. The major disadvantage with the class of algorithms based on higher order statistics is the large amount of data required and the inherent computational comlpexity involved in the estimation of the higher order moments (cumulants) of the received signal. Consequently, these algorithms are not generally applicable to fading multipath channels, unless the channel time variations are extremely slow.</p><p>More recently, a third class of blind-equalization algorithms based on the maximum-likelihood (ML) criterion have been developed. To describe the characteristics of the ML-based blind-equalization algorithms, it is convenient to use the discrete-time channel model described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[223]</ref>. The output of this channel model with ISI is <ref type="bibr">(5.8.1)</ref> where are the equivalent discrete-time channel coefficients, represents the information sequence, and is a white Gaussian noise sequence.</p><p>For a block of received data points, the (joint) probability density function (pdf) of the received data vector conditioned on knowing the impulse response vector and the data vector is (5.8.2)</p><p>Blind-equalization algorithms have also been developed for CDMA systems in which intersymbol interference (ISI) is present in the received signal in addition to MAI. Wang and Poor <ref type="bibr" target="#b538">[530]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b542">[533]</ref> have developed a subspace-based blind method for joint suppression of ISI and MAI for timedispersive CDMA channels. The time-dispersive CDMA channel is first formulated as a multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) system. Based on this formulation and using the signature sequences of the users, the impulse response of each user's channel is identified by using a subspace method. From knowledge of the measured channel response and the identified signal subspace parameters, both the decorrelating (zeroforcing) multiuser detector and the linear MMSE multiuser detector can be constructed. The data is detected by passing the received signal through one or the other of these detectors. Other methods for performing blind multiuser detection have been developed by Honig et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b468">[461]</ref>, Madhow <ref type="bibr" target="#b469">[462]</ref>, Talwar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b521">[514]</ref>, van de Veen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b533">[526]</ref>, Miyajima et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b489">[482]</ref>, Juntti <ref type="bibr" target="#b473">[466]</ref> and Paulraj et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b497">[490]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Concluding Remarks</head><p>In this section we have provided an overview of equalization techniques applied to fading dispersive channels. Of current interest is the use of equalizers for suppressing interference in multiuser systems and in time-varying channels. In view of the widespread developments in wireless communication systems, research on new adaptive equalization methods will continue to be an active area. The information-theoretic arguments provided before yield clear indications about the preferred coding/decoding method to be used in an effort to approach ultimate performance in a fading time-varying environment. Coding is the central ingredient in those schemes. Equalization, and in particular simple equalization algorithms, constitutes a practical method to cope with the frequency and time multiple user varying environment. In that respect, equalization, coding, and modulation should be inherently approached in a unified framework. This does not necessarily imply an increase in complexity that could not be handled in practice. This fact is documented by recent work which mostly resorts to iterative algorithms, and in which the coding part is inherent within the equalization process itself (which may cope also with multiuser interference). See <ref type="bibr" target="#b465">[458]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b488">[481]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b507">[500]</ref>, as well as <ref type="bibr" target="#b550">[541]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">[194]</ref> for some selected (and not necessarily representative) references to this area, which recently happened to be at focus of advanced research, and produced so far dozens of papers, not cited here. Although in the present section we have not addressed coding explicitly, it is important to realize that in efficient communication methods that strive for the optimum when operating on fading channels, coding and equalization are not to be treated separately, but intimately combined, as indeed is motivated by informationtheoretic insight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper we have reviewed some information-theoretic features of digital communications over fading channels. After describing the statistical models of fading channels which are frequently used in the analysis and design of communication systems, we have focused our attention on the information theory of fading channels, by emphasizing capacity as the most important performance measure and examining both singleuser and multiuser transmission. Code design and equalization techniques were finally described.</p><p>The research trends in this area have been exhibiting a blessed, mutually productive interaction of theory and practice. On one hand, information-theoretic analyses provide insight or even sorts out the preferred techniques for implementation. On the other hand, practical constraints and applications supply the underlying models to be studied via information-theoretic techniques. A relevant example of this is the recent emergence of practical successive interference cancellation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">[194]</ref>, and references therein) as well as equalization and decoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b457">[450]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b507">[500]</ref> via iterative methods . These methods demonstrate remarkable performance in the multiple-access channel, and a deeper information-theoretic approach accounting for the basic ingredients of this procedure is called for (though not expected to be simple if the iterative procedure is also to be captured). To conclude, we hope that in this partly tutorial exposition we have managed to show to some extent the beauty and the relevance to practice of the information-theoretic framework as applied to the wide class of time-varying fading channels. We also hope that in a small way this overview will help to attract interest to information-theoretic considerations and to the many intriguing open problems remaining in this field.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

In Seshardi's GVA, the search is identical to the conventional VA from the beginning up to the stage of the trellis, i.e., up to the point where the received sequence has been processed. Hence, up to the stage, an exhaustive search is performed. Associated with each data sequence , there is a corresponding channel estimate From this stage on, the search is modified, to retain surviving sequences and associated channel estimates per state instead of only one sequence per state. Thus the GVA is used for processing the receivedsignal sequence</p><p>The channel estimate is updated recursively at each stage using the LMS algorithm to further reduce the computational complexity. Simulation results given in the paper by Seshradri <ref type="bibr" target="#b513">[506]</ref> indicate that this GVA blind-equalization algorithm performs rather well at moderate signal-to-noise ratio with Hence, there is a modest increase in the computational complexity of the GVA compared with that for the conventional VA. However, there are additional computations involved with the estimation and updating of the channel estimates associated with each of the surviving data estimates.</p><p>An alternative joint estimation algorithm that avoids the least squares computation for channel estimation has been devised by Zervas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b548">[539]</ref>. In this algorithm, the order for performing the joint minimization of the performance index is reversed. That is, a channel impulse response, say , is selected and then the conventional VA is used to find the optimum sequence for this channel impulse response. Then, we may modify in some manner to and repeat the optimization over the data sequences</p><p>Based on this general approach, Zervas developed a new ML blind-equalization algorithm, which is called a quantizedchannel algorithm. The algorithm operates over a grid in the channel space, which becomes finer and finer by using the ML criterion to confine the estimated channel in the neighborhood of the original unknown channel. This algorithm leads to an efficient parallel implementation, and its storage requirements are only those of the VA.</p></div>			</div>
