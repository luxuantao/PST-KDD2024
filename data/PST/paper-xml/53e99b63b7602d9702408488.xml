<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We study a discrete-time version of Markowitz's mean-variance portfolio selection problem where the market parameters depend on the market mode (regime) that jumps among a finite number of states. The random regime switching is delineated by a finite-state Markov chain, based on which a discrete-time Markov modulated portfolio selection model is presented. Such models either arise from multiperiod portfolio selections or result from numerical solution of continuous-time problems.</p><p>The natural connections between discrete-time models and their continuous-time counterpart are revealed. Since the Markov chain frequently has a large state space, to reduce the complexity, an aggregated process with smaller state-space is introduced and the underlying portfolio selection is formulated as a two-time-scale problem. We prove that the process of interest yields a switching diffusion limit using weak convergence methods. Next, based on the optimal control of the limit process obtained from our recent work, we devise portfolio selection strategies for the original problem and demonstrate their asymptotic optimality.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>M ARKOWITZ'S Nobel-prize winning mean-variance portfolio selection model (for a single period) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> provides a foundation of modern finance theory; it has inspired numerous extensions and applications. The Markowitz model aims to maximize the terminal wealth, in the mean time to minimize the risk using the variance as a criterion, which enables investors to seek highest return upon specifying their acceptable risk level.</p><p>There have been continuing efforts in extending portfolio selection from the static single period model to dynamic multiperiod or continuous-time models. However, the research works on dynamic portfolio selections have been dominated by those of maximizing expected utility functions of the terminal wealth, G. Yin is with the Department of Mathematics, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48202 USA (e-mail: gyin@math.wayne.edu).</p><p>X. Y. Zhou is with the Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong (e-mail: xyzhou@se.cuhk.edu.hk).</p><p>Digital Object Identifier 10.1109/TAC.2004.824479</p><p>which is in spirit different from the original Markowitz's model. For example, the multiperiod utility models were investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, among many others. As for the continuous-time case, the famous Merton paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> studied a utility maximization problem with market factors modeled as a diffusion process (rather than as a Markov chain). Along another line, the mean-variance hedging problem was investigated by Duffie and Richardson <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and Schweizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, where an optimal dynamic strategy was sought to hedge contingent claims in an imperfect market. Optimal hedging policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> were obtained primarily based on the so-called projection theorem. Very recently, using the stochastic linear-quadratic (LQ) theory developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, Zhou and Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> introduced a stochastic LQ control framework to study the continuous-time version of the Markowitz's problem. Within this framework, they derived closed-form efficient policies (in the Markowitz sense) along with an explicit expression of the efficient frontier.</p><p>In the aforementioned references, for continuous-time formulations of mean-variance problems, stochastic differential equations and geometric Brownian motion models were used. Although such models have been used in a wide variety of situations, they have certain limitations since all the key parameters, including the interest rate and the stock appreciation/volatility rates, are assumed to be insensitive to the (very likely) drastic changes in the market. Typically, the underlying market may have many "modes" or "regimes" that switch among themselves from time to time. The market mode could reflect the state of the underlying economy, the general mood of investors in the market, and so on. For example, the market can be roughly divided as "bullish" and "bearish," while the market parameters can be quite different in the two modes. One could certainly introduce more intermediate states between the two extremes. A system, commonly referred to as the regime switching model, can be formulated as a stochastic differential equation whose coefficients are modulated by a continuous-time Markov chain. Such a model has been employed in the literature to discuss options; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Moreover, an investment-consumption model with regime switching was studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>; an optimal stock selling rule for a Markov-modulated Black-Scholes model was derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>; a stochastic approximation approach for the liquidation problem could be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, we treated the continuous-time version of Markowitz's mean-variance portfolio selection with regime switching and derived the efficient portfolio and efficient frontier explicitly.</p><p>Motivated by the recent developments of mean-variance portfolio selection and Markov-modulated geometric Brownian motion formulation, we develop a class of discrete-time meanvariance portfolio selection models and reveal their relationship with the continuous-time counterparts in this paper. The discrete-time case is as important as the continuous-time one. First, frequently, one needs to deal with multiperiod, discrete-time Markowitz's portfolio selection problems directly; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> for a recent account on the topic, in which efficient strategies were derived together with the efficient frontier. In addition, to simulate a continuous-time model, one often has to use a discretization technique leading to a discrete-time problem formulation. In this paper, however, one of the main features of the problem to be tackled is that all the market coefficients are modulated by a discrete-time Markov chain that has a finite state-space.</p><p>Owing to the presence of long-term and short-term investors, the movements of a capital market can be divided into primary movement and secondary movement naturally leading to two-time scales. Besides, with various economic factors such as trends of the market, interest rates, and business cycles being taken into consideration, the state space of the Markov chain, representing the totality of the possible market modes, is often large. If we simply treated each possible mode as an individual one distinct from all others, the size of the problem would be huge. A straightforward implementation of numerical schemes may deem to be infeasible due to the curse of dimensionality. It is thus crucial to find a viable alternative. To reduce the complexity, we observe that the transition rates among different states could be quite different. In fact, there is certain hierarchy (in terms of the magnitude of the transition rates) involved. Therefore, it is possible to lump many states at a similar hierarchical level together to form a big "state." With this aggregated Markov chain, the size of the state-space is substantially reduced. Now, to highlight the different rates of changes, we introduce a small parameter into the transition matrix, resulting in a singular perturbation formulation. Based on the recent progress on two-time-scale Markov chains (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>), we establish the natural connection between the discrete-time problem and its continuous-time limit. Under simple conditions, we show that suitably interpolated processes converge weakly to their limits leading to a continuous-time mean-variance portfolio selection problem with regime switching. The limit mean-variance portfolio selection problem has an optimal solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> that can be obtained in a very simple way under appropriate conditions. Using that solution, we design policies that are asymptotically optimal. Our findings indicate that in lieu of examining the more complex original problem, we could use the much simplified limit problem as a guide to obtain portfolio selection policies that are nearly as good as the optimal one from a practical concern. The advantage is that the complexity is much reduced.</p><p>We remark that although the specific mean-variance portfolio selection is treated in this paper, the formulation and techniques can be generally employed as well in the so-called hybrid control problems that are modulated by a Markov chain for many other applications.</p><p>The rest of this paper is arranged as follows. Section II begins with the formulation of the discrete-time mean-variance portfolio selection problem. Section III proceeds with some preliminary results concerning two-time-scale Markov chains and introduces an auxiliary process. Section IV is devoted to weak convergence analysis, in which we establish the natural connection between the discrete-time and continuous-time models aiming at reducing the complexity of the underlying systems. Section V constructs policies that are based on optimal control of the limit problem and derives asymptotic optimal strategy via the constructed controls. Section VI extends the results by allowing the Markov chain to be nonhomogeneous and/or including transient states. Section VII concludes paper with additional remarks. To make the paper more accessible, a couple of long and technical proofs are placed in the Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. FORMULATION</head><p>Suppose that is a fixed positive real number and that is a small parameter. Working with discrete time , we consider , where denotes the integer part of a real number . For ease of presentation, in what follows, we suppress the floor function notation whenever there is no confusion. All the random variables/processes in this paper are defined on a given complete probability space . Consider a market model as follows. Let denote the collection of different market modes. Let , for , be a discrete-time Markov chain, which is parameterized by , with the state-space . Suppose that there are assets in the underlying market. One of which is the bond and the rest of them are the stock holdings. Use to denote the price of the bond, and , , to denote the prices of the stocks at time , respectively. (Note that here does not represent the calendar time; it is the iteration time at which the systems dynamics are updated. The calendar time is .) Corresponding to a market mode , let be the interest rate, and and the appreciation rates and volatility rates of the stocks, respectively, where , , for , are given functions. For each , denote</p><p>(1) Then, under the so-called multiplicative model, the asset prices satisfy the following system of equations:</p><p>(</p><p>where , are sequences of independent and identically distributed random variables. Note that the multiplicative model adopted above is analogous to the geometric Brownian motion model in continuous time, which ensures the nonnegativity of the stock prices. (3) This model does not necessarily produce nonnegative stock prices. However, as demonstrated in <ref type="bibr">[15, p. 311</ref>], the two models are essentially the same in terms of approximating the stock price process.</p><p>Suppose that at time , an investor with an initial endowment holds shares of the th asset, , during the time interval . His or her total wealth at time is for . Now for a self-financed portfolio (i.e., no infusion or withdrawal of funds during the indicated time interval), the difference in total wealth between two consecutive times is purely due to the change in the prices of the stocks (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[11, p. 6</ref>. eq. (2.2)]). Therefore, we have (</p><p>(5)</p></div>

This is because, by (4), we have Therefore Hence, the wealth process is completely determined by the allocation of wealth among the stocks (excluding the bond). We call an admissible wealth-portfolio pair, and denote the class of admissible wealthportfolio pairs by . The objective of the discrete-time mean-variance portfolio selection problem is to find an admissible portfolio , for an initial wealth and an initial market mode , such that the terminal wealth is for a given , and the risk in terms of the variance of the terminal wealth, , is minimized. That is subject to: (6)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PRELIMINARY RESULTS</head><p>Our effort in what follows is to obtain a limit problem of (6) as . The idea comes from aggregation of the Markovian states to reduce the complexity of the underlying system via a hierarchical approach. To proceed, we make the following assumptions. The first one is on the transition matrix of the Markov chain, the second one concerns about the interest rate of the bond, and the stock appreciation and volatility rates, and the last one is a condition on the exogenous noise . A1) The transition matrix of the discrete-time Markov chain is given by ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) (8) such that for are transition matrices, and is a generator (i.e., for and for each</p><p>). Moreover, are irreducible and aperiodic. A2) For each , are real-valued continuous functions defined on . A3) For each is a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables that are independent of and that have mean 0 and variance 1. Moreover, for , and are independent. Remark 3.1: The rationale for A1) is that among the transition rates of the Markovian states, some of them vary rapidly and others change slowly. Decomposing the state space in accordance with these transition rates, we can write the state-space as <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> where . Since in a finite-state Markov chain, there is at least one recurrent state (not all states can be transient), and there is no null-recurrent state, the irreducibility implies that there are ergodic classes of states. Each of the transition matrix is responsible for the rapid transitions, whereas the generator governs the slow transitions from one ergodic class to another. The transition matrix given in (7) with specified in (8) has the so-called nearly completely decomposable structure. It arises from many discrete-time control and optimization problems, or from discretization of a continuous-time problem; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and the references therein.</p><p>On the other hand, Condition A3) indicates that the sequences are the so-called white noise. Under this condition, the Donsker's invariance principle <ref type="bibr">[2, p. 137</ref>] implies that converges weakly to a Brownian motion as . For definition, discussion, and basic results on weak convergence, we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In fact, correlated noise may also be dealt with. What is essential is a functional central limit theorem as mentioned before holds for the scaled sequence. Sufficient conditions guaranteeing the convergence, for example, for -mixing processes are available. However, assumption A3) allows us to simplify much of the discussion in what follows.</p><p>Due to the various considerations, the state space is large. That is, is a large number. In solving the portfolio selection problem, we aggregate the states in each of the recurrent class into one state, resulting in an aggregated process having only states. If , the possible number of configurations is substantially smaller for the aggregated process. In practice, we typically merge all the similar states into one "big" state. For example, we can put all the states together where the market is generally up (respectively, down) to form a "bullish" (respectively, "bearish") mode of the market. Our effort in what follows is to show that suitably interpolated processes of the prices converge to limit processes that are switching diffusions, and to establish the connection between the discrete-time and continuous-time portfolio selection problems. Using the optimal strategy of the limit problem, which was obtained explicitly in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, enables us to construct an asymptotically optimal strategy for the original problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Singularly Perturbed Markov Chains</head><p>To carry out the analysis, define an aggregated discrete-time process by if . Next, define the interpolated processes of the stock/bond price processes, the aggregated process, and admissible wealth-portfolio pairs as follows: For <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> That is, they are all piecewise constant on the interval of length . We will obtain the weak convergence of the interpolated processes. Before proceeding further, we present some preliminary results.</p><p>Lemma 3.2: Assume condition A1).

For the subsequent analysis, it is more convenient to work with an auxiliary additive model. To do so, we retain the definition of , and define auxiliary processes for as: and</p><p>where is given by (1). In terms of the processes , the price for the th stock can be written as (17) Similar to the interpolation , define the interpolated processes (18) It is easily seen that . That is, is related to the interpolation of through the exponential function.</p><p>To obtain the convergence of , we utilize the auxiliary process . We first show that converges weakly to certain limit process, in which the appreciation and volatility rates are averaged out with respect to the stationary measures of the corresponding Markov chains. Then, by using a well-known continuous mapping theorem [2, Th. 5.2, p. 31], we obtain the desired result.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. WEAK CONVERGENCE</head><p>This section is devoted to the weak convergence of interpolated processes and .

Select such convergent subsequences (still indexed by for notational simplicity) with limits and , respectively. By virtue of the Skorohod representation [12, p. 29], we may assume without loss of generality that and converge to and , respectively, with probability one (w.p. 1), and that they converge uniformly on any compact time interval.</p></div>

Applying Itô's formula to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> and noticing the relations (1) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, we obtain the desired result. Now, we define the (continuous-time) limit problem of mean-variance portfolio selection. Denote by the -algebra generated by , where . A control is admissible for the limit problem if is -adapted and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> has a unique solution corresponding to .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. EXTENSIONS</head><p>We have demonstrated the natural connections of the discrete-time model and its continuous-time counterpart for the Markowitz's mean-variance portfolio selection problems under the premise that the modulating Markov chain is time homogeneous. In this section, we extend the results to time inhomogeneous Markov chains, which entail the time-dependent transition matrices. To proceed, we first recall the definition of weak irreducibility. Definition 6.1: Suppose that is a discrete-time Markov chain with a finite state-space and (timedependent) transition probability matrices . The Markov chain (or the transition matrix) is said to be weakly irreducible if for each , the system of equations ( <ref type="formula">38</ref>) has a unique solution and for each .

It allows the transition matrices and the quasistationary measures to be time dependent. In addition, some of the components could be 0. Using Definition 6.1, we modify the argument used in the previous sections, and extend the results to include time-dependent transition probabilities.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS</head><p>This paper has been devoted to a class of dynamic Markowitz's mean-variance portfolio selection problems. Taking into consideration market trend and other factors, a discrete-time model that is modulated by a Markov chain was introduced. Aiming at complexity reduction, we use nearly completely decomposable transition matrices and weak convergence methods to derive the limit mean-variance portfolio selection problem. Based on the limit, we can design optimal (efficient) portfolios and derive efficient frontier <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> (see also the framework of LQ control with indefinite control weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>). Then using the efficient portfolios of the limit problem, we constructed portfolios for the original discrete-time model and show that such portfolios are nearly efficient.</p><p>In Section VI, we assumed the smoothness of the transition functions in A1') and A1"). Such a condition can be relaxed if we work with convergence of the probability vector and the transition probability matrices under the weak topology of . The associated weak convergence and the limit systems can still be obtained. As far as the limit mean-variance problem is concerned, for the cases discussed in Section VI, due to the time-dependent generator (the nonhomogeneity), the corresponding limit problem is more difficult to handle. However, we can still obtain near optimality if we use a " -optimal" portfolio policy for the limit problem. Based on such a -optimal policy, we can construct portfolios that are nearly optimal for the original problem. The statement of (34) is changed to . This paper has been devoted to a discrete-time model. In fact, one may use the weak convergence method to treat a continuous-time mean-variance portfolio problem where is a continuous-time singularly perturbed Markov chain generated by . The use of the singularly perturbed Markov chain again comes from the motivation of reduction of complexity. As shown in [24, §2.2, p. 840], such a continuous-time Markov chain has an associated discrete-time chain whose transition matrix has the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. Thus, the problem treated in this paper can be thought of as a discretization of the continuous-time problem given previously.</p><p>It should be noted that in our model the wealth of an agent is allowed to become and remain negative. Prohibition of bankruptcy renders the problem one with state constraint, which remains an interesting yet challenging open problem.</p><p>Finally, we remark that although the formulation and motivation in this paper stem from mean-variance portfolio selection problems, the techniques used and the methods of solutions are not restricted to financial engineering applications. They can also be employed in other hybrid control problems modulated by a singularly perturbed Markov chain.</p></div>
