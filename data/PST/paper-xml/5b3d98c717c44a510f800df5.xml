<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>According to ISO/IED 27000 standard [1], an attack in the context of computer networks is defined as an "attempt to destroy, expose, alter, disable, steal or gain unauthorized access to or make unauthorized use of an asset". This definition is broad enough to englobe any malicious intent against a network asset. However, the term attack is popularly identified to an individual malicious action. For instance, we speak of SQL Injection attacks or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, where just one action, possibly repeated, is required to threaten the system. We can call them single-step attacks.</p><p>However, advanced attackers follow a step-by-step method in their attempts to attack a system. There are two reasons to proceed in this way. First, the victims chosen by advanced attackers are usually medium or big organisations, with a complex network topology and different layers of security. Considering that the most important assets in terms of information value are in the less reachable areas of the network, it would be almost impossible to complete an intrusion with success using a single-step attack. Second, if the attack is decomposed in several steps, it is more stealthy and difficult to be identified by the victim, especially if some of the steps do not pose a risk to the system by themselves.</p><p>The described attacks can be called multi-step attacks or multi-stage attacks. They have evolved and become more stealthy and sophisticated. If they started as a combination of regular attacks, they have later acquired relevance and even their own names, as it it is the case of WannaCry, which created havoc in many institutions in May 2017 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>. For being able to detect multi-step attacks, we need to consider the global strategy of the attack and to highlight the causal relationship between traces collected all over the network. The sequence of traces left by the attackers often follow a logical progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>, as they are generated from a set of actions performed with a single objective. After each of the steps of the attack, the attacker gains knowledge about the target system <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref> and is able to better prepare the subsequent steps.</p><p>In this paper we present a systematic survey about multi-step attack detection methods published since the beginning of the field. Even if some seminal work about the importance of linking several events to detect an attack already existed <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref>, Huang and Wicks <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref> were probably the first ones that pointed out the importance of attack strategies in detection in 1999. The new millennium brought an awareness against this kind of attack and the analysis of the global attack strategy became important in security research. Developing mechanisms for multi-step attack detection is critical for protecting the networks, as prevention methods do not suffice. We need to have in mind that there will always be vulnerabilities in a network. If we harden all the network assets against every known vulnerability, we can loose flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>. Our interest in detection comes from this limitation. The better are the detection methods, the lower is the risk of having vulnerabilities in the network assets. This challenge is specially hard to solve when attacks are complex and composed of different steps. The aim of this survey is to collect, explain and put in context the detection methods developed specifically against multi-step attacks.</p><p>Through a systematic bibliographic research, we have ended up with a selection of 181 publications, which constitutes what we call the corpus of this survey. It reflects the published results of 119 different multi-step attack detection methods. Some other publications that are also relevant for multi-step attack detection but that do not propose a specific detection method are mentioned as well. We only consider for the selected corpus the methods aiming to detect real traces of attacks, not the ones hypothesising about possible attack paths on a network. Moreover, we are only interested in the methods considering the whole attack scenario as an ensemble of the individual steps. We have not found previous surveys considering this point of view. There is some work related to correlation of alerts <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9]</ref> or situational awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>, but they do not focus on the multi-step nature of current attacks, the object of study we are interested in. We have also identified some work about specific types of multi-step attack detection methods, like sequential pattern mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref> or Hidden Markov Models (HMM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>, but not covering the whole domain.</p><p>We start this survey presenting a series of preliminary definitions in Section 2 and a list of challenges faced by multi-step attack detection in Section 3. We then explain in Section 4 the review methodology followed for the identification of the main corpus of the survey. The bibliometrics extracted from the reviewed publications are explained in Section 5. Section 6 constitutes the main part of the survey, where all the reviewed methods are classified by approach and explained. Following the review, we present in Section 7 an analysis of the state of multi-step attack detection in terms of type of data used, type and reproducibility of experiments or origin of knowledge about the attacks. We end this survey with a discussion in Section 8 and the conclusion in Section 9.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Preliminary definitions</head><p>As in every scientific domain, it is important in the field of computer security to have solid definitions of basic concepts. We present in this section the definitions of some terms extensively used in security detection. We also explain the concept of multi-step attack, the object of the detection methods considered in our study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Clarifying the use of basic terms</head><p>We need to be cautious when using basic terms in the domain of attack detection, because they can be interpreted in many different ways depending on the author. To avoid confusion, we</p><p>give here the definition of some terms as we use them. The choice is made according to the wide use of the definition in the reviewed literature and our own experience in the security industry.</p><p>• Definition 1. Event. We consider the definition given by the Standard on Logging and Monitoring published by the European Comission in 2010 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>: "an event is an identifiable action that happens on a device". Events are usually represented as plain text in a format dependent on the used technology. This materialisation of an event, a textual trace stored in the device, is called log.</p><p>• Definition 2. Packet. It is the minimal unit of data exchanged in a network communication protocol. It represents an action that happens between two or more network devices. In cybersecurity, the word network is usually preceding the term to specify the environment.</p><p>• Definition 3. Alert. Also referred to as alarm, it is an event generated by a security system in response to the detection of alleged malicious activities or faults <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. In other words, it is an indicator that something is not working as it should or that a resource is not properly used.</p><p>An alert is an event, but not all events are alerts. There exists events reporting normal functioning of systems. An alert supposes an indicator of a suspicious activity by itself and, as its name suggests, it demands the network analyst to be vigilant. Sometimes we refer to the events as "general events", when we want to emphasize that we refer to any kind of event, including alerts. Alert information is usually represented as a short message with a specific format containing details about the problem.</p><p>• Definition 4. Trace. This term is used for englobing all the indications of the execution of an action in a network, e.g. events (including alerts) or packets. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">1</ref> we show a diagram to better understand the definition of trace.</p><p>• Definition 5. IDS. This acronym stands for Intrusion Detection System and denotes a system for automatic detection of suspicious activities in an IT system. An IDS can be either network-based or host-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>. A network-based IDS monitors network traffic, while a host-based IDS analyses the activity of applications and operating systems running at endpoint level. We are interested in the aspect of an IDS as an observer and reporter of suspicious actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref> in the form of alerts, independently of the source of information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Multi-step attacks</head><p>We call multi-step attack the ensemble of steps taken by one or several attackers with a single specific objective inside the network, containing at least two distinct actions. If actions are similar between them, it cannot be considered a multi-step attack. For example, in a DDoS attack against a device or service we can find millions of packets but each of them represents a particularisation of the same type of action. We consider thus regular DDoS attacks as multi-agent single-step. We can call them distributed or coordinated attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>. We shall not confound the DDoS attack by itself with the whole process of intrusion into an organisation in order to get control over an endpoint and launch a DDoS attack from it. This last case, represented in the dataset DARPA 2000, is indeed a multi-step attack, and the DDoS attack launched against some victim external to the network is just the final step of it. Some authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18]</ref> take the liberty of calling DDoS attack to the mentioned multi-step attack, leading to confusion.</p><p>The detection methods reviewed here assume there is a relationship between two events belonging to the same attack scenario. Highlighting the links between elementary actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref> in the form of traces should be the first step to multi-step attack detection. Conditions for linking two actions can take many forms. The most used in the literature, as single conditions or in combination with others, are listed below:</p><p>• IP addresses of the actors involved in the actions are identical or in the same range.</p><p>Comparisons are made for source, destination or a combination between these two features <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15]</ref>.</p><p>• The actions are usually found together <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>.</p><p>• There is a certain time difference between the actions or they belong to a specific time window <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>.</p><p>• One action prepares for the conditions needed by the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24]</ref>.</p><p>• The type of action is the same. This is usually exploited when linking IDS alerts, where the alert attack type is considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">26]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Different ways to name multi-step attacks</head><p>Depending on the author, multi-step attacks can also be called multi-stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> or multistage <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> attacks. Some others refer to them as attack strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref>, attack plans <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>,</p><p>attack scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref> or attack sessions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>.</p><p>We consider that the term multi-step attack is the one better reflecting the difficulties faced in the detection of this type of attack, as the main challenge resides in the fact that the attack is composed of many steps which, to top it all, can be of very different nature. The most relevant characteristic is that they cannot be described by less than two atomic events <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>. The identification of these events as steps in the consecution of the attacker's objective captures well the concept.</p><p>Since the beginning of the decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>, the name Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) has been used to denote multi-step attacks that are specifically crafted against a single victim and where the access of the attacker to the target network is maintained during a long period of time.</p><p>Not every multi-step attack is an APT. As WannaCry infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref> has recently demonstrated, even global malware campaigns, that are not targeted, can be based on an attack that can be decomposed in multiple steps affecting several assets in the network.</p><p>The term APT has become somehow distorted after having been adopted by the industry and used in marketing campaigns. Moreover, a lack of rigorous definition of what an APT is <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref> makes this term valid for other contexts, as for attacks using advanced malware. Among the publications proposing a detection method using the term APT for denoting their target, we only include in the corpus of the survey the ones addressing the identification of the global strategy behind the combination of the attack steps <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Challenges in multi-step attack detection</head><p>Multi-step attacks pose many challenges to detection. Among the challenges we find, of course, all those faced by general intrusion detection. One of them is, for example, the high complexity of current network data, which makes a hard task the identification of information relevant for security. Moreover, the most dangerous attacks happen only rarely, which means that in each dataset we have only a few examples of attacks. This problem in intrusion detection research, called the Rare Data Problem, and some other statistical problems of security data, such as skewed distributions or imbalanced data sets, are further explained by Ourston et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>.</p><p>The impact of these difficulties seems even worse when multi-step attacks are considered.</p><p>For a single-step attack, all the information related to it is usually contained in a trace and linked to a vulnerability in a system. The attack can be isolated and compared with similar occurrences.</p><p>It is more difficult to study and characterise the similarity between attacks as the number of steps involved is incremented. In a multi-step attack we need to infer not only the nature of each of the step, but also the link between them. Even if we can identify the involved steps, we can still miss the attack strategy.</p><p>We briefly review here the particular challenges faced by multi-step attack detection:</p><p>• Individual steps composing a multi-step attack can seem innocuous.</p><p>• We can never assume we have access to a complete library of attack plans. This contrasts with what happens in traditional plan recognition problems where the possible actions are well defined <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>.</p><p>• A single attacker can conceive multiple attack plans <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>. Furthermore, the execution of a plan can stop just because the attacker loses interest or is not able to take advantage of the vulnerabilities in the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>.</p><p>• The detection of individual steps can be missed due to technical limitations of network devices or to how they are deployed or configured <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>.</p><p>• The chronological order of actions can become altered when they are expressed as traces.</p><p>• An attacker does not need to follow a precise order for executing a multi-step attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>, so the set of possible sequences of actions can be very complex.</p><p>• Attackers can perform actions just to avoid recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>, even if they are not coherent with the rest of actions in the plan.</p><p>• Attack scenarios have to be modelled and represented in a standard language <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">36]</ref>.</p><p>• IDS do not usually include explicit information about the root causes of a problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17]</ref>, so it is difficult to identify contextual information.</p><p>• Much of the features contained in traces are categorical, i.e. there are not predefined order and metric between the possible values. This hinders the application of mathematical methods for attack scenario construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref>.</p><p>• The interval between consecutive stages of an attack can be very high, on the order of hours, days or even months <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>.</p><p>• There are not many standard datasets for the evaluation of multi-step attack detection systems. Furthermore, public research has no access to much of the methods and datasets used by other researchers or private institutions. We shall return to this issue in Section 7.</p><p>We show in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> that many of the analysed multi-step attack detection methods use IDS alerts as a source. There are many challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9]</ref> related to the generation of IDS alerts:</p><p>• Any medium-size network generates a high volume of them. This poses a big challenge for the development of systems working in real-time.</p><p>• Alerts indicating a real threat are mixed with false positives and non-relevant ones.</p><p>• Different security systems may generate a different alert for the same action.</p><p>• If there are systems from different security vendors, the format of the alerts will not probably be the same. An unification method is required for working with the ensemble of the alerts.</p><p>• There is an important lack of clear and consistent documentation about the meaning and format of IDS alerts <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Review methodology</head><p>Our bibliographic research is based on a systematic search process inspired by Luh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>. Systematic search is a way to provide a rigorous and reproducible methodology to literature review. It requires more effort than traditional reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref> but it avoids missing relevant but not well-known publications, and that is why we have chosen it as the method for this survey. The expertise in the domain is applied in the selection of the relevant publications and in the recursive identification of references.</p><p>We start with the search of a set of keywords related with multi-step attack detection in the most relevant search engines specialised in the scientific literature on Computer Science. We select from the obtained results the publications proposing a multi-step attack detection method.</p><p>Then, we look for other publications in the references of selected ones. Additionally, we look for some other publications citing the ones found in the previous step.</p><p>In this section, we present the methodology used in the search. First, we list the set of criteria determining which work should be included and which one should be excluded. We then explain the three subsequent phases of the search: A) bulk search of keywords in several research engines, B) selection of relevant results and C) recursive search for references.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Inclusion and exclusion criteria</head><p>We establish a series of inclusion criteria to determine the work that should be included in the corpus of the survey:</p><p>• The authors present a multi-step attack detection method working on real digital traces such as events, alerts or network packets. Methods can be tested by simulation or case studies, but their main purpose should be the analysis of real data.</p><p>• The structure of the multi-step attack and the link between its steps should be considered in the detection process.</p><p>• The reference has a structure of scientific research publication.</p><p>• Methods are exposed in a clear and evident way.</p><p>• The publication is written in English and with an understandable style.</p><p>Emphasis needs to be given to the source of information for detection, composed of traces generated by the devices in the network. This excludes from the survey, therefore, all methods only based on structural and static network data, which rather belong to the domains of vulnerability analysis or risk assessment. These domains are vast and generate hypothesis about the possible paths of an attack in a network, which can be very useful in preventing further intrusions. Hypotheses are usually coded on an attack tree, an abstract representation of the network containing information about vulnerabilities affecting each asset. However, we focus our survey on detection in real time or through forensic investigation, always from the materialisation of actions in the form of traces. This include work using attack trees but always as an instrument for projection of real traces, as it is presented in Section 6.3.</p><p>We also consider a set of exclusion criteria to better identify the reason why some references are excluded. Below we present a list of the categories of publication not considered in the survey:</p><p>• Focused on multi-step attacks but not on detection. This criterion is met by references addressing multi-step attacks but not proposing a detection method. Some of them can be, for instance, about attack modelling, languages for detection, risk assessment, vulnerability analysis or application of security policies.</p><p>• Only focused on one aspect of multi-step attack detection such as dropper analysis or C&amp;C identification, among others. They only consider one network asset in the analysis, not having a global perspective for linking the different steps in the attack.</p><p>• Not about multi-step attacks at all. For example, about coordinated or distributed attacks, such as DDoS attacks, where multiple attackers may have a common objective but they do not necessarily perform multiple steps in the network. We include also here work on other security areas, such as access control, cryptography or wireless security, that can be returned by the automatic search.</p><p>• Not in English.</p><p>• About single-step attack detection.</p><p>• Not research, such as articles published in non-scientific magazines and commercial whitepapers.</p><p>• About flow-based detection, where the structure of the multi-step attacks is not revealed.</p><p>In these publications, detection is done analysing the statistical effects on traffic produced by the attack.</p><p>• Slides or posters.</p><p>• Duplicated. Documents containing exactly the same content but that were published in different places or whose reference appears twice.</p><p>• Of low quality. In the selection of the publications, we follow the position defended by Glass <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref>, who considers that a systematic survey should include all the references found in the studied domain, both good and bad ones. Anyways, as there is not a clear benchmark in multi-step attack detection and most of the publications do not offer the possibility of reproducing the experiments (see Section 7.5), it would be difficult to apply a narrow exclusion criterion based on the quality of results. However, we discard some references which are below a minimum level of quality in style, form and presentation; where:</p><p>there is not enough detail to understand how the method works, text cannot be well understood because a bad use of English or some elements taken from the work made by other authors are not properly credited.</p><p>We do not cite in this survey any of the work excluded in terms of quality. In current scientific research, number of citations is such a relevant metric in the evaluation of quality that citing work that we do not consider acceptable would do research a disservice. If the reader want more information about discarded publications, please contact the corresponding author of this survey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Phase A: Using the research engines</head><p>The objective of this first phase is to search the references conforming the starting point of the systematic bibliographical search. We need to choose a set of keywords frequently appearing in the title of publications about multi-step attack detection. We have chosen the following sets of keywords:</p><p>• From the obtained results, we just download the references related to cybersecurity. Even if the keywords used are mainly related to cybersecurity, some publications from other domains are found in the search results. For example, the acronym 'APT' can refer to concepts in Finances and Medicine.</p><p>After merging all the results coming from each of the four research engines, we end up with 432 references.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Phase B: Filtering the results</head><p>References found in Phase A are reviewed one by one. We apply the inclusion and exclusion criteria mentioned in Section 4.1 in order to only select the references proposing multi-step attack detection methods.</p><p>We follow the method proposed by Meline <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref> to generate a "bibliography of candidate studies". We apply this method in two stages. First, we eliminate the publications clearly meeting one or more exclusion criteria after reviewing titles and abstracts. Then, we read the remaining documents and we include in the survey the publications meeting all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria.</p><p>After that, we end up with just 50 references to include in the final corpus. That means we have discarded 382 references from the original search.</p><p>Excluded work and the reasons we aduce for their exclusion are important to understand the research about multi-step attacks. Because of that, we represent in the pie chart of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">3</ref> the distribution of excluded documents according to the main reason of exclusion. The categories are directly taken from the already cited exclusion criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Phase C: Recursive search for references</head><p>After the first search and the filtering process of phase A and B, we have followed a recursive search of references among the ones cited by the selected publications. This new iteration has returned 65 publications to be included in the corpus. The process has been repeated on the bibliography of these 65 references, after which we have found 8 additional publications.</p><p>Reviewing the references contained in these 8 publications we have not found further references to include in the survey. This gives a total of 123 publications.</p><p>The problem of recursive search of references is that it is oriented 'towards the past':</p><p>found references in one publication are always older than the publication itself. That is why we have looked for new references citing the 123 publications we had already identified. This is easy to do using Google Scholar, where each reference counts with a 'cited by' button to access to a list of publications citing the reference. The search has returned 58 additional publications to include in the corpus.</p><p>The total number of publications proposing a multi-step attack detection method composing the corpus of this survey is then 181 publications, covering a total of 119 detection methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Bibliometrics</head><p>Before presenting each one of the approaches about multi-step attack detection, we introduce a series of statistical analysis of the corpus of publications considered in the survey.</p><p>We are interested in the number of publications per year, the number of citations and the number of publications written by each author. These metrics could be extracted from a corpus of publications in any scientific domain.</p><p>One of the studied aspect is the number of publications per year. The results are represented in the histogram of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">4</ref>. They are separated by type of approach in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">5</ref>. We have not considered in these figures the documents made public after 2016, because this survey is written before the year 2017 arrives at its end and the results would not be complete.</p><p>On the other hand, we want to analyse the most relevant publications and authors in the domain. We have listed the 20 most cited publications in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> and the authors of more than 4 publications about multi-step attack detection in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p><p>The number of citations included in this survey has been extracted from Google Scholar, which we consider as the most complete search engine in terms of number of references. It is regrettable that this search engine does not provide a better API to extract the metadata and that it blocks automatic searches when a high number of requests is made. Overcoming these limitations could made of Google Scholar an even more important reference for scientific surveys than what it is nowadays.</p><p>We see that 2007 is the year with the highest number of publications about multi-step attack detection, closely followed by 2016. This last peak is an indicator that the research about multi-step attacks is still very active nowadays. The recent threat posed by WannaCry makes us think that multi-step attack research will be an important research topic in the near future.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table">2</ref> we also include for each author the number of citations of the most cited publication, the number of citations of the least cited publication and the total number of citations. Some important authors, such as Julisch, do not appear in the ranking of Table <ref type="table">2</ref> in spite of their number of citations because they have less than five publications in the corpus.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Review of multi-step attack detection methods</head><p>In this section we present the final selection of publications proposing multi-step attack detection methods. We refer to this selection as the corpus of the survey. The methods are classified according to the main approach they follow. Work in some of the approaches is further classified into categories. The taxonomy of the classification is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">6</ref>. We find five kinds of approach:</p><p>• Similarity-based. The degree of similarity between traces determines the construction of the attack scenarios. We find three categories in this approach: progressive construction (by attribute matching or correlation), scenario clustering and anomaly detection.</p><p>• Causal correlation. Detection is focused on the anatomy of multi-step sequences and the causal relationship between their steps. Publications under this approach can be further classify into one out of three categories: prerequisites and consequences, statistical inference or model matching.</p><p>• Structural-based. Incoming traces are projected to a model of the network, where future attack paths can be predicted.</p><p>• Case-based. Detection of well-known attack scenarios as an ensemble of traces.</p><p>• Mixed. More than one of the approaches are followed but none of them stands out among the others.</p><p>The distribution of the work in the corpus according to its approach is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">7</ref>.</p><p>Below is a summary of the contributions to each one of the approaches. We finish this section presenting some work about architectures for detection, which is not included in the corpus of this survey because it does not explain the detection methods involved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Similarity-based methods</head><p>Similarity-based methods propose the composition of scenarios according to the similarity between the individual steps of the attack. They are based on the idea that similar alerts are related to the same root cause <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9]</ref> and they therefore belong to the same attack scenario. Computation of the similarity degree is the central focus of these methods. This distinguishes them from causal correlation methods, which focus on the causal structure of the sequence.</p><p>The similarity between traces is computed after one or several fields among the ones contained in each trace: IP addresses, port numbers, timestamp, type of trace, etc. The metric to do the comparison between fields depends on each detection method. It is generally expressed as a correlation index, which can be binary, i.e. equal or unequal, or based on a more complex correlation function. Some authors consider just the comparison of one feature <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>, while most of them look at a combination of several of them <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">84]</ref>. When this is the case, some of the fields can be considered as more important than others through the application of weights.</p><p>The main advantage of similarity-based methods is that if the process to determine the link between the traces is correctly chosen, the implementation is easy and can return unknown multi-step attacks. The analysis is just based on comparison between pairs of traces, so systems implementing this methods have usually a good performance. However, choosing how the traces are linked is far from being an easy task. If the linking process is kept simple, only relying on the similarity of few fields, the results will contain too many false positive alerts. On the contrary, a complex linking process based on the application of correlation matrixes and using different weights for each field can be too specific to capture the characteristics of the whole range of real multi-step attacks.</p><p>We can classify similarity-based methods in three categories depending on how the degree of similarity is used in the creation of the attack scenarios. First of all, we have a set of methods based on progressive construction, where the sequence of actions conforming the attack is built step by step by the addition of similar traces. Secondly, methods doing scenario clustering just apply a clustering method to all the set of alerts and return the clusters as possible scenarios, without considering the order as it happens in progressive construction. Finally, in anomaly detection methods the similarity of incoming sequences of traces is computed against a set of non-malicious traces; and sequences are considered as part of an attack scenario if they differ from normality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1.">Progressive construction</head><p>In progressive construction methods, a potential attack sequence is built step by step.</p><p>Traces are appended to a scenario according to the similarity with the rest of the traces in it.</p><p>Compared traces are selected from the same time window. The difference with clustering methods is that the order of the actions is an important factor. In progressive construction, the sequences are built step by step and following a logical progression.</p><p>The match between the compared fields can be exact or partial. Methods using an exact match between some fields in the events have been considered in the subcategory attribute matching. On the other side, methods which consider partial similarity are placed in attribute correlation. These last methods calculate a correlation coefficient between events and place them together if the coefficient is above certain threshold.</p><p>Attribute matching. B. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> propose a system for active correlation built on top of a Bro IDS. This allows direct contact with network traffic, as opposed to passive event collection.</p><p>The system highlights malicious network events using IDS signatures and follows their development as consecutive events, finding matches in terms of IP address or port.</p><p>A similar technique, but not directly implemented on the IDS, is followed by Shaneck et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>. They divide the detection process in two stages. The first one combines pattern matching by an IDS engine and profiling to create attack scenarios in a highly restrictive way. In a second step, other alerts or pieces of network traffic with the same IP addresses as the alerts in each scenario are appended to it. The BDB system <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref> also starts its operation with a triggering alert, but the authors do not give much detail about the linking process.</p><p>IP addresses are also the only features considered by Z. Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref> to link the steps of an attack. In their system, single-step attacks are first assigned to a predefined phase of attack.</p><p>Alerts are progressively added to a scenario if the source and the destination IP addresses match with the rest of alerts in the scenario. This perspective is also adopted by Ebrahimi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>,</p><p>who propose a simple matching algorithm using both source and destination IP addresses.</p><p>The technique developed by Brogi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref> also aims to find links between elementary attacks but using a method based on tags. These tags are assigned to each of the steps in the potential multi-step attack and propagated through the system by flows of information. Links between the steps are created if they have features with coincident information.</p><p>A different perspective is to focus on the detection of the attacker at IP level, such as STARLITE <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>. A module is added to an IP traceback system to trace back the source of the attack to the most external router in the network. This system does not consider the attack in terms of a sequence of actions but in terms of a sequence of assets used by the attacker during the infiltration.</p><p>Attribute correlation. Valdes and Skinner <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref> are one of the first authors in proposing a method based on attribute correlation for multi-step attack detection. Their method is integrated in the EMERALD system <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref> and it is based on a similarity matrix that contains the manually crafted correlation indexes between each type of alert. The mechanism they use is not explained in detail, but it is still one of the most cited references in multi-step attack detection. In the system proposed by Dain and Cunningham <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">112]</ref>, attack scenarios are build based on the partial similarity of IDS alerts. Each time an alert arrives at the system, the probability of being assigned to one or another scenario is computed based on a comparison against the last alert in the scenario. The probability depends on several factors: similarity of IP addresses, time interval between the alerts or logic progression between attack types. The similarity score proposed by Khakpour and S. Jalili <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref> is also based on several features. It also depends on the correlation strength of alert types deduced from a manually crafted database, whose details are not provided in their work.</p><p>Similarity is computed by pairs of elementary attacks in the method proposed by Zhu and</p><p>Ghorbani <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[84]</ref>. The correlation indexes are based on six selected features and extracted from a reference set of alerts. They do so using two methods: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Support</p><p>Vector Machine (SVM). The resulting indexes are stored by attack type in an Alert Correlation Matrix (ACM), used to deduce the attack scenarios.</p><p>The Statistical Filtering algorithm, developed by Li Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">68]</ref>, is also based on a correlation matrix, but in this case the indexes are manually deduced from experience and they are fixed in time. Even if sequences are automatically extracted according to their frequency, the final verdict about whether they represent an attack scenario relies on the human-crafted correlation indexes. Li Wang continued the development of her idea several years later <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[66]</ref> introducing more sophisticated time windows, whose size evolves with time, and a classification of candidate scenarios in three groups according to the relationship between their members.</p><p>Chih-Hung Wang and Chiou <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref> propose in a most recent work a method also using a correlation matrix, but they distinguish between forward and backward correlation strength, according to the time order of the alerts.</p><p>Pei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref> propose HERCULE, a system for doing 'attack story reconstruction'.</p><p>Their method is inspired by relationships in social networks. They define a long list of possible relationships between events. This relationships are exploited to create graphs of events. Edges in the graphs have a weight value, which is calculated using a quadratic optimisation algorithm.</p><p>The result returned by the system is a complete graph representing all the events involved in a multi-step attack. A very interesting aspect of their paper is the emulation of an ample group of real APTs from the existing literature.</p><p>On the other side, Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) have been much used in single-step intrusion detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>, but the only proposal particularly addressing multi-step attack detection is iCorrelator <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">117]</ref>. ICorrelator is developed by Bateni, Baraani et al., and it emulates the human immune system in a three-layer architecture. It is based on cells, which are vectors of comparison features, e.g. the similarity between IP addresses. Each cell represents the correlation degree between two alerts. Correlation is based on the set of cells stored in memory, which evolves through supervised learning from an initial set of basic rules.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2.">Scenario clustering</head><p>The goal of clustering is to discover natural groups in a set of elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref>. This is usually done through the application of automatic clustering algorithms. In this category we find the methods applying a clustering algorithm in order to identify groups of similar actions. Those groups or clusters are then consider to be potential multi-step attacks. The degree of similarity between traces belonging to the same scenario should be higher than the degree between traces from different scenarios.</p><p>As far as we know, the application of clustering to multi-step attack detection was first proposed by Julisch <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">105]</ref>. His approximative alert clustering method is based on taxonomies associated to each one of the attributes in the alert. Taxonomies are arranged in the form of trees, where parent nodes include the concepts in children nodes. Alert similarity is computed from the distance between nodes within the tree corresponding to each attribute. The aim of the author is to reduce the huge number of alerts generated by IDS, mostly fruit of persistent configuration errors or particularities of devices. However, the revelation of the root causes of a set of alerts can also lead to the identification of attack scenarios and a better understanding of attackerâ€™s intention. Some other work <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119]</ref> has proposed to improve in terms of quality the algorithm developed by Julisch using a genetic algorithm.</p><p>In the context of MIRADOR project, Cuppens also developed a clustering method oriented to alert fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref> which was successfully tested on multi-step attack detection.</p><p>However, his most important contribution to the domain is on causal correlation, about which we speak in Section 6.2.1.</p><p>The clustering method proposed by Murphy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">120]</ref> uses a similarity matrix based on the services each attack exploits. Clusters of alerts are extracted using Divisive Hierarchical Clustering (DHC) on a social network graph derived from the similarity matrix. Qiao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref> propose a simple formula for computing the similarity between alerts. They apply a double clustering followed by a loose application of LCS (Longest Common Subsequence).</p><p>In JEAN (Judge Evaluation of Attack Intension) system, proposed by Cheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref>,</p><p>the process starts building a database of attack session graphs from a training set of IDS alerts using J-Fusion, an algorithm for alert fusion. Once the scenarios are built, the system mines other occurrences of the attack session graphs using a method inspired by the generalised Hough transform, an image processing method to identify geometric forms.</p><p>Manganiello, Colajanni and Marchetti <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">124]</ref> propose the application of a Self-Organizing Map (SOM), a kind of auto associative neural network, before a second phase of alert clustering using k-means. In a final phase, a correlation index between clusters is calculated and the resulting attack scenarios are represented in the form of oriented graphs. They do not give information about which features are compared.</p><p>In a brief paper, Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref> present a clustering method based on a specific metric between IP addresses. We have not been able to find more details about their work. Their original contribution is that they work with alerts coming from a WAF (Web Application Firewall). A WAF works in a high level of abstraction, which can be convenient for the study of the purpose of the attacker.</p><p>Finally, Kawakani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">127]</ref> propose a method for hierarchical clustering of graphs representing attack strategies. The graphs are automatically derived from alerts in the same time window by attribute matching of IP addresses. Built clusters can be later used to classify new scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.3.">Anomaly detection</head><p>Anomaly detection methods learn from a dataset clean of attacks and then consider as a threat the sequences differing from normal behaviour. Similarity comparison is then made against a whole reference dataset, not only between the members composing the scenario. And the results are used differently than in the other similarity-based methods: we do not search the similarities but the differences. It is important to note that abnormal behaviour not necessarily correspond to an attack. The rate of false positives can be high, but anomaly detection methods offer the possibility of finding previously unseen attacks.</p><p>Mathew and Upadhyaya <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref> apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to build a model from attack-free data. Next, they project new data on the created clusters, so abnormal behaviour is easily identified. They consider a set of different states for the network. Each one of the states is defined by certain features and composed of information from heterogeneous security data.</p><p>In the anomaly detection method developed by Skopik, Friedberg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">32]</ref>, events from a training set free of attacks are linked in a random way to create hypotheses. They develop a mathematical framework to define hypotheses, rules and anomalies. Events not related to the hypothesis are considered as anomalous and raise alerts. The multi-step attack perspective is only present during the characterisation of the clean dataset, as detection is made event par event.</p><p>Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have also been used in anomaly detection. A set of HMMs representing sequences of normal events are built from a clean dataset. Sequences not corresponding to the trained models are consider as anomalous and thus corresponding to a multi-step attack. Anming et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref> implemented a method based on this in 2004, using the Segmental K-means algorithm to create the HMM from a training dataset of OS audit data. 9 years later, Shin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref> apply the same method on the same dataset but on IDS alerts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Causal correlation methods</head><p>In causal correlation, the causal progression of the sequences of traces is the key factor in the identification of multi-step attacks. In other words, previous steps determine the ones that follow, and a causal scheme can be derived from this relationship. This completely differs from similarity-based methods, where the found links depend on the inherent similarity between features of each action or set of actions. In progressive construction methods (see Section 6.1.1), causality is considered but just as a result derived from similarity relationships, and not as an element in the analysis.</p><p>Causal correlation methods have an important advantage: their process and results can be easily interpret by a human analyst <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. They highlight the character of multi-step attacks as sequences of steps, the most intuitive view we have of these threats so far. Their flexibility leaves a bit of space to find slight variations of known attacks, but not completely unknown ones.</p><p>There may still be a high number of false positives, but less than in similarity-based methods, as safer hypothesis are made.</p><p>Depending on the considered aspect of causality, we find three categories of causal correlation methods: prerequisites and consequences; statistical inference; and model matching. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1.">Prerequisites and consequences</head><p>In these methods, each alert is supposed to have a series of prerequisites, also called preconditions, and consequences, or postconditions. The prerequisites are the conditions to be given for an attack to be successful, while the consequences are the possible effects of the attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">88]</ref>. Methods in this category presuppose that each possible alert has a list of known associated prerequisites and consequences. Real alerts are brought together to form hyper-alerts.</p><p>An hyper-alert is a set of facts, represented by alerts, with the same prerequisites and consequences. Hyper-alerts are then correlated through the automatic identification of prerequisites to consequences, returning a sequence of attacks composing an attack scenario.</p><p>The first language created to represent a multi-step attack scenario considering the prerequisites and consequences of each step was LAMBDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[131]</ref>, proposed by Cuppens and Ortalo. It was followed by JIGSAW <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref> and ADeLe <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>. The authors of these seminal works did not propose a method for detection, just the language. As the proposal by Ning has evolved during a longer timespan, many improvements related to graph reduction or analysis have been incorporated. For example, with focused analysis the security expert can focus the analysis on certain values of attributes, while link analysis gives some insight on the connection between attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">55]</ref>. Graph reduction can be applied to extract the attack strategy if the method considers the derivation of the extended consequences of alerts <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[56]</ref>. Ning's team has even proposed a different way to express the causal predicates <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref>, focusing on triggering events and applying a hierarchical taxonomy to the attributes in the alerts. Finally, they have also proposed the enrichment of IDS alerts with the inclusion of OS-level event logging <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[60]</ref>.</p><p>A vast research about prerequisites and consequences has been conducted inspired on the work by Cuppens and Ning. Cheung et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52]</ref> propose CAML (Correlated Attack Modeling Language), another language for expressing causal sequences of attacks, and use it in the EMERALD project <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref>. Wang, Liu and Jajodia <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">7]</ref> improve the performance of the method proposed by Ning et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref> by adding a new element called Queue Graph. In their method, alerts are correlated only to the latest copy of each type of alert, not to all the past ones.</p><p>Their attack graphs contain, apart from the causal information, the vulnerabilities of the attacked environment.</p><p>In the work by Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">135]</ref>, predicates to express preconditions and postconditions are substitute by capabilities. A capability can define both the new possibilities of the attacker after performing a single-step attack and the requisites of the attack. This offers a universal way of describing the causal link in multi-step attacks. However, their assignation still requires manual work by a security expert. Yan and Liu <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">136]</ref> also propose another original approach: using a case grammar where the relationship between actions is expressed in plain English. In their model, actions are connected as verbs in linguistics.</p><p>MARS (Multi-stage Attack Recognition System), the system developed by Alserhani <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">103,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">101,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">102]</ref>, is the most complete of the multi-step attack detection proposals based on prerequisites and consequences. It is a direct extension of the work by Ning et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">45]</ref>. Using the method provided by MARS, Alnas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[137]</ref> are able to model the behaviour of Zeus botnet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2.">Statistical inference</head><p>Statistical inference is the process of inferring from a dataset the distribution that generated it <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[138]</ref>. It assumes that the information is already in the dataset of traces, we just need to know where to look. Methods in this category works with the frequencies of actions and The probabilities of the edges in each network are modified according to the probability of correlated scenarios. Jalili et al. are apparently inspired by this idea, but they do not show in their publications <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">142]</ref> how they obtain the "system indicators of attack consequences and prior knowledge of attack transitions" that they use to link the nodes in their Bayesian models.</p><p>A Bayesian model is also used by Ren et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[83]</ref> but in this case the models are extracted from a training dataset in a first offline phase. All the features in the alerts are tested to find the ones which better represent the relevance of alerts representing attack steps. In a second phase, the selected features and probabilities are used to extract attack scenarios from a real-time stream of alerts. No previous knowledge about the attacks is needed and the Bayesian models are able to evolve during execution. A very similar approach is followed by Kavousi and Akbari <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">144]</ref>.</p><p>They present a more abstract view of the resulting attack scenarios, easier to analyse by a human expert. On the other hand, in the algorithm proposed by Marchetti et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref> the level of correlation between nodes in the Bayesian graph depends on the time difference between the events and on the automatic analysis of past events. In a final step, the graph is pruned to remove the nodes whose correlation probability is lower than a dynamic threshold defined by the current statistics of dataset. Anbarestani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[146]</ref> also propose a Bayesian-based method, where the relationship between the traces is only based on the IP addresses, taking the final objective of the attack, i.e. the IP address of vulnerable assets, as a reference to do the comparison.</p><p>Z. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">71]</ref> propose a method to identify the intrusion alerts with the highest probability of being followed by other attacks. The set of probabilities for each alert is computed from a set of candidate sequences extracted from a training dataset using sliding time windows.</p><p>The resulting graphs can be applied after verification to a set of new alerts for attack prediction.</p><p>There is much work where the candidate sequences are built after a feature match between the alerts. Therefore, there is in these methods a previous phase of progressive construction by attribute matching (see Section 6.1.1), before deducing the probabilities. For example, the system Nexat <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref> developed by Cipriano et al. groups into sessions the alerts for which there is some connection between source and/or destination IP addresses. Lagzian et al.</p><p>[147] also consider only the IP addresses as linking feature, applying Bit-AssocRule, a variation of the Apriori algorithm. In the case of Man et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[148]</ref>, the features matched are the destination IP address, the attack type and the timestamp, while Kim and Park <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[149]</ref> just use time differences and pairs of IP addresses, not giving much insight about the implementation. Other work <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">150,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">151]</ref> simply takes the ID of the events and apply a sequential mining method to find frequent sequences.</p><p>In the work by Sadoddin and Ghorbani <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>, there is also a first phase of attribute matching, by source or destination IP address. However, it selects as potential attacks only the most frequent sequences. Their method, called FSP_Growth, automatically mines frequent patterns of IDS alerts and arranges them in a pattern tree, which are updated even during detection phase. FSP_Growth is based on the FP_Growth algorithm, used by Bai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[152]</ref> in the search of frequent sequences. The attack patterns to search are extracted from a Bayesian model of possible attack scenarios.</p><p>Finding the most frequent patterns is also the objective of Brahmi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[153]</ref>. They apply an improved version of the PrefixSpan algorithm after distributing the alerts and their attributes in multi-dimensional tables. This is not the only variation of PrefixSpan proposed for multi-step attack detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[154]</ref>. Another standard sequential pattern mining algorithm is GSP. It is used in the RMARS framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref> to extract patterns from a training dataset. The patterns can later be used in real time detection. We could not find any published experiments using RMARS.</p><p>The correlation matrix proposed by Zhu and Ghorbani <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[84]</ref> (see Section 6.1.1) is reused by Ghorbani in a later work with Soleimani <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>. After a first phase of sequence identification using the correlation matrix, an episode mining algorithm is applied to find combinations of alerts. Multi-step attacks are identified through a supervised Decision Tree (DT) learning method.</p><p>Other authors have also taken this perspective, focusing on the distribution of time windows <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[156]</ref>. The RTEAS algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[157]</ref> uses a manually crafted correlation matrix with the indexes relating couples of attack types.</p><p>In a very recent approach, Yang Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[158]</ref> propose to group the alerts using a fast fuzz cluster algorithm which relies on similarity between IP addresses, ports and timestamps.</p><p>Then, a frequent mining method is applied to the dataset, but only considering as feature the alert type.</p><p>Hidden Markov Models (HMM) have been also applied to statistical inference for multi-step attack detection. Ourston et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref> were probably the first ones to use HMM in the detection of multi-step attacks. They use IDS alerts, which are previously classified into categories corresponding to each of the usual steps of a complex attack. The definition of a HMM always requires to precise how its steps are linked. In this case, the steps are linked by IP addresses. In the more recent paper by Luktarhan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[159]</ref>, there is not a clear explanation of how the attack scenario is defined. While some research uses traditional attack trees, in standard <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[95,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">97]</ref> or enhanced <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[170]</ref> form, the network model used in TANDI <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">76]</ref>  assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[173,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">174,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">175,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">176,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">177]</ref>. Nonetheless, some of them can be applied in a production environment. In these proposals, the defender reduces the uncertainty of the attack through the signals received from IDS alerts, placing defences in real time in order to avoid damages. For example, Lin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[178]</ref> propose a model focused on attackers whose objective is to steal confidential data. And Yi Luo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[179]</ref> present an algorithm called RDFP (Responses by Dynamic game tree-based Fictious Play) to be applied in a dynamic game tree.</p><p>To end with structural-based methods, we want to mention a method for the very particular context of software-defined home networks (SDHN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[180]</ref>. It is a good example of specialisation in multi-step attack detection. Anyways, the projection method they propose could be adapted to other environments, as the attack graphs can contain information from any type of network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Case-based methods</head><p>A broadly spread approach for intrusion detection is the comparison between the observations and a knowledge-base of previously seen attacks. There are many methods applying this approach to multi-step detection. Attacks are in this case represented by scenarios or sequences of actions. The knowledge-base can be manually populated by security experts or attacks can be extracted from a dataset using automatic techniques. Honeypots can aid in the collection of real multi-step attacks for the development of case-based signatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">[181]</ref>.</p><p>Modelling the behaviour of human actors involved in security <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">[182]</ref> can also be important to better understand how to develop detection rules and even how to train new security professionals. Newly discovered multi-step attacks, through an inference mechanism or human intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>, can be added to the database once they have been analysed and a model is built.</p><p>It is important to highlight the differences between case-based methods, model matching, structural-based methods and methods based on prerequisites and consequences, as their resemblance can lead to confusion. In cased-based methods, models of attacks are built manually and represent a specific type of multi-step attacks. Conversely, in model matching methods models are highly abstract and assumed valid for every multi-step attack, or at least for an ample set of them. In structural-based methods, models are built only upon structural network characteristics. They do not use any information about the attack, but hypothesise it from the vulnerable elements and the possible paths in the network. That means that a multi-step attack is defined as an exploited vulnerability in the network element A followed by another exploited vulnerability in element B, regardless of how they are exploited. Finally, it is true that in methods based on prerequisites and consequences there is a predefined model for each alert, so theoretically all the possible combinations of sequences representing attacks could be built in advance and be applied to detection using a case-based method. However, when building the knowledge database of prerequisites and consequences the steps of the attacks, represented as alerts, are built one by one without defining the sequence of the multi-step attack. The alerts are later assembled in an automatic way, through the linking of prerequisites and consequences. This is what gives to methods based on prerequisites and consequences its flexibility and the capability of including more cases than case-based methods.</p><p>The clear advantage of case-based methods is that the number of false positives is low:</p><p>we know what we search and we look for the exact occurrence of it, so it is difficult to miss the mark. Nevertheless, if an attack is not in the database it is not found. Case-based methods are only capable of detecting known multi-step attacks.</p><p>Most of the work in case-based detection uses IDS alerts as an input. They are based on a library of handmade attack scenarios, which are generally expressed in the shape of a general graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">[183]</ref>. These libraries can contain additional information that can help in the detection of the attack, such as the criticality of the assets in the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[85]</ref>.</p><p>Attack scenarios can be stored using any standard language for rule representation. For example, Chintabathina et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">[184]</ref> propose A-prolog in order to apply logic programming to case-based detection. XML is also used in some work <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">[185]</ref>. However, there are many languages that have been specifically created to model multi-step attacks. We review here only the languages used in a multi-step attack detection method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STATL (State Transition Analysis Technique Language), developed by Eckmann et al.</head><p>[48], is a transition-based language to develop multi-step attack signatures. It was conceived for centralised case-based detection, but it was later used in other approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref>. While STATL is specifically thought for being used by a low-level search engine, Morin and Debar <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[54]</ref> propose to apply a high-level description based on Doussonâ€™s chronicle formalism <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">[186]</ref>. They propose the integration of chronicle, which was conceived to model dynamic systems, with the M2D2 platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[187]</ref>, a framework for event and structural information management. The chronicle formalism has been later used by other authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[188,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">189]</ref>.</p><p>Another language for representing multi-step attack signatures is EDL, developed by</p><p>Meier <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[190]</ref>. It has been later improved by Jaeger, Ussath and Chen <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>. This new version is complemented with a method for automatic derivation of multi-step EDL signatures from taint graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[96]</ref>. These taint graphs are created through semiautomatic correlation of the steps in multi-step attack examples <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[98]</ref>. In EDL, a sequence of steps composing an attack scenario is represented as a sequence of nodes in a colored Petri net. Although the general idea looks simple, its formal specification includes very innovative mechanisms for rule definition, as the use of moving tokens as search agents.</p><p>We can find very simplistic methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">[191,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">192,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">193,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b195">194]</ref>, just based on pure pattern matching. Some of them embellish the process with a previous phase, of alert aggregation in the case of Xiao and Han <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[195]</ref>. But we can find more complex proposals, where the system incorporates additional mechanisms to improve the detection.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">[196,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b198">197]</ref>. They represent the attack scenarios as Causal Relation Graphs (CRG), with queues of alerts placed in each of the vertex of the graph. This structure eases the implementation for real-time detection and the prediction of missing alerts. The correlation system proposed by Chien et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">[198]</ref> works with primitives representing parts of attack scenarios. Primitives are built from a pre-defined ontology, but not enough detail is given about how they are created. The authors explain the correlation process in very general terms, but their idea of decomposing the attack scenario in parts is interesting.</p><p>ONTIDS framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[199]</ref> is also based on an ontology, which works at different levels: context, alert, attack and vulnerability. The connection between all these levels is exploited in the definition of detection rules.</p><p>Giura and Wang <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[200,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b202">201]</ref> propose a model for APT detection that can work with general events, not only with IDS alerts. The stages of the attack are arranged in a layered pyramid, with the goal at the top of the pyramid and the previous steps stratified by layers. In each face of the pyramid we can find a different domain: physical, network, application, user, etc.</p><p>This model is used in a detection framework where correlation rules are based on signatures, profiling or security policies.</p><p>Also working with general events, Morwilog <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">[202]</ref> is a system inspired by the behaviour of foraging ants. The arrival of events to the system triggers the generation of artificial ants, which look for the best paths in trees that contain possible sequences of malicious events.</p><p>Morwilog works with the assistance of a human expert, who helps the system to learn through the identification of false positives and real detections. Even if in the paper the event trees are randomly generated, the system is conceived to benefit from manually crafted trees with expert knowledge.</p><p>The case-based methods presented so far are centralised: traces are collected in a central point, where detection of attack scenarios takes place. However, there are also some distributed methods where detection of individual steps is done by local agents scattered through the network, who give a coordinated response to multi-step attack detection. This kind of intrusion detection system have been throughly studied as a particular field of security detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>.</p><p>An example of a distributed system applying case-based detection is Quicksand <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">[203]</ref>,</p><p>where handmade multi-step attack signatures are translated into pattern graphs and sent to local agents. Each agent is responsible of detecting the fraction of the signature represented in a node of the graph. Each time an agent detects its assigned pattern, a message is sent up in the tree, until Quicksand identifies the full signature, represented in the root node, and raises an alert. The distributed system proposed by Vogel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b205">204]</ref> is based on the Petri net principle and uses signatures written in EDL <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[190]</ref>. Signatures are divided in minimal parts and sent to the local agents. In both methods, rule division has to be made by hand.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5.">Mixed methods</head><p>As we have mentioned earlier, there is some work where several approaches are integrated together in the same system, with no clear prevalence of one over the other.</p><p>For instance, the framework RTECA <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">[205]</ref> combines frequency analysis, similarity of alert types through a correlation matrix and matching of IP addresses and ports. Frequent sequences are arranged in event trees, which are fed with similar sequences during the execution.</p><p>The analysis of frequent patterns can be also combined with a phase of clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">[206]</ref>. The creators of RTECA also propose in another paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">[207]</ref> a very similar system to their previous one but based on Bayesian networks. Lessons learned from both systems are incorporated in a very recent three-phase framework developed by the same authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b210">[208]</ref>, where there is no dependance of a predefined correlation matrix.</p><p>In ASEA system <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">[209]</ref>, statistical relationships between alerts and attribute correlation are merged to apply plan recognition using HMMs. On the other hand, Shittu proposes in the third chapter of her PhD. thesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">[210]</ref> to combine Bayesian inference with attribute correlation, offering a different perspective to existent Bayesian methods. Furthermore, Du et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[78]</ref> start by identifying sequences of IDS alerts with the same victim IP address and assigning a severity score to each step. Then, the found sequences are mined using three techniques, each of them based on a totally different mechanism: Longest Common Subsequences (LCS), Fourier transform and social networks.</p><p>There is much work combining prerequisites and consequences with other approaches.</p><p>Ning et al. propose to mix their method with similarity-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">62]</ref>. Their purpose is to merge the graphs belonging to the same attack scenario but that are mistaken as separate because an IDS alert is missing. Yu and Frincke <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">[211,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b214">212]</ref> combine causal correlation and statistical inference, applying colored Petri net with hidden states to multi-step attack detection.</p><p>Another proposal is that of Saad and Traore <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">[213]</ref>, who propose a phase of clustering using an intrusion ontology before applying the connection between prerequisites and consequences. A similar method is used by Al-Mamory and Hong Li Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">[214]</ref>, who additionally propose the application of an Attribute Context-Free Grammar to model the multi-step attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">[215,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b218">216]</ref>.</p><p>This grammar contains information about the level of similarity between the alerts, their prerequisites and consequences and the structure of known attack scenarios.</p><p>We find also some publications proposing the combination of methods that we have already mentioned in the context of other approaches. This is mostly done by the same authors who developed the original methods. For instance, causality-based INFERD <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">93,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">92]</ref> is integrated with the structural-based TANDI system in the work by Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[76]</ref>. Furthermore, the SF algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">68]</ref> is combined with MASP in the SATA platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[69]</ref>. Marchetti,</p><p>Colajanni and Manganiello propose a framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">[217]</ref> to combine their two approaches, the one using Self-Organizing Maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">123]</ref> and their pseudo-Bayesian algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref>.</p><p>There are some frameworks in the literature proposing a whole end-to-end correlation process focused on multi-step attack detection. relevant than the network level. Another correlation framework is the one proposed by Ahmed <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">[220]</ref>, where attack scenario construction is made combining semantic-based clustering and analysis of pre-defined consequences of alerts. He also proposes previous phases for alert aggregation and verification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6.">Architectures for the detection</head><p>There is some work proposing systems for multi-step attack detection from an architectural point of view but without defining specific methods or algorithms to identify the threat. As we have indicated before, publications in this section are not included in the main corpus of this survey.</p><p>We find in this category which is probably the first system conceiving the attack strategy as an important point for intrusion detection, in 1999 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref>. It is based on a communication protocol between IDS agents, which are distributed through the network and doing local analysis and classical intrusion detection. A master controls their behaviour after the identification of possible strategies. Another most recent proposal of distributed architecture is FCDS (Federated Cyber Defense System) <ref type="bibr" target="#b223">[221]</ref>. It is intended to coordinate a Federation of Systems (FoS), a set of connected heterogeneous systems that collaborate in the detection of multi-step attacks.</p><p>Very much focused on alert aggregation, Debar and Wespi <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">[222]</ref> conceived in 2001 an architecture for a console working on top of the Tivoli Enterprise Console (TEC), a commercial product. Their paper does not give much details about the implementation but it is still a much cited architecture of reference for multi-step attack detection.</p><p>In the survey about alert correlation written by Salah et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>, an architecture of reference is built from the options proposed in the literature. They propose an end-to-end process composed of four stages: preprocessing, reduction, correlation and prioritisation.</p><p>The architecture proposed by Ficco and Romano <ref type="bibr" target="#b225">[223]</ref> takes a perspective of detection based on prerequisites and consequences. Their knowledge base is associated to a specific ontology <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">[224]</ref> for attack scenario reconstruction.</p><p>Bhatt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b228">[225,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b229">226]</ref> propose, without showing much detail about the implementation, a framework for APT detection from events using Hadoop.</p><p>Directly working with network packets, DFA-AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">[227]</ref>  Finally, it is interesting the idea of attack narratives proposed by Mireles et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">[228]</ref>.</p><p>They propose a methodology to associate pieces of traffic to a multi-step APT model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Global state of the field</head><p>After the review of all methods in the corpus, in this section we study the domain from a global perspective. The reader can find more detailed information about the characteristics of each method in the Appendix, where publications presenting the same approach have been grouped together. We are interested in the information used in multi-step attack detection and which experiments are presented in order to support the validity of the methods. The reason is that they are important points to evaluate the scientific quality of any domain in research. We see in this section that in the 17 years that have past since the beginning of multi-step attack detection, the field has not been totally consolidated in scientific terms.</p><p>We start by the analysis of type of trace used by each method in its search of indications left by multi-step attacks. Then, we study the ways used to extract the knowledge about multi-step attacks. We continue by evaluating the experiments made to prove the validity of the methods and the datasets used in them. To conclude this section, we discuss about the reproducibility of the presented methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Types of trace</head><p>As we have said in Section 2, there are several types of traces reflecting actions that happen in the IT system: packets, events and alerts. The methods studied in this survey analyse the traces in the search of multi-step attacks. It is important to remember the definition of alert as a specific type of event that indicates an alleged malicious activity or fault. Alerts generally come from an IDS.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> we show how many publications analyse each type of trace. We distinguish three groups: methods only fed with alerts, those using general events, and those using traces with triggering alerts. This last group can be considered an hybrid between the two first ones. It contains methods using alerts to identify the potential presence of a multi-step attack but later working with other types of traces that are related to the triggering alert.</p><p>We can see there is a disparity in the use of the different types of traces: more than 85% of the publications are exclusively focused on the analysis of alerts. According to Brogi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>, detecting a multi-step attack is the same as highlighting the links between elementary attacks. It is therefore logical to start the search of multi-step attacks with the individual attacks revealed in the alerts.</p><p>Despite of this, there are still some methods using general events in the multi-step attack detection process. An alert is also an event, as we saw in Section 2, so alerts can also be considered by these methods. We have found just one method <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref> that works with general events but does a distinction between the treatment given to alerts and the rest of events.</p><p>There are also other kinds of methods where an alert triggers the detection process and then the attack scenario is built from other types of trace: packets <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17]</ref> or events <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">60]</ref>. These methods take advantage of the alerts as indicators of something suspicious happening and they develop the investigation on other traces from the information contained in this triggering alert, being able to compose the attack scenario with individual elements that are not a threat by themselves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Origin of knowledge about attacks</head><p>Another way of differentiating the publications is by the origin of the information about multi-step attacks in the detection process. According to this, we classify methods into three categories: manual, supervised or automatic extraction. The distribution of the publications in the corpus of the survey according to the mentioned categories is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">8</ref>.</p><p>In manual methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">48]</ref>, the knowledge about the attack is manually coded by an expert. They search for already known attacks or slight variations of them. All reviewed case-based methods (Section 6.4) and all the methods based on prerequisites and consequences (Section 6.2.1) are of this type. It is important to note that we also consider as manual the methods requiring precoded templates of attacks in some stage, even if they include other phases of automatic extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">[213]</ref>.</p><p>Supervised methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b214">212,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">122]</ref>  Finally, there are other methods approaching detection without any previous knowledge about the attacks to detect. We say of these methods that they are automatic <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">84]</ref>.</p><p>They learn from the own dataset where detection takes place, in real time. All methods classified under scenario clustering in the taxonomy shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">6</ref>, for example, are considered as automatic.</p><p>The clear advantage of automatic methods over the others is that they could find unknown multi-step attacks. The desired goal of any security system is to be as much autonomous as possible in the detection of attacks. However, it is difficult to reach such a goal considering the current state of research in intrusion detection. Automatic methods are not still fully reliable and return a lot of false positives. It is true that they can eventually inform about an unknown attack, but we should wonder if the work done identifying true positives among the returned alerts is not heavier than the development of rules to detect known cyberattacks.</p><p>On the other side, supervised methods greatly depend on the availability of a sound and reliable dataset for the training phase. The dataset has to faithfully represent traces found in real networks in order to be effective in detection. Available datasets are far from reflecting the complex situations we can find in the real world, mainly because of privacy and security issues that impede the organisations to make public their network data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.">Type of data for experiments</head><p>The validity and effectiveness of the proposed methods is tested by experiments. There are basically three types of data for experiments in the corpus of publications included in this survey: datasets of traces, synthetic data expressly simulated for the tests and attack examples.</p><p>Among the datasets of traces, we can find public and private ones depending on their open availability to the rest of the research community.</p><p>We have classified the 181 publications in the corpus in five categories, according to the type or types of data used in their experiments:</p><p>• Public dataset. At least an experiment with a public dataset is made. A public dataset can be obtained by any research team, so the experiments can be easily reproduced, provided that the method used is explained with enough detail and, when necessary, expert knowledge is furnished.</p><p>• Private dataset. Method is tested with experiments based on private datasets of traces, independently of also using simulated data <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">76]</ref> or examples.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.">Public datasets</head><p>In our research about multi-step attack detection methods, we have found a series of public datasets that we describe below. The number of experiments done with each of the datasets is shown in the Venn diagram of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">10</ref>. We should note that in this diagram we consider the total number of experiments using the dataset and that each publication can include several experiments to test the proposed method.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.1.">DARPA 2000</head><p>It is undoubtedly the most important public dataset to test multi-step attack detection methods. It was sponsored by DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in the United States. It was generated using the same test bed network as in DARPA 1998 and 1999 but incorporating multi-step attacks. This allows mixing the traffic and events in these older versions with the ones contained in DARPA 2000 to make more difficult the search <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">71]</ref>. DARPA 2000 was generated by the MIT Lincoln Laboratory in order to be used by the emerging methods for high-level attack analysis and goal recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref>. It contains network traffic from two networks and BSM audit data coming from the affected Solaris machines. However, researchers generally focus on the alerts returned by an IDS after it has processed the network packets. We only have found one reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref> only using the BSM audit data. DARPA 2000 is actually composed of two datasets, each one containing instances of a slightly different multi-step attack.</p><p>The first one is LLDOS 1.0, which starts with a phase of probing, followed by the intrusion and culminated on the installation of a DDoS launcher <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>. The second one, LLDOS 2.0, is similar to the first one but more sophisticated.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5.">Reproducibility</head><p>Reproducibility is the ability to replicate the results obtained in an published experiment in similar conditions as were set by the original researcher <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">[233]</ref>. It is important to distinguish it from replicability, which is the ability of reproduce the results but using different data that the one proposed in the original research. Replicability is harder to attain, as the proposed hypothesis also needs to be true for no matter which dataset and not only for the one used in the published experiments. Reproducibility is therefore a minimum standard for defending a claim as scientific <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">[234]</ref>.</p><p>As we could see in Section 7.3, there are publications about multi-step attack detection not proposing experiments at all. Among the ones presenting at least one experiment we have analysed which ones contain reproducible experiments. We define the reproducibility of experiments through a set criteria, similar to the ones proposed by Leek and Peng <ref type="bibr" target="#b239">[235]</ref>. We can establish three conditions to be met in order to consider a publication as reproducible in terms of experiments: accessibility of method, accessibility of data and accessibility of knowledge. We briefly explain below these three concepts:</p><p>• Accessibility of method (A m ): The proposed multi-step attack detection method is exposed in such a clear way that a reader can reproduce its functioning by itself. The explanation of the details of the method can be in plain English or in the form of pseudocode scripts: the important factor is the capability of reproducing how the method works. The maximum degree of accessibility is attained if the publication provides a downloadable implementation of the method <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>.</p><p>• Accessibility of data (A d ): At least a public dataset is used in experiments. It can be a well-known public dataset (see <ref type="bibr">Section 7.4)</ref> or a new one that is made available by the authors of the publication. We do not consider this condition to be true if only an example of a multi-step attack is shown to prove the validity of the method.</p><p>• Accessibility of models (A k ): If the detection method relies on models, e.g. a schema of alerts with their prerequisites and consequences, the ones used in the experiment are provided in the publication. There are methods where models are learned from a training dataset. In that case we consider that this condition is accomplished if the training dataset is available. This condition is not applicable to automatic methods, which directly learn the models from the analysed data.</p><p>We can see the distribution of publications in the corpus according to their reproducibility and to the accessibility of method, data and models in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">11</ref>. Most of the publications (67%) do not offer full reproducible experiments. There is even an 19% of publications proposing multi-step attack detection methods that are not accessible by third parties.</p><p>We examine the implications and possible reasons of this distribution in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Discussion</head><p>We have identified the big challenges in research about multi-step attack detection, after a thorough study of the published literature: modelling, automation, dataset structure and reproducibility.</p><p>In this section, we discuss all these challenges in detail. We give our vision about how multi-step attack detection should evolve in the near future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.">How to model multi-step attacks</head><p>Among the 181 publications composing the corpus of this survey, 101 of them show the model of a multi-step attack (see the Appendix for further detail). Out of them, 37 work only with DARPA 2000, so the represented models correspond to the same attacks. Thus, we do not find many different examples of multi-step attack models in the literature about detection. There is a specific literature about multi-step attack modelling that is not the object of this survey, but it is mainly focused on modelling the attacks as possible paths in a network <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b240">236]</ref> or on the development of modelling languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">131]</ref>.</p><p>Having good models of multi-step attacks is indispensable to guide the development of detection methods. In scientific research, the definition of the studied object is a basic prerequisite. Here the studied objects are the multi-step attacks, which are abstract entities built to correspond to the single goal of an attacker. As we saw in Section 2.2, there does not exist a consensus about which are the features linking two steps. Some authors give more relevance to the IP addresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15]</ref> or to the event type <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">26]</ref>, while some others focus on the causal <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24]</ref> or temporal conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>.</p><p>The conclusion is that the research community still does not know how to provide a solid definition of a link between the steps of an attack. Multi-step attack detection lacks from a true debate about what connects the pieces of an attack scenario. The most consistent definition presented so far is that two traces are linked if one is a consequence of the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">43]</ref>. This has been thoroughly used in the literature (see Section 6.2), but always depending on the manual coding of the pre and post conditions. The link itself become a human construction. On the other hand, in methods where the link is based on common features of the individual steps, the choice of those features seems much conditioned by the immediate problem to solve in each publication.</p><p>It is possible that there cannot exist a global multi-step attack detection method considering just one type of link between steps. In that case, a set of methods should be developed, one for each type of link, i.e. each type of multi-step attack.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.">From manual to automatic methods</head><p>Most of the methods included in the corpus of this survey rely on manually coded knowledge about multi-step attacks, as we saw in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">8</ref>. The aim in security detection is to develop fully automatic methods, not only to reduce the time wasted by security professionals in the investigation of potential threats but also to avoid human errors in the development of signatures. Moreover, it is the only way of detecting attacks that are still unknown to the intrusion detection community.</p><p>Some progress has been made in the development of automatic multi-step attack detection methods, particularly based on clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">49]</ref> and statistical inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22]</ref>. But we are far from a reliable automatic detection. Pattern matching is a highly reliable method to detect well known attacks and it is still most used in commercial intrusion detection systems. The enrichment with results coming from automatic methods could lead to detection of both known and unknown multi-step attacks.</p><p>Only long-term research projects can return solid and reliable security systems. However, we see that 85 out of the 119 methods studied in the corpus publish their results in just one publication, which gives an idea of the lack of continuity in multi-step attack detection research.</p><p>This seems a problem affecting the whole academic world, due to difficulties linked with current funding of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b241">[237]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3.">Limitations on the type of data</head><p>We can see in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> that alerts are by far the most used traces in multi-step attack detection. As we commented in Section 7.1, it is natural to start the search of multi-step attacks as the combination of simpler single-step attacks, represented as IDS alerts. However, we cannot deny that other events not representing a security alert can provide context information that can be fundamental in the identification of an attack scenario. An IDS returns the events that are suspicious by themselves, but multi-step attacks can be composed of harmless steps too.</p><p>We consider there are some important reasons behind this preference for the study of IDS alerts over general events. First, it is clear that multi-step attacks are easier to detect if they are composed of elements that suppose a threat by themselves, so alerts are preferred. This follows the classical scientific approach of starting to solve easy problems before facing complex ones.</p><p>The second reason is related to the limitations of current networks: IDS alerts have a predefined structure and a limited number of types, which general events have not. Alerts are generated by a specific device, the IDS, which is produced and maintained by a single organisation. It does not matter if the organisation is open source or commercial: each IDS device generates a series of coherent and cataloged set of alerts. On the other side, a system dealing with general events has to manage logs coming from many different devices. Logs are usually stored as plain text and there is no standard format to represent them.</p><p>Finally, this preference for IDS alerts is also explained by the composition of public datasets: most of them are composed of IDS alerts or has to be processed by an IDS in order to be used in experiments.</p><p>We consider that multi-step attack detection should move beyond the analysis of IDS alerts. Considering other kinds of events can enrich the detection and it can improve the applicability of the methods to real networks. The development of methods able to cope with any type of event is a big challenge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.4.">Lack of reproducible research</head><p>In Section 7.5, we have seen how there is a big proportion of work about multi-step attack detection methods where there are no reproducible experiments. We show in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">12</ref> a distribution per year of the publications including reproducible experiments. We see that the evolution has not been very favorable: after a huge rise from 2000 to 2004, the presence of reproducible experiments dramatically dropped and it is now stabilised around 40%. This casts doubts on the scientific quality of the work in multi-step attack detection.</p><p>The reasons of this results do not necessarily rely on neglects by the authors but on limitations of the domain. A relevant factor to make an experiment reproducible is the publication of the data used on it. But this cannot always be done. We have seen in Section 7.4 that public datasets are scarce. And researchers using private datasets cannot publish them for confidentiality reasons. Private institutions financing research in security can provide data to the researchers, but they do not usually want to disclose this data to preserve network confidentiality.</p><p>Even considering the benefits of producing shareable data <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">[238]</ref>, it is difficult to trust data anonymization methods. Although some of them exists <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">[239]</ref>, we are far from infallible anonymization of research data, as it has been proved by several authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">[240,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b245">241]</ref>. On the other side, test networks, isolated from production ones, are costly to implement.</p><p>Creating an artificial dataset for experimentation is hard, because you need to be sure that it follows the same distribution as data generated in real networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">[232]</ref>. Real data is complex, it is constantly evolving and it highly depends on particularities of the network. Finding its common places to generate a global dataset is a big challenge. We can see some weaknesses in existent public datasets. DARPA 2000, for example, does not contain enough scenarios for the parameter estimation needed in some algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.5.">Recommendations</head><p>To end this discussion, we propose below a succinct list of recommendations for research teams about the future of multi-step attack detection. They reflect our personal view about the direction towards which the field should evolve.</p><p>• Conduct studies on the links between the steps composing multi-step attacks. A better knowledge of their characteristics can help the development of detection methods.</p><p>• Aim to develop methods working with general events. Even if it is harder than working with well-formatted alerts, challenges posed by processing general events can be a source of new questions about the pertinence of used approaches.</p><p>• Expose the methods in the clearest possible language, so they can be easily understood and reproduced by the community.</p><p>• Publish the datasets used in the experiments when possible.</p><p>• Develop new datasets containing multi-step attacks. There are research teams such as the one managed by Ghorbani <ref type="bibr" target="#b246">[242]</ref> that have dedicated some effort to the generation of datasets, as a parallel activity to the creation of detection methods.</p></div>

Quotations means that the set of words enclosed by them are searched as an ensemble: the expression has to appear literally as it is written. Selected sets of keywords lead to the number of strings to search shown next to each item in the list, between square brackets. This gives us a total of 52 strings to search. A visual representation of the used strings of keywords is shown in Figure 2. The next step is to search the strings of keywords in the most important search engines specialised in the scientific literature on Computer Science: IEEE, ACM, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Only the title of each publication is considered in the search. For Google Scholar, we exclude patents and citations.

Statistical inference focuses on the extraction of causality from the frequency of occurrence of actions with respect to other actions. And model matching refers to the comparison of data against pre-defined general models of what should be a multi-step attack.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Shortly after the development of LAMBDA, Cuppens et al. became the pioneers in the development of prerequisites and consequences methods [43, 89, 88, 90]. They developed their work in the context of MIRADOR project. In their work, the connection of attack A and B is made if the consequences of A partially matches the prerequisites of B. Additional hypothesis, expressed as ontological rules, are needed to the connection of some of the attacks. The extraction of the correlation rules is made in an automatic way from the dataset of individual attacks expressed in LAMBDA language. Once we have the rules, they can be applied to IDS alerts in real time.The other father of multi-step attack detection based on prerequisites and consequences is Ning, the most cited author in this corpus. His team at North Carolina State University has been the most prolific one in this category of methods, both in terms of number of publications and of timespan of the project<ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">132,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">133,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">91]</ref>. Their method was developed in parallel to the one by the MIRADOR project, and independently according to Ning<ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[50]</ref>. The formalism of both methods is different, but the principles behind the correlation process are very similar.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_3"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>sequences of actions. A statistical model is automatically extracted from a training dataset of traces or from the own data where the detection process is made. The inferred statistics serve to build a probabilistic model that can be used for detection and prediction of further attacks. The most popular method of statistical inference, both in general and in multi-step attack detection, is probably Bayesian inference. Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are also popular to represent the conclusions extracted from statistical inference.Geib and Goldman<ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58]</ref> were pioneer in proposing in 2001 an adaptation of plan recognition, a good established field in AI, to attack scenario detection and prediction. They propose the application of probabilistic reasoning to identify the intentions of the attacker. They do not propose a method to extract the information to be coded in the rules. However, the relevance of their work is that they opened a new way in security research based on plan recognition. The work by Zhuo Ning and Gong is also based on plan recognition<ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[139]</ref>. Their method needs a preliminary attack graph with associated belief values, so the detection of unknown attack is not possible.Their influence is evident in the work by Qin and Lee. Their first published multi-step attack detection method<ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref> applies a correlation between individual alerts based on the Granger Causality Test, a time series-based causal analysis algorithm. Using this work as the basis, they propose a Bayesian technique<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">140,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">104]</ref> to correlate isolated attack scenarios. A set of Bayesian networks are derived from a manually crafted library of attack trees of high level alerts.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_4"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Farhadi et al.  implement a method similar to the one by Ourston et al. but using classical Markov models, not HMMs<ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[160]</ref>. Classical Markov models are also used by Xuewei et al.<ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[161]</ref>, who define the relationship between alert types only based on similarities between IP addresses.Kholidy et al.  show in a set of three publications<ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">163,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">164]</ref> that other variations of classical Markov models, such as Variable Order Markov Models (VMM), can be used to predict next steps in a multi-step attack. The approaches they propose highly depend on predefined models or signatures of attacks, but prediction is based on transition probabilities adapted from alert data.6.2.3. Model matchingMethods doing model matching assume that every multi-step attack follow a certain structure. They model this structure and try to find sequences that adapt to them. Model matching methods are different from cased-based ones, explained in Section 6.4, because the latter techniques use specific cases of real attacks. Model matching methods use a higher level of abstraction, representing the skeleton and general features of a multi-step attack.For example, a possible model can be derived from the global phases of an APT proposed by the literature<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10]</ref>. The structure of this model would be that of a sequence of ordered stages corresponding to each one of the steps of the attack. Traces, previously associated to a phase, can be linked by their similarity and compared to the model. This way of working is followed by INFERD<ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">93,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">92]</ref>. It uses a Guidance Template composed of different stages. Each of them represents a broad category of IDS alerts. INFERD aggregates alerts to the same model if they match the template and they have the same source and/or destination IP addresses. There exists several systems proposing Markov models for high-level representation of IDS alert sequences. Fava et al. [25, 81, 82] use variable-length Markov models (VLMM), derived from a set of known multi-step attacks. The projection on the model can depend on the attack description, the category of the attack or the destination IP address. Other methods use HMM for representing abstract models of well known multi-step attacks [75, 4, 165]. The one proposed by Lee et al. [166] considers distributed agents to detect each stage of the attacks. None of the mentioned approaches using HMM take advantage of the possibilities offered by these models: they just use the formalism of HMM to represent the abstract sequences. But the model is not adapted to changes in the analysed data, or at least the authors do not give details about a training phase. On the other hand, a very recent proposal by Holgado et al. [167] considers the HMM as a prediction model built from existing data. A HMM is built for each type of attack, instead of having only one general model. The parameters in the model are automatically derived from a training dataset of alerts, which are clustered by the similarity of the attack description with the content of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) documents.6.3. Structural-based methodsMany methods consider the structure of the network as a key element for intrusion detection. They incorporate in their detection engine network information, specially about the vulnerabilities affecting each asset. This information is structural in the sense that it only depends on the defended systems and not on the actions of the attackers. The latter are deduced from the former but no real evidence from traces is used. Structural information is usually coded in the form of an attack graph. An attack graph is an abstract representation of the network containing the vulnerabilities of the systems in each node<ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[168]</ref>. Structural-based methods project incoming traces into the attack graph representing the defended network. Their objective is to use this projection to predict future steps of ongoing attacks. The process of prediction relies on the hypothesis of possible attack paths, solely deduced from the attack graph. attack graphs in 2004. Vulnerabilities are extracted using a network scan, and they are identified with a known exploit. Alerts are matched to the exploits if their correlativity is above certain threshold. Correlation between alerts depends on the distance between the corresponding exploits.</figDesc></figure>

TANDI is developed at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), the birthplace of some of the most relevant ideas about structural-based multi-step detection. One of these ideas is the cyber terrain or virtual terrain, proposed by Fava, Holsopple et al.<ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">80]</ref>. It is a manual model of a network where each asset is associated to its services, its version and the logical connections with other assets. They idea of cyber terrain is also appealing for vulnerability assessment. We consider it as a more important contribution by Fava et al. than their use of HMM for model matching, already cited in Section 6.2.3. Also born at the RIT, the system proposed by Du, Holsopple et al.<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> considers four categories: current state of the attacking source, current state of the target, firewall rule configuration and open services at the target. Prediction is made using two methods. The first one uses Transferable Belief Model (TBM) to combine the concepts of Capability and Opportunity assessments developed in the FuSIA system<ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[80]</ref>. The second one uses Fuzzy inference to merge Variable Lenght Markov Model (VLMM) estimates based on the attributes extracted from the alerts.Chien and Ho<ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[171]</ref> present a system based on colored Petri nets. They model each attack plan in an abstract way and detection is made considering a metric of exploit certainty. On the other hand, Zhang et al.<ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[172]</ref> propose to automatically build the trees used for detection. They do that assembling different elements (information about topology, vulnerability scan results, etc.) through the principles of causal correlation. Some attempts have been made to apply Game Theory to capture the behaviour of an attacker and a defender during the execution of a multi-step attack. Most of these efforts are out of the scope of our survey, as they are only based on structural data and just applied to risk</figDesc></figure>

Methods have been classified according to the approach they follow. We have identified five approaches: similarity-based, causal correlation, structural-based, case-based and mixed. Each method has been briefly explained and placed in context with respect to the other ones. As far as we know, this is the first survey fully dedicated to multi-step attack detection methods as mechanisms to find attack scenarios through the connection of real traces. The bibliometrics analysis conducted on the corpus of this survey shows that multi-step attack detection is an active field of research. However, further analysis has revealed certain weaknesses in the field. First, there is an important shortage of public datasets. The most used one is DARPA 2000, a dataset containing only two attack scenarios and being 17 years old, as old as the multi-step attack detection field itself. Secondly, it is difficult to identify a global model of multi-step attacks and to characterise the link between the different steps. Finally, most of the publications do not present reproducible experiments to support the validity of the proposed method. We have proposed a set of recommendations to improve the development of public research about multi-step attack detection in the future. There are still criminals using multi-step attacks in their network intrusions, probably more than ever. It is important to develop solid detection methods to minimise the threat posed by these criminals. Public availability of detection methods and data, together with credible scientific procedures, are the keys for the progress of multi-step attack detection research. 10.
