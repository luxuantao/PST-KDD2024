<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This powerful underlying concept is usually realized in both research and practical efforts within a nodelink model: nodes are the holders of content, and links are the means by which the content is given context. In this model, links are closely associated with navigation and mechanisms for traversal; they are a way to move from node to node, to keep readers focused on the current node or document, until they decide to move on to the next. We refer to this style of hypertext as document-centered hypertext.</p><p>As systems and applications designers have gained more practical experience with hypertext, models of structure have grown more sophisticated, more expressive, and in many cases, more flexible than conventional node-link models. To address the needs of specialized applications, some models diverge entirely from stan-dard notions of links; for example, Parunak introduces set-based hypertext for applications that involve taxonomic reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. The expressiveness of hypertext models has been extended by adding types to nodes, links, and structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20]</ref>. Finally, for the sake of flexibility, in some applications links are left implicit, computed dynamically by using text analysis methods or other heuristics for determining regular interconnections <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6]</ref>. Thus we see systems and applications designers broadening the field, in some cases by theory, but also through practical experience. Spatial hypertext has grown out of just such an intertwining of theory-and experience-based extensions to hypertext concepts.</p><p>Spatial hypertext has arisen through our experiences with applications that explore alternative structures for content and applications in which the domain structure is not well understood at the outset or changes during the course of a task. Many of these applications involve the collection, comprehension, and interpretation of diverse materials; they are information-intensive activities, like analysis, design or evaluation, and are often collaborative efforts. Spatial hypertext is most appropriate when there is no distinction between readers and writers, and more prescriptive design methods might hamper exploratory structuring.</p><p>Spatial hypertext has its origins in browser-based approaches in which the emerging hypertext network is portrayed graphically, in an overview, to promote coherence (see Th√ºring et al. in this issue); authors and readers interact with the hypertext using a map of its structure. In early conceptions of browser-based hypertext, boxes or other icons symbolized nodes, while lines represented the links among them; hypertext browsers were oriented toward presenting a graph representation of a network. NoteCards <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> and gIBIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> are examples of hypertext systems that used such a spatial map. But gIBIS differed from NoteCards in one crucial way: in NoteCards, the browser was used mainly as a means of visualizing existing network structure 2 ; in gIBIS, the browser was the primary means of interacting with the emerging network as well as presenting it.</p><p>Extensions to the node-link model, such as types and complex structures, have found their way into browser-based approaches. By watching people use these extensions, our sense of "what matters" in spatial hypertext evolved. The ability to create and move nodes freely matters; the ability to express relationships by spatial proximity and visual cues matters. If we remove the explicit links from a browser, it can become a dynamic canvas for interaction. Nodes may appear in different contexts through multiple spatial references to the same underlying content; authors may use "any unit of text as a new element in an expanding vocabulary of signs" <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Thus, spatial hypertext is not only a means of presenting readers and authors with visualizations of existing structures; it is also a way to take advantage of human perceptual abilities in hypertext navigation, and to provide users with a fairly intuitive medium through which they may express new structures and manipulate existing structures.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> illustrates how hypertextual structures can be realized in a spatial setting by showing the transition from a document-centered hypertext (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>) to a browser-based hypertext (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref>) to a spatial hypertext (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c</ref>). Imagine Nodes C and A in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>   Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c</ref> extends and generalizes the browser-based hypertext in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref> to a simple spatial hypertext. Once again, we refer to content of underlying nodes by visual symbols, applying the color-coded types from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref>. First we see that Node A's visual symbol is near Node B's visual symbol, so Node A is very probably related to Node B. From the characteristics of their visual symbols, Nodes A, D, and E are understood to belong to the same set, contained in Node C, whose symbol is at the head of the list; the set relationship is implicitly conveyed through proximity, alignment, and homogeneity of type. To illus-trate one final important property of spatial hypertext, we have populated the space with some gray unlabeled nodes that show Node A as part of other relationships elsewhere in the space-its visual symbol is grouped with some others on the right side of the example hypertext, as well as heading up a list on the left. Thus hypertext-encounters with content in different contexts-is realized through recurrent references that use visual symbols of underlying objects instead of through traversal-oriented links. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> illustrates several important characteristics of spatial hypertext: the separation of symbol and underlying content; the use of these visual symbols to create hypertextual meaning; and the ability to leave structure implicit and informal. This final point-the ability to leave structure implicit and informal-is one of the crucial distinctions of spatial hypertext. Of course, in document-based hypertext, structure may be left implicit and reclaimed through analysis of document content, but the structure that is computed is regular; spatial hypertext allows people to express what DeRose refers to as "extensional structure" <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>, idiosyncratic and dependent on the situation at hand, perceived through context, not computed from content. Ambiguity may be left unresolved without compromising the integrity of the structure. 4 For example, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c</ref>, if we pushed Spatial hypertext is thus inherently flexible, decidedly less formal than other models of hypertext, and readily supports volatility and change.</p><p>Many of these characteristics are derived from the basic affordances offered by visual and spatial modes of working. People may find it difficult to express how or why content is interconnected, but they are accustomed to arranging media-either physical or electronic-in space. Computational tools like text editors, structured graphics editors, outliners, some hypertext systems, and even multiple window displays (where different documents or different portions of the same document can be readily juxtaposed) all support spatialized content. Office workers frequently shuffle papers to make sense of them, and use the physical space around their offices as important adjuncts to their more organized file cabinets <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref>.</p><p>Sometimes links are noted physically or graphically in these media-in computational media, lines are drawn from one content item to another, or boxes group multiple items; in noncomputational environments, people fasten documents together with paper clips, staple them, put rubber bands around sets of videotapes, or otherwise physically connect related things-but often interconnections are left implicit, to be resolved only if use demands it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Looking at Practice</head><p>Instances of spatial hypertext-like constructs appear in many computational and noncomputational settings. How can we learn from practice to design appropriate components for and an interface to a spatial hypertext system? It is crucial to watch users in action, to look at the results of their work in a variety of environments, and to talk to them about what they are trying to accomplish. Experiences with the Aquanet hypertext system, which uses a browser-based approach, coupled with a survey of the types of spatial structures people created in three different hypertext systems (NoteCards, the Virtual Notebook System, and Aquanet) provided us with a basis for designing a spatial hypertext system and reflecting on directions for spatial hypertext <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>.</p><p>In our survey, we found that authors sometimes prefer to express relationships among nodes 5 by using geometric cues like proximity and alignment, and visual cues like graphical similarity. These geometric and visual cues correspond to Bertin's notion of planar and retinal variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. By combining geometric and visual cues, authors may build up surprisingly complex hypertext structures.</p><p>Geometrically-based relationships arise from spatial configurations of nodes: nodes may be "close to" or "on top of" each other (be proximate); nodes may be "under," "over," "to the left of," or "to the right of" one another (show deliberate alignment in either the x or y dimension); or nodes may be clustered or grouped (set apart from other elements of a space). People readily use these spatial configurations to portray relationships. For example, two adjacent or overlapping nodes might be related in a manner analogous to a simple binary link.</p><p>Visual characteristics also are used to signify relationships or clarify spatial cues. So nodes of the same color distributed throughout a space might belong to a common set. Or nodes that are similar in appearance might elaborate on the role of a geometrically-perceived link. For example, if we know Node Y is an annotation on its neighbor, Node Z, and Node Y is distinctive because it is yellow, we can perceive the same annotative relationship between Node X and its yellow neighbor, Node W. While we have observed that people develop complex visual codings to represent different properties of nodes, these codings are apt to be Spatial Hypertext: Designing for Change undeclared and inaccessible for processing by a spatial hypertext system. Thus from our analysis, we found that the most important and basic visual characteristic to consider is "similar to" (or, equivalently, "different from"). Using homogeneity and analogy as guides, people can portray and perceive different kinds of hypertextual structures.</p><p>Taken in combination, visual and geometric characteristics also suggest hypertext composites. Composites are higher-level structures that include other nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. By this definition, any group of visual symbols that appears to be deliberately organized-specific symbols occupying specific relative positions-is a composite. More interesting are node layouts that exhibit repeated patterns of visual and geometric characteristics, which are referred to as composite types. We found composite types in many of the layouts surveyed.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> shows a com-plex spatial structure created in Aquanet as part of a long-term analysis of machine translation systems and technologies.</p><p>The figure includes graphical objects that are instances of seven different object types; each instance refers to underlying content. What kinds of structure can readers perceive in this information space? First, coupling geometric and visual characteristics, we can see that each corner of the space seems to be inhabited by different distinct patterns of graphical objects. It is useful to take a closer look at a small portion of one of these regions to examine other common types of hypertextual structure.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows several structures taken from the lower-right corner of this space. First, we can see that there are overlapping stacks of visually-similar graybordered objects; we can consider these to be sets. At a slightly coarser level of structure, we can see two instances of a composite type, the type that consists of four symbols: a purple rectangle above a cyan rectangle next to a green rectangle over a set of gray-bordered rectangles. Since the two instances of the </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 4a</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4b</ref> composite type are aligned so regularly, they appear to be a set as well. Although little structure has been declared beyond node types, there is much hypertextual structure to be perceived in this example.</p><p>Given the results of this analysis, we can begin to anticipate common kinds of spatial structures and ways people would like to manipulate and interact with these structures. These results can then be used as a basis for designing an experimental spatial hypertext system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An Experimental Spatial Hypertext System</head><p>With Coombs, we have developed an experimental system, VIKI, to explore spatial hypertext as a geometric and visual structuring paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. The system is designed to take advantage of the human perceptual system, spatial and geographic memory, and more generally, spatial intelligence; its emphasis is on flexibility, informality, and change. For readers, the system provides an opportunity to read in context, with awareness of the related, nearby nodes. For writers, the system supports the development of a visual language through informal interaction with a user interface similar to a graphics editor. A hierarchy of spaces helps keep complexity tractable for both readers and writers; users traverse through levels of spaces, each containing references to a particular set of nodes and subspaces-an organizational strategy similar to that of Storyspace <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Interpretive Task</head><p>In designing VIKI, we focused our efforts on supporting the interpretive process. Interpretation is that part of writing, collaborating, or thinking in which people collect the materials of interest and make sense of them in the light of their tasks and the backgrounds they bring to it. Of course, groups and individuals are neither monolithic nor consistent in their beliefs; to support interpretation, we considered varying ways of recording interpretations of a body of materials, using frameworks or structuring schemes that make very different uses of the same content.</p><p>Interpretive use of spatial hypertext is an important avenue of research to pursue. Through the increasing availability of online information sources (including other people, in addition to databases and corpora), people have access to vast quantities of materials relevant to their work. Yet there are relatively few tools that can be used to gather diverse materials and to explore the various ways these materials may be interpreted.</p><p>Such tools are needed in many settings. For example, a successful product development organization will collect business-related material relevant to the positioning and viability of a new product. This business-related material may include electronic announcements and reviews of related products; competitors' home pages from the World-Wide Web; relevant patent documents retrieved from an infor-mation provider's extensive database; internal project-related materials (like engineering documents) created during the course of product development; electronic mail exchanges held within the organization; and, perhaps, information mined from Usenet newsgroup discussions. Once these materials have been gathered, members of the organization must make sense of them-they need to decide which materials are important, extract the salient information, evaluate its veracity, and organize it for their purposes. It is the understanding that a group develops and shares over time that makes a collection of materials valuable; the materials themselves are of limited utility without this shared understanding. The difficulty lies in expressing and recording this mutually-defined, ever-evolving interpretive structure.</p><p>Thus, interpretive structure is not inherent in document content, but evolves through work. In practice, interpretive structure may arise through filing, in conversation, in juxtapositions of documents on a desktop, in notes and annotations, in markings and marginalia <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. All of these methods of expressing interpretations are necessarily partial, since they are not fully articulated; they readily tolerate ambiguity. Relationships among documents, assessments of their content, and interpretive abstractions can remain tacit through the entire interpretive process. E xternalizing these relationships, assessments, and interpretive abstractions is a crucial part of reflecting on one's own understanding of a problem and communicating one's understanding to others during the course of collaborative work. Our experiences demonstrate that such structure is difficult to express, even in hypertext; tensions arise between the tacit knowledge of the expert practitioner (the reader/author), and the means that hypertext tools provide to express interpretations as partial, emerging forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. Spatial hypertext promises to be a good medium to ease these tensions. VIKI forms the basis of our experimentation with the use of spatial hypertext in service of interpretive tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIKI's Spatial Hypertext Model</head><p>VIKI's spatial hypertext model is simple, and follows our survey of practice <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">6</ref> ; it consists of objects, which are node-like holders of content; visual symbols, which are the references to objects that a user manipulates in an information space <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">7</ref> ; collections, which are user-defined subspaces; and composites, which are the groupings of objects that form higher-level structures. Extensible structured types provide users with an abstraction mechanism. We describe each element of the model very briefly to illustrate how spatial hypertext is realized in our prototype. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref> refer to an analysis of machine translation software, in which retrieved materials and notes are organized according to the systems they cover. The analysis is shown in progress-some portions of the spatial hypertext are more highly structured than others.</p><p>Objects. Objects are the content-holding entities of VIKI's spatial hypertext model. Objects are semistructured: they may have no internal structure, or they may have an unlimited number of fields that can be added when users wish to highlight or create content that doesn't fit within the object's existing internal structure. Each object that is part of the information space is referred to by one or more visual symbols. Double-clicking on a visual symbol causes the corresponding object's full content to appear in a separate window.</p><p>Visual symbols. Visual symbols are manipulable references to an object. Visual symbols each have a graphical appearance, determined either by direct manipulation or through the types mechanism described later. Users can manipulate the size, shape, color, line thickness, and font characteristics of individual visual symbols separately from their content. Indeed, users have much control over what is visible on a visual symbol at a given time. They can use the symbol's size to limit the amount of content revealed; they can specify which fields' contents are shown; and they can scroll through content to focus attention on a specific segment.</p><p>In contrast to the tight correspondence between instances of object types and their graphical appearance that is common to most browser-based hypertext systems, VIKI's visual symbols decouple objects and particular references to them in the display space. This decoupling, along with the ability to manipulate the appearance of individual symbols, provides users with an informal way to record different properties of an object according to its spatial context. For example, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref> contains two references to the same content, a lengthy survey article about machine translation software, "Babelware for the Desktop." One reference to the article has a wide, dark border; the other, a narrow, less conspicuous outline. The author has used this convention, line thickness, to indicate how important the information in the article is. Apparently, the article is a more important source of information about Intergraph's DP-Translator system than it is about Globalink's GTS.</p><p>Collections. Collections contain arbitrary spatial arrangements of objects or other collections, enabling them to form a system-supported hierarchy of spaces. They too are represented by manipulable visual symbols that refer to large, scrollable planes, in which objects may overlap. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref> includes five collections (each with a blue background) titled according to the systems investigated. The edges of the collections act as clipping regions-collections appear as portals into subspaces. Users may resize or zoom collections to reveal more or less of their contents. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref>, the collections are sized to reveal the degree to which their contents have been organized; the collection at the lower left is clearly less well organized than the others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C</head><p>ollections give users the ability to immerse themselves in local meaning without losing global context. A collection may be motivated by the use of a particular visual/spatial structuring scheme (for example, as exhibited by the regions in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>); it may group materials that pertain to a specific subtask (as is the intent of Rooms <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>); or it may indicate semantic cohesion, as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>.</p><p>Since collections are acyclic, visually-nested hierarchical structures, the system provides a navigational mechanism that allows people to move between focal collections. Like Boxer <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>, VIKI uses a spatial metaphor for navigation. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> shows an example of spatial navigation in VIKI. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref> shows the top level of an information space. Traversing into the collection titled "ATLAS" (by double-clicking on its border) causes it to become the focus. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4b</ref> shows the result of this traversal. Now more of the contents of "ATLAS" are visible. Other objects have been revealed by the traversal, and we see that "ATLAS" contains another collection, "Using ATLAS," which is clipped. Multiple levels of the hierarchy may be traversed in a single step by clicking on any collection's border.</p><p>Types. In our spatial hypertext model, types arise through use; we expect users to work first with the graphical appearance and spatial layout of instances, and build up abstractions from these examples as generalities become apparent (see the description of prototypes and bottom-up design processes in Nanard and Nanard, this issue). A type encapsulates a particular appearance and internal structure, along with how this internal structure is displayed by visual symbols. Because content is often irregular, ad hoc fields may be added to the internal structure of any instance. For example, if one of the machine translation systems used a particular intermediate representation like Esperanto, we might want to add a field and value "Interlingua: Esperanto" to a single object.</p><p>Composites. Composites are structures that consist of combinations of two or more objects or collections in particular visual/spatial configurations; they closely model the structures we have observed in practice. Composite types are formed through recurrent patterns of constituent types; they may be defined direct-ly or suggested to authors based on the results of recognition algorithms, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>. We see composites (especially automatically perceived and maintained composites) as a viable way of building up relational structures in spatial hypertext. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4b</ref> shows an example of four composites that are instances of a composite type, which may be described roughly as, "a green rectangle over a set of purple rectangles." Several instances of the purple rectangle (an object type) use a visual property-border thickness-to represent an attribute of the underlying objects.</p><p>Working within such a spatial hypertext model, authors can use objects, collections, composites, and the visual symbols that refer to them to gradually build up interpretations of the contents of a corpus of collected relevant material, eventually forming types, abstractions, and a sophisticated visual language for performing an analysis of this material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recognition</head><p>Instead of providing a mechanism for defining specific links between objects, VIKI focuses on the relationships that can be noted visually and spatially. These relationships may either remain implicit, or be recognized by structure-finding algorithms that automatically analyze spatial layout and visually salient properties of the constituents of a space <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. Because structure is not enforced, but available on demand, expressive flexibility is not hampered by the definition of formal interconnections. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">8</ref> This approach addresses common problems associated with creating hypertexts, such as the need to articulate tacit knowledge or commit to structure prematurely <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. In short, structure is created easily, perceived by readers and writers, and, if requested, recognized by the system and used as the basis for further interaction.  Automated structure recognition, as we use it in our spatial hypertext prototype, assists authors in three different ways. VIKI may (1) use undeclared structure as a basis for interaction (for example, users may select and move the entirety of an undeclared structure); (2) help people use the object-collectioncomposite data model (for example, by locating potential collections and composites); and (3) provide inter-object abstraction (for example, by suggesting composite types) on demand. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref> shows an example of how the recognition facilities can help users locate and declare composite types, and more generally, incrementally formalize structure. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>, the structure recognition facilities have identified and suggested a possible composite type, a green rectangle (a type called "Label") over a set of purple rectangles (a type called "Dialog"). The user has accepted the system's suggestion, and has declared the new type.</p><p>Recognition is an accelerator, and enhances the usability of the basic facilities; it also usefully demonstrates that certain kinds of regular structures do tend to emerge in real use situations and can be made into formal hypertext constructs as needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spatial Hypertext in Use</head><p>We have found that information-intensive applications refer to external materials; for these applications it is important to see spatial hypertext not as the primary holder of content, but rather as a superstructure for organizing, and more importantly, interpreting large-scale information resources. This perspective takes account of the mutability of any external materials, and the role of structuring paradigms in making large-scale information resources serve communities of practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</p><p>To demonstrate the use of spatial hypertext in this role, we have extended VIKI so that objects may refer (through automatic processing of user-supplied URLs) to World-Wide Web pages <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>; users can start Web browsers by interacting with VIKI objects. This facility allows people to take advantage of the Web as an information resource, and enables them to interpret and situate Web materials in the context of their work; they are free to mix annotation and source materials, and add as much structure as necessary. Thus VIKI provides an expressive superstructure-a medium for customizing views of the Web.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> shows an in-progress VIKI information space that refers to Web pages pertaining to research topics of interest to its author. The author has used collections to gather materials on different topics and has used color to indicate the types of Web pages referred to by the visual symbols. For example, red symbols refer to journals, purple to ACM Special Interest Groups, green to conferences. The author has also annotated materials in several of the collections with his own notes and questions, such as his notes about how visual languages use spatial parsing.</p><p>In this example, we see a mixture of structured and unstructured materials, and a mixture of external references and personal annotations. This is a potentially useful way for communities to cull materials from information resources and record their interpretations of these external materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>Spatial hypertext can provide workgroups with a means of recording their interpretations of the large bodies of information relevant to their day-to-day activities; this information is quickly becoming available through a variety of networked electronic resources such as the World-Wide Web, online information services, and various digital library projects.</p><p>By addressing the needs of applications in which structure is emerging, changing, or difficult to articulate, spatial hypertext promises to be a useful alternative to traditional node-link models of hypertext. Spatial hypertext uses perceptible characteristics of recurrent visual symbols-references to underlying content-to create structures such as annotative links, sets, and composites. We have observed that these structures arise in practice, through human interaction with computational and noncomputational materials.</p><p>Spatial hypertext not only provides the means of visualizing complex structures; it also can provide perceptually-based feedback for navigation and a range of possibilities for expressing emerging relationships. As Kaplan and Moulthrop point out, spatial hypertext need not only reflect an author's picture of relationships among nodes; it may also be used to represent a reader's growing conceptualization of meaning <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. Hyperspace may draw upon physical metaphors (see Dieberger and Bolter in this issue); it may also serve as fertile ground for exploring new kinds of abstract spaces that exhibit characteristics not found in the physical world.</p><p>We have begun such an exploration of abstract information spaces with an experimental system, VIKI, which uses a simple spatial hypertext model and a familiar user interface, coupled with mechanisms to support the gradual emergence of structure, such as types and recognition algorithms. VIKI is designed to support the volatility and change we have observed in information-intensive work. By investigating the use of spatial hypertext in such applications, we can extend hypertext concepts to realms in which prescriptive design methods break down.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>88</head><label></label><figDesc>August 1995/Vol. 38, No. 8 COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM C a t h e r i n e C .
