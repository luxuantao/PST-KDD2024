<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for the linear collusion analysis of watermarked digital video sequences, and derive a new theorem equating a definition of statistical invisibility, collusion-resistance, and two practical watermark design rules. The proposed framework is simple and intuitive; the basic processing unit is the video frame and we consider secondorder statistical descriptions of their temporal inter-relationships. Within this analytical setup, we define the linear frame collusion attack, the analytic notion of a statistically invisible video watermark, and show that the latter is an effective counterattack against the former. Finally, to show how the theoretical results detailed in this paper can easily be applied to the construction of collusion-resistant video watermarks, we encapsulate the analysis into two practical video watermark design rules that play a key role in the subsequent development of a novel collusion-resistant video watermarking algorithm discussed in a companion paper.</p></div>

The growing appeal of video watermarking for more general applications is evidenced by the number of proposals for digital TV transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, satellite broadcast monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, video on demand distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and authenticating video surveillance for use as legal evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The flexibility of watermarking concepts for use with new data types has also been demonstrated through preliminary work with MPEG-4 video objects and parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Although in their raw form video streams are sequences of image frames, the complexity and flexibility of the solution space for the watermarking of video is significantly greater than that for images due to the presence of the time dimension. Video watermarking is distinct from image watermarking, in part, because there is more data available to both the attacker as well as to the watermarker. This additional volume allows the payload to be more redundantly and reliably embedded possibly by exploiting more sophisticated temporal masking characteristics of human perception. In the same vein, the attacker has the liberty to make greater use of correlations in the signal volume to devise more effective watermark estimation or removal attacks. One important class of such attacks which is the focus of this paper is known as multiple frame linear collusion.</p><p>Collusion occurs when collections of video frames are analyzed or combined with the ultimate goal of producing a markfree copy of the original. The frames may form a temporally continuous subsequence, or come from greatly varied parts of the video. The key idea is the exploitation of temporal redundancy, either of the host video or the watermark, to estimate the redundant component. In the case of multiple frame linear collusion, distinct watermarked video frames are scaled and added to form a resulting frame that provides an estimate of either the host or the watermark. If the scaling is the same for each frame, then the overall attack consists of average a set of watermarked video frames. Intuitively, this operation has the effect of amplifying the component of the watermark or host that is the same from frame to frame and attenuating the part that differs. To date, the collusion attack has not been well studied, most probably because of the research focus on watermarking still images. However, its growing importance is evidenced by the publication of recent papers in the area <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>The objectives of this paper are two-fold:</p><p>1) To provide a theoretical framework for the analysis of collusion-resistant video watermarking algorithms. We intend our framework to be general and compatible with a broad class of existing video watermarking schemes.</p><p>2) To devise collusion-resistant video watermark design strategies inspired by our theoretical observations. A bridge between theory and practical applicability is of interest in this work. The collusion problem was first addressed by Swanson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. However, the proposed solution involves a two-level hierarchy of transforms and is considered to be highly complex. One of the contributions in this work is to provide a framework in which lower complexity collusion-resistant video watermarks can be devised. Recent work by Trappe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> has focused on collusion-resistant digital fingerprinting that can identify colludes; their work makes use of effective anti-collusion codes for CDMA type watermarking using theory of combinatorial designs. The work presented in this paper formulates the problem using statistical notions rather than coding theory and thus involves a framework that is complementary to that proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>We begin in Section II by presenting a mathematical framework for the analysis of collusion attacks. Then, in Section III, we define multiple frame linear collusion, and the notion of statistical invisibility for watermarking which we prove theoretically to be an effective counterattack to collusion. We close the paper with a discussion of the theoretical results and their implications to existing video watermarking algorithms in Section IV, followed by concluding remarks in Section V.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. NOMENCLATURE</head><p>A robust watermarking system is comprised of two basic components: the embedder that inserts the watermark and, the detector that detects or extracts the mark. The inputs to the embedder are the host video sequence, a key , and a binary data message vector . The key is a sequence of bits encapsulating all secret parameters and components of the watermarking system, i.e., block sizes for block-based algorithms or seeds for random number generators. The payload capacity (in bits) of the system is determined by the length of the binary vector . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a) summarizes the set-up.</p><p>The original or host video sequence is denoted , where is a time or frame number index set, and are row and column indices, respectively.

The embedder produces a watermarked video sequence obtained by linear combination of the watermark with the host data <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where represents a general scaling factor (i.e., local or global). No matter how the watermark is actually embedded, all data hiding procedures can be expressed in this form by defining the watermark as the difference between the watermarked and host signals (and setting to 1 or some other appropriate function based on the details of the embedding algorithm). In general, the signal is dependent on the V from a possibly attacked and watermarked video sequence Y using the secret key K (also known at the receiver).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Linear Collusion</head><p>In this paper, we say that Type I collusion arises when large numbers of "visually dissimilar" video frames are marked via linear combination with a fixed watermark pattern. For instance, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, it is shown that statistical processing can be used to recover a good approximation of a nonframe dependent watermark pattern. This is commonly found in many existing video watermarks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> Type II collusion arises when large numbers of "visually similar" frames are marked via linear combination with independent watermark patterns. An example of such an attack is frame averaging. This case is relevant, for instance, to video watermarks that use different two-dimensional pseudo-noise (PN) sequences to mark each frame <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. We next formulate our framework and present some propositions useful for video watermark design resistant to linear collusion.</p><p>Definition 1: Given two random variables and with finite means and variances, we say that is an -optimal Mean Square Error (MSE) estimate of if and only if <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> where is the expectation operator, , and is the variance of the argument random variable.</p><p>In Definition 1, we normalize random variable to reflect the same mean and variance as ; thus, we also require as stated. The next definition specifies the class of attacks considered in this work.</p><p>Definition 2: Given a set of watermarked video frames , , linear collusion is the process of forming a linear combination of the frames <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> such that provides an -optimal MSE estimate of a) the watermark component , where we require for , and some , or b) the host component , where we require for , and some , for which is the statistical correlation coefficient between random variables and (where denotes covariance), and (where we let , ). In the case of a), we refer to the attack as Type I collusion; in the case of b), as Type II collusion.</p><p>In the subsequent analysis of this paper we let , , and exclusively. The conditions in Definition 2 on and are required for the watermark (Type I) or host (Type II) to be "well-defined" notions; only when this occurs do we consider to be a valuable information-bearing estimate. The values of , are considered to be "small" (i.e., , ) to provide a reasonable estimate of the watermark or host. In addition, our definition of collusion involves the addition of spatially synchronized (i.e., unshifted, registered) raw format frames. Spatial correlations are not accounted for in the attack formulation. Thus, for notational simplicity we drop reference to the pixel values ( , ) and, subsequently, formulate our problem using random variables instead of random fields.</p><p>Definition 2 encapsulates frame averaging attacks by setting , as well as more sophisticated linear temporal filters by allowing to take on arbitrary values. It is also general enough to encompass combining arbitrary sets of frames that are not necessarily in a temporally continuous sequence relative to the video.</p><p>The remainder of this section presents two useful propositions.</p><p>Proposition 1: Given two random variables and with finite means and variances, is an -optimal MSE estimate of if and only if . That is,</p><p>where as discussed before, is the statistical correlation coefficient between random variables and and . Proof: See Appendix A. Through Proposition 1 we can see the relationship between the statistical correlation and the MSE estimate; the smaller the value of , the greater the lower bound on correlation. We next present a necessary condition for each type of linear collusion.</p><p>Proposition 2: Assuming that the scaled watermarks are independent of the host frames , then a necessary condition for each of the two forms of linear collusion described in Definition 2 is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(Type I) (7) (Type II) (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>where , and , i.e., Type I linear collusion is not possible, and</p><p>Type II linear collusion is not possible. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> Proof: See Appendix B. Proposition 2 only gives a necessary condition for Type I linear collusion since we also require the watermark to be a well-defined quantity that we mathematically express as , , . For instance, the condition of ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is not sufficient if the watermark pattern is independent in each frame, because Type I collusion can be evaded; the linear combination of the watermarked frames will not enhance the watermark. More specifically, if independent watermark patterns are used to mark each of the video frames, and if the necessary condition is met, then <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> However, no information about the watermarks is revealed according to Lemma 1 which gives <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> where all of the watermark terms on the right hand side of ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) are unknown uncorrelated random variables, and, thus, the watermark is not a well-defined and estimated notion.</p><p>When considering Type II collusion, we observe that if the same watermark , is used to mark each of the video frames that obey , , and even if the necessary condition is met, the colluded host will still include a scaled version of the watermark pattern. If we consider the case for which : <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> Therefore the collusion attempt can fail to sufficiently separate the host from the watermark and a mark-free copy cannot be obtained. As in the case of Type I collusion, Proposition 2 gives only a necessary condition for Type II collusion. The condition is not sufficient since proper design of the watermark can, as shown, provide protection against these attacks.</p><p>Through the subsequent analysis, it will become evident that it is possible to achieve protection from Type I and II collusion by imposing certain design criteria on the watermark. These criteria are formalized mathematically in the next section as statistical invisibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Statistical Invisibility</head><p>Definition 3: Given a sequence of host video frames , and watermarked video frames , we say that the video watermark is statistically invisible if and only if the correlation coefficient between any two host frames and is equal to that between the two corresponding watermarked frames, i.e., . We refer to this property as statistical invisibility since an attacker analyzing the video sequence in a frame-by-frame manner does not observe any statistical difference between the host and watermarked sequences. For the remainder of the analysis the following assumptions are made about the statistics of the watermark, host, and scaling factors.</p><p>A1) The video frames share a common finite mean and variance (average power), i. Next, we present a sufficient condition for robustness to linear collusion; this expression will enable us to show a direct relationship between statistical invisibility and collusion resistance.</p><p>Proposition 5: Under assumptions (A2) and (A4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> which provides sufficient conditions for the resistance to Type I and Type II linear collusion attacks.</p><p>Proof: See Appendix E.</p><p>Therefore, ensures the inability of an attacker to obtain an -optimal MSE estimate of the watermark (Type I) or host (Type II) for<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> , and is sufficient for robustness to linear collusion.</p><p>Having assembled all of the necessary ingredients, we state our theorem on the relationship between statistical invisibility and multiple frame collusion.</p><p>Theorem 1: Under assumptions (A1)-(A4), the following statements are equivalent:</p><p>1) , 2)</p><p>, and 3)</p><p>. Property (1) describes the statistical invisibility condition; property (2) defines a host-dependent watermark design criterion; and property (3) ensures that a watermark satisfying these criteria exhibits statistical resistance to Type I and Type II linear collusion attacks.</p><p>Proof: Proposition 3 shows the equivalence between properties ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), and Proposition 4 shows the equivalence properties ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) and (3). Proposition 5 ensures that in practice all three properties are sufficient for robustness to linear collusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Video Watermark Design Principles</head><p>In this section we make use of our analysis results to determine two video watermark design principles robust to linear collusion. Proposition 5 states that under assumptions (A2) and (A4), for all guarantees collusion resistance in practice. Furthermore, we assert:</p><p>Proposition 6: Under assumptions (A2) and (A4)</p><p>Proof: See Appendix F. In other words, if the energy of the basic watermark signals embedded into each frame is kept constant over the video sequence, modulating the per-frame embedding strengths proportionally to the variances of the host frames ensures that the condition in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">18</ref>) is met. The idea of watermark strength adaptation according to some function of the image variance, both at global and local scales, is a popular rule of thumb used by many image watermarks. As it turns out, it also plays a role in maintaining statistical invisibility and thus becomes our first video watermark design principle:</p><p>The second moment of the watermark scaling factors should be adapted proportionally to the variance of the host video frames, i.e., Under assumptions (A1)-(A4), property (2) of Theorem 1 guarantees robustness to linear collusion in practice, and we can identify a second watermark design principle:</p><p>The correlation of the watermarks embedded into each pair of video frames should be matched to the correlation of the host frames themselves, i.e., A necessary and sufficient condition for the statistical invisibility of a video watermark is given by property (2). This implies that in order for the watermarks embedded into two video frames to be statistically invisible, their correlation must differ from that of the host frames only by a scaling factor. In the trivial case, where a constant strength watermark is embedded into each frame, i.e., , we require that . This implies that highly correlated video frames should be watermarked with highly correlated watermark patterns, and vice versa. Our second design principle is a more precise mathematical statement of the hypothesis originally proposed by et. al. <ref type="bibr">Swanson et al. in [15]</ref> that visually similar regions of video sequences should be marked with consistent watermarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. DISCUSSION</head><p>Although the theoretical results presented here are strictly correct only when the specified assumptions hold, we believe that they are still indicative of the behavior to be expected under more general circumstances. Assumption (A1), which states that the video frames share a common finite mean and variance, may seem at first like a restrictive condition. It is expected to hold approximately over scenes with similar lighting arrangements. But more importantly, it can be shown that if it does not hold: <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> Since the image power is clearly greater than that of the watermark, the dominant term on the right hand side of ( <ref type="formula">20</ref>) is the product in the denominator. The expression then tends to 0 even when is quite large, as long as the images have reasonably large variances. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> Thus, and the statistical invisibility criterion is approximately met and collusion resistance is loosely supported for a broader range of cases than is immediately evident.</p><p>Assumption (A2) holds for all existing spread spectrum watermarks. Assumption (A3), which considers the second moment of the scaling factors is more difficult to interpret. If a global scaling factor is used, it is clear that the assumption is valid. On the other hand, if the factors are locally derived from an image property like the Noise Visibility Function (NVF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the analysis without this assumption becomes more complicated. Assumption (A4) is reasonable when the watermark pattern has a large spatial spread, and also applies for a global scaling factor.</p><p>Accepting these assumptions as valid, we can consider what Theorem 1 tells us about the collusion-resistant properties of some existing video watermarks. First we look at the algorithms in which the same noise-like watermark pattern is embedded into each frame of a video sequence, i.e., where <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. By definition, since the same pattern is used to generate the watermark for each frame, regardless of the correlations of the underlying video frames. At the other end of the spectrum are the video watermarking strategies in which different noise-like patterns are embedded into each video frame <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. One typical scenario is to generate and as two statistically independent patterns. In this case, . In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the authors propose to construct a video watermark based on their powerful Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) domain image watermark <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. To address the collusion problem, the watermarking key is changed every frames. Thus the resulting watermark frames have pairwise correlations equal to 1 when , and 0 otherwise. From a statistical invisibility perspective, this mark may offer better performance than the two extreme cases considered in the last paragraph. In particular, temporally distant watermark frames are uncorrelated and we expect that the underlying video frames will likewise be negligibly correlated. Temporally adjacent watermark frames are also likely to be identical and the underlying video frames are expected to have a high correlation. However, the collusion-resistance of the mark depends strongly on the selection of . Observe that when we get the same result as in the first of the extreme cases above (i.e.,</p><p>), and when we get the second, (i.e.,</p><p>). Finally, a more sophisticated video watermark based on the Temporal Wavelet Transform (TWT) has been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The watermark frame correlations range over [0,1], but since the watermark is constructed in a three-dimensional space, it is difficult to study the two-dimensional frame-by-frame correlations analytically. The watermark is designed to be temporally layered by embedding the mark separately into static and dynamic components of the video, therefore, we expect it to exhibit good statistical invisibility. However, it employs two levels of transforms, as well as two layers of visual masking, making it one of the most computationally complex approaches.</p><p>We hope that the practical design strategies highlighted in this work will serve to inspire more feasible, but robust watermark constructions. The sequel to this paper attempts at the development of such an algorithm. Future directions for this work include developing methods to achieve matched host-watermark correlation while analyzing the effect of nondimensionpreserving transformations, such as scaling, on the statistical correlation coefficients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. FINAL REMARKS</head><p>In Part I of this two-part paper, we developed a simple yet effective framework for the statistical analysis of linear collusion resistance in video watermarking. An important component that has been added to the body of watermarking research is the derivation of equations describing properties that a watermark should possess in order to resist this class of attacks. Through this theoretical work we defined a desirable watermark property called statistical invisibility in which the presence of a collusion-resistant watermark is not revealed using linear statistical tools. In other words, given a set of second-order statistics describing the relationships between the frames of a video sequence, we have shown that collusion resistance is achieved if these statistics are not affected by the watermarking procedure. We propose a new theorem and two video watermark design principles summarizing this result. Finally, we considered how a number of existing video watermarking techniques measure up in terms of statistical invisibility, and found that there is indeed some room for improvement. The second installment of this work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> proposes a novel video watermarking approach that attempts to make more effective use of our two watermark design principles. Evaluation and simulation of this algorithm allows the ideas presented in this paper to be assessed under more practical conditions. .

Proof of Proposition 2</head><p>From <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, we have the following Lemma: Lemma 1: Given a set of independent random variables with finite means and variances, and their sum , the squared correlation coefficient of the composite random variable with itself is equal to the sum of the squared coefficients of its correlations with each of the independent components, i.e., </p></div>
