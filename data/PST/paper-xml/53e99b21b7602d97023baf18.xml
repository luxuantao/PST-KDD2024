<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>A labelling of a graph is a map that carries graph elements to the numbers (usually to the positive or non-negative integers). The most common choices of domain are the set of all vertices (vertex labellings), the edge set alone (edge labellings), or the set of all vertices and edges (total labellings). Other domains are possible. The most complete recent survey of graph labellings is <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>In many cases it is interesting to consider the sum of all labels associated with a graph element. This will be called the weight of the element. As in the study of magic total labellings, see e.g., a recent book of Wallis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the weight of a vertex x under a total labelling j of elements of a graph G = (V , E) is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">wt(x) = j(x) + xy∈E j(xy),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>and the weight of the edge xy is wt(xy) = j(x) + j(xy) + j(y).</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">)<label>2</label></formula><p>This parameter of a graph G is well known as the irregularity strength of the graph G, s(G). Finding the irregularity strength of a graph seems to be rather hard even for simple graphs, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref>]. An excellent survey on the subject is Lehel <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. For recent results see papers by Amar and Togni <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Jacobson and Lehel <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and Nierhoff <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Motivated by this problem, a recent excellent book by Wallis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and other papers on total labellings, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, we study in this paper irregular total labellings.</p><p>For a graph G = (V , E) with vertex set V and edge set E we define a labelling j : V ∪ E → {1, 2, . . . , k} to be a total k-labelling. A total k-labelling is defined to be an edge irregular total k-labelling of the graph G if for every two different edges e and f of G there is wt(e) = wt(f ), and to be a vertex irregular total k-labelling of G if for every two distinct vertices x and y of G there is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">wt(x) = wt(y).</formula><p>The minimum k for which the graph G has an edge irregular total k-labelling is called the total edge irregularity strength of the graph G, tes(G). Analogously, we define the total vertex irregularity strength of G, tvs(G), as the minimum k for which there exists a vertex irregular total k-labelling of G.</p><p>Let G = (V , E) be a (p, q)-graph, that is, the graph with vertex set V = {v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v p } and edge set E, |E| = q. Let j be a total labelling of G. We associate with G and its total labelling the following p × p matrix L = [l ij ] defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">l ij = ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ j(v i v j ) if v i v j ∈ E and i = j, 0 i fv i v j / ∈ E and i = j, j(v i ) if i = j.</formula><p>Let us call this matrix the j-matrix of the total labelling j of the graph G. This matrix is symmetric with respect to the main diagonal and all its elements are non-negative integers.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we investigate properties of edge irregular total labellings. Section 3 is devoted to vertex irregular total labellings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Edge irregular total labellings</head><p>Our first result shows that the total edge irregularity strength is defined for all graphs. Namely, we have Theorem 1. Let G = (V , E) be a graph with vertex set V and a non-empty edge set E. Then</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">|E| + 2 3 tes(G) |E|.</formula><p>Proof. To get the upper bound we label each vertex of G with label 1 and the edges of G consecutively with labels 1, 2, . . . , |E|. It is easy to see that wt(e) = wt(f ) for any two distinct edges e and f of G.</p><p>Let be an optimal labelling with respect to the tes(G). Then the heaviest edge e of G has weight wt(e) |E| + 2. This weight is the sum of three labels. So at least one label is at least (|E| + 2)/3. The lower bound in Theorem 1 is tight as can be seen from the following theorem.</p><p>Theorem 2. Let P n and C n be a path and a cycle, respectively, with n 1 edges. Then</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">tes(P n ) = tes(C n ) = n + 2 3 .</formula><p>Proof. By Theorem 1 we have tes(G) (n + 2)/3 , n 1 where G ∈ {P n , C n }. First we prove the bound for paths. We proceed by induction on n. The path P 1 is labelled with label 1 on all three elements. Let P n be a path</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">v 1 e 1 v 2 e 2 v 3 • • • v n e n v n+1</formula><p>; n 1. Suppose we have labelled the path P n for n = 3(k -1) + 1, k 1, in such a way that the edge e n = v n v n+1 of P n is labelled with j(v n ) = j(v n+1 ) = j(e n ) = k. For the inductive step the edges e 1 , . . . , e n and the vertices v 1 , . . . , v n+1 are labelled as in P n and we put j(e n+1 ) = j(e n+2 ) = j(e n+3 ) </p><formula xml:id="formula_7">= k + 1, j(v n+2 ) = k, j(v n+3 ) = j(v n+4 ) = k + 1</formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">) = k + 1, j(v n-1 ) = j(v n ) = k.</formula><p>To obtain an optimal labelling of C n+1 (C n+2 and C n+3 , respectively) we split the edge e n-1 into two (three, or four, respectively) edges by adding one new vertex x 1 (two new vertices x 1 and x 2 , or three new vertices x 1 , x 2 and x 3 , respectively) and label the "new" vertices and edges of the cycle C n+1 (C n+2 , C n+3 , respectively) in the following way,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">j(v n-1 x 1 ) = k + 1, j(x 1 ) = k + 1, j(x 1 v n ) = k (j(x 1 ) = j(x 2 ) = k + 1, j(v n-1 x 1 ) = j(x 1 x 2 )=k+1, j(x 2 v n )=k, and j(x 1 )=j(x 2 )=j(x 3 )=k+1, j(v n-1 x 1 )=j(x 2 x 3 )=k+1, j(x 1 x 2 )=k+2, j(x 3 v n )=k, respectively).</formula><p>For C n+3 we reorder the vertices and edges so that the edge x 1 x 2 will play the role of e n-1 of the above construction.</p><p>The upper bound in Theorem 1 is not sharp. If we introduce into the play the maximum degree = (G) of the graph G, we obtain the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Theorem 3. Let G = (V , E) be a graph with maximum degree = (G). Then (i) tes(G) + 1 2 and (ii) tes(G) |E| - if |E| -1 2 .</formula><p>Proof. (i) Suppose j is an optimal total labelling of G. Let e 1 , e 2 , . . . , e be the edges incident with a vertex x of maximum degree in G. Let y i be the other end of the edge e i , i.e., e i = xy i . Since w(e i ) = j(x) + j(e i ) + j(y i ) for all i, 1 i , and as w(e 1 ), w(e 2 ), . . . , w(e ) are all distinct, j(e i ) + j(y i ) are all distinct for 1 i . So the largest among these values must be at least + 1. Thus, either j(e i ) or j(y i ) must be at least ( + 1)/2 for some i, 1 i . (ii) Let x and e 1 , e 2 , . . . , e be defined as above. Let be the following labelling of the elements from</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">V ∪ E. (v) = 1 for every v ∈ V , v = x and (x) = + 1.</formula><p>The edges from E -{e 1 , e 2 , . . . , e } are labelled consecutively with labels 1, 2, . . . , |E|and (e i ) = |E| -2 + i, i = 1, 2, . . . , . It is easy to see that is an edge irregular total labelling having the required property.</p><p>The lower bound in Theorem 3 is tight as can be seen from the next theorem.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Theorem 4. Let S n = K 1,n be a star on n + 1 vertices, n &gt; 1. Then tes(S n ) = n + 1 2 .</formula><p>Proof. </p><formula xml:id="formula_13">(x) = 1, (v i ) = i + 1 2 , (e i ) = i + 1 2 for i = 1, 2, . . . , n.</formula><p>The upper bound in Theorem 3 seems to be far from the best possible. The idea of the proof of Theorem 3(ii) is used in the proof of:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Theorem 5. Let G = (V , E) be a graph with |V | = p and |E| = q. Let I = {u 1 , u 2 , . . . , u t } be an independent set of vertices in G such that deg G (u i ) = d i for any i = 1, 2, . . . , t. If t i=1 d i (q -1)/2 then tes(G) q - t i=1 d i .</formula><p>Proof. Let A i = {e 1 , e 2 , . . . , e d i } be the set of edges incident with the vertex</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">u i , i = 1, 2, . . . , t. Set A 0 = E -t i=1 A i .</formula><p>The following labelling j is an edge irregular total labelling to the set {1, 2, . . . , r}, where r = q -t i=1 d i . We put</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">j(v) = 1 for every v ∈ V -I , j(u i ) = 1 + d 1 + d 2 + • • • + d i for every i = 1, 2, . . . , t.</formula><p>The edges from the set A 0 are labelled consecutively with labels 1, 2, . . . , r. The edges {e 1 , e 2 , . . . , e d i } from the set</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">A i get labels r -d i + 1, r -d i + 2, . . . , r.</formula><p>It is easy to see that the largest integer used in our labelling j is r = q -t i=1 d i . It is a routine matter to verify that each edge of G has a distinct weight. In fact, our labelling has been chosen in such a way that the resulting edge weights form a consecutive sequence of integers from 3 to q + 2.</p><p>Let j be an edge irregular total labelling of a graph G, and let H be a subgraph of G. The restriction of j to H is also an edge irregular total labelling of H. This means that tes(H ) tes(G). As a consequence of this inequality we have the following: Lemma 6. Let G = (V , E) be a graph with |V | = p. Then tes(G) tes(K p ).</p><p>Lemma 6 points out that it is very important to know the exact value of tes(K p ) for any p 2. We know that</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">p 2 -p + 4 6 tes(K p ) (p -1)(p -2) 2 . (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>The left inequality is from Theorem 1, the right side one is a consequence of Theorem 3(ii). From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> we know that tes(K 3 ) = 2. The total edge irregularity strength of K 4 equals 3 as can be seen from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">3</ref>) and from the following matrix L(4) expressing a suitable labelling j:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">L(4) = ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 3 2 1 2 3 2 3 3 3 ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ .</formula><p>For K 5 the inequality (3) gives tes(K 5 ) 4. However, we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">Theorem 7. tes(K 5 ) = 5.</formula><p>Proof. The upper bound 5 is given by the labelling j expressed by j-matrix of K 5 below</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">L(5) = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ 1 1 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 2 5 5 4 1 5 4 5 4 1 5 5 3 ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ .</formula><p>To prove that tes(K 5 ) 5, let us proceed by contradiction. Suppose tes(K 5 )=4. Then the edges of K 5 must have weights 3, 4, 5, . . . , 11, 12. The existence of an edge e = ab with wt(e) = 12 forces j(e) = j(a) = j(b) = 4. Also, in K 5 , there must be an edge f = xy with wt(f ) = 3 and j(f ) = j(x) = j(y) = 1. Because the edges ax, ay, bx, and by have one vertex labelled with label 1 and the second vertex labelled with label 4 their labels must be distinct. As tes(K 5 ) = 4 we have {j(ax), j(ay), j(bx), j(by)}={1, 2, 3, 4} and so {wt(ax), wt(ay), wt(bx), wt(by)}={6, 7, 8, 9}. The remaining four edges must receive the weights 4, 5, 10 and 11. The fifth vertex of K 5 cannot be labelled with a label larger than 2, otherwise the weight 4 cannot be attained and it cannot be labelled with a label less than 3, otherwise the weight 11 cannot be attained. This produces a contradiction.</p><p>We believe that the following holds Conjecture 1. tes(K p ) = (p 2p + 4)/6 for any p 6.</p><p>We have verified this conjecture for 6 p 20. The next two theorems were motivated by our desire to explore labellings of graphs with a vertex of maximum degree beyond the constraints of Theorem 3(ii).</p><p>First we present the total edge irregularity strength of W n , the wheel with n + 1 vertices.</p><p>Theorem 8. tes(W n ) = (2n + 2)/3 for n 3.</p><p>Proof. Let W n be the wheel with</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">V (W n ) = {v} ∪ {v i : 1 i n} and E(W n ) = {vv i : 1 i n} ∪ {v i v i+1 : 1 i n - 1} ∪ {v n v 1 }.</formula><p>That (2n + 2)/3 is a lower bound for tes(W n ) follows from Theorem 1. To show that (2n + 2)/3 is an upper bound for tes(W n ) we describe a total (2n + 2)/3 -labelling for W n .</p><p>For n 6 we construct the function as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">(v) = 2n + 2 3 , (v i ) = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ 1 i f 1 i 2n + 2 3 -2, 2n + 2 3 -2 if i = 2n + 2 3 -1 and i = n, 2n + 2 3 if 2n + 2 3 i n -1, (v i v i+1 ) = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ i if 1 i 2n + 2 3 -3, 1 i f i = 2n + 2 3 -2, 5 i f i = 2n + 2 3 -1, 2n + 2 - 2n + 2 3 -i if 2n + 2 3 i n -2, 4 i f i = n -1, 2 i f i = n, (vv i ) = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ i if 1 i 2n + 2 3 -2, 2 i f i = 2n + 2 3 -1, i - 2n + 2 3 + 4 if 2n + 2 3 i n -1, 3 i f i = n. Observe that wt(v i v i+1 ) = (v i ) + (v i+1 ) + (v i v i+1 ) = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ i + 2 for 1 i 2n + 2 3 -2, 2n + 2 3 + 1 for i = n, 2 2n + 2 3 + 2 for i = n -1, 2 2n + 2 3 + 3 for i = 2n + 2 3 -1, 2n + 2 + 2n + 2 3 -i for 2n + 2 3 i n -2 and wt(vv i ) = (v) + (v i ) + (vv i ) = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ 2n + 2 3 + 1 + i for 1 i 2n + 2 3 -1, 2 2n + 2 3 + 1 for i = n, i + 2n + 2 3 + 4 for 2n + 2 3 i n -1.</formula><p>So the weights of edges of W n under the labelling constitute the set {3, 4, . . . , 2n + 2} and the function is a map from</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">V (W n ) ∪ E(W n ) into 1, 2, . . . , 2n + 2 3 .</formula><p>To take care of W n , 3 n &lt; 6, we give the following special labellings:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">For W 3 : (v) = 3, (v 1 ) = (v 2 ) = 1, (v 3 ) = 2 (vv 1 ) = 2, (vv 2 ) = (vv 3 ) = 3, (v 1 v 2 ) = (v 2 v 3 ) = 1 and (v 1 v 3 ) = 2. For W 4 : (v) = 4, (v 1 ) = (v 2 ) = 1, (v 3 ) = 2, (v 4 ) = 3 (vv 1 ) = (v 1 v 2 ) = (v 1 v 4 ) = (v 2 v 3 ) = 1, (vv 2 ) = 2, (vv 3 ) = (vv 4 ) = (v 3 v 4 ) = 3. For W 5 : (v) = (v 4 ) = 4, (v 1 ) = (v 2 ) = 1, (v 3 ) = 2, (v 5 ) = 3, (vv 1 ) = (v 1 v 2 ) = (v 1 v 5 ) = (v 2 v 3 ) = 1, (vv 2 ) = (vv 3 ) = (vv 5 ) = 2, (vv 4 ) = (v 3 v 4 ) = (v 4 v 5 ) = 4.</formula><p>It is easy to see that these total labellings have the required properties. This concludes the proof.</p><p>Next we determine the total edge irregular strength for friendship graphs.</p><p>The friendship graph F n may be visualised as n triangles sharing a common vertex (but otherwise independent). Alternatively, F n may be considered as an even wheel W 2n with every alternate rim edge missing. This second conceptualisation justifies us referring to the edges adjacent to the vertex of maximum degree as spokes and the remainder of the edges as rim edges. Note that</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">|V (F n )| = 2n + 1 and |E(F n )| = 3n. Theorem 9. tes(F n ) = (3n + 2)/3 .</formula><p>Proof. For the friendship graph F n our aim is to allocate edge weights from the set {3, . . . , 3n + 2} so that each edge receives a distinct weight. Ideally, we would wish to ensure that the largest label is M = (3n + 2)/3 , the minimum largest label by Theorem 1.</p><p>Case 1: n ≡ 1 (mod 2). Label the vertex x of degree = 2n with c = (n + 1)/2. Choose a vertex v 1 and without loss of generality number v 2 , v 3 etc clockwise, with v 1 v 2 ∈ E(F n ). Let s i represent the spoke xv i and r i the rim edge v i v i+1 . Note that the subscript of r is always odd. Define a labelling for the first (n -1)/2 triangles as</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">(r i ) = (v i ) + 1, i ≡ 0 (mod 3), (v i ), i ≡ 1 (mod 3), (v i ) -1, i ≡ 2 (mod 3), (s i ) = i -(v i ) + 1,</formula><p>where 1 i n -1, so we have labelled (n -1)/2 complete triangles and allocated weights from {3, . . . , (3n + 1)/2} such that each edge has a distinct weight.</p><p>For the second part of the labelling we now allocate the largest edge weight, 3n + 2 to a rim edge so that the maximum label is as small as possible. Allocate (v 2n ) = n + 1 = (v 2n-1 ) and (r 2n-1 ) = n. If n + 1 is to be the largest label, then the largest spoke weight can be no greater than (5n + 5)/2. Next we need to allocate weights from the set {(5n + 7)/2, . . . , 3n + 2} to rim edges. Note that the cardinality of this set is (n -1)/2. We may then assign labels to a further n -1 spokes so as to allocate weights from the set {(3n + 9)/2, . . . , (5n + 5)/2}.

To complete the labelling we label the remaining two vertices and rim edge all with the value c and the two remaining spokes with c + 1 and c + 2. This completes our labelling.</p><p>Case 2: n ≡ 0 (mod 2). Label the vertex of maximum degree with c = n/2. The rest of the labelling follows the labelling for Case 1 except that the first part labels only (n/2) -1 complete triangles.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Vertex irregular total labellings</head><p>It is easy to see that irregularity strength s(G) of a graph G is defined only for graphs containing at most one isolated vertex and no connected component of order 2. On the other hand, the total vertex irregularity strength tvs(G) is defined for every graph G. Our first result in this section is Theorem 10. Let G be a graph with no component of order 2.

If we extend this labelling to the vertex set V (G) of G using (v) = 1 for every v ∈ V (G), we obtain a vertex irregular total labelling of G.</p><p>Nierhoff <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> recently proved that for all graphs G with no component of order at most 2 and G = K 3 , the irregularity strength s(G) of G is at most p -1. Using this result and (4) we obtain Corollary 11. Let G be a graph with no component of order 2, G = K 3 . Then tvs(G) p -1.</p><p>Lemma 15. Let be a vertex irregular total labelling of a graph G and let wt be the corresponding weight function on V (G), the vertex set of G. Let e = xy be an edge of G.

(ii) -(v) = (v) for x = v = y, -(x) = (x) -1, -(y) = (y) -1 provided that (x), (y) 2, -(f ) = (f ) for f = e and -(e) = (e) + 1.</formula><p>Note that in Lemma 15 the case when + (e) = 0 corresponds to the deletion of the edge e.</p><p>Theorem 16. Let G be a (p, q)-graph with minimum degree = (G) and maximum degree = (G). Then</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">p + + 1 tvs(G) p + -2 + 1.</formula><p>Proof. Lower bound: The largest value among the weights of vertices of G is at least p + and this weight is the sum of at most + 1 integers. Hence the largest label contributing to this weight must be at least (p + )/( + 1) . Upper bound: Consider K p with the optimal total labelling from the proof of Theorem 14 providing tvs(K p ) = 2. Choose a subgraph of K p isomorphic with G and delete from K p all edges not belonging to G in agreement with Lemma 15. This means that if an edge e = xy is deleted and its label is (e) = k (k = 1 or 2 because tvs(K p ) = 2) then in the new labelling + (x) = (x) + k and + (y) = (y) + k. After the deletion of all the edges of G, the complement of G, the new label j(v) of any vertex of degree d is</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">p -d j(v) 2p -2d.</formula><p>Hence the labels j of vertices of G are at least pand at most 2p -2 . Because of Lemma 15, the weights of vertices of G are the same as in K p and they are mutually distinct. Now the label j(v) of every vertex is decreased by p --1. The new vertex irregular total labelling is obtained with the property that This observation can be used in the proof of:</p><p>The weights of vertices x i , 1 i n, successively attain values 4, 5, 6, . . . , n+3 if all vertices x i , 1 i (2n+3)/4 , receive distinct labels from the set {1, 2, 3, . . . , (2n + 3)/4 } and all vertices x i , (2n + 3)/4 + 1 i n, receive distinct labels from the set {2, 3, 4, . . . , n -(2n + 3)/4 + 1}.</p><p>If n is even and each vertex y i , 1 i n, receives the same label as vertex x i then the weights of vertices y i , 1 i n, constitute the set of consecutive integers {n + 4, n + 5, . . . , 2n + 3}.

Amar and Togni <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> established that the irregularity strength s(T ) of any tree with no vertex of degree 2 is equal to its number of pendant vertices. This provides an upper bound. To prove the lower bound consider the weights of the pendant vertices. The smallest weight among them is at least two and the largest weight has value at least n + 1. Since the weight of any pendant vertex is the sum of two positive integers, the proof is complete.</p><p>The sharpness of the lower bound in Theorem 12 is given by Lemma 13. Let K 1,n be a star with n pendant vertices then</p><p>Proof. It is enough to describe a suitable vertex irregular total labelling.
