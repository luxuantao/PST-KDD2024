<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>HE design of optimal linear filters and predictors is T considered using either an l2 minimum variance estimation error criterion, or a H , minimum estimation error spectrum criterion. The former is a modified Wiener or Kalman filtering problem where colored measurement noise is allowed and a dynamical error weighting function is used. The latter represents a new class of filtering problem motivated by the need to keep the estimation error spectrum small over a range of frequencies. Such a problem may arise in a number of signal processing applications [1]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>For scalar H , estimation problems where the unweighted estimation error is minimized, the optimal error is white noise. Such a device should be valuable in signal detection problems. For control applications it may be necessary to introduce a frequency shaping function so that the optimal error spectral densityfunction will be nonconstant and the error will be nonwhite [ 171.  There are important differences between the H , filter and least-squares based filters. The shape of the estimation error spectrum for the filter can be preselected by appropriate choice of weighting function. The choice of error weighting term is therefore crucial in the design of the H , filter. If, for example, a weighting term with constant gain at high and low frequency is employed which has a resonant peak at frequency wo, then the estimation error will be forced to be a minimum at wo. Thus, in applications where it is imperative to force the error to be small in a particular frequency interval, the H , filter is appropriate. Similarly, if the peak of the error spectrum is to be minimized, an H , filter is valuable.</p><p>The H , approach used in the solution of the problem described here derives from the work of Kwakernaak <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Grimble [7]</ref>, [8] on the related H , robust control problems.</p><p>The problem considered here might be considered using the "standard problem formulation" of Doyle and solved by the recent state-space approach of Doyle et al. <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>. However, the equations presented by Doyle et al. do not define the optimal solution except in the asymptotic case. This is rather different to the polynomial equations which actually define the optimal solution. It is of course true that these equations cannot normally be solved in an explicit manner but must be solved by iterative methods. Thus, the two approaches are different fundamentally and both have open numerical research questions.</p><p>The present work has been brought to fruition in a software package which is now available. It is therefore possible to compute H, filters using this menu driven <ref type="bibr">program.</ref> There are of course several other techniques, particularly the state-space approaches which have their own virtues. Thus, although the importance of the new state-space methods must be recognized, the polynomial approach described here is a possible alternative methodology. There are no claims that this is better than the state-space methods, but it is worthy of investigation. If adaptive filters are to be constructed there may be real virtues in the polynomial approach, since the signal model is normally identified in ARMA (polynomial) form.</p><p>The I, least-squares multichannel filtering problem is first considered in Sections I1 and 111. The H , filtering problem is then embedded within an l2 problem framework using Lemma 3 which links the two classes of problem. The H , estimation problems are considered in the remaining sections and a full solution is given to the scalar problem with supporting examples. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section VIII.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. THE H , OPTIMAL ESTIMATION PROBLEM</head><p>The least-squares type of estimation problem previously considered is based on Hilbert space concepts and the idea of orthogonal projection. In the frequency domain the integral of the estimation error power spectral density is minimized. However, an alternative requirement might be to minimize the magnitude of the estimation error power spectrum. Thus, rather than minimizing the average error power or error variance which might result in a relatively large error power in certain frequency ranges, the peak error power can be minimized.</p><p>By the introduction of frequency weighting functions, in the H , cost-function definition, the error power in selected frequency ranges can be heavily penalized so that the error power is made particularly small in these regions. It follows from the optimality of the estimator that the error power could not be made smaller in these regions, using any other linear filter.</p><p>A frequency weighting function W,,(z-') may, of course, be used in the definition of the l2 cost function (17). However, since the integral of the weighted error spectrum is being minimized</p><p>The effect of the weighting term is less direct than if the H , cost function is minimized</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">J , = sup (Wp@'i.i.W;).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Statement of the H , Estimation Problem</head><p>Consider the discrete-time, linear, time-invariant system shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The problem is to determine the optimal linear estimator H, that minimizes 11 W,, (z-) @ i i ( Z -I ) W;(Z-l)llrn, i.e., it is required to find the H , estimator that minimizes the cost function</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">J , = sup 1 1 W,,(z-') Gii(zF1) W;(z-')llZ (26)</formula><p>where 11 X <ref type="bibr">( 2 -I )</ref> 112 A a{ X ( <ref type="bibr">2 -I )</ref> ] and a denotes the maximum singular value of the matrix X .</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">I : / = I I095</formula><p>The L,/H, problem cannot be solved as simply as the H, problem since L , is not a Hilbert space and hence there is no notion of orthogonal projection from L , onto H,. However, since H, is a subspace [ 161 of H2 it is possible to pose the problem in an H. framework.</p><p>The key idea is to find a suitable link between the H2 and H , estimation problems. A lemma which links the two classes of problem was established by Kwakernaak <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> and is presented below.</p><p>Lemma 3: Auxiliary problem: Consider the auxiliary problem of minimizing:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">(tr { C ( z -' ) X ( z -' ) } ) (27) J = -$ 1 2 r i I:I = I</formula><p>for some function X = X * . Suppose that for some real rational matrix on the unit circle of the</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">z plane C* ( z -' ) = C ( z -I ) &gt; 0 the criterion J is minimized by a function X o ( z -' ) for which X 0 ( z P 1 ) = h'Ir, with h a constant.</formula><p>Then this function also minimizes sup1 ; I = I I X( z -' ) I.</p><p>Proofi Suppose there exists an estimator such that the corresponding X has the property sup (x(z-')I &lt; sup ( X " ( z -' ) ( = A' .</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">\ : I = 1 I;( = 1</formula><p>Then necessarily X ( z-' ) &lt; h21r = X o ( z -' ) for all I z 1 = 1, which implies that this contradicts the assumption that X o minimizes (27). Hence, the above hypothesis is false.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Lambda Equution</head><p>Note from Lemma 3, at the minimum of the l2 cost function, the integrand must equal CA'. Thus, if the l2 filtering results of Lemma 1 are to be applied, the integrand of (21) (after the introduction of the C weighting) must equal CA2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Scalar Minimax Estitnutor</head><p>To simplify the analysis, emphasis will now be placed on the scalar filtering problem. Before invoking Lemma 3, a fictitious l2 problem must be constructed where the C function is introduced into the cost index. Recall that the H , cost function is defined by (26). The fictitious l2 problem must have a cost index (21) which includes the C function. This can be achieved by modifying the definition of the cost weighting Po = WF W/, so that W/, (stable and minimum phase) is replaced by W, W,, where W, W,* = E. The unknown FoDf*-'D;lF,* (28) will then have a factor C and hence the 1, criterion ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>) can be written in the form of ( <ref type="formula">27</ref>) where X equals the modified left-hand side of ( <ref type="formula">28</ref>) after the extraction of C.</p><p>If</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">Wll = A,,-'B,, is replaced by W,W, = A ; ' B , A ~' B ,</formula><p>where W, A l l B , and A,, B, are assumed to be strictly Hunvitz polynomials, then A,, must be replaced by A,A, and B,, by B,, B,.

These equations can be solved by several techniques, for the unknown polynomials ( G2, S2, F , ) and the scalar A. For example, iterative techniques may be applied, such as successive approximation algorithms.</p><p>Note that when the signal model is stable, the solution of the linear equations (73), (74) can be found using only (73) (this is the usual case).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Low Measurement Noise</head><p>If then no spectral factor A , will exist. Thus, the value of A2 must be greater than or equal to A', . In the case where the infimum X2 = A', is achieved, the polynomial A , has a zero on the unit circle. The cost function (27) is infinite ( A , = A , = 0 ) in this case and the auxiliary problem does not provide the H , solution. This is called the nongeneric case. However, although Lemma 3 does not a ply, the optimal filter does give an equalizing solution Xg( z-' ) = Xi. Since our H , filtering theorem was generated assuming this equalizing solution existed and X2 cannot be smaller than A',, the equations presented do define the optimal estimator. Although the link to the l2 optimization problem (through Lemma 3), does not apply in this case and also the minimum degree requirement on F, does not hold, we still have a solution for the problem. This will be mentioned again in Section V-D.</p><p>In the generic case, the polynomial F, is of minimum degree or deg(F,) &lt; g and the results do relate to the solution of the l2 estimation problem. The polynomial A,, is strictly Hurwitz and X2 &gt; Ai.</p><p>In the nongeneric case, the deg (F,) equals g and X2 = A; . Since, as mentioned above, the link to the l2 problem is broken in the nongeneric case this solution is not unique. For example, AAA: = ( -A h ) ( -A,,) * and hence two solutions can be found giving the same minimum cost but involving two different realizations of the optimal estimator.</p><p>There are numerous algorithms (see the next section)</p><p>for solving H , filtering problems for the generic case [ 1 11.</p><p>If Ah is found to be non-Hurwitz, this indicates the existence of a nongeneric solution. The computation of the optimal estimator is then straightforward.</p><p>In most cases, only (73) needs to be solved since (74) is automatically satisfied. However, if the signal model is unstable it may be necessary to solve the equations simultaneously [ 12 J .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>A polynomial approach to the solution of the f, linear optimal prediction and filtering problems was first presented. The noise model included both white and colored noise components, and a frequency response shaping filter was introduced as a dynamical weighting operator.</p><p>A new type of linear estimation problem was then introduced which was related to the minimax control problems considered by Zames [ 141, Kwakernaak [6], Francis Computational algorithms for the solution of the H , estimation problem were described. Examples were also presented to illustrate the computational methods and the procedures. It was seen from these examples that the solution procedure was rather simple and that it does not require high level mathematical tools. It can therefore easily be adopted by control engineers with the numerical support of standard software packages, such as MATLAB or <ref type="bibr">Control-C.</ref> It was also clear that H , filters have interesting and different properties to their f2 counterparts. For example, the H, filter with constant weighting enabled the peak of the error spectrum to be reduced considerably. Moreover, by introducing frequency weighting, the error in particular frequency ranges can be reduced to lower values than is possible with an f2 type of filter.</p><p>It is an unusual property of the H , filter that the shape of the error spectrum is completely determined a priori by the inverse of the weighting function, whatever the signal and noise model descriptions. The minimum of the error spectrum is determined by the peak of the weighting function and because of the optimality of the filter is the lowest value which can be achieved for any linear filter.</p><p>Thus, the H , filter is suitable for applications which require the error spectrum to be made uniformly small, or the error in a particular frequency range to be made as low as possible.</p><p>The main benefits of the approach should appear in important applications such as window design <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, ship po-sitioning systems which require low estimation error in certain frequency ranges <ref type="bibr">[ 171, radar detection [ 181,</ref> and systems with poorly defined transmission channels [ 2 11.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 ,</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1, Signal and noise models</figDesc></figure>
