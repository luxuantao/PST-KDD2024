<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>With the recent advances in information networks, the problem of community detection has attracted much attention in the last decade. While network community detection has been ubiquitous, the task of collecting complete network data remains challenging in many real-world applications. Usually the collected network is incomplete with most of the edges missing. Commonly, in such networks, all nodes with attributes are available while only the edges within a few local regions of the network can be observed. In this paper, we study the problem of detecting communities in incomplete information networks with missing edges. We first learn a distance metric to reproduce the link-based distance between nodes from the observed edges in the local information regions. We then use the learned distance metric to estimate the distance between any pair of nodes in the network. A hierarchical clustering approach is proposed to detect communities within the incomplete information networks. Empirical studies on real-world information networks demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively detect community structures within incomplete information networks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Information networks arise naturally in a wide range of domains. Examples include biological networks, publication networks and social networks. In these networks, fea-Copyright is held by the International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2). Distribution of these papers is limited to classroom use, and personal use by others.</p><p>WWW 2012, <ref type="bibr">April 16-20, 2012</ref>, Lyon, France.</p><p>ACM 978-1-4503-1229-5/12/04. ture vectors are usually available which are associated with nodes. Links represent relationships between the nodes. Identifying communities in information networks is a crucial step to understand the network structures. The community is defined as a group of nodes which are densely connected inside the group, while loosely connected with the nodes outside the group.</p><p>Community detection in network data has been extensively studied in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref>. Conventional approaches focus on detecting communities based upon linkage information. They assume that the complete linkage information within the entire network is available. However, in many real-world networks, such as terroristattack information networks, the complete linkages are very difficult or even impossible to obtain. Instead, the complete linkage information is only available within a few small local regions. We notice that a similar problem has also been studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. However, in this paper, we focus on incomplete information networks with local information regions. For example, in work relation networks, it is usually impossible to obtain the complete linkage information among all the people. But usually we can afford to obtain the work relationships within a small number of local regions, such as groups or organizations. These networks are called incomplete information networks in this paper. The local regions with complete linkage information are called local information regions. An incomplete information network with local information regions is shown in the upper left level of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Some real-world examples for community detection in incomplete information networks are listed as follows:</p><p>• Terrorist-attack network. Let us consider a terrorist attack activity networks within a period in a certain country. Each node in the network represents a terrorist activity. Terrorist attacks committed by the same terrorist organization are linked with each other. Investigating the community structures within these networks is a challenging problem, since most of the connections/links between attacks are not clearly resolved. Detecting the communities in these incomplete information networks is crucial for analyzing the structures of terrorist-attack activities.</p><p>• Food Web The food web of a large ecosystem is usually a highly complex network. Each node in the network represents a living organism, while the links rep-  resent the relations between them. Usually, it is very difficult to resolve all of the links within a food web. However, it is relatively easier to figure out some local regions within the food web. Discovering communities in these incomplete food webs can help us identify micro ecosystems and the corresponding living organisms of each micro ecosystem.</p><p>Finding communities in incomplete information networks is a challenging task. Conventional graph-based clustering methods can not be directly applied to it. The reason is that traditional graph clustering methods, such as normalized cut based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> and modularity based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, mainly focus on the topological structure of the network. Since most of the links are absent in incomplete information networks, it is impossible to cluster the network with this kind of methods. As shown in the middle level of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, if we cluster the nodes using the traditional attribute based methods such as k-means, the most likely result is that we place nodes with the most similar attributes in the same cluster. However, the nodes which are densely connected in structure may not necessarily mean they have the most similar attributes, i.e., they may be only similar on a subset of the attributes. For example, in the food web networks, a community usually stands for a micro ecosystem and can contain various kinds of living organisms, which can have very different attributes. Recently, some new algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> which perform clustering based on both structures and the attributes of the network are proposed. However, they can not be applied on incomplete information networks due to the absence of the complete linkage structure.</p><p>Given the assumption that the structure of the network has a close relation with attributes of each object in the information network, in this paper, we propose a novel approach for community detection in incomplete information networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to formulate and address the incomplete information network problem. The main idea of our approach is that, since the structure of the network has a strong relation with the attributes of the objects in the network, we can learn a global distance metric from the local information regions with complete linkage information. Then, we use the global metric to measure the distance between any pair of nodes in the network. Because the metric is learned from the structure of the network, the distance will reflect the hidden linkage structure in the network. Finally, we propose a distance-based clustering algorithm to cluster the nodes in the incomplete information network. The different clustering results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. To summarize, this work contributes on the following aspects:</p><p>• We identify and define the problem of community detection in incomplete information networks with local information regions, i.e., an incomplete information network that still has a few tiny local regions where the complete linkage information is available.</p><p>• In order to find a measurement, which can reflect the structural relation between the nodes in incomplete information networks, we cast the side information of the network into an optimization problem. Then a metric, which can be used to measure the distance between any pair of nodes, is learned.</p><p>• Based on the learned metric, we devise a distancebased modularity function to evaluate the quality of the communities.</p><p>• Finally, we propose a distance-based algorithm DSHRINK which can discover the hierarchical and overlapped communities. Moreover, in order to speedup the clustering process, an effective strategy is also taken.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. We introduce the related work in Section 2. The formal definition of our problem is presented in Section 3. In Section 4, we introduce how to make use of the side information to learn a global metric. In Section 5, we explain the distance-based clustering algorithm. The experimental results are presented in Section 6. Finally, we conclude in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">RELATED WORK</head><p>Community detection in networks and graphs has been widely studied in recently years <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4]</ref>. Many approaches mainly focused on the topological structures based on various criteria including modularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, normalized cut <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>, structural density <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> and partition density <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. Given a graph, which is clustered into k communities, the modularity function Q is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Q = k i=1 li L - di 2L 2 (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>where L is the number of edges in the graph, li is the number of edges between nodes within community i, and di is the sum of the degrees of the nodes in community i. The optimal clustering result is achieved by maximizing the modularity value which ranges from 0 to 1. In general, maximizing Q is a NP-hard problem. Hence, many heuristic approaches, which try to approximate the optimal modularity value, were proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. Such approaches include greedy agglomeration <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>, mathematical programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>, spectral methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, simulated annealing <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, sampling techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, etc. However, modularity is not a scale-invariant measure, and therefor, by relying on its maximization, can not detect communities smaller than a certain size <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. Besides, Palla et. al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> proposed a clique percolation method, which can detect overlapped communities, but is not suitable for detecting hierarchical structures. Huang et. al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> proposed a parameter-free algorithm SHRINK, which can not only discover overlapped and hierarchical communities but also the hub nodes and outliers among them. Rosvall et. al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> tried to compress the information of the graph by optimizing the minimum description length of the random walk and proposed a highly accurate algorithm namely Infomap. Ahn et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref> insisted that link communities are fundamental building blocks, and the overlapped and hierarchical communities in networks are two aspects of the same phenomenon. They proposed a link-based approach which reveals the real world communities effectively. Other link-based methods were also devised by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>.</p><p>There are also some graph clustering methods which based on attributes. Tian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> proposed an OLAP-style aggregation approach to summarize large graphs by grouping nodes based on user-selected attributes and relationships. This method achieves homogeneous attribute values within clusters but ignores the intra-cluster topological structures. Tsai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> proposed a feature weight self-adjustment mechanism for k-means clustering. In that study, finding the appropriate weight is modeled as an optimization problem which tries to minimize the separations within clusters and maximize the separations between clusters. Since most of the attributes based methods mainly focus on the homogeneity of the clusters, the cohesive internal structure of the clusters can not be guaranteed.</p><p>Recently, some clustering methods based on both links and attributes were also proposed. <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref> introduced the connected k-center(CkC) problem, which checks whether an attributed graph can be partitioned or not by considering both attributes and the links. Since the CkC problem is NPcomplete, the authors proposed a constant factor approximation algorithm and a heuristic algorithm for the large data sets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> proposed SA-Cluster, which is based on both structural and attribute similarities through a unified distance measure. In that study, a graph is partitioned into k clusters so that each cluster contains a densely connected subgraph with homogeneous attribute values. Then, in order to learn the degree of contributions of structural similarity and attribute similarity automatically, an effective method was proposed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">PROBLEM DEFINITION</head><p>In this section, we formally define our problem and introduce several related concepts.</p><p>Definition 1 (Information Network) An information network is denoted as G = (V, E, A), where V is the set of vertices, E ⊆ V ×V is the set of edges, and A = a1, a2, ..., a |V | is the set of node attributes which describe the properties of vertices in V .</p><p>For convenience, we use A(v) to denote the attribute vector of node v and E(U ) to represent the edges among nodes in U (U ⊆ V ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 2 (IIN) Incomplete Information Networks with</head><p>Local Information Regions (IIN) are defined as follows: given an information network G = (V, E, A) and a network G = (V , E , A ), network G is called an incomplete information network with local information regions of G iff (1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">V = V, E ⊂ E (2) ∀v ∈ V , ∀v ∈ V, if v = v , then A (v ) = A(v). (3) ∃V ⊆ V , for ∀e ∈ E(V ), then e ∈ E (V ).</formula><p>Specifically, we call the local subnetwork g(V , E , A ) as the local information region denoted by L, where E = E(V ) and A = A(V ).</p><p>From Definition 2, we know that an incomplete information network with local information regions is a network G = (V , E , A ) with a small set of connected regions V ⊂ V , where the edges in E -E(V ) are missing. There can be many different types of incomplete information networks. In this paper, we focus on the incomplete information network that has some local information regions, where the linkage structures are completely preserved as in Definition 2. For the remaining of the paper, we will just refer to this type of "incomplete information network with local information regions" as incomplete information network. Obviously, there can be more than one local information regions in an incomplete information network G . Furthermore, when we are talking about an incomplete information network, we assume that there is a corresponding information network, potentially. A typical incomplete information network is shown in the upper left level in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. For an information network G, if C = C1, C2, ..., C k is the set of clusters which are based on the linkage structures of G, we formalize our community detection problem as: given an incomplete information network G of G and the dissimilar node-pair set D, based on some similar criteria, the objective is to find the set C which should be as similar as possible to C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK</head><p>In this section, we address the problem of how to learn a global metric which is used to measure the distance between any pair of nodes in an incomplete information network G . This goal is achieved by solving an optimization problem, which makes use of the side information getting from the link relations of G and the dissimilar node-pair set D.</p><p>Definition 4 (Structure Similarity) Given a network G = (V, E), for any pair of nodes vi, vj ∈ V , the structure similarity between node vi and vj is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">s(vi, vj ) = |Γ(vi) ∩ Γ(vj)| |Γ(vi) Γ(vj )|<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where Γ(v) is the set containing v and its neighbors. We compute the structure similarity between any pair of nodes ui, vi in local information region Li by Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(2)</ref>. Then, we define the similar node-pair set S as a 3-tuple set about the structure similarity as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">S = {(ui, vi, si)|si = s(ui, vi), ui, vi ∈ V (Li)}<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Based on the similar node-pair set S and the dissimilar node-pair set D, our objective is to find a metric by which, the similar nodes should be close together and the dissimilar nodes should be far away from each other. Moreover, the extent of closeness between any pair of similar nodes should be based on the structure similarity between them. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, this objective can be achieved by learning a distance metric. Let the matrix M ∈ R m×m represent the distance metric. Then, the distance between any two nodes ui, vi ∈ V is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">dM(ui, vi) = ui -vi M = (ui -vi) T M(ui -vi) (4)</formula><p>In order to make sure the distance metric defined by Equation (4) satisfies non-negativity and the triangle inequality, we constraint M to be positive semi-definite. Now, we can formalize our objective as an optimization problem as follows: min</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">M (u i ,v i )∈S (si ui -vi M) 2 s.t. u i ,v i ∈D ui -vi M ≥ w M 0 (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">)</formula><p>where w is a constant. We notice that our objective function ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">5</ref>) is a linear function of M. Further more, both of the constraints given in Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">5</ref>) are convex. Hence, our optimization problem is convex, which enables us to compute the global optimal resolution.</p><p>Despite our optimization problem falls into the category of convex programming, it does not fall into any special class of convex programming, e.g., quadratic programming and semi-definite programming. Hence, the global solution can only be solved by a generic approach. We also notice that the learned optimal M can appear in two forms, which are diagonal matrix and full matrix.</p><p>In order to get the diagonal form of M, we give the equivalent Equations (5) similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">f (M) = f (M11, ..., Mnn) = u i ,v i ∈S s 2 i ui -vi 2 M -log   (u i ,v i )∈D ui, -vi M  <label>(6)</label></formula><p>Minimizing Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">6</ref>) can be resolved by using the Newton-Raphson method. Furthermore, in order to keep the semidefinite characteristics of M, we replace the Newton update H -1 f by αH -1 f , where α is the a step-size parameter optimized via a line-search which gives the largest downhill steps subject to Mii ≥ 0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</p><p>In order to get the full matrix of M, we give the equivalent Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">5</ref>) similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">max M g(M) = (u i ,v i )∈D ui, vi M s.t. h(M) = (u i ,v i )∈S (si ui, vi M) 2 ≤ w M 0<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The reason for giving the transformation of the original optimization problem is for efficiently finding the global optimal full matrix M by using gradient descent and the idea of iterative projections <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. We first use a gradient ascent on g(M) to optimize <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(7)</ref>. Then, we project the intermediate results to hold the constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(7)</ref>. The similar tricks are also used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Besides, we notice that in Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">7</ref>), w is a constant whose value is not important. This is because the distance between any pair of nodes in network G is a relative variable. Changing the value of w only makes the distance between any pair of nodes ui and vi change from uivi M to w 2 uivi M. Hence, we choose w = 1 in this paper. For the convenience of discussion, we denote the incomplete information network as G = (V, E, A, M) in the rest of the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">DISTANCE-BASED CLUSTERING</head><p>By optimizing our objective function, we have learned a matrix M in section 4. In other words, we have gotten a metric which can be used to measure the distance between any two nodes in graph G. Inspired by the density-based clustering approaches, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref>, which cluster nodes from the higher density to lower density, in this section, we propose a distance-based clustering approach DSHRINK which can detect the overlapped and hierarchical communities hidden in the graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Distanced-based Modularity</head><p>The distance-based clustering approach DSHRINK places the nodes which have the shorter distance with each other into the same cluster, and the nodes which have the longer distance between them into different clusters. In order to evaluate the quality of clusters, we define the distance-based modularity as follows:</p><p>Definition 5 (Distance-based Modularity) Given an incomplete information network G = (V, E, A, M) and its cluster C = {C1, C2, ..., C k }, the distance-based modularity Q d is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Q d = k i=1 D I i D T - D C i D T 2 (8)</formula><p>where k is the number of clusters, D I i = u,v∈C i dM(u, v) is the sum of distance between any pair of nodes within cluster Ci, D C i = u∈C i ,v∈V dM(u, v) is the sum of distance between any node in cluster Ci and any node in the network G, and D T = u,v∈V dM(u, v) is the sum of distance between any two nodes in the network G.</p><p>Obviously, in contrast to the original modularity defined by Newman <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, the value range of Distance-based Modularity is [-1, 0]. If Q d = 0, it means all the nodes are either placed into one cluster or placed into different clusters randomly. The smaller value of Q d means the better quality of clustering.</p><p>Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref>, if we combine any two modules Cs and Ct, the distance-based modularity gain Q d achieved from the combination can be computed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Q d = Q Cs∪Ct d -Q Cs -Q Ct = 2D U st D T - 2D C s D C t (D T ) 2<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where D U st = u∈Cs,v∈Ct dM(u, v) is the sum of distance between any two nodes in modules Cs and Ct respectively.</p><p>According to Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">9</ref>), we compute the gain of distancebased modularity Q d for combing j clusters C1, C2, ..., Cj into a new community by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Q d (j) = s,t∈{1,...,j},s =t 2D U st D T - s,t∈{1,...,j},s =t 2D C s D C t (D T ) 2 (10)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Clustering Algorithm</head><p>Before addressing our algorithm in detail, we give the following definitions.</p><p>Definition 6 (Nearest Neighbor) Given an incomplete information network G = (V, E, A, M), the nearest neighbor set for ∀v ∈ V is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">NN(v) = {y|y = arg min x dM(v, x), x ∈ V ∧ x = v}. (11) Definition 7 (Mutual Nearest Neighbor) Given an incomplete information network G = (V, E, A, M), any pair of nodes u, v ∈ V is said to be mutual nearest neighbor, denoted by u γ ↔ v, i ffv ∈ NN(u) ∧ u ∈ NN(v) ∧ dM(u, v) = γ, where γ ∈ R + .</formula><p>Definition 8 (Local Community) Given an incomplete information network G = (V, E, A, M), we call the subgraph</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">C(v) = (V , E , A , M, γ) of G as a local community iff (1) v ∈ V ; (2) ∀u ∈ V , ∃v ∈ V ∧ (u γ ↔ v); (3) {u|u ∈ V ∧ u γ ↔ v∧v / ∈ V } = ∅. γ ∈ R + is the radius of the local community C(v).</formula><p>The distance-based shrinking approach DSHRINK is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. Our approach can be divided into two phases. At the first phase, we compute the distance between any pair of nodes in graph G and store the distance as a 3-tuple (vi, vj , dM(vi, vj )) into a map structure (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). For any vi ∈ V , the sum of the distance between node vi and any other node vj ∈ V is saved in</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">S T i . Since D C s = v i ∈Cs,v j ∈V dM(vi, vj ) = v i ∈Cs S T i , computing S T i</formula><p>in advance can speed up computing D C s when computing Q d . For the same purpose, the total distance D T between any pair of node is also be computed.</p><p>At the second phase, (1) we first begin at an arbitrary node and span the node to a local community based on Definition 8. All the nodes, which are in the local community, will be tagged as "visited". Then, we choose the next unvisited node in graph G and repeat the above step. This process will not stop until all the nodes are visited. (2) Secondly, for each local community discovered by the first step, we view each single node in it as a community. Then Q d is computed according to Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref>. which means the combination of the communities can decrease the total distance-based modularity Q d , we shrink the local community as a super node. Otherwise, the local community will not be shrunk. (3) Thirdly, we tag all the nodes including super nodes and the common nodes as "unvisited" and repeat the first and second steps. The above steps will be repeated many times until shrinking any local maximal community can not decrease the Q d any more.

Single nodes, which have not been shrunk to any other super nodes, are viewed as hubs or outliers depending on how many communities they are close to. If we want to form the overlapped communities, the hub nodes will be placed into more than one communities. Otherwise, each hub node will only be placed into the community which makes the most decrease of Q d by adding the hub node.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Speeding up the Clustering Process with Approximation</head><p>It is possible to speed up the clustering process by allowing some approximation in the determination of the local community. We define -approximate mutual nearest neighbor and -approximate local community as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Definition 9 ( -approximation Mutual Nearest Neighbor) Given an incomplete information network G = (V, E, A, M), any pair of nodes u, v ∈ V is said to be -approximation mutual nearest neighbor in G, denoted by u ↔ v, iff (v ∈ NN(u) ∧ |dM(u, v) -dM(v, x)| ≤ ) ∨ (u ∈ NN(v) ∧ |dM(u, v) -dM(u, y)| ≤ ), where x ∈ NN(v), y ∈ NN(u), ∈ R + .</formula><p>Obviously, -approximate mutual nearest neighbor is an extended version of mutual nearest neighbor.</p></div>

In order to take advantage of -approximation local community, the only difference in DSHRINK is to span a -approximation local community instead of a local community in step <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref>. When we span the -approximation local community ( &gt; 0), the final clustering result may rely on the visiting sequence of the nodes. In this paper, we give priority to the shorter distance nodes among all of the -approximation neighbours when spanning the -approximation local communities. Our experimental results show that the final clustering effect is almost not affected by the order of the visiting sequence of nodes by taking the above strategy. Furthermore, given an appropriate parameter , we find that this relaxation does not affect the practical quality of the communities obtained. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">EXPERIMENTS</head><p>In this section, we use two real-world data sets to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. All the experiments are conducted on a machine with Intel 8-core 2.7 GHz processors and 28GB memory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Data Sets</head><p>DBLP-A Dataset: DBLP-A is the data set extracted from DBLP database<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> which provides bibliographic information on computer science journals and proceeding. We extract paper information from 16 top conferences which cover 6 research fields including Artificial Intelligence, Information Retrieval, Computer Vision, etc. We create the coauthor network by choosing authors, who published at least 2 papers during 2000 -2010, as the nodes of the network. Any pair of authors who have coauthored are linked in this coauthor network. This coauthor network contains 4638 nodes and 16447 links in total. Each node is attached with a bag-of-words which extracted from the paper titles published by him/her. We first apply the standard text preprocessing such as stemming, stop words removal. Then we reduce the dimension of the bag-of-words to 100 by PCA and use them as the features of the corresponding node. In addition, the number of co-authors and publications are also used as features of the nodes.</p><p>DBLP-B Dataset: We also extract paper information from 16 top conferences of 6 research fields such as Algorithms &amp; Theory, Natural Language Processing, Bioinformatics, etc. The same setups with DBLP-A are also used here to build the coauthor network as our second data set, called DBLP-B.</p><p>We summarize our data sets in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Incomplete Information Network Generation</head><p>In order to simulate the incomplete information networks with local information regions, we use the following experiment setting. If we perform random sampling on the nodes, the sampled network usually ends up being sparsely connected, without local information regions. In this paper, we use the snowball sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> to sample a group of connected local region at a time. We randomly sample one node and use BFS to include its neighboring nodes into the sampled region until a fixed number of nodes are sampled. We repeat this process until a number of local regions are sampled. Then we assume the links within the local informative regions are available to the algorithms, while the remaining links in the network are removed. In order to control the total number of nodes being sampled, we introduce a parameter p, called sample ratio, i.e., the ratio of the nodes in the network being sampled into the local region. In addition, we introduce another parameter q, called local information region size, to control the size of each local information region. In detail, we first randomly choose a node in the network. We then include q% nodes from its neighbors using BFS search. Common neighbors of any pair of nodes in the sampled region are further included into the sampled local region. The above sampling process continues until we sample p% of the nodes in the network. In addition to the local regions, we sample the same number of nodes and use them to generate dissimilar pairwise constraints. In the sampled group, the pairs of nodes that are in different classes are then used as the dissimilar node-pair set D. More concretely, for DBLP-A and DBLP-B datasets, we choose the pair of authors, whose research fields are not overlapped as the dissimilar node pair.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Evaluation Measures</head><p>In order to measure the effectiveness of our approach, we adopt Purity to evaluate the quality of the communities generated by different approaches. The definition of purity is as follows: each cluster is first assigned with the most frequent class in the cluster, and then the purity is measured by computing the number of the instances assigned with the same labels in all clusters. Formally:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">Purity = 1 n k i=1 max j |Ci ∩ lj|<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where {C1, • • • , C k } is the set of clusters, lj is the j-th class label. The value of purity ranges from 0 to 1. The community structure generated by each compared method will be evaluated using the true label of each node such that the higher purity value means the higher accuracy of the method. Since each author can have multiple research areas as its class labels. We computed the purity of the clustering results based on each label separately, and the average results over 6 labels are reported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Compared Methods</head><p>In order to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, we compare our approach with the following methods:</p><p>• Kmeans: We use the default Euclidean metric to measure the distance between any node xi and the centroid x k .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5">Effectiveness Results</head><p>The variation of purity scores under different values of p% is given in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. In this experiments, q% = 0.3% is used. Since the accuracy of KMeans is not affected by the number of sampling nodes, the purity value of the KMeans is a horizontal line in all cases. We notice that the purity scores of M f +DSHRINK and M d +DSHRINK ascend quickly with the increasing number of local information regions sampled. Especially, when p% &gt; 2%, the purity values of M f +DSHRINK and M d +DSHRINK exceed kmeans over all data sets. That is because, firstly, the learned Mahalanobis matrix M rescales all of the nodes into a new feature space, where the similar nodes are closer, and the dissimilar nodes are further away than the original Euclidean space. Secondly, DSHRINK can automatically detect the most appropriate number of communities by minimizing the distance-based modularity. Since the number of communities in the networks is unknown, M f +DSHRINK and M d +DSHRINK have more advantage for discovering the most appropriate community structures than Kmeans. Another observation is that, in most of the cases, with the same value of p%, the purity scores of M f +DSHRINK are a little higher than M d +DSHRINK in both DBLP-A and DBLP-B data sets. This demonstrates that the full Mahalanobis matrix performs better rescaling function for separating the similar nodes from the dissimilar nodes than diagonal Mahalanobis matrix in DBLP-A and DBLP-B data sets. However, this principle dose not not always hold. For instance, in DBLP-A data set, the purity score of M f +DSHRINK is less than M d +DSHRINK when p% = 8%.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, given a specified value of p% = 10%, we also present the changes of purity scores with the different value of q%. We notice that, on the one hand, for a specified p% = 10%, the larger value of q% makes more similar node pairs be captured in each local information region, but fewer local information regions get chosen in the whole incomplete information network. On the other hand, with the smaller value of q%, fewer similar node pairs can be captured in each local information region, but more local information regions can be sampled. Since both the number of local information regions and the number of similar node pairs can affect the learning of the metric, finding the balance point of q% is critical for achieving a better clustering result.</p><p>From Figures <ref type="figure">5 (a</ref>) to (b), we know that the balance point of q% can be gotten between 0.5% to 0.7%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6">Efficiency Results</head><p>We notice that, computing the optimal Mahalanobis matrix and the distance between any pair of nodes can be accomplished in advance before clustering process. In this part, we mainly focus on the clustering process and test how -approximation local community speeds up the clustering process and affects the quality of clusters. The distance here is relative and changeable according to different values of w in Equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>). Hence, discussing the value of is meaningless with a special value of w. Fortunately, we find the top k nearest nodes of each node is a good base for us to compute the appropriate value. In order to compute an appropriate value, we average the sum of distance between each node and its corresponding top k nearest nodes as follows:</p><p>where T opK(i) is the set of node index, whose distance to vi ranks in the top k among all of the nodes to vi, and |N | is the total number of nodes in the incomplete information network. In this paper, we choose k = 10 and give the value of as = d × b. For a specified incomplete information network G and a metric M, the value of d is a constant. Therefor, changing the value of b is equivalent to change the value of . In Figures <ref type="figure">6(a</ref>) to (b), we have illustrated the variation in the efficiency of different b values for M f +DSHRINK and M d +DSHRINK. We observe that the computation time decreases quickly with the increasing value of b. It is because relaxing the definition of local community to a certain extent can decrease the iteration times in the clustering process. We also find that the purity score are not changed dramatically with differenct b values.</p></div>

While the traditional community detection algorithms make the assumption of the full knowledge of linkage information, they can not solve the problem</p></div>			</div>
