<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper is concerned with the collective behaviors of robots beyond the nearest neighbor rules, i.e., dispersion and flocking, when robots interact with others by applying an acute angle test (AAT)-based interaction rule. Different from a conventional nearest neighbor rule or its variations, the AAT-based interaction rule allows interactions with some far-neighbors and excludes unnecessary nearest neighbors. The resulting dispersion and flocking hold the advantages of scalability, connectivity, robustness, and effective area coverage. For the dispersion, a spring-like controller is proposed to achieve collision-free coordination. With switching topology, a new fixedtime consensus-based energy function is developed to guarantee the system stability. An upper bound of settling time for energy consensus is obtained, and a uniform time interval is accordingly set so that energy distribution is conducted in a fair manner. For the flocking, based on a class of generalized potential functions taking nonsmooth switching into account, a new controller is proposed to ensure that the same velocity for all robots is eventually reached. A co-optimizing problem is further investigated to accomplish additional tasks, such as enhancing communication performance, while maintaining the collective behaviors of mobile robots. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>W ITH the development of wireless communication tech- nologies and the advancement in microprocessors, control of networked systems has received considerable attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In particular, for a team of mobile robots, some results show how to control robots to fulfill complex tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, such as environmental monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, containment control, and target tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Compared with a single robot, a group of robots have advantages in terms of robustness, energy saving and self-healing capability. Over the last decade, cooperative control of multiagent/robot systems has focused on using local interactions to capture collective behaviors, i.e., rendezvous, formation control, dispersion, and flocking <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. More specifically, rendezvous or swarming is concerned with designing distributed control strategies to achieve agreement on the location of robots. Formation control focuses on deploying robots on locations that maintain a specific distance between each other in order to create a desired formation. Dispersion aims to disperse the initially close-located agents in the workspace. Flocking concentrates on achieving velocity matching with respect to its neighbors.</p><p>The majority of cooperative control problems are solved under an assumption of a nearest neighbor rule, which allows each agent to interact with the other's that are located within a circle of radius R <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Some collective behaviors are first explored under fixed network topology. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, a multiagent system eventually stops moving using properly designed repulsive and attractive potential functions. But in practical circumstances, it is more natural to consider the addition and deletion of edges as agents moving around, which means that the topology is switching. Along this line, a flocking algorithm incorporating a navigational feedback is proposed to track a virtual leader <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, and the flock-tracking is further fulfilled in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> when only a fraction of agents have information access to the leader. Using the nearest neighbor rule, a common assumption for cooperative control is that the connectivity is maintained all the time, which is restrictive in reality. In order to address this issue, based on the nearest neighbor rule, a hysteresis-based rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> is proposed to formally guarantee the connectivity. It is assumed that a link between two agents can only be built if their distance is smaller than R -δ (0 &lt; δ &lt; R), and the introduction of δ brings a lagging effect on the link addition. Using a nonincreasing Lyapunov-like energy function, it is proved that the added new links never tend to reach R, i.e., the connectivity is guaranteed. The hysteresis-based rule is enhanced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, where link deletion is regulated by local estimates of the global network and a tie breaking mechanism. Instead of regulating links directly, a framework is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> to control the topology-both link deletion and addition-using the mobility of agents. The aforementioned results <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> have a common shortcoming-when the neighbor set for each robot becomes large, the system is not scalable. In fact, in many cases of cooperative control, agents are initially closely located in an area to mimic specific scenarios (e.g., robots are dispersed from a control station to search survivors after earthquake happens), or to guarantee the initial connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>As a result, it is unavoidable to use a large neighbor set, i.e., the scalability suffers. Therefore, it is necessary to employ a different interaction rule such that the system scalability is maintained while capturing the collective behaviors of networked agents without destabilizing the system. In addition, for some flocking work <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, the results are obtained by using a class of smooth potential functions. However, nonsmooth changes of potential functions sometimes occur due to unexpected obstacles or noises.</p><p>Motivated by the above observations, in this paper, we investigate the collective behaviors of robots beyond the nearest neighbor rule, i.e., dispersion and flocking when robots interact with others by an acute angle test (AAT)-based interaction rule. The AAT allows interactions with some farneighbors, and excludes unnecessary nearest neighbors. As a result, it guarantees that the system is scalable over time. Although the AAT is introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, it merely concentrates on proving the system-wide connectivity. In contrast, we focus on effectively using the AAT-based interaction rule to investigate collective behaviors of dispersion and flocking. Note that the investigation is nontrivial because the network topology switches much more arbitrarily by the AAT-based rule than the one by the nearest neighbor rule or the hysteresis-based rule, i.e., the addition or deletion of links brings discontinuities to a potential function. Thus, the commonly used invariant-set-based stability proof <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> cannot directly apply to this paper. For the dispersion, a spring-like controller is proposed for robots, which ensures that the dispersion process is collision-free. Then a fixed-time consensus-based energy function is proposed to guarantee the system stability with switching topology. An upper bound of settling time for the energy consensus is obtained. Using the bound, a uniform time interval is set so that energy distribution is conducted in a fair manner. For the flocking, two neighbor sets-one is determined by the traditional nearest neighbor rule, the other is determined by the AAT-are used together in the proposed controller. The former set is used for the collision avoidance purpose, and the latter one is used for the velocity matching purpose. Considering unexpected obstacles or noises, the flocking is achieved by a class of generalized potential functions, under which the controller suffers a nonsmooth transition. To this end, the flocking is analyzed by some nonsmooth techniques. Finally, a co-optimizing problem is investigated, i.e., co-optimizing of the proposed interaction and other objectives such as enhancing communication performance, obstacle avoidance or leader-navigation. An objective of decreasing expected number of transmissions per successfully delivered packet (ETX) of an active communication flow is illustrated to demonstrate the capability of the developed co-optimizing controller, i.e., achieving the objective while maintaining the collective behaviors.</p><p>In summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows. 1) A unified framework is established, when the interactive neighbor set is determined beyond the nearest neighbor rule, i.e., the information of some far-neighbors is used, to investigate the collective behaviors of mobile robots. 2) Dispersion is achieved by a spring-like collision-free controller. Using a proposed fixed-time consensus-based energy function, the system stability is guaranteed with switching topology. 3) Flocking is achieved by a proposed controller based on a class of generalized artificial potential functions, and is analyzed by some nonsmooth techniques. 4) A co-optimizing problem of the proposed interaction and other generalized objectives is solved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PRELIMINARIES AND PROBLEM STATEMENT</head><p>In this section, the AAT is introduced, and problem statement is presented. In addition, graph theory and some lemmas are provided.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Graph Theory</head><p>A networked system can be represented by a graph G = (V, E), where V = {v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v N } is a vertex set indexed by an associated agent set, and E = {(i, j) | v i , v j ∈ V} is an edge set that denotes the set of interaction links. A directed graph is denoted by an</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">adjacency matrix A = [a ij ] N×N with a ij &gt; 0 if (v j , v i ) ∈ E and a ij = 0 otherwise. Suppose that no self-loops exist, i.e., (v i , v i ) /</formula><p>∈ E. Thus, a ii = 0. In this paper, we consider the undirected graph, i.e., a ij = a ji . The Laplacian matrix L is defined as L = -A, where is the valency matrix of G, which is defined as = diag( N j=1 a ij ). Note that L is always symmetric and positive semidefinite for an undirected graph. The graph is called connected if for each pair of agents i and j, there exists a sequence of neighbor vertices in G connecting the two agents. For an undirected connected graph G, the second smallest eigenvalue of L, denoted as λ 2 (L), is larger than zero. In a graph G, if assigning an arbitrary direction to each edge, e i ∈ E, and if the total number of edges is equal to n and E = {e 1 , . . . , e n }, then the N × n incidence matrix of G is I, where ι ij (the entry of I) equals to 1 if v i is the head of e j , and equals to -1 if v i is the tail of e j , otherwise it is equal to 0. Since agents can move dynamically, G(t) = (V, E(t)) is used to denote a time-varying graph, where E(t) is the edge set at time t. In cooperative control, each agent interacts with a neighbor set, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">N i (t) = {j ∈ V | (i, j) ∈ E(t)}.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. AAT</head><p>The definition of the AAT is that, there exists a link between robots A and B if and only if for any other robot C, the interior angle ∠ACB is acute. To save the calculation cost, such a test is equivalent to check the presence of any robot C inside the circle with diameter d AB . In Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, two examples are illustrated to show how the AAT works. In Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>(a), a connection is built between robots A and B, because all interior angles (∠AC 1 B, ∠AC 2 B, and ∠AC 3 B) are acute. Equivalently, robots C 1 , C 2 , and C 3 are all out of the circle. In Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>(b), the connection is not built, because the interior angle ∠AC 4 B is not acute. It is equivalent to that robot C 4 is located inside the circle.</p><p>Remark 1: The AAT performs in a distributed manner. A distributed implementation method is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">1(a)</ref>. For robot A, a connection between B and itself is assumed to be built at first, and the relative distances between A and B, A and C A practical scenario when robots using AAT to interact with each other is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, where a red hexagon, green circles, and purple circles denote a control station, mobile robots, and active robots, respectively. The aim is to build a communication network that covers a disaster area using a team of survivor-searching mobile robots dispatched from a central control station. As a result, rescue staff who stay at the station can make decisions based on received onsite information detected by the active robots. In this case, the implementation of the AAT ensures that robots spread over a large area while maintaining the network connectivity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Problem Statement</head><p>Given a group of N mobile robots, the dynamics of each robot is described by the following double-integrator:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ẋi = v i vi = u i , ∀i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N}<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">x i ∈ R m , v i ∈ R m</formula><p>, and u i ∈ R m denote the position, the velocity, and the acceleration control input of robot i, respectively. The relative distance between robots i and j is denoted by x ij , where • is the Euclidean norm. The problem to be addressed in this paper is stated as follows.</p><p>For the dispersion, design a cooperative controller u i in the form of</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">u i = ⎡ ⎣ j∈S i (t) k s 1 - l 2 0 l 2 ij d ij ⎤ ⎦ -k d ẋi<label>(2)</label></formula><p>such that robots initially close-located in an area are dispersed and finally reach a static configuration, i.e., v i = 0, ∀i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N}. In addition, when designing u i , it is required that the resulting coordination is collision-free, i.e., x i = x j , ∀i = j. In (2), l ij = x ij denotes a spring length (relative distance) between robots i and j, l 0 is a constant denoting the natural spring length, d ij is a unit vector indicating the direction of the virtual spring force from robots i to j, k s and k d are a spring constant and a damping factor, respectively, and S i (t) is the AAT-based virtual spring set (neighbor set) at time t. Since the neighbor set is switching more arbitrarily by the AAT than the one by the nearest neighbor rule or its variations, a new switching mechanism will be developed in Section III-A to guarantee the system stability.</p><p>For the flocking, design another cooperative controller u i in the form of</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">u i = j∈N 0 i (t) ∇ x ij V ij d ij - j∈S 0 i (t) v i -v j<label>(3)</label></formula><p>such that robots eventually reach the same velocity, i.e., v i = v j , ∀i, j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N}. In (3), N 0 i (t) denotes a nearest neighbor set, i.e., N 0 i (t) = {j ∈ V | x ij &lt; l 0 }, S 0 i (t) denotes an AAT neighbor set, i.e., S 0 i (t) = {j ∈ V | (i, j) ∈ E(t)}, where (i, j) ∈ E(t) if the AAT test passed; otherwise, (i, j) / ∈ E(t), and V ij belongs to a class of non-negative artificial potential functions satisfying Assumption 1. The first term in (3) is for the purpose of collision avoidance, and the second term is for the purpose of velocity matching. In order to investigate the nonsmooth effect caused by unexpected obstacles or noises, the following assumption is presented.</p><p>Assumption 1: A class of non-negative artificial potential functions V ij of x ij hold the following generalized properties.</p><p>1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">V ij → ∞ if x ij → 0.</formula><p>2) It is continuous everywhere, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">V ij = 0 if x ij ≥ l 0 .</formula><p>3) It is differentiable almost everywhere except at</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">x ij = l 0 . In particular, ∇ x ij V ij = 0 if x ij &gt; l 0 ; ∇ x ij V ij &lt; 0 if 0 &lt; x ij &lt; l 0 , and lim x ij →l - 0 ∇ x ij V ij = k,</formula><p>where k is a negative constant. Remark 2: The function of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">2</ref>) is similar to a real spring, if the distance between two robots is larger than the predefined natural spring length, an attractive force pulls the two robots closer to each other. On the other hand, if l ij is smaller than l 0 , a repulsive force pushes the two robots apart from each other. In addition, when l ij in (2) approaches zero, the virtual repulsive force becomes infinitely large to push robots i and j apart from each other. Such a design ensures that the whole system is collision free during the interactive movement of robots and the collision avoidance analysis will be presented in Section III-B.</p><p>Remark 3: Note that some existing results related to the result in this paper are <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> where the nearest neighbor rule or the hysteresis-based rule is used to determine the neighbor set for the dispersion controller. Instead, we achieve the dispersion behavior by the AAT-based rule, which ensures that the system is scalable. Besides, those two results are obtained for robots with single-integrator dynamics, while our approach investigates robots with double-integrator dynamics, which can better describe the real robot dynamics. It is nontrivial to extend the single-integrator case to the double-integrator without using the velocity information from other robots. In fact, a damping term is added in the proposed controller, and corresponding stability analysis is carried out by a fixed-time consensus-based energy function.</p><p>Remark 4: In <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, similar potential functions are proposed to achieve the flocking, but the potential function V ij used in this paper has a nonsmooth change when the topology is switching, i.e., when there exists a transition in N 0 i (t), which extends the potential function to a more generalized form. One particular form of V ij will be presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. To clarify the difference between the proposed potential function and the existing potential functions, we use a repulsive function proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> for illustration, that is</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">ψ r ij x ij = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ 1 x ij 2 -2 1 + r , 1 &lt; x ij &lt; 2 0, 2 ≤ x ij &lt; ∞<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where 1 and 2 are two positive constants, and r is a second-order polynomial in x ij selected to guarantee that ψ r ij ( x ij ) is smooth over the 2 transition. Therefore, ψ r ij ( x ij ) is smooth in its domain, while our proposed potential function is nonsmooth at a particular transition point. In fact, nonsmooth changes of potential functions sometimes occur due to unexpected obstacles or noises. Another flocking algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> does consider the nonsmooth switching for a proposed repulsive potential, but the velocity-matching part only uses information from the nearest neighbors. Recent results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> present some nonsmooth analysis for the proposed interactive systems. However, the results concentrate on robots with single-integrator dynamics. Therefore, the flocking behavior is not investigated.</p></div>

Together with its compactness, using LaSalle's invariance principle, the system will eventually converge to the largest invariant subset of the set {(x, ẋ) | Ẇ = 0}. Therefore, ẋi = 0 holds eventually for all robots. We now consider the case of switching topology. When robots are moving around, the relative distance between any two robots varies accordingly. Therefore, S i (t) changes as well. To guarantee the system stability under switching topology, inspired by the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, we propose a new fixed-time consensus-based energy function. A distinctive feature of this approach is that an upper bound of settling time for the energy consensus is obtained without dependence on initial states, and then a uniform time interval is set so that energy distribution is conducted in a fair manner.

To utilize the adequate energy, a better way would be redistributing the energy first, then determining whether to switch or not. The fixed-time energy-based approach guarantees that the energy reach an agreement before switching, thus providing the fair energy distribution. Such an approach is used for a two-stage robot deployment strategy, but the energy function is developed in a complex form in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. In contrast, this paper employs the energy-based approach to guarantee the system stability for dispersion, and proposes an energy function in a concise form. In fact, the upper bound of settling time only depends on four system parameters, i.e., a, b, α 0 , and β 0 . Moreover, a uniform time interval is globally set to enable energy distribution to be conducted in a fair manner. In addition, since the Lyapunov function in Proposition 3 is independent from the network topology, Proposition 3 still holds even if the topology becomes time-varying during [t n , t n+1 ) as long as the smallest λ 2 for corresponding interaction topology is available. Note that if we remove the fixed-time consensus term in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, Proposition 2 holds as well. But the resulting switching process becomes restrictive for robots due to the possible unfair energy distribution.</p></div>

During the movement of robots, we first suppose that there are only two robots, e.g., robots i 0 and j 0 , collide with each other at some time, i.e., x i 0 j 0 = 0. From <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, l i 0 j 0 = 0 leads to V i 0 j 0 → ∞.

FLOCKING BEYOND THE NEAREST NEIGHBOR RULE</head><p>In this section, the nearest neighbor rule and the AAT-based interaction rule are used together to determine the neighbor sets for each robot, together with a class of generalized artificial potential functions, to explore the flocking behavior of a robotic team.

Thus, the combination use of N 0 i (t) and S 0 i (t) makes the robot dynamics suffer a discontinuous right hand side when there exists a transition in N 0 i (t) or S 0 i (t). Notations G N 0 and G S 0 are used to denote the position graph and the velocity graph when the nearest neighbor rule and the AAT are used to determine the 2 Since N 0 i (t)+N i (t) = N i (t), there are two extreme cases: one is N 0 i (t) = ∅, i.e., all the neighbors lie on the boundary of the circle with radius l 0 ; the other is N i (t) = ∅, i.e., all the neighbors lie inside the circle. Otherwise, only part of neighbors lie on the boundary of the circle.</p><p>neighbor set, respectively. In the following part, the flocking behavior is analyzed with the proposed controller.</p><p>By Definition 1, the closed loop dynamics for robot i is rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">ẋi = v i vi ∈ K[u i ]<label>(24)</label></formula><p>and stacking the state into the vector, one gets</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">ẋ = v v ∈ K[u]<label>(25)</label></formula><p>and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_47">25</ref>) is further rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">ẋ = (B N ⊗ I m )v v ∈ K[u] (<label>26</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_49">)</formula><p>where x = (B N ⊗ I m )x, B N is the incidence matrix (with arbitrary orientation) of the complete graph with N vertices, I m is the m × m identity matrix, and ⊗ is Kronecker product. Proposition 5: For a team of N robots, each one interacts with others using controller (3) and starts from a noncollision configuration, and the neighbor sets N 0 i (t) and S 0 i (t) are switching over time according to the nearest neighbor rule and the AAT rule, respectively. If G N 0 is connected over time, then all robots are collision-free during their interactive movement, and eventually reach the same velocity.</p><p>Proof: See Appendix C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CO-OPTIMIZING WITH OTHER OBJECTIVES</head><p>In this section, we further investigate a co-optimizing problem of the proposed interactive movement and other objectives such as enhancing communication performance, obstacle avoidance or leader-navigation. It is assumed that the objective can be modeled as a smooth potential J(x). Since ẍi = u i = -∇ x i V i -k d ẋi drives robots to a configuration where V i is locally minimized, a gradient decent term is then added to the original interactive controller. As a result, the combined dispersion controller becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">ũi = ⎡ ⎣ j∈S i k s 1 - l 2 0 l 2 ij d ij ⎤ ⎦ -k c ∇ x i J -k d ẋi<label>(27)</label></formula><p>where k c is a positive constant, and the combined flocking controller becomes ûi =</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">j∈N 0 i ∇ x ij V ij d ij -k c ∇ x i J - j∈S 0 i v i -v j . (<label>28</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_52">)</formula><p>In what follows, we treat enhancing communication performance as an objective. As the combined flocking controller has a similar form to the combined dispersion controller, we use the dispersion one as an illustration.</p><p>In order to optimize the communication performance, a commonly used metric for the link quality is ETX <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> that is modeled as</p><formula xml:id="formula_53">T i,i+1 = 1 + e p(d i,i+1 -q) (<label>29</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_54">)</formula><p>where T i,i+1 denotes ETX of the link (i, i + 1) consisting of robots i and i+1, d i,i+1 is the relative distance between robots i and i + 1, and p and q are positive parameters depending on the communication range and the variance of environmental fading. A route path is called an active flow on which the collected data from two active nodes are transmitted. Suppose that the active flow consisting of h robots, which are labeled in order from 1 to h. If considering T i,i+1 as a cost for link (i, i + 1), then the flow cost is calculated as the sum of T i,i+1 over the active flow. Thus, the objective is to minimize</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">J(x) = h-1 i=1 T i,i+1 .</formula><p>Note that the combined controller ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_50">27</ref>) is executed after the dispersion is fulfilled. More specifically, the original controller ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">2</ref>) is first executed. Once all robots stop moving, Dijkstra's algorithm is used to determine the active flow members between any two active nodes, and then the combined controller ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_50">27</ref>) is executed to adjust the robots on that flow.</p><p>Proposition 6: For a team of N robots, if each robot cooperates with others using <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> and the topology is determined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, then the collision of robots is avoided and all robots will eventually reach the zero velocity.</p><p>Proof: We first prove Proposition 6 with the fixed topology. Similar to the proof of Proposition 1, the total energy of the system, W, is constructed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_56">W = N i=1 W i = N i=1 W i + k c 2 J(x) (<label>30</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_57">)</formula><p>where W i is the total energy of robot i.

The switching topology case and the collision-free analysis are the same in spirit to the proof of Propositions 2 and 4, so they are omitted here.</p><p>The combined controller can be extended to a wider application areas. Instead of only co-optimizing the proposed interaction and the communication performance, other objectives such as target tracking or area coverage can be further added as long as they can be modeled as appropriate potential terms.</p><p>Remark 6: From the communication optimizing prospective, a controller proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> solves a co-optimizing problem of the cooperative movement and the communication performance in terms of bit error rate of a specific route. Although related in spirit, they use an additional potential term for collision avoidance purpose while we propose a single collision-free controller to model the interactive force among robots. Moreover, instead of using a global energy function, we use a local energy function to guarantee the system stability, which is easier to implement for distributed systems. Recently, the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>  task of a class of generalized objectives for robots. It is worth mentioning that since a potential term -k c ∇ x i J is added to the original controller, it is not guaranteed that the global optimal communication performance is achieved in the final stable configuration, but this is a common shortcoming of the potential-based cooperative control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. SIMULATION RESULTS</head><p>In this section, the performance of dispersion and flocking using ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">2</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">3</ref>), respectively, is evaluated. Without loss of generality, a group of ten robots are used, which are initially random-located in a unit circle centered at the origin, and the natural spring length is set as l 0 = 50. The selection of l 0 determines the final covered area, as the relative distance between any two connected robots will approach the natural spring length.</p><p>For the dispersion, set k s = 0.05 and k d = 0.3. The constants k s and k d can be tuned to achieve additional goals such as minimizing the robot movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. From the expression of (2), a large k s will result in a large control effort, but too large k s will cause undesirable system performance. Generally, k s is selected in the range of 0.01 to 0.2. For k d , a large value ensures the system quickly reach a static state, but too large k d will prohibit the system from reaching the desired formation. Typically, k d is selected in the range of 0.2 to 0.5. The controller (2) together with the AAT-based interaction rule is first used to disperse the ten robots. The final configuration of the dispersed robots is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3(a)</ref>. Then, the final configuration by (2) together with the nearest neighbor rule  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">3</ref>) and (c) by the controller used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. (d) Magnitude of velocity difference.</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">(a)<label>(b) (c) (d)</label></formula><p>is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3(b</ref>). In Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>(a) and (b), the purple line denotes the communication link. Since each robot in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>(a) only interacts with those passing the AAT, the neighbor set is relatively small compared to the one in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>(b) determined by the nearest neighbor rule. Thus, the AAT-based interaction is inherently scalable. The complexity of the algorithm running on each agent is related with the number of locally visible agents instead of the total agents. In practice, depending on the capability of agents, a sensing range R sense is applied in order to decrease the complexity of the AAT. In addition, the AAT-based interaction rule maintains the connectivity as long as a proper R sense is available. It is true that if available R sense is small, the systems may become disconnected and divide into several distant groups. However, since the connections between two groups always include the shortest pairwise distance between agents in each group, the network will be connected whenever the sensing capability allows.</p><p>To demonstrate the effectiveness of the combined controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>, select k c = 0.3, p = 0.05, and q = 10. The constant k c performs as a weight between the proposed interaction term and the other objective term. A large k c will add weight to the optimization part, but too large k c will weaken the cooperative interaction, i.e., affect the robustness of the whole network. Generally, k c is selected in the range of 0.2 to 0.5. In addition, randomly select robots 1 and 8 as active nodes as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4(a)</ref>, between which the collected data from the fields are transmitted. And the shortest-path flow, determined by the Dijkstra's algorithm, consisting of robots 1, 5, 6, and 8, is the active flow [the blue line in Fig. <ref type="figure">4(a)</ref>].</p><p>Then, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> is implemented for each robot to optimize such an active flow while maintaining the dispersion behavior of ten robots. In Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>(b), the active flow members tends to be equal-spaced between robots 1 and 8, which proves that ∇ x i J has played its communication optimizing role. When the active nodes change to robots 3 and 10, the yellow line in Fig. <ref type="figure">4(b)</ref>, same procedure is re-executed to optimize the new active flow consisting of robots 3, 6, 4, and 10. Similarly, the final configuration is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">4(c</ref>). In Fig. <ref type="figure">4(d)</ref>, the ETX of the active flow downs from 24.7 and 24.4 to 21.0 and 20.5, a decrease of 15.0% and 16.0%, respectively.</p><p>For the flocking, we further randomly distribute an initial velocity for each robot, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5(a)</ref>. In (3), the V ij is a class of artificial potential functions, and one particular form used for illustration is</p><formula xml:id="formula_61">V ij x ij = ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ l 0 x ij + χ x ij 2 + ς x ij , 0 &lt; x ij ≤ l 0 2 k x ij -l 0 , l 0 2 &lt; x ij ≤ l 0 0, x ij &gt; l 0 (<label>32</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_62">)</formula><p>where χ = 4(kl 0 + 4)/l 2 0 , and ς = k -(4kl 0 + 12)/l 0 . Such a form of V ij is nonsmooth at x ij = l 0 and holds other generalized properties defined in Assumption 1. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5(b</ref>) and (d), with the controller (3), all robots in the final configuration has the same velocity. To make comparison, we show simulation results for robots using the proposed controller in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, and the final configuration is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5(c</ref>). It is clearly that, the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> uses velocity information from more neighbors in the final configuration than our proposed one.</p><p>In fact, during the whole collective movement, the controller in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> always interact with more neighbors than ours, i.e., the system is not scalable when the neighbor set becomes large. Another interesting finding is the robots finally cover a larger area with our proposed controller (2) or (3), so it would be beneficial when effective area coverage is another preferable task for cooperative control in scenarios such as wildlife monitoring and military alert.</p><p>To demonstrate robustness of the collective behaviors by the AAT-based interaction rule, a group of 38 robots are dispersed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>(a), three agents are assumed to fail (blue circles) due to energy shortage or unexpected emergences. Then the system dynamically reconfigures to compensate the losses of those three agents in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>(b) by ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">2</ref>) under the AATbased interaction rule. Under the conventional nearest neighbor rule or its variations, if setting R to be large enough, the system would obtain the self-healing capability. But a large R brings a large neighbor set, which again results in the suffer of system scalability. Therefore, taking scalability into account, the collective behaviors are more robust when robots are interacting by the AAT-based rule.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>The dispersion and flocking have been investigated for a team of mobile robots with double-integrator dynamics when interacting with others by an AAT-based interaction rule. For the dispersion, a spring-like collision-free controller is proposed, and system stability is analyzed with fixed and switching topology using a new fixed-time consensus-based energy function. For the flocking, the velocity matching is achieved by a class of generalized potential functions, and is analyzed using some nonsmooth techniques. A co-optimizing problem of the proposed interaction and other objectives is further solved by a developed controller. Enhancing communication performance has been illustrated as an additional objective, and an active flow has been dynamically optimized. The co-optimizing approach is applicable to scenarios such as building reliable communication in a disaster area where resources are limited. Since the AAT-based interaction rule allows interactions with some far-neighbors and excludes unnecessary nearest neighbors, the dispersion and flocking hold the advantages of scalability, connectivity, robustness, and effective area coverage. Simulation results have shown the superiority of the collective behaviors by the AAT-based interaction rule compared with that by the nearest neighbor rule. Some of the future research topics would be to further investigate a nonconvex optimization problem for more complex objectives, or to realize cluster flocking, i.e., robots in different groups reach different velocities.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX C PROOF OF PROPOSITION 5</head><p>First, a Lyapunov-like function is constructed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_96">V 0 = N i=1 ⎛ ⎝ 1 2 j∈N i (t) V ij + 1 2 v T i v i ⎞ ⎠<label>(49)</label></formula><p>and it can be obtained that V ij is regular at x ij = l 0 by Definition 2. Since x ij is a smooth function of both x i and x j (we will later show no collision exists for the system, i.e., x i = x j ), V ij is regular at both x i and x j . Thus, V 0 is locally Lipschiz and regular as it is a finite combination of locally Lipschiz and regular functions j∈N i (t) V ij and v T i v i . In what follows, without causing confusion, we drop the dependence on t when denoting the neighbor set, e.g., using N i to denote N i (t). Then the generalized gradient of V 0 with respect to (x, v) is calculated as ∂V 0 = [ρ T 1 , ρ T 2 , . . . , ρ T N , v T 1 , v T 2 , . . . , v T N ] T , where ρ i is computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_97">ρ i = ∂ j∈N i V ij ∂x i = ∂ j∈N 0 i V ij ∂x i + ∂ j∈N i V ij ∂x i = ∂ j∈N 0 i V ij ∂x i + K ⎡ ⎣ ∇ x i j∈N i V ij ⎤ ⎦ = - j∈N 0 i ∇ x ij V ij d ij - j∈N i z i d ij (<label>50</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_98">)</formula><p>where z i [k, 0], and the third equality follows the result from Lemma 1, since j∈N i V ij is locally Lipschitz.

(<label>53</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_102">)</formula><p>The graph G S 0 is connected all the time when using AAT to determine the corresponding neighbor set <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, i.e., L S 0 is always positive semidefinite no matter how fast the topology is changing. Therefore, -v(L S 0 ⊗ I m )v is negative semidefinite, i.e., L (v,u) V 0 is a nonpositive interval. Case 2: In this case, following a similar procedure, one gets wT ξ = -v(L S 0 ⊗ I m )v, and L (v,u) V 0 is a nonpositive scalar value.</p><p>Thus, for any time t, one concludes that L (v,u) V 0 belongs to a nonpositive interval. Note that the proof for the collisionfree part is similar to that of Proposition 4, the difference is that here one needs to use the result from Lemma 2. Since (x, v) is a Filippov solution of (26) and V 0 is locally Lipschitz and regular, t → V 0 is absolutely continuous. In addition, (d/dt)V 0 exists and (d/dt)V 0 ∈ L (v,u) V 0 ≤ 0 for almost all t ≥ 0, i.e., (d/dt)V 0 ≤ 0 for almost all t ≥ 0. At time t, suppose two robots, i and j, collide with each other, i.e., x ij = 0. From the properties of V ij , x ij = 0 leads to V ij → ∞, which contradicts the conclusion that V 0 is nonincreasing. As a result, it is concluded that all robots will not collide with others during their interactive movement.</p><p>Next, we prove that all robots eventually reach the same velocity. Since it is assumed that the G N 0 is connected all the time, x ij ≤ (N -1)l 0 , ∀(i, j) ∈ E. Thus, (i,j)∈V×V ≤ (N(N -1) 2 l 0 )/2. As a result, x involves in a closed and bounded set. Then, a set 0 W = {(x, v) ∈ R mN(N-1)/2 × R mN | V 0 ≤ c, c ∈ R + } defined to denote the level set of V 0 is closed by continuity. Since V 0 ≤ c, V ij ≤ 2c. Thus, x ij ≤ V -1 ij (2c). Similarly, v i ≤ √ 2c. As a result, the set 0 W is bounded, and therefore compact. The invariant property follows the fact that (d/dt)V 0 ∈ L (v,u) V 0 ≤ 0. Then, define another set S = {x ∈ 0 W | 0 ∈ L (v,u) V 0 }. Since L (v,u) V 0 belongs to a nonpositive interval, the largest value that can be obtained is zero. And -v(L S 0 ⊗ I m )v = 0 if and only if</p><formula xml:id="formula_103">⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ v 11 v 12 . . . v 1m ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ v 21 v 22 . . . v 2m ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ = • • • = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ v N1 v N2 . . . v Nm ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ c 1 c 2 . . . c m ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦<label>(54)</label></formula><p>where v Nm denotes the velocity in the mth dimension of robot N, and [c 1 , c 2 , . . . , c m ] T are constants to which the final speeds converge.
