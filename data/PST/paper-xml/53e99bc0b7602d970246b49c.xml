<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this letter, a novel approach for enhancing the results of fuzzy clustering by imposing spatial constraints for solving image segmentation problems is presented. We have developed a Sugeno-type rule-based system [9] with three inputs and 11 rules that interacts with the clustering results obtained by the well-known FCM and/or PCM algorithms. It provides good image segmentations in terms of region smoothness and elimination of the effects of noise. The results of the proposed rule-based neighborhood enhancement (RB-NE) system are compared to well-known segmentation algorithms using stochastic field modeling. They are found to be of comparable quality, while being of lower computational complexity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>A CCORDING to Haralick [1], a good image segmenta- tion consists of well defined regions that consistently describe intensity variations within the same object. In addition, there should be no single-pixel regions-the effects of noise-within bigger regions and the segmented regions' boundaries should be smooth. These requirements cannot be met using the well known K-means, fuzzy c-Means (FCM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and possibilistic c-means (PCM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> algorithms due to the lack of spatial constraints in the calculation of the fuzzy (or crisp) partition matrix. Therefore, many algorithms have been presented in the literature that impose spatial constraints to clustering algorithms for segmenting image data. These algorithms are mainly based on stochastic field modeling of the problem and use single-or multiresolution approaches to enhance the quality of image segmentations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Some fuzzy approaches that impose similar constraints have also appeared recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we have developed a rule-based fuzzy system that postprocesses the clustering results of any fuzzy clustering algorithm by imposing spatial continuity constraints and using the inherent correlation of an eight-connected neighborhood. In Section II, we describe the rule based system and the underlying concepts for its' development; in Section III we provide some experimental results and finally, in Section IV we discuss the results of our approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. THE FUZZY RULEBASE FOR ENHANCEMENT OF CLUSTERING RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Definitions</head><p>The main concept in imposing spatial constraints is to add a neighborhood voting scheme that increases or decreases the possibility of the central pixel to belong to a certain region according to the region labels/memberships of its' neighbors. The overall region membership assignment is given by combining this voting scheme with a proper distance metric between the data and a prototype value.</p><p>In the proposed approach, imposing spatial constraints is based on a voting scheme over a neighborhood, that is evaluated on a cluster basis. The application of a generic fuzzy clustering scheme, e.g., FCM or PCM, to an image data set provides a fuzzy partition matrix of dimensions where is the number of clusters, and with being the image dimensions, that describes the degree of membership of each pixel to the cluster according to a distance metric that relates to i.e. the cluster prototypes.</p><p>We have built a Sugeno-type fuzzy system <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> with three inputs, a single output and 11 rules that applies spatial constraints to on a cluster per cluster basis. The system results in a correction matrix, and the final partition matrix is given by Since the processing is carried out on a cluster basis, in the rest of the paper we denote by with The variables that feed the proposed fuzzy system are the number of pixels that belong to the cluster with high membership, the number of pixels that belong to the cluster with low membership, and the maximum relative connectivity of the pixel examined to it's neighborhood, DUMAX. They are all calculated in the eight-connected neighborhood of and are defined as follows:</p><p>(1) (2) (3) 1070-9908/98$10.00 Â© 1998 IEEE where denotes the number of elements that satisfy the logical operation</p><p>The thresholds in ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) were selected experimentally. Usually, values approximately 20% larger/smaller than the maximum ambiguity value are expected to provide good results. When PCM <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> is used to obtain the initial fuzzy partition matrix, the thresholds 0.7 and 0.3 are valid for any since the memberships of a pixel to different clusters do not sum up to 1.0. However, if FCM is used for the same task, and these thresholds should be set to and respectively, since in the case of maximum ambiguity, the pixel's membership to any cluster is DUMAX is a measure of the presence of discontinuities in the neighborhood that is being examined. The linguistic variables defined for the fuzzy variables and are LOW, MEDIUM, and HIGH, defined on the universe of discourse</p><p>The linguistic variables for the fuzzy variable DUMAX are LOW and HIGH, defined in the universe of discourse</p><p>The membership functions of all linguistic variables are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Imposing Spatial Constraints</head><p>The basic criterion for imposing spatial constraints over a neighborhood is that when we deal with a homogeneous region, either of low or high membership to a cluster, the fuzzy partition matrix should be updated in such a way that describes the membership of the majority of the pixel neighbors to the cluster. The region homogeneity is controlled by DUMAX. When DUMAX is low, it suggests that there are no discontinuities in the neighborhood that is examined. This criterion leads to the following set of rules.</p><p>Rule 1: If is LOW) and is HIGH) and is LOW), then Rule 2: If is HIGH) and is LOW) and (DUMAX is LOW), then This set of rules suggests that the membership of the pixel examined is modified by a positive (negative) quantity that is analogous to the pixels that have high (low) membership to the cluster and belong to the same neighborhood. The same rules hold in the case when there is a certainty for the majority of the neighbors, as follows. These rules control the way the fuzzy system behaves when approaching an image edge. They have a smoothing effect on the edge by extending the boundaries of homogeneous regions. Finally, the last rule covers all the other combinations of input variables:</p><p>Rule 11: else</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>In this section, the results obtainable from the proposed system are presented. We have applied the RB-NE system to the fuzzy partition matrix obtained by using FCM for clustering the Lena image to two and five clusters, using only the pixel intensities as features. The fuzzy partition matrix was randomly initialized, the fuzzifier was set to two and the termination criterion was a change of 10 in the cost function <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(a) and (c), the results of the adaptive clustering scheme (ACS) proposed by Pappas <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> for two and five clusters, respectively, are shown. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(b)</ref> and<ref type="figure">(d)</ref>, the results of the proposed scheme are shown. The results of RB-NE are quite similar with ACS. This observation is rather encouraging, having in mind the computational complexity of ACS and other similar schemes. In order to understand the effects of the proposed scheme, we plot in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> the elements of the fuzzy partition matrix that correspond to the vertical centerline of the Lena image that were obtained by the FCM algorithm (for the "bright" cluster) in dotted line, and the correction term that resulted from the application of the proposed scheme in solid line. Note that RB-NE leaves homogeneous regions practically unaffected, while modifying the membership in their boundaries and reducing the membership in regions of low membership. The application of RB-NE to the "dark" cluster would produce the contrary effects in the case of two clusters. In both cases, the value of was set to 0.1, a selection that was made in order to guarantee considerable increase (decrease) in cluster membership when the majority of the neighborhood certainly belongs (not belongs) to the cluster.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSION</head><p>We have shown how a fuzzy rule-based system can be designed in order to impose spatial constraints on the results of generic clustering algorithms in the framework of image segmentation. The proposed system performs equally well when compared to other methodologies for solving the same problem, e.g., the Gibbs random field models. The proposed system was inspired by the operation of two-point clique potentials that are used to model Gibbs probability density functions and apply spatial constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> that are the key element of their efficiency. However, RB-NE is intuitively simple and its computational complexity is lower since it is not iterative and requires the evaluation of the fuzzy rules once per pixel. It has also provided better results for the class of images examined when compared to generic fuzzy data clustering algorithms.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
