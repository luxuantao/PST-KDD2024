Appleby, Xuerong Mao, and Alexandra Rodkina Abstract-This paper considers the stabilization and destabilization by a Brownian noise perturbation that preserves the equilibrium of the ordinary differential equation x (t) = f (x(t)). In an extension of earlier work, we lift the restriction that f obeys a global linear bound, and show that when f is locally Lipschitz, a function g can always be found so that the noise perturbation g(X (t)) dB(t) either stabilizes an unstable equilibrium, or destabilizes a stable equilibrium. When the equilibrium of the deterministic equation is nonhyperbolic, we show that a nonhyperbolic perturbation suffices to change the stability properties of the solution.</p><p>Index Terms-Almost-sure asymptotic stability, Brownian motion, destabilization, Itô's formula, stabilization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I T IS WELL known that noise can be used to stabilize a given unstable system or to make a system even more stable when it is already stable. Stabilization by deterministic periodic "noise" has been studied a great deal by many authors, e.g., Bellman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, Kushner <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, Meerkov <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and Zhabko and Kharitonov <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Deterministic vibrational stabilization for delay systems was investigated in Lehman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In the case of random noise, the pioneering work is due to Hasminskii <ref type="bibr">[11, p. 229]</ref>, who stabilized a system by using two white noise sources. Later, Arnold et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> showed, in particular, that the system ẋ(t) = Ax(t) can be stabilized by zero-mean stationary parameter noise if and only if trace A &lt; 0. On the other hand, in the nonlinear case, Scheutzow <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> provided some examples on stabilization and destabilization in the plane, and Mao <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> developed a general theory on stabilization and destabilization by Brownian motion. Recently, Appleby <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, Appleby and Mao <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and Appleby and Flynn <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> have extended these results on stabilization and destabilization to functional differential equations and Volterra equations. The stabilization of general scalar nonlinear stochastic difference equations has been examined in Appleby et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. General rates of decay in stabilized nonlinear differential equations have been considered in a paper of Caraballo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. We should also mention that some results on stabilization by random switching are given in Verriest <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> while stochastic stabilization for partial differential equations is given in Caraballo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The present paper may be thought of as an extension of the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to general nonlinear equations, and draws on some of the techniques developed for nonlinear stochastic difference equations (SDEs) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, Mao showed that a general finite-dimensional ordinary differential equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ẋ(t) = f (x(t)), t &gt; 0; x(0) = ξ ∈ R d (1)</formula><p>could be stabilized (resp., destabilized) using Brownian motion. More precisely, he showed that the equilibrium solution of the SDE</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">dX(t) = f (X(t)) dt + g(X(t)) dB(t)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>is almost surely asymptotically stable (resp., unstable), for an appropriate choice of g. (For the general theory of SDEs, we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.) In that paper, he assumes that f and g obey a global linear bound of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">|f (x)| ∨ |g(x)| ≤ K 0 |x|, x∈ R d (3)</formula><p>for some K 0 &gt; 0. Indeed, under some further conditions, (3) can be weakened to a one-sided growth condition of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">x, f (x) + 1 2 |g(x)| 2 ≤ K 1 |x| 2 , x ∈ R d<label>(4)</label></formula><p>(see e.g., Mao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>). Although the condition (4) allows for a wider class of SDEs to be studied than (3), and in particular, means that we can study equations where neither f nor g obey a global linear bound, many deterministic dynamical systems with equilibria at 0 are still excluded. For example, consider the system (1) with</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">f (x) = log(1 + x)x. (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>Clearly, a condition of the form (4) cannot hold, even though solutions of (1) are well defined on (0, ∞). In this paper, we show that the analysis can be extended to cover cases of this type.</p><p>It is also assumed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> that the stabilizing noise is (essentially) of the form ΣX(t) dB(t), or that the diffusion term in (2) does not depart too much from linearity. Certainly, if the deterministic system (1) at 0 is sublinear, such a perturbation suffices to stabilize the unstable deterministic equation. However, one may not need such a strong noise perturbation in order to stabilize the solution. Therefore, we ask here what the critical size of stochastic perturbation g(X(t)) dB(t) at zero must be in order to stabilize the deterministic equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. On the other hand, if a system is asymptotically stable, but the equilibrium is nonhyperbolic, we may be able to destabilize using a relatively weak noise perturbation.</p><p>A final feature distinguishes this analysis from that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. There, because f obeys either a global linear bound or a onesided growth condition, solutions of (1) cannot explode in finite time. However, if such a restriction is lifted, solutions of (1) can explode in finite time. As a concrete example, consider <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where f obeys (5), and once again,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">f : [0, ∞) → [0, ∞). If f obeys ∞ 1 du uf (u 1/2 ) &lt; ∞</formula><p>then the solution explodes in finite time; in fact</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">lim t↑T |x(t)| = ∞, where T = ∞ |x(0)| 2 du uf (u 1/2 )</formula><p>.</p><p>In this paper, we show that stabilization is still possible with such functions f in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</p><p>The main results of the paper are the following. First, given an equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where f is locally Lipschitz continuous, it is always possible to design a noise perturbation g such that all solutions of (2) tend to zero, almost surely. Necessary and sufficient conditions on g (in terms of f ) for which this is true are known in the scalar case. However, the method presented here can be applied to a wider class of stochastic dynamical systems (such as nonautonomous SDEs and even stochastic functional differential equations). Moreover, the conditions given recover both the earlier results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and sharp sufficient conditions supplied by the Feller explosion theory in R (see e.g., [p. 348]).</p><p>We are also able to show that given an equation (1) with a (globally or locally) asymptotically stable solution and where f is locally Lipschitz continuous, it is always possible to design a noise perturbation g such that no solution of (2) tends to zero, almost surely. Under some other conditions, we can even show that solutions must tend to infinity, a.s.</p><p>The structure of the paper is as follows: the next section introduces notation, results required from the literature, and a precise statement of the problem to be studied, and standing assumptions required. Section III deals with stabilization by noise, and Section IV with destabilization by noise when the system is of dimension two or higher. We show that finite dimensional systems can always be stabilized, and that all systems of dimension two or higher can be destabilized. However, we cannot destabilize a globally asymptotically stable scalar system with equilibrium preserving noise, and this result is the subject of Section V. The final section (Section VI) shows that the solution of the stochastic differential equation cannot hit zero, the proof having been postponed in Section II.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Notation and Required Results</head><p>Throughout the paper, unless otherwise specified, we will employ the following notation. Let (Ω, F, {F(t)} t≥0 , P) be a complete probability space with a filtration {F(t)} t≥0 satisfying the usual conditions (i.e., it is increasing and right continuous while F(0) contains all P-null sets). Let B(t) = (B 1 (t), • • • , B r (t)) * , t ≥ 0, be an r-dimensional Brownian motion defined on the probability space, where * denotes the transpose of a vector or matrix. If x, y are real numbers, then x ∨ y denotes the maximum of x and y, and x ∧ y denotes the minimum of x and y. Let |x| be the Euclidean norm of a vector x ∈ R d and x, y be the inner product of vectors x, y ∈ R d , while, without any confusion, the notation • is used for the quadratic variation of a martingale. Vectors x ∈ R d are thought as column ones; so to get row vectors, we use x * . Let e i ∈ R d denote the ith standard basis vector in R d . The space of d × r matrices with real entries is denoted by R d×r . If A = (a ij ) be a d × r matrix. We denote its Frobenius norm by</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">|A| 2 F = d i=1 r j =1 a 2 ij .</formula><p>If A is a d × d matrix with entries a ij = α i for i = j and a ij = 0 otherwise, we write</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">A = diag(α 1 , α 2 , . . . , α d ).</formula><p>The following result (see. e.g. [16, Th. 7, p. 139]) will be of great use in the paper. We introduce the notation {Z →} to denote the set of all ω ∈ Ω for which the scalar process Z has the property that lim t→∞ Z(t) exists and is finite. We denote the limit in this case by Z(∞).</p><p>Lemma 1: Let A 1 and A 2 be a.s. nondecreasing processes. Let also Z be a nonnegative semimartingale, with E(Z) &lt; ∞ and</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Z(t) = Z(0) + A 1 (t) -A 2 (t) + M (t), t ≥ 0</formula><p>where M is a local martingale. Then</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">{ω : A 1 (∞) &lt; ∞} ⊆ {Z →} ∩ {ω : A 2 (∞) &lt; ∞} a.s.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Statement of the Problem</head><p>We study the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the SDE (2). (For the advanced background on SDEs, we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.) We denote the solution of this initial value problem by X(•, ξ), or simply X. We now impose some hypotheses on f and g that stand throughout the paper.</p><p>Assumption 2: Let f : R d → R d and g : R d → R d×r obey that</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">f (0) = 0, g(0) = 0.<label>(6)</label></formula><p>This ensures that when ξ = 0, X(t, ξ) = 0 for all t ≥ 0 is a solution of the SDE (2). Therefore, the noise perturbation preserves the equilibrium of the system.</p><p>We assume that f and g are locally Lipschitz continuous. Assumption 3: For every integer n ≥ 1, there is</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">K n &gt; 0 such that |f (x) -f (y)| ≤ K n |x -y|, |g(x) -g(y)| F ≤ K n |x -y| (7) for all x, y ∈ R d with |x| ∨ |y| ≤ n.</formula><p>By virtue of Assumption 3, we are guaranteed that there is a unique continuous adapted process X (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>) such that <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> where τ k = inf{t &gt; 0 : |X(t)| ≥ k}. The equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) has a global solution if the explosion time τ ξ e defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">X(t ∧ τ k ) = ξ + t∧τ k 0 f (X(s)) ds + t∧τ k 0 g(X(s)) dB(s), t ≥ 0, a.s.</formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">τ ξ e = lim k →∞ τ k = inf{t &gt; 0 : |X(t, ξ)| ∈ [0, ∞)} (9)</formula><p>obeys τ ξ e = ∞, a.s. Throughout the paper, it is important to show that solutions cannot reach zero in finite time. To make our argument more concise, define</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">ϑ ξ 0 = inf{t &gt; 0 : |X(t, ξ)| = 0}. (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>Proposition 4: Suppose that f and g obey Assumptions 2 and 3. Let X be the unique continuous adapted process that obeys <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. With τ ξ e and ϑ ξ 0 defined as in ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">10</ref>), we have τ ξ e ≤ ϑ ξ 0 a.s. The proof of this result is relegated to the Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. STABILIZATION OF (1)</head><p>In this section, we wish to give conditions on g that ensure that solutions of (2) will tend to zero almost surely. It turns out that assuming the following about f and g will suffice:</p><p>Assumption 5: There exists θ ∈ (0, 1) such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">|x| 2 (2 x, f (x) +|g(x)| 2 F ) -(2 -θ)|x * g(x)| 2 ≤ 0, x ∈ R d . (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>Assumption 6: For every L &gt; 0,</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">g(L) := min |x|=L |x * g(x)| &gt; 0.<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Before we can discuss and prove asymptotic stability, it is first necessary to ensure that the solutions are well defined on [0, ∞), a.s. Therefore, we need to prove first that τ ξ e = ∞, where τ ξ e is defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. Assumption 5 guarantees that there is a unique global strong solution of (2), and this Assumption turns out to be crucial in giving the asymptotic stability of solutions.</p><p>Proposition 7: Suppose that f and g obey Assumptions 2, 3, and 5. Then there exists a unique continuous adapted process X, which is a solution of (2) such that τ ξ e = ϑ ξ 0 = ∞, a.s. The proof of this result is given in the Appendix. The statement says that the solution does not explode, but also may not end up at the equilibrium (0).</p><p>If Assumption 6 also holds, almost-sure asymptotic stability is guaranteed.</p><p>Theorem 8: Suppose that f and g obey Assumptions 2, 3, 5 and 6. Then, there exists a unique continuous adapted process X, which is a global solution of (2) and which obeys</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">lim t→∞ X(t, ξ) = 0, a.s.</formula><p>The proof of this result is also deferred until later in the section.</p><p>We notice that this result also shows that when 0 is a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium of (1) when f (0) = 0, we can preserve this global stability in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. A sufficient condition for global asymptotic stability of the zero solution of (2) is</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">x, f (x) ≤ -F (|x|) ≤ 0, x ∈ R d</formula><p>where F : [0, ∞) → [0, ∞) is continuous with F (x) = 0 only when x = 0. Therefore, once g is so small that there exists θ ∈ (0, 1/2) such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">F (|x|) ≥ 1 2 |g(x)| 2 F -(1 -θ ) |x * g(x)| 2 |x| 2 , x ∈ R d \ {0},</formula><p>we have that ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">11</ref>) is satisfied (with θ = 2θ ), and so, if g also obeys <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, we have that the solution of (2) obeys lim t→∞ X(t, ξ) = 0 a.s. for any ξ ∈ R d .</p><p>Before giving examples of functions g that will satisfy these hypotheses, and proving the results stated earlier, we comment briefly on the assumptions required in this section. In particular, we see that both assumptions are analogs of conditions required in the scalar case, and for this reason, are difficult to relax significantly. When d = 1 and r = 1, Assumption 6 reduces to the condition that g(x) = 0 for x = 0, which is the standard nondegeneracy assumption in the scalar case, which also ensures that the equilibrium is unique. Also, when d = 1 and r = 1, Assumption 5 reduces to the condition</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">sup |x|&gt; 0 xf (x) g 2 (x) &lt; 1 2 .</formula><p>However, this condition is not far from being necessary to ensure the asymptotic stability of scalar autonomous stochastic differential equations. Indeed, if there exists L ∈ [-∞, ∞] such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">L := lim x→0 xf (x) g 2 (x) ,</formula><p>it is known (see e.g., [p. 247]) that -∞ ≤ L &lt; 1/2 ensures that solutions tend to zero with (at least) positive probability, while L &gt; 1/2 implies that</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">P[{ω : lim t→∞ X(t, ω) = 0}] = 0.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Examples</head><p>We now show that the conditions of Theorem 8 are satisfied for many functions g, and in particular, that for every function f [and therefore, for every equation (1)], a function g can be chosen to stabilize solutions of (1). This example is modeled on an example in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Example 9: Let γ : R d → R be locally Lipschitz continuous with γ(x) = 0 for x = 0. Suppose also that there exists c &gt; 2 such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">γ 2 (x) &gt; c x, f (x) |x| 2 , x ∈ R d \ {0}.</formula><p>Now let g : R d → R d×r be given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">g(x) = γ(x)xv * (x), x ∈ R d ,</formula><p>where v : R d → R r is a locally Lipschitz continuous function such that |v(x)| = 1 for all x ∈ R d . It is easy to see that the positive definiteness of γ 2 ensures Assumption 6 is satisfied. Also, defining θ ∈ (0, 1) by 1θ = 2/c, we have Assumption 5. By virtue of Example 9, the following corollary of Theorem 8 holds.</p><p>Corollary 10: Suppose that f : R d → R d is a locally Lipschitz continuous function with f (0) = 0, and that the zero solution of</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">ẋ(t) = f (x(t)), t &gt; 0,</formula><p>is unstable. Then, this system can be stabilized by an equilibrium-preserving noise perturbation, in the sense that there exists a locally Lipschitz continuous function g : R d → R d×r with g(0) = 0 such that, for every ξ ∈ R d , the unique continuous adapted process X which obeys</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">X(t) = ξ+ t 0 f (X(s)) ds+ t 0 g(X(s)) dB(s), t ≥ 0, a.s.</formula><p>obeys lim t→∞ X(t) = 0, a.s.</p></div>
