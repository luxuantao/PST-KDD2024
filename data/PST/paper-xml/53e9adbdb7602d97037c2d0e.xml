<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Clustering algorithms are useful in many fields, from image analysis through astronomy to biology. Generally, clustering is applied to a data set, which is a collection of N d-dimensional vectors (data points) representing d measured features per sample. Given a data set, clustering algorithms seek a partition of the data to coherent groups, in a sense that data points in the same group share similar properties. Many approaches try to solve the clustering problem by optimizing a global cost function, expressed in terms of the local similarities between data points.</p><p>Typical data sets contain clusters that differ from each other in density, and may also contain elongated clusters that could intersect. Moreover, in many cases clusters of interest include points that represent noisy samples from some underlying manifold structures. Also, many data sets are multiscale in nature, containing a nested structure of small clusters within larger clusters. In the scope of this work, we attempt to separate between clusters with different 0031-3203/$30.00 á­§ 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.patcog.2006.04.007 densities, to identify intersections between clusters, to support the creation of clusters that preserve smooth continuation, and in particular to distinguish between the different clusters that cross an intersection. To realize these objectives and to discriminate between the different clusters at all scales in the presence of noise, scale-dependent global properties should affect the formation of coherent clusters. The main global features that are utilized in our present study are density, shape, intrinsic dimensionality and orientation. The last three features are part of the manifold identification process, which is performed in parallel to the clustering process.</p><p>The importance of integrating these global features into the clustering process is exemplified in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. It should be emphasized that a variety of additional global features, also called multiscale similarity features or aggregative properties, can be integrated into the process. See for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, where in the problem of image segmentation there enter aggregative properties such as average color, color variations at all intermediate scales, boundary match, shape properties of salient sub-aggregates, etc.</p><p>In this paper, we present a novel clustering algorithm inspired by algebraic multigrid techniques (AMG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. At the basis of our methodology is the normalized-cut cost minimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, in the sense that salient clusters in the data set can be characterized by low normalized-cut costs. The minimization problem can be formulated as a generalized eigenvector problem. Many other approaches that attempt to solve the clustering problem (including spectral clustering methods e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>) formulate the problem as a generalized eigenvector problem, and usually solve it by using an eigensolver with quadratic or cubic complexity. An efficient way in most practical cases to compute eigenvectors at just a linear complexity is offered by an AMG eigensolver <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. It is important to realize, however, that the AMG solver contains in itself a hierarchical aggregation procedure which already yields a (hierarchical) clustering of the data set, and that it is much better to directly use this procedure for clustering than actually computing the eigenvectors, or using other clustering procedures. This is because:</p><p>(1) If desired, this procedure can yield the same clustering as computed from the eigenvectors, at a smaller cost. (2) This procedure will actually yield a hierarchical clustering, breaking the clusters into sub-clusters, sub-subclusters, etc. (3) The produced clusters can be fuzzy, with some data points remaining undecided, belonging with different probability weights to different clusters. (4) Most important, the hierarchical aggregation procedure can be modified to account for similarities in global properties of aggregates that emerge at various intermediate levels (scales). To our best knowledge such use of multiscale similarity features cannot be considered by any uniscale procedure, or for that matter, by any formulation of the problem as a functional minimization problem. (5) Top-down procedures can easily be iteratively incorporated at all levels, to affect finer-level aggregation criteria by properties found important at coarser levels.</p><p>Our AMG-like approach discovers the desired aggregation of the data set by following the similarities between the data points at different resolutions, using (similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>) a bottom-up weighted aggregation coarsening procedure that preserves the low normalized-cut costs. Moreover, to achieve coherent clusters at all scales, our approach allows combining multiscale similarity features, based on properties of aggregates that emerge at intermediate levels. The combined approach of bottom-up weighted aggregation and multiscale similarity features constructs a hierarchical pyramid of aggregates such that a salient cluster is guaranteed to emerge at a certain appropriate level with low normalized-cut cost. The cost of the algorithm is linear in the data set size, and is independent of the number of clusters.</p><p>Clustering and manifold identification are known to be related. In manifold learning one is interested in finding the intrinsic dimensionality and low dimensional structure of the data. In this work, the clustering and manifold identification processes influence each other, so that the cluster partition is used to approximate the manifolds, and the manifold structure is used to improve the cluster partition. The identification of manifolds created by aggregates is dealt within the bottom-up process by using a scale-dependent local principal component analysis (PCA). An aggregate manifold is represented as a composition of spatially ordered sub-manifolds, each of which is approximately convex and well approximated by a set of principal axes. The aggregate manifold is identified even in the cases in which the manifold is nonconvex and noisy.</p><p>In addition to the bottom-up aggregation process, a top-down process is applied in the present work to resolve intersections between clusters and to separate dense clusters from background noise. Relying on the AMG strength, the algorithm can be applied to data sets of any dimensionality, although the junction resolving, which relies on smooth continuation of orientations, is currently developed only for the cases of clusters with intrinsic dimensionality of 2D and 3D. The complexity of the algorithm is not dependent on the data dimensionality.</p><p>The paper is divided as follows. In Section 2 we describe work related to clustering algorithms and manifold learning. In Section 3 an overall description of the clustering algorithm is given. In Section 4 we demonstrate the use of aggregative properties. In Section 5 the algorithm complexity analysis is presented. In Section 6 clustering results of real astrophysical data in 3D are demonstrated. Section 7 compares our 2D and 3D results with results obtained by other algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work</head><p>There are numerous approaches for data clustering and manifold learning. In this survey we mostly refer to the algorithms that are related to our approach. For an extensive overview see text books such as Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</p><p>Spectral clustering methods for graph-based clustering and image segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> use the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix to embed the data in a lower subspace where they are expected to be well separated. Spectral clustering uses explicitly eigenvector solvers to find clusters whose graph cut is minimal. The NystrÃ¶m approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> is used to decompose the similarity matrix W efficiently by choosing a random sample of the data, so that the complexity of decomposing W to its eigenvectors is of O(nN ) where n is the size of the sample, and N is the size of the data set. Path-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> discover elongated structures and overcome noise. Their complexity is at least O(N 3 ). In the super-paramagnetic clustering (SPC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> method, also known as the granular magnet method, the data points are modelled as a collection of magnets. The scale of the temperatures used in a Monte-Carlo simulation of this collection determines the resolution at which the magnets align to form clusters, creating hierarchical clustering similar to ours. A related work <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> approaches the clustering problem as a minimal cut problem and produces a stochastic set of cuts by hard contractions of the original graph. The complexity of Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is O(N log 2 (N )). In tensor-voting <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> additional properties of location and orientation of data points in 2D and 3D are used to cluster data points and characterize their manifold. The method also detects cases of junctions and copes well with noise. Moreover, a criterion to measure smooth continuation between oriented structures, which is based on proximity and curvature, has some similarities with our criterion of completion probability (Section 4.2). Tensor voting divides the data into voxels, each voxel aggregates some data points and geometric features but only on the scale induced by the partition into voxels. The algorithm complexity is O(n 3 k) where n is the number of voxels at the side length of the data set volume, and k is the number of the additional input properties. Some of the early manifold learning methods are the PCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In extensions of PCA such as the principal curve method (and the principal surface method) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> one estimates a manifold by computing a smooth curve that passes through the "middle" of a d-dimensional data cloud. In projection pursuit <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> different optimization strategies are sought to find a basis for local data projections that optimize certain criteria. Our use of scale-dependent local PCA in different scales reveals the shape of the clusters with respect to their scatter. The local-linear embedding (LLE) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> learns the manifold structure by finding a global coordinate system on the manifold. LLE attempts to compute a low dimensional embedding such that nearby points in the high dimensional space remain nearby and similarly co-located in the low dimensional space. A similar approach is the Laplacian eigenmaps (LEM) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, where the graph Laplacian matrix is used for dimensionality reduction that preserves local proximity. In Isomap <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> the embedding is optimized with the constraint of preserving geodesic distances. The complexity of LLE, LEM and Isomap is at least O(N 2 ).</p></div>

Our AMG-like procedure seeks salient clusters by following the similarity of the data points at different resolutions, from fine scales to coarser ones. Moreover, to further separate clusters at all scales, our AMG-like approach calculates and incorporates multiscale similarity features (e.g. density, shape, intrinsic dimensionality and orientation), which are called aggregative properties. As a result a hierarchical pyramid of graphs is constructed. Each node, at a certain scale, represents an aggregate, which is a weighted collection of the original data points. Each cluster S, which is a salient aggregate (i.e., (S) is low) emerges as a single node at a certain scale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Multiscale graph coarsening: weighted aggregation</head><p>Starting from the given graph G [0] = G, we recursively coarsen the minimization problem, creating the sequence of graphs G [1] , . . . , G [k] of decreasing size. At each scale we seek for nodes with low . The salient aggregates, or clusters, represented by low-nodes, are considered as approximate solutions to the minimization problem. As in the general AMG setting, the choice of the coarse variables ("Cpoints"), the design of the fine-to-coarse aggregation (or coarse-to-fine interpolation), and the derivation of the coarse problem are determined automatically, as described below.</p><p>Although the AMG approach can handle the full graph G [0] = G as defined above, the complexity of the algorithm is lowered by applying a dilution procedure which sets to 0 every w ij that is relatively small. We first apply to G [0]  the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> (typically 10 k 50). In addition to KNN we apply the following edge dilution procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>: for each pair of neighboring nodes i and j we set w ij to 0 in case w ij / k: i,k w ik &lt; and w ij / k: j,k w jk &lt; (or w ij /max k: i,k {w ik } &lt; and w ij /max k: j,k {w jk } &lt; ), in our experiments is set to 0.1.</p><p>The edge dilution procedure can be applied at each pyramid level.</p><p>The construction of a coarse graph from a given one is divided into three stages:</p><p>(1) A subset of the fine nodes is chosen to serve as the seeds of the aggregates (the later being the nodes of the coarse graph).

The construction of the set of seeds C ("Cpoints") and its complement denoted by F, is guided by the principle that each F-node should be "strongly coupled" to C.

Each node in the chosen set C becomes the seed of an aggregate that will constitute one coarse scale node. We define for each node i â F a coarse neighborhood N i = {j â C, w ij &gt; 0}. Let I (j) be the index in the coarse graph of the node that represents the aggregate around a seed whose index at the fine scale is j. The classical AMG interpolation matrix P (of size N Ã n, where n = |C|) is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P iI (j ) = w ij / kâN i w ik for i â F, j â N i , 1 for i â C, j = i, 0 otherwise.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Aggregative properties</head><p>Consider a specific clustering problem in which small clusters are nested within larger clusters, as exemplified in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Multiscale use of the densities may reveal the nested structure and eventually cluster the data appropriately. In Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> all the dense patches have similar average density, yet in region A the patches are distributed sparsely, and in region B they are more tightly packed. Hence, at a small scale, the dense patches should be grouped together, yet on a larger scale regions A and B should be partitioned into different clusters as indeed achieved by our algorithm and shown in Fig <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>In the case of astrophysical flow simulations, where at a given moment each star has a defined location as well as velocity, an important example of aggregative property is the average velocity of an aggregate. While the velocities of individual stars may be quite chaotic, their averages are significant and intermediate-level aggregates with similar averages (and other matching moments) should be grouped together to give a coherent view of the flow. Since our weighted aggregation framework allows to aggregate a variety of multiscale properties, we call these properties aggregative properties. In this framework, for each aggregate i emerging at a certain scale s, we calculate a set of aggregative properties. An aggregative property can be expressed as a weighted average over the aggregate i of a property that has first appeared at a scale r (r s). The scale s is termed the aggregate scale and the scale r is called the property scale. At each scale s the similarity matrix W [s] , inherited from finer aggregate scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, is modified by the similarities arising from the set of aggregative properties obtained from multiple property scales. In the scope of this work aggregative properties of density, shape, dimensionality and orientation are computed and incorporated. The aggregative properties are used to obtain partition into clusters that differ in density, to separate background noise from clusters, and to resolve intersecting clusters. Moreover, they are utilized to identify the manifold that approximately span each aggregate. As a straightforward aggregative property the reader may consider the center of mass of an aggregate. For an original data point the center of mass is simply its spatial coordinates (in this case r = 0, s = 0). For an aggregate i at scale 1 the center of mass is the weighted average of the spatial coordinates induced by the data points associated with aggregate i, the weights being the interpolation weights (in this case r = 0, s = 1). Similarly, the center of mass of an aggregate at scale s is a weighted average of the center of mass of its sub-aggregates at scale (s -1) associated with it. This is exactly the center of mass as if explicitly calculated from the cloud of data points that assembles this aggregate.</p><p>The following formulas are applied to compute the aggregative properties. Let a property Q appear at the property scale r, where its set of values is</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Q [r][r] = q [r] = (q [r] 1 , . . . , q [r] N [r]</formula><p>). Then the average of Q over aggregate k at scale s is given by Q</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">[r][s] k = j p [r][s] jk q [r] j / j p [r][s] jk , where p [r][s]</formula><p>jk is the (j, k) element in the product matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">P [r][s] = P [r] â¢ â¢ â¢ P [s-1]</formula><p>, which is the fraction of aggregate j at scale r in aggregate k at scale s. A fast computation of an aggregative property can be achieved by utilizing the following recursive relation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Q [r][s] def = Q [r][s-1] P [s-1] , M [r][s] def = M [r][s-1] P [s-1] , (s &gt;r),<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where M [r][r] def = 1 = (1, . . . , 1) at length N [r] . Note that</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">M [r][s]</formula><p>k is the number of sub-aggregates at scale r that compose the aggregate k at scale s. In particular, M [0][s] k , which is the number of data points which compose aggregate k at scale s, is called aggregate size. From these recursive relations one can then calculate the required weighted average:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">Q[r][s] k = Q [r][s] k M [r][s] k .

The junction resolving top-down process is used to determine the different manifolds that cross a junction, which has already been detected and isolated during the bottom-up process. The top-down process is based on the information obtained from the manifold identification: the junction and the orientation of manifolds. This high-level information obtained at a coarse scale s is used to modify the coupling weights at a finer scale r.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Complexity</head><p>The high complexity of a clustering algorithm can be a significant barrier when the datasets are large. Also, the preprocessing of calculating the local similarities between the data points can be expensive if done naively. In the scope of this paper, we do not intend to solve efficiently the preprocessing. We use the KNN procedure to obtain a bounded number (5 k 40) of local similarities (neighbors) per a data point. In low dimension KNN has complexity of O(N log N ), whereas in high dimension the complexity is O(N 2 ), where N is the number of data points.  The manifold type of selected aggregates shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">15</ref> is determined and compared to the visual detection of the shape patterns.</p><p>The complexity of our multiscale clustering algorithm is O(N). At each scale s of the pyramid four steps are applied: the computation of coupling weights, the computation of the aggregative properties, the modification of W [s]  according to the aggregative properties, and the choice of coarse representative for the next scale. Each of these steps has O(N [s] ) complexity. Therefore, O(N [s] ) operations are done at each scale s. A single graph coarsening step produces a coarse graph with about half the number of nodes of the finer graph. Thereby the complexity of one bottom up process is O(N + N/2 + N/4 + â¢ â¢ â¢) = O(N ). The complexity of a top-down process starting at a top (coarse) scale s is influenced only by the number of operations performed on the fine scale r (O(N [r] )). Thus, the top-down process complexity is at most O(N ). Therefore, the total complexity of the algorithm is linear in the size of the dataset.</p></div>

Some of the underlying tasks in this field are the exploration of the different structures that galaxies and clusters of galaxies form both in real observations and in simulated models. This may serve as a key for determination of the underlying astrophysical model parameters that explain observations. The cold and dark matter (CDM) is assumed to be the major fraction of the universe mass. Cosmological simulations of the universe evolution are based on applying a dynamical model on CDM particles. As time evolves, CDM particles form peculiar structures such as filaments, sheets and spherical clusters, i.e. different manifold types. We use our algorithm in this context to demonstrate its capabilities of detecting structures in such datasets. We also use our algorithm to infer the fitting between an astrophysical model and real observations by comparing the distribution of different manifold types.</p></div>

Sparse clusters whose manifold cannot be identified, due to small number of galaxies belonging to it, are also counted and considered as 0D-manifolds.

Our AMG-like approach discovers the desired aggregation of the data set by following the similarities between the data points at different resolutions, using a bottom-up weighted aggregation process. Moreover, to achieve coherent clusters at all scales, our approach uses multiscale similarity features and incorporates manifold identification processes. The algorithm detects clusters that are distinguished by their multiscale nature, separates between clusters with different densities and identifies and resolves intersections between clusters. The flexibility of our algorithm which allows to combine other statistics, i.e. additional multiscale similarity features, along with its low complexity, offer a powerful tool for exploring massive data sets.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A. Completion probability in 3D</head><p>In the 3D case of completion probability there are two situations: 1D-manifolds and 2D-manifolds in R 3 space. In the 1D-manifold case (Fig. <ref type="figure">21</ref>) two angles are defined: the pitch angle between the Z = 0 plane and the first principal axis, and the yaw angle between the Y = 0 plane and the 1st principal axis. The completion probability function reflects co-circularity and co-linearity for both angles:</p><p>In the 2D-manifold case (Fig. <ref type="figure">21</ref>) the ag-gregates manifold structure is approximated by a plane. Given aggregates k and l, two angles are considered: the aggregate's roll angle difference <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2 )</ref>, and their pitch angles (). The roll angle difference is measured as the angle formed between the directions of the intersection lines of the aggregate's manifolds with the X = 0 plane and X = r plane, respectively, (the lines are denoted by I (k) and I (l) where I (l) is located at l center). We then fix the Z = 0 plane to intersect X = 0 where the bisector of the directions of I (k) and I (l) lays. The pitch angle of an aggregate k (denoted by (k)) is measured as follows: the intersection I (y, k) of Y = 0 with the planar manifold of k is computed. (k) is the angle between I (y, k) and the Xaxis. Similarly, I (y, l) and (l) are computed. The probability function G reflects co-circularity and co-linearity of the pitch angles, the difference in the roll angle 2 , and the distance between the two aggregates:</p><p>, where c d , c p , and c r are predefined parameters. is computed by using with L [1]  i equal to the length of I (p+, i), and L [2]   i equal to</p><p>(3) i , for i = k, l. In 3D, the completion curve of 1D-manifolds considers two angles: the yow and pitch angles, whereas in 2D-manifolds interpolation of the two planes via the cubic spline creates the completion surface (Fig. <ref type="figure">21</ref>).</p></div>			</div>
