<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[ 4 ]</head><p> A new metaheuristic algorithm called Golden Eagle Optimizer (GEO) is proposed.</p><p> Multi-Objective Golden Eagle Optimizer (MOGEO) is proposed for solving multi-objective problems.  Both algorithms are tested on several challenging benchmark optimization functions.</p><p> GEO is also applied to constrained engineering design problems.</p><p> The qualitative and quantitative results proved the efficiency of GEO and MOGEO. Introduction Optimization is the process of finding the state of decision/design variables that yields the best value for single or multiple objective functions. Analytical methods were the dominant approach to solve mathematical problems before the heuristic optimization era. In addition to the primary information on the objective function value and constraint violation, analytical methods rely on the information about the derivatives of the sole or constraint-penalized objective functions in the form of first-and second-order derivatives. This extra information enables them to find the exact optimum for linear or convex non-linear problems efficiently. However, this comes at the cost of vulnerability to local optima entrapment in more complex problems-that has many local optima-and unavailability for problems with stochastic or unknown search space <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The stochastic behavior and unknown search space are the prominent features of real-world problems. This led to the advent of metaheuristic algorithms. The notable characteristics of metaheuristic algorithms are that they are derivative-free and do not require limiting assumptions. Therefore, they can be readily utilized for solving different classes of problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Such flexibility, however, is not costless. It has been observed, and later addressed as the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, that the excellent performance of an optimization algorithm on a specific set of problems does not guarantee the same performance on other problems. NFL provides an avenue for researchers to develop novel metaheuristic algorithms. Relative simplicity in understanding and application, as well as good performance, have resulted in the popularity of metaheuristic algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Numerous algorithms have been introduced recently to solve business and engineering problems effectively.</p><p>Metaheuristic methods can be classified through various approaches. One common approach suggests classifying these methods based on the source inspiration: (a) evolutionary, (b) human-based, (c) physicsbased, and (d), synthetic, and (e) swarm intelligence. Evolutionary algorithms are normally based on the natural selection law of biology. These methods evolve the initial population using evolutionary operators to improve the population's fitness and find the global optimum <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Selection, crossover, and mutation are the most common of such operators. Genetic Algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and Differential Evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> are two popular evolutionary algorithms. The human-based approach encompasses any algorithm that is inspired specifically by humans' social behavior or concepts that have been developed by humans. Queuing Search Algorithm (QSA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Group Teaching Optimization Algorithm (GTOA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> are the examples of algorithms proposed in this area. Physics-based methods tend to perceive the landscape as a physical phenomenon and move the search agents using formulae borrowed from physical rules or theories. Some of the recent algorithms proposed under this approach are Atom Search Optimization (ASO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, Henry Gas Solubility Optimization (HGSO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, Water Cycle Algorithm (WCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, Electron Radar Search Algorithm (ERSA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Lightning Attachment Procedure Optimization (LAPO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, Optics Inspired Optimization (OIO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, Equilibrium Optimizer (EO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, Thermal Exchange Optimization (TEO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, Multi-Verse Optimizer (MVO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, Electro-Search algorithm (ES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and Colliding Bodies Optimization (CBO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Synthetic methods are solely based on mathematical equations like trigonometry functions or well-known constants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[ 7 ]</head><p>These algorithms are not inspired by a specific natural phenomenon. Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>,</p><p>Golden Ratio Optimization Method (GROM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and Stochastic Fractal Search (SFS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> are among the algorithms proposed within this approach. Algorithms belonging to the swarm intelligence approach imitate the social behavior and communications within a group of species of animals, plants, or other living things <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Searching for food, hunting, mating, and memorizing are the common social behaviors considered in this class. Because communication is an indispensable element of social behavior, swarm intelligence algorithms allow the search agents to enjoy the information produced by other search agents in the current previous iteration <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. This approach has gained increasing popularity in terms of both application and new algorithm development. Some of the recently proposed algorithms that can be categorized under this approach are Pathfinder algorithm (PFA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, Seagull Optimization Algorithm (SOA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, Sailfish Optimizer (SFO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, Black Widow Optimization (BWO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, Emperor Penguin Optimizer (EPO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, Mouth Brooding Fish algorithm (MBF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, Spotted Hyena Optimizer (SHO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, and Selfish Herd Optimizer (SHO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>Metaheuristic methods can also be classified according to the number of search agents they use <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>Individualist methods use only one search agent in each iteration, while population-based methods use multiple search agents in each iteration. A population of search agents produces more information in each iteration and can better explore the problem's feasible region. However, this massively increases the number of objective function evaluations, which can be problematic for computationally intensive objective functions. Simulated annealing (SA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, Tabu Search (TS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, and hill-climbing <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> are among the wellknown individualist metaheuristics. This paper proposes a novel swarm-intelligence metaheuristic algorithm and its multi-objective version based on the golden eagles' hunting process. They are called Golden Eagle Optimizer (GEO) and Multi-Objective Golden Eagle Optimizer (MOGEO). GEO is founded on the intelligent adjustments on attack propensity and cruise propensity that golden eagles perform while searching for prey and hunting. MOGEO uses the same principles and is equipped with special tools to handle multi-objective problems. The remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows. Section 2 provides the fundamental inspiration and mathematical formulation of the GEO for single-and multi-objective problems. Section 3 presents the experimental results of applying the proposed algorithm on different classes of single-objective benchmark functions in addition to a convergence and scalability analysis. Section 4 presents the results of applying MOGEO on the benchmark functions for multi-objective optimization. Section 5 explores the application for real-world engineering optimization problems. The paper concludes in Section 6 by presenting final remarks and suggestions for future studies.</p></div>

First, the inspiration for the algorithm is presented, then the mathematical model is discussed.</p><p>[ 8 ]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Inspiration</head><p>The golden eagle (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), scientifically known as Aquila chrysaetos, belongs to the Accipitridae family, which covers different species of birds of prey like eagles and hawks <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. With exceptional vision, high speed, and powerful talons, golden eagles are professional hunters that can catch preys of a broad range of sizes from insects to mid-sized mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. This bird can fly as fast as 190 km/h <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. The golden eagle is the most widely distributed member of the Accipitridae family. Despite many other types of eagles, it can be found all over the Earth's northern hemisphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Golden eagle <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> Golden eagles have always had a close relationship with humans. They held lofty and sacred positions in the beliefs since ancient and tribal humans and were considered a sign of positive events <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Even today, more than ten countries have an eagle as the national emblem or on the national flag <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. The tradition of hunting with eagles is also practiced throughout Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. The golden eagle is the main bird of prey to be used there <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</p><p>The unique feature of the golden eagle's cruising and hunting is that it takes place in a spiral trajectory, meaning that the prey is most of the time on one side of the eagle. This enables them to monitor the targeted prey and the nearby boulders and bushes for finding a proper angle of attack. In the meantime, they also survey other regions if they can find better food.</p><p>At each instance of the flight, the golden eagle's behavior is driven by two forces: the propensity to attack, and the propensity to cruise. Golden eagles know that if they attack hastily, they may catch small prey that does not even compensate for the energy consumed for hunting. On the other hand, if they engage in an endless search for bigger prey, they may run out of energy and catch nothing. Golden eagles intelligently create a balance between these two desires to snatch the best prey they can in a reasonable time and with a reasonable amount of energy. They switch from a low-attack-high-cruise profile to a high-attack-low-cruise profile smoothly. Each golden eagle starts the hunt by flying at high altitudes within its realm in large circles</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">[ 9 ]</formula><p>and searches for prey. Once prey is spotted, it starts moving on the perimeter of a hypothetical circle centered at the prey. The golden eagle memorizes the location of the prey but continues to circle it. The eagle gradually lowers its altitude and simultaneously gets closer to the prey, making the radius of the hypothetical circle around the prey smaller and smaller. At the same time, it also surveys the nearby regions for better alternatives. Sometimes golden eagles share the location of the best prey they found so far with other eagles. If the eagle does not spot better location/prey, it continues to circle around the current one in smaller circles and finally attacks the prey. Otherwise, if the eagle finds a better alternative, it flies on a new circle around the new prey and forgets the previous one. It is noteworthy that the final attacks are performed in a straight line.</p><p>With that said, the main characteristics of the hunting process of golden eagles can be summarized as follows.</p><p> They follow a spiral trajectory for search and a straight path for the attack,  They show more propensity to cruise in initial stages of hunting and smoothly transition to more propensity to attack in the final stages,  They retain tendency for both cruise and attack in every moment of the flight,  They look for other eagles' information on prey.</p><p>Cruise, attack, and the intelligent balance that the golden eagle creates between these two are the natural manifestation of exploration, exploitation, and the transition from the former to the latter. This paves the way for devising a metaheuristic algorithm. The next subsection mathematically models this behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Mathematical model and optimization algorithm</head><p>This subsection describes the proposed mathematical formulation to mimic the movements of golden eagles that search for prey. The formulation for the spiral motion is presented, followed by its decomposition into attack and cruise vectors to emphasize exploitation and exploration, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">The spiral motion of golden eagles</head><p>GEO is based on the spiral motion of golden eagles. As mentioned earlier, each golden eagle memorizes the best location it has visited so far. The eagle simultaneously has attraction toward attacking the prey and toward cruise to search for better food. Attack and cruise vectors in 2D space can be visualized as in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p><p>[ 10 ] </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Prey selection</head><p>In each iteration, each golden eagle must choose a prey to perform the cruise and attack operations. In GEO, the prey is modeled as the best solution found so far by the flock of golden eagles. Each golden eagle is capable of memorizing the best solution it has found so far. In each iteration, each search agent selects a target prey from the memory of the whole flock. Attack and cruise vectors for each golden eagle are then calculated relative to the selected prey. If the new position (calculated via attack and cruise vectors) is better than the previous position in the memory, then the memory is updated. The prey selection strategy plays an important role in GEO. Selection can take place in a basic way, where each golden eagle only selects the prey in its own memory. To make golden eagles better explore the landscape, we propose a random one-toone mapping scheme, where each golden eagle randomly selects its prey in the current iteration from the memory of any other flock member. It is noteworthy that the selected prey is not necessarily the nearest or farthest prey. In this scheme, each prey in the memory is assigned or mapped to one and only one golden eagle. Then each golden eagle performs the attack and cruise operations on the selected prey. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref> shows that each search agent can only attack one of the positions in the memory that belong to another search agent.</p><p>[ 11 ]</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑥 𝑥 … 𝑥 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ Memory of search agent 1</formula><p>Memory of search agent 2</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Attack (exploitation)</head><p>The attack can be modeled via a vector starting from the current position of the golden eagle and ending in the location of the prey in the eagle's memory.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4">Cruise (exploration)</head><p>The cruise vector is calculated based on the attack vector. The cruise vector is a tangent vector to the circle and perpendicular to the attack vector. The cruise can also be thought of as the linear speed of the golden eagle relative to the prey. The cruise vector in -dimensions is located inside the tangent hyperplane to the 𝑛 circle; thus, to calculate the cruise vector, we have to first calculate the equation of the tangent hyperplane.</p><p>The equation of a hyperplane in -dimensions can be determined by an arbitrary point from that hyperplane 𝑛 and a perpendicular vector to that hyperplane, which is called the normal vector of the hyperplane.

A golden eagle can choose any destination point on the cruise hyperplane. To find a random vector on the cruise hyperplane, we have to first find a random destination point on this hyperplane other than the one we already have (the current location of the golden eagle ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>𝐶 𝑖</head><p>Note that the starting point of the cruise vector is the current location of the golden eagle . Since 𝑖 hyperplanes are one dimension smaller than their ambient space, we cannot simply generate a random 1 × 𝑛 point. A simple random point in -dimensional space is not guaranteed to be located on the cruise 𝑛 hyperplane. A new point located on the -dimensional cruise hyperplane has degrees of freedom, 𝑛 𝑛 -1 meaning that dimensions can be chosen freely, but the hyperplane equation dictates the last 𝑛 -1 dimension, as shown in Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. The last dimension must be chosen so as it satisfies the hyperplane equation; therefore, we have free variables and one fixed variable. We use the following procedure to 𝑛 -1 find a random -dimensional destination point located on the cruise hyperplane for golden eagle .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>𝑛 𝐶 𝑖</head><p>Step 1. Randomly choose one variable out of variables as the fixed variable. We denote the index of the 𝑛 selected variable with . Note that the fixed variable cannot be chosen from the variables whose 𝑘 corresponding element in the attack vector is zero. The reason is that when the coefficient of a variable in 𝐴 𝑖 Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">2</ref>) is equal to zero, the hyperplane is parallel to the axis of that variable, and that variable can take any value for a random combination of the other variables. For example, in the 3D plane 𝑛 -1 3𝑥 1 +2𝑥 2</p><p>, if we choose and choose random numbers for and , say , we cannot find a = 10</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">𝑘 = 3 𝑥 1 𝑥 2 {𝑥 1 = 2,𝑥 2 = 5}</formula><p>unique point.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Multi-objective optimization</head><p>Multi-objective problems are relatively similar to single-objective problems in terms of problem definition.</p><p>The only difference is that, as their name suggests, they contain multiple objective functions instead of a single objective function. This apparently negligible difference, however, creates challenges in terms of optimization procedure that cannot be addressed by algorithms that are designed to deal with singleobjective optimization. That is where the need for optimization algorithms that can handle and solve multiobjective problems emerges. A general multi-objective problem can be defined as Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_21">10</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</p><p>[ 18 ]</p><p>Minimize 𝐹 ( 𝑥 ) = {𝑓 1 (𝑥),𝑓 2 (𝑥),…,𝑓 𝑘 (𝑥)} Subject to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">𝑔 𝑖 ( 𝑥 ) ≤ 0, 𝑖 = 1,2,…,𝑟 ℎ 𝑖 ( 𝑥 ) = 0, 𝑖 = 𝑟 + 1,𝑟 + 2,…,𝑠<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Where is the set of objectives to be optimized, is the vector of decision/design variables, is the -th 𝐹 𝑥 𝑔 𝑖 𝑖 inequality constraint, is the -th equality constraint, is the number of inequality constraints, and is the ℎ 𝑖 𝑖 𝑟 𝑠 total number of constraints.</p><p>In the single-objective optimization, the solution is better than if . However, in multi-</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">𝑥 1 𝑥 2 𝑓(𝑥 1 ) &lt; 𝑓(𝑥 2 )</formula><p>objective optimization, such a definition cannot be used. Instead, the Pareto dominance concept is introduced to deal with multi-objective problems. It suggests that solution dominates (is better than) if</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">𝑥 1 𝑥 2</formula><p>for all of the objective functions we have . The two solutions are called non-dominated if for</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">𝑓(𝑥 1 ) &lt; 𝑓(𝑥 2 )</formula><p>at least one objective, but not all of them we have . If such a relation holds for a solution</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">𝑓(𝑥 1 ) ≮ 𝑓(𝑥 2 )</formula><p>compared to other solutions in the feasible region, that solution is called Pareto optimal. The ultimate goal in multi-objective optimization is to find the Pareto optimal solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. In contrast to single-objective problems, multi-objective problems do not have a single Pareto optimal solution. Instead, they have a set of non-dominated solutions as the Pareto optimal solutions. So the ultimate goal in these problems is shifted toward finding the Pareto optimal set of solutions, which is also called the Pareto front <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Multi-objective Golden Eagle Optimizer (MOGEO)</head><p>The proposed algorithm is able to find the best location of food using different operators. However, it is not capable of finding the Pareto optimal solution to problems with multiple objectives. In particular, the drawbacks of GEO for handling multi-objective problems are as follows:  In GEO, each golden eagle has its own separate memory of the best prey visited by itself so far. This means that GEO saves multiple individual best prey in each iteration. Saving multiple solutions are useful for multi-objective problems, but the saved solutions must be non-dominated, which is not guaranteed in GEO. Therefore, a mechanism should be introduced to only save the non-dominated solutions so far.  In the prey selection stage of GEO, each golden eagle chooses another golden eagle arbitrarily to perform attack and cruise operators on its best prey stored in its memory. However, quality optimal Pareto fronts contain members that are uniformly distributed along the front. This implies that a criterion is needed so that golden eagles can prioritize some of the preys in the memory to the others with that criterion.  In the prey selection stage of GEO, a one-to-one mapping occurs between golden eagles and preys in the memory. In other words, each prey in the memory is assigned to one and only one golden eagle.</p><p>However, the Pareto front in a given iteration might have more or fewer members than the</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">[ 19 ]</formula><p>population size. Therefore, the one-to-one mapping between search agents and prey cannot be implemented in multi-objective problems.</p><p>With that said, Multi-objective Golden Eagle Optimizer (MOGEO) is built upon the concepts of singleobjective optimization mentioned above plus three additional concepts: (a) external archive, (b) prey prioritization criterion, and (c) multi-objective prey selection.</p><p>External-archive-based algorithms are popular yet robust approaches in multi-objective optimization. Some well-known multi-objective algorithms like Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> or recent ones like Multi-Objective Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (MOGOA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> or Multi-Objective Ant Lion Optimizer (MOALO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> utilize an archive-based approach.</p><p>The basic idea is to keep promising non-dominated solutions in an external archive and update it as the optimization algorithm proceeds. Search agents are steered toward the archive members and ultimately to the region where the optimal Pareto front exists <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. Since GEO uses a dedicated memory to keep promising preys, the external archive approach can be easily implemented in GEO. The archive's capacity is limited. Therefore, a mechanism should be introduced for updating the external archive to keep the Pareto optimal solutions visited so far and avoid violating the maximum capacity limit of the archive.</p><p>When each of the search agents moves to a new position, it may face one of the three following conditions.</p><p>If the new solution (position) is dominated by one or more of the current archive members, the new solution is discarded. If the new solution is non-dominated to the current members of the archive and the archive is not full, simply add the new position to the archive. If the new position is non-dominated compared to the current members of the archive, randomly select one of the archive members and substitute it with the new solution. One of the desirable characteristics of an ideal optimal Pareto front is the uniform dispersion of archive members along the front in the objective space. Therefore, the outgoing member should be selected from the dense regions of the archive in order to decrease the density in those regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">9</ref> shows an example of archive members located in the dense and sparse regions of the archive.</p></div>

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">10</ref> shows the crowding hypercube for solutions 𝑗 located in the sparse regions of the archive are assigned larger crowding scores, while solutions in the dense regions have smaller crowding scores. It can be seen that the crowding distance is equal to half of the crowding hypercube's perimeter. The only exceptional cases are limiting members, i.e., the members with the largest or smallest value in any of the objective functions. Regular members have two adjacent members, but limiting members have only one. The crowding score for limiting members is calculated similarly to Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> except that one of the terms in the numerator is discarded.</p></div>

The outgoing member is selected using a roulette wheel where the probabilities are proportional to crowding distances. We want to select the outgoing member from the denser parts of the archive, so we should assign larger weights to the solutions in denser regions. This can be easily achieved by subtracting the crowding scores from 1 since the crowding distances calculated by Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> fall in the interval . The new scores that are used for the roulette [0,1] wheel procedure are called sparsity scores ( ), which can be calculated using Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">𝑆 𝑖 𝑆 𝑖 = 1 -𝐶 𝑖<label>(12)</label></formula><p>The last important topic in MOGEO is the prey selection procedure. It is similar to the prey selection in GEO but with some modifications. In GEO, every search agent has its own memory to keep the best location visited so far. However, the memory in this sense cannot be used as the external archive in MOGEO because the archive keeps only non-dominated locations visited so far. This point leads to conditions where the number of archive members is less than, or in general, different from the population size. We propose the MOGEO prey selection procedure to be based on the roulette wheel, where the weights are the sparsity scores of the current archive members. This results in a higher probability of selection for members in the sparse regions of the front and less probability for archive members in the dense regions. The crowding scores are calculated according to Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7">Scalability analysis</head><p>This subsection presents the results of the scalability analysis conducted to see how GEO is scalable for problems with a large number of decision variables.

Figure <ref type="figure">17</ref> displays the results for the best objective value obtained in the form of error bars. The center points show the arithmetic mean of the 30 independent runs, while the upper and lower bars show the minimum and maximum objective values obtained. Results confirm GEO's almost consistent performance as the dimensions rise. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">18</ref> shows the same statistics for computation times. It is observed that in terms of computation time, GEO belongs to the midpack and can retain its relative computation time compared to other algorithms. This implies that the temporal performance of GEO is consistent relative to that of other algorithms when we transit from small to large problems. It worths noting that the plots in Figure <ref type="figure">17</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">18</ref> have a logarithmic scale along the -axis 𝑦 to better demonstrate the differences in small values.

For parameters that the algorithms share with their single-objective version, the parameters introduced in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">1</ref> are used. Since both MOGEO, MOGWO, MOPSO, and MOSSA are archive-based solvers, a similar archive size is used for both of them.

It reveals that MOGEO outperformed the other algorithms in eight of the multi-objective benchmark functions. MOGEO was also able to provide more stable results in three of the problems in the test suite. This confirms that MOGEO can successfully handle multi-objective optimization problems. MOGEO's higher rate of converging to the optimal Pareto front can be attributed to the fact the search agents always choose prey from the external archive that stores the Pareto front obtained so far. The archive update mechanism, when triggered, usually drop a member from the most densely populated areas of the archive, which helps MOGEO converge to more uniformly distributed fronts. The good exploration mechanism of GEO, which also benefits MOGEO and was numerically proved in the previous section, helps MOGEO avoid local fronts to converge to the true Pareto front.

In this study, we solve the following engineering benchmark problems: three-bar truss design, cantilever beam design, tension/compression spring design, and welded beam design.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Welded beam design</head><p>The objective of this problem is to find optimal values for the thickness of weld ( ), length ( ), height ( ), ℎ 𝑙 𝑡 and thickness of the bar ( ) that minimizes the total cost of manufacturing a welded beam. The structure of 𝑏 the considered design is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">28</ref>, and the corresponding mathematical formulation is shown in Equation ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_28">19</ref> tabulates the results obtained by solving this problem using GEO and other competing algorithms.</p><p>This table shows that GEO outperforms GWO, GA, PSO, HS, and DA, and provides competitive results compared to CSA. This confirms the ability of the proposed GEO to solve problems with multiple nonlinear constraints efficiently. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_29">20</ref> shows that the null hypothesis of the Kruskal-Wallis test is rejected for the welded beam design problem. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">29</ref> displays the results of the multiple comparisons test and shows that GEO performs statistically similar to GA and CSA.  To certify the performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithms, GEO was tested on 33 benchmark problems from different classes, including unimodal, multimodal, and composite benchmark functions. The CEC2017 test suite was utilized for composite benchmark functions. Results were compared to that of six other well-known metaheuristic algorithms via different statistical measures. It was revealed that GEO is capable of exploring the landscape through intense and abrupt movements in the initial stages of the search and converge toward the promising areas by exploiting the best solutions found over the course of iterations.</p><p>GEO outperformed other algorithms in the majority of the benchmark problems while providing competitive results in the others. GEO was also used to solve real-world engineering problems, where it showed promising performance. The results indicate that GEO is able to find the global optimum of optimization problems with challenging and unknown search spaces.</p><p>MOGEO's performance was tested using the CEC2009 and DTLZ test suite, which are specially designed for testing multi-objective algorithms. The results of MOGEO was compared to that of four other wellknown multi-objective algorithms. MOGEO was able to provide competitive results, and in many cases,</p><formula xml:id="formula_59">[ 55 ]</formula><p>outperform the other algorithms in approximating the true Pareto front in challenging multi-objective problems.</p><p>It worths noting that the proposed GEO and MOGEO algorithms treat single-and multi-objective problems as a black box; therefore, they can be applied to any type of optimization problems, including NP-hard ones, as long as the problem is properly formulated. In addition, since the proposed algorithms are able to solve optimization problems with continuous variables, some modifications may be needed for applying the GEO and MOGEO on problems with non-continuous decision space. There are opens avenues for future researches to proposed suitable operators to enhance the performance of the proposed algorithms on different types of problems. It is also perceived from the experiments that the introduction of the cruise vector provides good exploration in comparison to Exploitation capabilities in GEO and MOGEO. This enables these algorithms to perform better on problems with unknown or more complex landscapes than unimodal functions. Future studies are encouraged to expand the concept of exploitation of GEO in unimodal functions. Therefore, the area for improvement of this algorithm is to modify the exploitation aspects of GEO.</p><p>Future works can also develop new mechanisms for the algorithm or enhance the existing ones for performance improvement. New prey selection mechanisms can be proposed to enhance the performance of the existing approach for both GEO and MOGEO based on, for example, statistical probability functions.</p><p>For randomizing the attack, cruise, and the step vector, a uniform distribution is used in this work, which can be extended to other approaches for randomization, e.g., Lévy flights.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3.
