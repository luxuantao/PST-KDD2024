<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The technical aspects of a power grid are fast changing and generally inspired by the technological evolutions in the market and in the corresponding usage on informational technologies (ITs). To stand up to these changes, computer systems, which is also called supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, are being developed. Closed, isolated, and single user-based architectures are changing into interlinked, standardized systems that support new functionalities, and they are also user friendly and cost efficient. SCADA systems are widely used in industry for monitor and control industrial processes, especially for a plant or for its equipment, such as telecommunications, water and waste control, energy, oil and gas refining, and transportation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. SCADA systems were deployed among power delivery systems several decades ago in the United States. To date, many such advanced systems and their applications have been developed worldwide. Smart grid is a promising power delivery system for the near future. Building a robust and secure SCADA system is therefore a key to the development of the smart grid.</p><p>SCADA systems in power grids have been in use in the United States for long enough-the past five decades. The development in corresponding IT resources has very rarely made its way into the power industry. The grids and, for that matter, even the SCADA systems still remain old in age. An interest in improving the national power grids to make them smart and productive has cropped up in the past 10 years. SCADA systems are a general sensory network with a distributed control system coupled on them. It forms the basic component of control, and it acts as an interface between the user and the actual systems. The systems are generally designed to be event driven. For example, the sounding of an alarm or a warning signal requires a corresponding action. This property of the SCADA systems tends to make it domain specific.</p><p>Besides SCADA, there are some other similar systems. For example, process control systems (PCSs) are complete sets of systems that from a centralized location are able to monitor remotely and take measurement of some remote sensors. The major distinguishing factor is that SCADA systems are spread in a very large geographical area. These systems make the critical structure that is related to power, water and sewage utilities, transportation services, and many more facilities that make our daily life lot easier. Distributer control systems (DCSs) and industrial control systems also form a subset of the major PCS systems. They differ in the fact that they offer many more geographically based services when compared with SCADA. There are many related works in these areas .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">INTRODUCTION OF SCADA 1.1. SCADA functionality</head><p>This section was base on the materials in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. SCADA functionality includes access control, multimedia interface, trending, alarm handling, logging/archiving, report generation, and automation explained as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Access control: users are allocated among groups that have defined read/write access privileges to the process parameters in the system and often to specific product functionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Multimedia interface: multimedia interface supports multiple screens, which can display combinations of synoptic diagrams and text <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Trending: most of the SCADA products provide trending facilities, and one can use it to summarize the common capabilities in a chart or a figure <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Alarm handling: alarm handling is based upon limit and status checking, and it is performed centrally in the data servers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In other words, the information only exists in one place, all users see the same status (e.g., the acknowledgement), and multiple alarm priority levels (in general many more than three levels) are supported.</p><p>It is usually possible to group alarms and to handle these as aggregation. E-mails can be generated, and predefined actions can be executed automatically in response to alarm conditions.</p><p>Logging/archiving: logging can be described as the medium-term storage of data on a disk, and archiving can be described as the long-term storage of data either on a disk or on another permanent storage medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Logging is typically performed on a cyclic basis. In other words, once a certain file size, period, or number of points is reached, the data are overwritten <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Logging of data can be performed at a set frequency, or it can be initiated only if the value changes or if a specific predefined event occurs. Logged data can be transferred to an archive once the log is full. The logged data is time stamped and can be filtered when viewed by a user. The logging of user actions is, in general, performed together with either a user ID or station ID. Report generation: one can send reports by using Structured Query Language (SQL) type queries to the archive, real-time database, or logs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Automation: many of the products allow actions to be triggered automatically by events <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Advanced SCADA systems</head><p>SCADA systems have been evolving since they were created. The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> summarizes that distributed architecture and multimedia are two dominate techniques that would influence the SCADA systems. The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> reviews that SCADA is adopting Web Technology, ActiveX, and Java in the products and also adopting object linking and embedding for process control as a means of communication between client and server modules. The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> argues that the future SCADA is not a stand-alone system, but rather, it is incorporated with a deep level implementation of information flows within the substation system featuring the advanced communication technologies.</p><p>Recent SCADA systems have shown a feature that many new technologies have applied into systems to make them more real-time, productive, robust, and secure. For example, those new technologies include advanced systems such as SCADA systems based on Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, Intranet-based SCADA <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, web-based SCADA <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, industrial Ethernetbased SCADA <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, web-based SCADA display system via Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, and so forth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">SCADA communications</head><p>SCADA systems in smart grid are designed to monitor the states and to control behaviors of all the plants over the power delivery systems. Therefore, real-time, precise, robust, and secure communication is the key to the monitoring and controlling processes.  <ref type="bibr">999-1992:</ref> this standard provides a recommended practice for SCADA communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. NCS TIB 04-1: the National Communication System (NCS) has released a Technical Information Bulletin 04-1 for the SCADA systems. It covers recent overviews of the SCADA architectures and protocols that implement the communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Other than the aforementioned national standards, many researchers have either proposed new communication technologies for the SCADA communication system or adopted advanced communication techniques for existing SCADA communication infrastructures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">SCADA security</head><p>Like any system, a SCADA system tends to be prone to attacks of various forms including physical attacks by a human or by malicious software that can harm the system or use up the system's resources. Any of these forms of disruption that happens to a SCADA system can be highly dangerous <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. Threats, such as fiddling with billing information of particular users, can cause a major economical disturbance if not monitored carefully <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. The power grids, on the other hand, are a major resource to national defense, and any form of attack on these can cause havoc. Attacks on SCADA systems have increased by at least 10 times since the beginning of the 21st century <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>.</p><p>The major issue is that most of the SCADA systems were set up years before advances of computers and communication networks so that SCADA systems did not evolve as fast as those in the computer systems and communication networks. Although restriction on the physical access to early SCADA systems was believed to be secure, current communication capability and remote access capability cause harder security issues. The common methods are prevention methods via restriction on the unauthorized access. People tend to undermine vulnerabilities in the SCADA systems caused by the complex network infrastructures. Therefore, many security breaches occur recent year.</p><p>It becomes a difficulty to justify how secure a SCADA/ power system is. It is possible to define security levels by analyzing the reliability of a power system. The analysis provides us with a means to analyze when and if power failures occur, and this analysis becomes a major factor in providing service to the customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. Failure of a SCADA system generally occurs when the operator of a power system is unable to retrieve data from or send data to the basic productivity plant or even the controlling units and the customer accessible infrastructures of the grid <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. To restore any of the loads, the control information and the usage or failure information is very crucial. The bus system connecting the various infrastructures is analyzed by comparing the availability of the controlling paths throughout the SCADA systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. This system would contain the master stations, communication networks, remote terminal units (RTUs), wide area networks (WANs), and the other basic infrastructure components of the grid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">SCADA ARCHITECTURE</head><p>The traditional SCADA system is composed of a central host computer and a number of RTUs, the operator terminals, and/or programmable logic controllers (PLCs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, which are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Some key components are as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>: SCADA meter: used for gathering data from a plant (acquiring) and sending commands (control) to a plant. RTU: used for connecting to sensors in the plants, converting sensor signals to digital data, and sending digital data to the supervisory system. PLCs: used as field devices because they are more economical, flexible, and configurable than specialpurpose RTU. Communication infrastructure: used for connecting the supervisory system to the RTUs and/or PLCs.</p><p>A proper understanding of SCADA is necessary to analyze the various security threats that need to be addressed. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows scada architecture in modern power grids.</p><p>A SCADA system is a centrally controlled master system that commands terminal RTUs, and these RTUs include relay devices, actuators and sensors, circuit power breakers, voltage regulators, and so forth. Master terminal units (MTUs) are higher level units, including supporting applications, human machine interfaces (HMIs), data storage, and acquisition systems. PLCs are used as control sensory devices and RTUs. Programmable automation controllers are used as the basic controlling unit.</p><p>There are three generations of SCADA system architectures. The first generation uses the WAN for communication between MTUs, which execute decision making, and RTUs, which serve the end users. The second generation uses local area networks (LANs) to communicate between MTUs and RTUs. The third generation uses WAN and Internet protocol (IP).</p><p>The components of the SCADA architecture include the following: (i) on-field devices, for example, RTUs, PLCs, intelligent electronic devices (IEDs), and Process Automation Controllers (PACs); (ii) monitoring and controlling equipment, for example, HMI, historian, controller for SCADA, and real-time data processor; and (iii) communications, for example, Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol (ICCP), Odyssey Commutation Processor (OCP), Ethernet, wireless networks, serial network connections, and Modbus and DNP3 protocols. The terminal controller unit is responsible for communicating, analyzing the data, and displaying the occurring events to the users as well as the service providers. The devices are generally controlling and controlled devices, which run on embedded operating systems to communicate data using various controlling protocols, such as Modbus and DNP3.</p><p>To ensure that SCADA systems are well maintained, security measures should be given special importance <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. Attacks on the SCADA system can cause threat to people's safety, a loss of productivity, and even some environmental damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. Some basic network systems (e.g., ports, hubs, switches, routers, firewalls, and the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)) are also general, electrical power grid components that are at risk of being attacked.</p><p>The interconnection of microprocessors used in SCADA has been an increasing trend in recent times, and this interconnection makes the SCADA system less secure <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. PLCs and DCSs used as process controllers have been replaced by IEDs, which are generally applied to control power meters, to control power stations, and to trace heat <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. Power meters, wireless LANs, IEDs, relay networks, and Master Control Centers (MCCs) are interconnected in SCADA when setting up power grids <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. With all these devices being interconnected, the network of a SCADA system is becoming less isolated and, thus, becoming prone to attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Hardware architecture</head><p>One is able to distinguish between two basic layers in a SCADA system: the client layer, which caters to the human-machine interaction and the data server layer, which handles most of the process data control activities. The data servers communicate with devices in the field through process controllers. Process controllers (e.g., PLCs) are connected to the data servers either directly or via networks or fieldbuses that are proprietary (e.g., Siemens H1) or nonproprietary (e.g., Profibus) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Data servers are connected to each other and to client stations by means of an Ethernet LAN. The data servers and client stations are NT platforms, but for many products, the client stations may also be Win95 machines. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows typical hardware architecture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Software architecture</head><p>The products are multitasking and are based upon a realtime database that is located in one or more servers. Servers are responsible for data acquisition and handling (e.g., polling controllers, alarm checking, calculations, logging, and archiving) on a set of parameters, which are typically those to which they are connected <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">4</ref> shows the software architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.  SCADA communication and security issues J. Gao et al.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Communication infrastructure</head><p>A typical SCADA communication system generally consists of a master station and many other distributed RTUs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The RTUs are interconnected to the master station through a variety of communication channels, such as radio links, leased lines, fiber optics (as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>), and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. However, one of the greatest communication challenges is that the channel limits the speed of data acquisition and control that can be performed. Furthermore, random noise on the channel is another challenge that has hindered SCADA communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. IEEE Std. C37.1-2007 is an IEEE standard for the SCADA and automation system. It gives an overview of the whole SCADA system and specifications for building a SCADA system. However, the safety, security, health, and environmental protection intentions are missing in this standard shown in <ref type="bibr">Figure 6 [65]</ref>. This standard introduced a SCADA system mainly by dividing it into two parts: the master station and remote site. The master station support, shown in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>, utilities to operate the power system <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. Master station (control center) architecture and functions include HMI, application servers (core SCADA subsystems, database subsystems, advanced application subsystems, historical databases, and configuration and management), communication front-end used for data acquisition from RTUs and field equipment, and external communication server to provide data exchange to other control centers. Remote site (substation) control system . SCADA master station system configuration at a control center without network security shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>.</p></div>

Wideband local networks used for high-speed data acquisition and control functions are excluded. This standard covers communication channels, channel interfaces, message format, information field usage, and communication management <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>.</p></div>

Therefore, after reviewing SCADA architectures, protocols and communication media, and vulnerabilities, they focused on possible strategies for NCS with regard to SCADA systems and their application in a national security and emergency preparedness and critical infrastructure protection environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Internet based</head><p>Traditional SCADA systems for power utilities relied on data transmission rather than fixed analogue circuits and modems, as shown in Figure 8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. On the other hand, the traditional ones become unfit for today's requirements. Therefore, the use of the Internet or Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/IP can overcome the limitations of analogue communications and can achieve higher bandwidth and quality communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>.</p><p>In particular, the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> proposes that the Ethernet can also be utilized to implement the SCADA communication. Furthermore, the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> applies Intranet technology to the SCADA communication system for a real-time performance and for reliability of supervisory control.</p></div>

Real-time information reporting systems, interconnected systems, and control processing and monitoring systems of SCADA need the Internet, whereas the internetworking increases vulnerabilities. SCADA systems adopt less expensive TCP/IP, Ethernet, and Microsoft Windows for financial reasons, which have a wide variety of vulnerabilities.</p><p>Encryption and data access authorization are required for secure communication between the master systems and the RTUs to prevent intruders and malicious software from damaging the system security. System security can SCADA communication and security issues J.

Before considering the higher level network security issues, we need to review SCADA system requirements: (i) electrical and environmental requirements, (ii) network resilience, that is, the ability of the systems to overcome circuit failures, and (iii) limited response times for the real-time SCADA systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>. The design of a system according to the electrical specifications and the general environmental specifications set by the government thus becomes necessary <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>.</p><p>Security issues in SCADA systems fall into two main categories: direct security threats (e.g., terrorist attacks, destruction of industrial infrastructures, and field device theft) and indirect security threats (e.g., attack by viruses, spywares, and causing system operating code logic errors) <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Attack data</head><p>In a realistic situation of a power grid being attacked, data collected by PLCs, DCSs, and RTUs are generally sent to a management group, which is composed of PCs, which can be hacked easily <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. The British Columbia Institute tracks industrial issues addressing cyber security, and it builds an Internet security incident database (ISID) that has information relating to security-related attacks on networking systems and PCSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. The data of attacks stored in this database are for future reference and for avoiding similar attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. Attacks to operating systems, applications, and multiple connected networks have been major causes recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>.</p><p>The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> presented some examples of attacks that have been reported to ISID. For example, one record shows an SQL slammer worm using four paths in the control systems to attack: (i) a nuclear power plantprocessing computer with a contractor's telephone line, (ii) a power SCADA system through a virtual private network (VPN), (iii) a petroleum control system using a laptop, and (iv) a machine HMI using a dial-up modem <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>.</p></div>

This is a major threat to the overall system safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>. • Mobile devices-mobile devices, such as laptops, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and flash drives, come with different security policies and practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>. • Internet-many studies, such as those based upon the ISID, have shown that some SCADA control systems get directly connected to the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Insecurities</head><p>There have been many factors that lead to insecurities. The use of embedded operating systems in SCADA results in many additional expenditures because it is tougher to interact with these systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>. Therefore, SCADA systems tend to use common operating systems such as UNIX, Solaris, or Windows in control center systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>. To increase the bandwidth capacity of the communicating networks, TCP/IP are used instead of the specialized protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>. All these standardizations in SCADA systems cause SCADA security to face the same challenge in traditional IT technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>.</p><p>With a system connected to share networks, it is becoming difficult to curtail the attacks, and solving these problems is a major goal of SCADA security <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> explained the significance of a power relay and the reason why they are the major targets of attackers. Power relays, which are the second most important part of the SCADA RTU, control or isolate the issues in the power grid when some electrical discrepancy arises in the grid <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. Power relays cut off the faulty area and create an isolation pool that is then restored by general smart grid error correction mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. Power relay is a major target for the attackers to collapse the grid <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>.</p><p>The following lists some of the common causes of insecurities in SCADA systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>:</p><p>• Dependency on encrypted messages-the use of IP causes vulnerability <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>.</p><p>• Segmentation-if one network and control center, which is protected by firewall, is breached, it becomes easy for the other network-connected components to be just as easily attacked <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Unsolved threats-the known vulnerabilities of</head><p>Windows or UNIX become major entry points for the attackers <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. • Personnel development-the employees of power grid companies need to be given proper training to maintain the security <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. • Absence of antivirus software-antivirus tools should be installed and connected to the Internet for downloading updates <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. • Remote observations disabled-remote control helps to notice attacks executed on the remote system.

After intruding into a grid, the hacker may operate these devices by changing the operational settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>.</p><p>The typical ways of intruding a system are carried out by finding a modem over the available devices or by finding out the company's IP address, which can be publically accessible <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. Then, the hackers send multiple input messages to figure out the connection type by using the popular dictionary, tools, or brute force password detection algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. The length of the password is proportional to the level of the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.5.">Firewalls</head><p>A survey on firewall deployment for SCADA networks was conducted by the National Infrastructure Security Coordination Center through the British Columbia Institute of Technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[90]</ref>. The firewall technique is used to monitor and control data packets to and from a network, and they are designed by keeping the security issues in mind <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. A firewall can be implemented either by separate hardware connected externally to the network or by software integrated into the operating system of SCADA, which is being secured in the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. Firewalls are utilized to protect process control network (PCN) and enterprise network (EN) from attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. PCN is a closed system with HMI systems, some data historians, workstations, and also the connecting networking medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>.</p><p>There are several types of firewalls [89]:</p><p>• The packet-filtering firewall is the simplest firewall, and it filters the packets depending upon the constraints on the activity control list of the firewall <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. • The stateful firewall accepts the anticipated data packets that belong to the previous types of firewalls faced <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. Therefore, stateful firewall is complex to design. It is also called dynamic packet-filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. • The application proxy firewall segments sections of the data packets depending upon the application that uses the data packet <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. They also put the data packet together and send it to the requesting application available on the same network <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. • The hybrid firewall is a combination of the stateful firewall and application proxy firewall <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. • The deep packet inspection firewall provides deep filtering in the application layer, and this type of firewall still remains in the development phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>.</p><p>Utility companies use remote access authorization to the controlling stations of third parties to fix outages in the PLCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. Wireless network access is also common in the SCADA system. A firewall for SCADA should be implemented to secure remote access and wireless access <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. Firewalls are also used to monitor data packets entering the PCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>.</p><p>Security, manageability, and scalability are three evaluation criteria for SCADA firewalls <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. On the basis of these criteria, there are eight architectures that have been proposed for firewalling SCADA systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>:</p><p>• A dual-homed computer uses two network interface cards, which connect to EN and PCN, to access information from both networks, but this architecture exposes the dual-homed computer as the main target for the attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. • A dual-homed server with a personal firewall is similar to a dual-homed computer, but it is employed in a server rather than a computer <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. • A network layer switch firewall is implemented by employing a network layer switch between PCN and EN <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. It typically allows one kind of packet across them, but managing these firewalls is a difficult task <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. • A firewall within two ports of the respective networks is similar to the previous architecture, but a modifiable firewall is utilized instead of a network layer switch <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. This type of firewall could filter TCP packets <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. For this architecture, the firewall is in between the two ports, and therefore, it makes management and scalability easy <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. • The combination of routers and firewalls is used for security purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. The routers are firewalled from the network, and thus, the external router takes care of the incoming packets with vulnerabilities by filtering them, and the firewall takes care of the application proxy and stateful inspection <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. The advantage is that it is easy to implement <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. • Demilitarized zones (DMZs) between networks create subnetworks for security reasons by using firewalls so that attackers can only be connected to the subnetwork <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. In SCADA systems, DMZ is formed by employing a firewall in between the switches of the two networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. It is more secure and can be easily managed and scaled <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. • Firewall pairing in between networks uses two firewalls to separate two networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. The first firewall blocks packages from the compromised server from entering into the control network. The second firewall blocks the arbitrary packages instead <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. The disadvantage is that this system exposes the server to attacks even when the networks connected to this DMZ are safe <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>.</p><p>PCN virtual LAN (VLAN) firewall is similar to the aforementioned but focuses on PCNs. It also decomposes them into several VLANs <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. These VLANs interconnect themselves to DMZ through the packet filter and network layer switch <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. These VLANs avoid the transmission of unwanted traffic across the entire PCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>. The disadvantage of this architecture is the cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[89]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">CONCLUSION</head><p>SCADA systems are the basic controlling units in the majority of the industrial systems that need a medium to connect the actual generating stations to the small units that the resource is supplied to. SCADA systems are widely used to monitor and control industrial processes. They provide the functionality of real-time monitoring, logging/ archiving, report generation, and automation among other things. On the basis of these functionalities, various SCADA architectures have been proposed and standardized, including hardware and software architecture.</p><p>However, the most open and expediently growing area is the communication infrastructure and technologies in SCADA communication. In this paper, we collected almost every documented standard in SCADA and its communication infrastructure, including IEEE Std. c37.1 and IEEE Std. 999-1992. Furthermore, many communication technologies and applications are developed on the basis of the standards. They provide faster speed as well as more secure, robust, and scalable communication for the SCADA systems. Those technologies cover web-based, Internet-based, ATM-based, TETRA network-based, wireless-based and even cell phone-based SCADA communication networks.</p><p>In addition, we analyzed the architecture of SCADA networks in modern day smart grids or power grids so that we could have a better understanding of the systems. Also, we observed the various security threats to a SCADA system in power grids. We, then, analyzed various forms of threats pertaining to the grid. We listed the various forms of attacks that are possible and that generally occur on a system, and we provided what needs to be carried out to stop these threats in the future. Also, we addressed the ways to mitigate such attacks.</p><p>SCADA systems have evolved with the development of both IT technology and communication technologies. The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[92]</ref> argues that SCADA systems have evolved from mainframe-based systems to flat client-server architecture now and that even flatter architecture and more distributed computing will be the direction for progression. Meanwhile, advancements in server Operating System (OS), databases, and communication tools will be the power drive for SCADA systems.</p><p>The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[93]</ref> believes that traditional SCADA systems will become an integrated SCADA and substation/distribution automation system. The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[94]</ref> applied artificial intelligence techniques, such as multiagent, to practice the SCADA automation. The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[95]</ref> suggests the implementation of the SCADA DC motor with a fuzzy logic controller on a neural network.</p><p>Extensibility and interoperability are also two of the future trends of SCADA system. The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[96]</ref> argues that there are two major drawbacks to current SCADA systems. First, wireless sensor networking is a promising technology in SCADA communication, which can significantly improve the sensing capability; however, it is difficult to integrate sensor networks with current SCADA systems because of their lack of interoperability. Then, current SCADA systems limit extensibility to new applications. For example, if a company should want to extend its SCADA system by adding a safety alarm system, it would be very difficult to add that application <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[96]</ref>. Therefore, it is very important to enable the interoperability and extensibility of the future SCADA system.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 4 .</head><label>4</label><figDesc>Figure 4.
