<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study proposes a higher-order multidimensional construct of service innovation readiness (SIR) based on the organizational change literature and the awareness-motivation-capability perspective. Service innovation is gaining more attention due to its potential value for creating competitive advantage and improving organizational performance. This research conceptualizes SIR to consist of two adopting contexts (i.e., "strategic orientation toward service innovation" and "enabling mechanism of service innovation") that, together, determine a firm's preparation to adopt organizational changes involved in service innovation. Six dimensions are also identified from a literature review and verified by industry expert interviews to define the two multidimensional adopting contexts. Data collected from 312 Taiwanese firms provide evidence to support the proposed factor structure of SIR and show that SIR positively correlates with SI performance. The findings contribute to the literature by theorizing SIR with a parsimonious structure that captures the complex conditions necessary for adopting service innovation. This study also yields some insight into the management of service innovation by providing managers an assessment that can be used to gauge a firm's status and direct its efforts in continuous improvement.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The world's economic landscape is changing and is characterized, in part, by the fact that services dominate the economies of not only the world's most advanced nations but also many fast-growing and developing countries. For instance, in China, the government has mandated a focus on services growth for the next five years and further into the future, despite that it previously allocated tremendous national energies on manufacturing <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In addition, many leading firms have added service to their product offerings and provide total customer solutions. Scholars contend that manufacturing firms should shift toward "solution" and/or "service" offerings to improve their competitiveness in an era of increasing commoditization that characterizes many product markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>. That is, companies across different industries are realizing they must compete in service to survive and grow in the future. As companies acknowledge the existence of the challenges, they may also recognize the need to stay innovative in their service offerings so they are prepared for increasing global competition.</p><p>Notwithstanding the trend, service innovation has remained among the least understood topics in the service management and innovation literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. The importance of service innovation is highlighted in a recent article that indicates "identifying drivers of sustained new service success" is a prioritized research topic for the science of service <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. As noted by Jim Spohrer, Director of Service Research at IBM, "people have a good idea of what technological innovation is, but service innovation is more hidden." <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. The dearth of insights on how companies can prepare themselves for service innovation is noteworthy when one considers the potential of service innovation to drive revenues and affect people's lives. Hence, it would be a top priority for firms to be able to evaluate their readiness for service innovation prior to considering other issues pertaining to the implementation of service innovation.</p><p>"Readiness" is not a novel concept in the literature, and a review of the literature reveals a number of prior studies that have investigated individuals' readiness to adopt IT, IS, or technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref>. The readiness concept becomes more complicated when an organization, rather than individuals, is the focus of adoption because firm-level readiness for innovation tends to depend on a wide variety of factors. For example, several studies have focused on human, business, and technology resources as organizational readiness factors required for adoption of innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref>. Others give more emphasis to attitude of top management <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, organizational characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>, or environmental conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. These studies suggest that research on firm-level readiness can, at best, only provide a partial explanation of the phenomenon and it is difficult to develop a unifying, one-sizefits-all framework of innovation readiness since the framework may be sensitive to the type of innovation and its adoption context. Although one might expect these readiness factors to be equivalently explanatory when applied in the context of service innovation (SI), one should avoid such facile generalization of prior research findings without taking SI characteristics into consideration. In sum, what has been noticeably missing from the literature is a robust framework and instrument to study the factors that affect readiness for service innovation and firm-level empirical evidence to explicate these factors.</p><p>Against this background, we propose the concept of service innovation readiness (SIR), which signifies a firm's self-assessment of its readiness for effectively implementing service innovation. To our knowledge, no construct in the literature of innovation and service science has fully captured this aspect of service innovation. The purpose of this study, then, is to demarcate the SIR concept and a corresponding framework that can be used for developing an inventory. To accomplish the purpose, the organization change (OC) view <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and the awareness-motivation-capability model of competitive perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> are used to develop a factor structure for SIR. To more precisely describe the compound structure of SIR with a parsimonious framework, we conceived it as a higher-order composite construct consisting of two multi-dimensional constructs that specify the conditions necessary for building up a firm's readiness for service innovation. We validate this construct and its measurement with a survey of 312 firms in Taiwan.</p><p>In doing so, this study makes several significant contributions to the extant knowledge of service innovation. First, it addresses an emerging but understudied topic by conceptually and empirically examining the critical managerial dimensions underlying service innovation. By identifying the actionable conditions and mechanism that constitutes a firm's SIR, this study tackles an important issue that has been identified as a top research priority in service science <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. Second, our conceptualization of SIR as a higher-order formative construct allows this study to delineate what actions and resource of the firm should be attended to and how they can be integrated to enhance service innovation performance. This study validates the conceptualization of SIR with findings in support of the predicted relationship between SIR and its determinants and consequences in a nomological net. Third, being empirically supported as a reliable and valid measure in this study, SIR offers a useful tool for selfdiagnosis and a practical guideline that managers can use to create organizational strategies and resources to prepare the firm for adopting service innovation.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section provides an overview of service innovation, and this is followed by a theoretical conceptualization of SIR. Based on literature review, we identify two determining factors of SIR and their corresponding dimensions. In later sections, we report the research methods employed and the empirical validation of the SIR instrument. Finally, we present a discussion of results and their implications, and directions for future work in this area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Service innovation</head><p>Despite an extensive literature on service management, service marketing, and service innovation, frameworks for managing service innovation remain scarce <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">92]</ref>. Early work focused on differentiating services from goods based on four characteristics, namely intangibility, heterogeneity, inseparability (or simultaneity of production and consumption), and perishability (inability to inventory service output) <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>. Yet, emerging views argue those characteristics are not generalizable to all services, while many goods actually possess one or more of these properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. For example, tangible goods are often purchased for intangible benefits and are heterogeneous. A strong argument about the inappropriateness of such a distinction, proposed by Vargo and Lusch <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>, suggests that the attempt to define service by contradistinction from tangible goods prohibits a full understanding of the rich roles of service in an exchange. Furthermore, they posit that "service is the fundamental basis for exchange" and the value of products (i.e., goods and services) is mainly through the "service" that is provided to customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">95]</ref>. Taking this broad perspective, service can take different forms to include the core offerings, as well as the activities that enhance the value of technical and manufactured products or that, when combined with tangible products, provide a total solution for the customer <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The recent tendency toward industrialization in services and customization in manufacturing, which has blurred the distinctions between manufacturing and services <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, also supports of the need for a broad view of service.</p><p>Along with the "services versus goods" distinction, there is an ongoing debate about whether service innovation can be analyzed using the same concepts and tools used in manufacturing innovation. The diversified views of service are further illustrated in the conceptualizations of service innovation. Coombs and Miles <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> distinguish among three different approaches to define and study service innovation, which reflects the existence of distinctive assumptions about service innovation. The first approach, taking an assimilation perspective, proposes that the theories and concepts developed in manufacturing contexts can easily be transferred to understand service innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. Evidence in support of this perspective shows that differences between services and manufacturing are smaller than within the service and manufacturing sectors, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>. The assimilation approach, however, has been questioned for its limited focus on analytical frameworks primarily derived from manufacturing without consideration of the idiosyncrasies of services <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. The second approach, a demarcation perspective, emphasizes the distinctive features of services that, in turn, make it difficult to transfer knowledge from manufacturing to services <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73]</ref>. The danger of the demarcation perspective lies in inferring that these peculiarities (e.g., intangibility and heterogeneity) are unique for services, whereas they might actually be as characteristic of manufacturing. By broadening the innovation concept to encompass features of service innovation, the demarcation approach brings to the forefront hitherto neglected elements of innovation that are also relevant to manufacturing.</p><p>Inspired by the demarcation view, the synthesis stream, as the third approach, focuses on efforts to bring together innovation in services and manufacturing rather than studying the two fields separately <ref type="bibr">[24,31M,73]</ref>. Gallouj and Weinstein <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, among the first to theorize a synthesis perspective on types and elements of "products," explicitly offer an integrative framework to the study of innovation in both services and manufacturing sectors. In fact, as researchers have gradually acknowledged that service innovation constitutes a distinct research area, the need to argue in favor of the specificities of service innovation with regards to product innovation in order to justify research on service innovation also declines <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Many scholars now turn to the trend of trying to synthesize innovation research in product and service innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. The synthesis approach, together with the emerging logic that views service as the fundamental basis of exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>, illuminates the call for a broader perspective of service innovation that can be applied to different industries.</p><p>Accordingly, we refer to the recent work of Ostrom et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref> and define service innovation as the practices to "create value for customers, employees, business owners, alliance partners, and communities through new and/or improved service offerings, service processes, and service business models." The definition reflects that service innovation may induce changes in multiple aspects of the organization (e.g., service concept, service delivery process and revenue model). Such a definition of service innovation is also broad enough that it can apply to both service and manufacturing industries. Because managing the various changes could complicate the service innovation efforts, it highlights the significant role of a firm's readiness for the changes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Defining service innovation readiness</head><p>As previously mentioned, service is the fundamental basis of exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>. The emerging view that a firm can enhance its competitive advantage through service <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> and the long held belief that innovation is a basic function of the firm [1] also imply the strategic importance of service innovation. At the same time, organizational readiness is suggested to play an important role in determining an organization's innovation readiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. However, frameworks and empirical studies for strategic management of service innovation remain scarce <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">92]</ref>. Hence, we propose the concept "service innovation readiness" (SIR) and characterize it as a firm's readiness for adopting service innovation based on assessment of its adopting contexts. While many factors affect the adoption of service innovation, we draw on theories of OC, supplemented by perspectives of the awareness-motivation-capability model of competitive action, strategic orientation, and resource-based view to guide our development of the two adopting contexts of SIR and their forming dimensions.</p><p>As suggested in the aforementioned definition, service innovation may encompass changes in multiple aspects of an organization's operations, thus, adopting service innovation implies significant organizational change <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. According to the organizational change literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, firms are inclined to adopt service innovation if the changes are perceived as needed and the organizations are capable of executing the changes. Also, organizational change is considered to be an outcome jointly determined by the motivation, opportunity, and capability to change <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. While opportunity to change may reflect the challenges embedded in the environment, motivation and capability to change are both the imperatives for managing service innovation. The stimulus-response model of social cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref> also offers useful insights to develop the two forming elements of SIR. Kiesler and Sproull <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> state that, before an organization can take actions to respond to a stimulus, it must first become aware of this stimulus and become motivated to act. In addition, the organization must be capable of taking the actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The stimulus-response model-awareness, motivation, and capability-provides a theoretical underpinning to derive the SIR constructs. Applying these views, we propose two constructs that define a firm's readiness for service innovation: (1) Strategic orientation toward service innovation (SOSI), and (2) enabling mechanism for service innovation (EMSI).</p><p>SOSI pertains to the degree to which a firm focuses its business strategy on service innovation. A firm's strategic orientation reflects the strategic directions executed by a firm to produce the proper behaviors for continuous superior performance of the business <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. A firm will tend to develop an SI-focus strategy orientation when it is aware of a gap between current performance and the desired endstate, together with the recognition of service innovation as the key to eliminating the gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The stronger the motivation to eliminate the gap, the greater is the effort to implement such a strategic orientation. Evidence also exists that firms with successful service innovation share strong commitment to innovation, have well-structured innovation efforts, and allocate substantial resources to their innovation efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. In order to proactively adopt the necessary changes, firms must have a positive attitude toward risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. In turn, firms with the proclivity to respond to market competitiveness with focused investment in service innovation and the willingness to take risk for achieving service innovation should foster more and faster service innovations. Thus, we specify two dimensions, namely strategic investment and risk tolerance, which together define a firm's SOSI EMSI is proposed as another adopting context that complements the influence of SOSI on SIR. Specifically, it represents the ability that a firm needs for effective implementation of its strategic focus on service innovation. The resource-based view (RBV) claims that firms create a sustainable competitive advantage by possessing inimitable, nonsubstitutable, rare, and valuable resources and capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. As stated by Winter <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>, a more innovation capable organization is one that can build and deploy distinctive resources faster than others. Without the support of firm resources, the organization's change endeavors based on high awareness and motivation for SI will not turn into effective innovation performance. Toward that end, firms with strong readiness for service innovation require the ability to mobilize and combine new and existing resources into an organizational mechanism that works together with the firm's strategy to facilitate service innovation. Prior research suggests that firms maintaining structural, systematic, and procedural mechanisms of current routines can facilitate the exploitation of new ideas into service innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.To reflect this consideration, we define EMSI as the degree to which a firm has a mechanism that enables the adoption of service innovation. Further, EMSI represents a competency, based on effectively combining the firm's existing resources, methods, systems, and routines, which can advantageously transform inputs (e.g., knowledge and experiences) into outputs (e.g., innovative service).</p><p>Because innovation involves the purposeful coordination and focused application of organizational skills and knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>, an innovative firm must be capable of acquiring and utilizing knowledge capital and facilitating learning. This is particularly true when ideas for service innovation are widely distributed around the value chain, making the exploitation of knowledge from various sources one core capability in the management of service innovation. For example, frontline employees are usually viewed as a valuable source of new service ideas and a resource in planning delivery and implementation of new services <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>. According to Vargo and Lusch <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>, a service-centered enterprise needs to identify or develop core competences that are bundles of basic resources, such as skills, technologies, routines, actions, or operations. It is through the utilization of knowledge, applied in concert with the knowledge of other members of the service chain, that a firm is able to make value propositions and gain competitive advantage. Hence, we propose four knowledge-based resources as the forming dimensions of EMSI. Specifically, we conceive that SI champions, inter-organizational collaboration, SI experience, and IT experience will together determine the capability to effectively develop and coordinate internal and external knowledge resources in support of the changes needed for service innovation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">SOSI dimensions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Strategic investment</head><p>The first dimension determining SOSI is strategic investment. Successful innovation performance starts with an innovation-focused strategy because such a strategy, particularly while being aligned with the overall plan, will ensure appropriate and adequate resources are allocated for realizing service innovation in the firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref>. In this study, strategic investment is characterized by the extent to which a firm strategically focuses on service innovation and allocates its investment in executing the plan. As shown in previous studies, technology leaders tend to have large R&amp;D expenses <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> and perceive new product development as being important <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. In a related manner, SI-focused strategic investment ensures that appropriate resources and practices are in keeping with the firm's business strategy to compete through service innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. For example, because service innovation often involves development of new procedures and concepts rather than new core technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>, companies need to be deliberative in resource allocation so the innovation effort aligns with their strategic focus on service innovation. Based on these arguments, we predict that companies tend to develop higher SOSI when they have greater strategic investment in service innovation, which in turns enhances the firm's SIR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Risk tolerance</head><p>The second SOSI dimension, risk tolerance, refers to the extent to which a firm is willing to tolerate actual or potential losses of its investments while implementing service innovation. In spite of the well-recognized contribution of service innovation to the firm's future well-being, many firms may still miss the opportunity to move an innovative idea forward due to their reluctance to forgo prior investment and current competencies. Thus, one pivotal factor separating innovators from other firms is the willingness of the former to cannibalize their investments <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Chandy and Tellis <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> first introduced the concept of "willingness to cannibalize" (W2C) in 1998 and defined it as "the extent to which a firm is prepared to reduce the actual or potential value of its investment." W2C is a critical organization-level attitude because firms making substantial profit from their current offerings may be reluctant to embrace innovation as it may make their investment, current capabilities, and existing products obsolete <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. This could be particularly true for developing new service due to ease of imitation and lack of strong patent protection <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>. The reluctance may make the firms less responsive to market changes and result in a lack of innovation. Because the innovative process is a long-term investment that requires commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>, firms that intend to foster service innovation have to develop a strategic orientation of moving toward the future rather than an orientation of simply wanting to protect the firm's past position <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. As such, we propose that the firms high in risk tolerance, reflected by the firm's W2C, will have higher levels of strategic focus on SI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">EMSI dimensions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1.">SI champions</head><p>When firms develop new services, SI champions are crucial enablers because they are the individuals within the organization who seek out creative ideas and make them tangible through coalition building, knowledge sharing, and persuasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In fact, innovation of all kinds requires champions who provide energy and momentum to the implementation process by supporting and promoting the innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>. Rather than directly influencing the success of innovation, a champion may influence other people and processes during innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Even though SI champions could be any employee in the firm, top management has long been regarded as prominent promoters of change/innovation implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Alternatively, an SI champion could be someone from line management. In the context of service innovation, ideas could also derive from bottom layers of the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81]</ref>, and only those that are brought to the attention of higher-level decision makers have the opportunity of being transformed into new offerings <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. During the upward movement, SI champions from line management play a critical role encouraging the generation of ideas and advancing the potential offerings towards approval. To effectively enable the change, SI champions demonstrate "living the innovation" by getting involved personally during the process and turn others into innovation pursuers <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Thus, we define SI champions as the extent to which a firm's managers actively and enthusiastically promote service innovation by influencing their staffs and leading by example. Through their guidance and coaching efforts, SI champions bring together the knowledge resources that enhance the firm's ability to execute SI-related changes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2.">Inter-organizational collaboration</head><p>Many value propositions of services are from combinations of elements provided by different service providers that together fulfill customer needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>. This implies that service providers frequently codesign and co-produce services with suppliers and customers, making the ability to manage the collaboration one key mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. Referring to Sanders <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>, we define inter-organizational collaboration as the degree to which a firm collaborates with its partners on information sharing, responding to market change, and planning for business development. Prior research provides consistent support for the idea that collaboration and integration across different firms improves firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84]</ref>. Through the collaboration, a firm can expand and/or renew its current resources and, in turn, strengthen its capacity to innovate its services <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. We believe this dimension reflects a firm's ability to sense and discover the valuable opportunities possibly derived from collaboration and the ability to reconfigure service systems for service innovation adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.3.">SI experience</head><p>The literature of business and marketing strategy has long emphasized the role of organizational experience or familiarity with products and markets. Previous research has also observed that stored information or memory may affect product development. For example, Cohen and Levinthal <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> note that a high level of previous learning increases a firm's absorptive capacity, which permits more effective use of additional knowledge. Likewise, organizations should develop routines for reactivating previously acquired knowledge in new product development <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. The knowledge that companies gained from prior experiences makes the acquisition and retention of new knowledge easier <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and decreases the total quantity of knowledge that must be acquired <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. Taken together, these contentions imply that greater prior SI experience in service innovation should promote organizational learning that enhances the firms' ability to assess and exploit newly acquired information, which then fosters the firm's readiness for service innovation. Hence, we propose SI experience as one defining characteristic of EMSI, which refers to the extent to which a firm has previously engaged in a variety of SI-related practices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.4.">IT experience</head><p>Information technology plays a pivotal role in a firm's daily operations and is considered imperative in its ability to create and sustain a competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. The utilization of IT enhances information processing and coordination activities in an environment that is high in uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Although IT per se may not necessarily generate a sustainable advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, its value can be protected when it is enhance by the presence of another resource <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>. For example, IT deployment can facilitate innovation when systems are synergistic and supportive <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82]</ref>. Service-dominant logic suggests that the support of IT facilitates value-creation collaboration with partners within the firm and across the entire value-creation network <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. In this study, IT experience is able to generate sustainable advantage as it bundles with other EMSI resources to enhance the firm's learning of SI information and coordination of SI activities. We refer to Menor and Roth <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> and characterize IT experience as the degree to which a firm uses information technology to assist SI implementation by facilitating and improving intra-and inter-firm coordination of activities and information processes. As noted by Heskett et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, most successful service organizations are information-based primarily through the utilization of IT systems. This is especially characteristic of service innovation when the level of uncertainty is normally high and relies greatly on coordination as well as communication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Model summary</head><p>Drawing on the OC perspective, we view service innovation as a type of organizational change that firms take to respond and adapt to market competition. Because the adoption of service innovation at the firm level could be complex and involves assessment of multiple conditions, this study develops a multidimensional and hierarchical model to represent the proposed characteristics of SIR. This model suggests that a firm would form an overall assessment of SIR on the basis of its evaluation of the two adopting context-SOSI and EMSI, whereas the degree of SOSI and EMSI are each determined by the firm's perceived performance on their corresponding dimensions. In addition, we posit that SOSI and EMSI are complementary in their influences on a firm's readiness for service innovation. SOSI is a complement of EMSI because the strategic focus can facilitate a firm's utilization of its resources to successfully adopt or implement new systems, processes, or products <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> while EMSI makes the firm's strategy to compete with service innovation possible with the needed competencies.</p><p>Although research constructs conceived at an abstract level are commonly specified as second-order factors, we suggest that modeling SIR as a third-order factor will facilitate the recognition of the complexity of this concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> while simultaneously tying the overall assessment of SIR to actionable dimensions in a hierarchical and meaningful manner. Furthermore, while the use of reflectively measured latent constructs is more common in research on information systems, a formative conceptualization of SIR is considered more appropriate in this study for two reasons. First, a formative model better depicts the relationships among SIR, SOSI, and EMSI, because SOSI and EMSI are the determinants, rather than the consequences, of SIR. That is, the causality direction in a formative model moves from indicators to the higher-order variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Second, indicators in reflective models should be interchangeable <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. However, this does not apply to SOSI and EMSI because they represent characteristics that are complementary, diverse, and not interchangeable in this study. This study also specifies SOSI and EMSI as formative constructs for the same reasons existing in the relationship between the two constructs and their forming dimensions. Finally, the formative factor structure will more appropriately reflect our reasoning of SIR, SOSI, and EMSI as evaluations of the firm's SIR conditions that are defined together by the dimensions corresponding to each of them.</p><p>For the purpose of construct validation, the model also includes SI performance. Based on the defining characteristics of SIR, a firm with high SIR is more inclined to adopt service innovation due to more positive assessment of its possession of two advantage-creating contexts. We reason that the possession of SI enabling competences with guidance of SI-oriented strategy will help the firm generate new service experiences and service solutions that meet customer needs, and that, subsequently, enhance firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. Thus, a positive relationship should appear between SIR and SI performance if the SIR measures developed in this study appropriately capture the essence of this construct.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Research methodology</head><p>This study takes the following steps to validate the SIR concept. First, we conduct a qualitative study for a purpose of verifying the SIR dimensions identified in the literature review. Second, we develop a survey that assesses the five SIR dimensions and SI performance. Third, we validate the factor structure of the SIR concept as a thirdorder formative construct with empirical data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Qualitative study and construct validation</head><p>Prior research suggests that between-method triangulation can help researchers enhance the credibility of their results <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. To validate the SIR dimensions identified in the literature review with an industry perspective, we adopted between-method triangulation and conducted three focus groups. Senior managers and executives representing a variety of business sections in Taiwan were invited to participate in the sessions because their areas of responsibility included SI-related practices in their respective organizations. Each session consisted of 12-15 participants and lasted for approximately 1.5 h. Based on the purpose of this study, the moderator of the discussion focused on two questions: (1) How does the firm engender and engage the whole organization to take part in the changes necessary for realizing service innovation? <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> What are the mechanisms/ capabilities that are critical in facilitation of SI-induced changes? We designed the two questions to probe the participants to discuss the two adopting contexts identified in this study. Guided by the two questions, we encouraged the participants to share their experiences of acquiring and/or reconfiguring resources that determine their motivation to adopting the changes involved in service innovation and the capabilities organizations need for carrying out the changes.</p><p>The interviews were audio taped and transcribed for further analysis. Three researchers with appropriate knowledge, skills, and SI project experience worked independently to read the interview segments and identify thoughts, ideas, and perceptions that emerged from each focus group interview. For categorization purposes, each emerged concept was placed into one category based on its similarity/dissimilarity to others independently judged by the three researchers. Some segments were dropped due to ambiguity or lack of clarity. After several iterations, all the concepts were classified into six categories, whereas the concepts in the same category reflect a common theme identified by the researchers. A scrutiny of the results reveals that the emerging themes correspond to the six SIR dimensions, confirming the content validity of the SIR factors. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents samples of respondent comments supporting the two SIR-forming constructs and their corresponding dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Measures</head><p>As described previously, we conceptualize SIR as a concept consisting of two second-order constructs. Specifically, SOSI and EMSI are composed of two and four dimensions, respectively. Except for "SI champions" and "SI experience," all other dimensions are variables that have been well established in the literature. Thus, we used existing scales as the basis for developing measures that fit the context of this study. In order to ensure the items were accurately captured when translated into Chinese, the conventional back-translation process was applied to the survey instrument before pre-testing.</p><p>Specifically, we adapted from two existing scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref> to provide a seven-item measure of "strategic investment". The items assess the extent to which a firm's investment is guided by its strategic focus on service innovation. The measure of "risk tolerance," coming from Nijssen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, consisted of six items that gauge a firm's willingness to tolerate actual and potential loss of investments induced by SI. On the basis of previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, we developed five items for the dimension "SI champions" to measure the extent to which the managers encourage and lead the employees in generating ideas for new services. To assess "inter-organizational collaboration," four items were adapted from Sanders <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref> to indicate the degree to which a firm collaborates with its partners in responding to market change. We measure "IT experience" with four items adapted from Menor and Roth <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref> to indicate the degree to which a firm uses information technology to facilitate and improve coordination and information processing of SI-related activities.</p><p>Based on the definition taken from Ostrom et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, service innovation refers to value-creation practices that consist of one or combination of new and/or improved "service offerings," "service processes," and "service business models." Hence, we measure SI experience by the extent to which the firm has engaged in the three forms of service innovation, with a higher value indicating a greater degree of SI experience. A total of nine items, three for each SI form, were developed to evaluate "SI experience." Instead of using direct measures, we modeled the two constructs, SOSI and EMSI, following the procedure suggested by Diamantopoulos and Winklhofer <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. We first computed the weights of the first-order factors to their designated second-order constructs using principle component factor analysis, then summed the weights of the first-order factors to form the two constructs' values. Finally, a global assessment of SIR was measured using two items developed based on the SIR definition. All the measures, which appear in the Appendix, use 7-point Likert-type scales anchored at strongly agree ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) "Although serving people is our major business, we rely on continuous service innovation to compete in the marketplace.

Based on their feedback, we modified the sales by rewording scale items that were subsequently administered to a pool of 130 managers for a pilot test. A preliminary analysis performed on the data indicates the items all loaded significantly on their respective dimensions, except two items for strategic investment and one for risk tolerance. Those three items were dropped from the survey instruments for their low factor loadings, leaving the final version of the SIR measures as a collection of 31 items assessing the six dimensions and another 2 items for a global measure of SIR. For validating the SIR scales, we adapted four items from Menor and Roth <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> to measure a firm's SI performance (see the Appendix A).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Research sample and data collection</head><p>The present study uses a two-step process to choose final respondents. Although we conceive SI as a practice applicable to both manufacturing and service industries, a preliminary survey for this project 1 indicates that SI is still a concept rather unfamiliar and novel to most manufacturing firms in Taiwan. Therefore, this study focuses on five important service sectors in Taiwan. Three sectors (retailing, financial services, and information services) were selected because they were the primary contributors to the gross output value in Taiwan during the period of 2005-2008. Healthcare services and tourism, two emerging sectors that have received strong government support, were also included due to the critical roles they are expected to play in Taiwan's economic development.</p><p>The second step involved contacting potential candidates from a sampling frame consisting of 2500 services firms that were randomly selected from the CCIS (China Credit Information Service) 2 database. Based on criteria defined by CCIS, the companies of each industry were grouped into large versus small and medium-sized enterprises. We then sampled firms from each industry on the basis of company size. A team from a professional survey company conducted telephone interviews from September through November 2009. Attempts were made to contact each firm in the sampling frame to identify the appropriate key informants who were senior-and top-level managers or executives in charge of SI-related activities in the firm. The phone interview started with a briefing indicating the purpose and significance of the study, while a definition of service innovation was also provided to assure a common understanding of the focal concept among the respondents. The final sample consists of 312 valid responses, representing a response rate of 12.48%. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> presents the demographic information of the firms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Scale reliability</head><p>We follow the approach suggested by Anderson and Gerbing <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> to assess the SIR model. The first step involves the analysis of the measurement model and the second step consists of testing the structural relationships in our framework. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted on the 31 SIR items using AMOS 5.0 to develop a measurement model with the six first-order SIR dimensions. The analysis reveals that most items loaded significantly (p b .001) on their respective dimensions with values above the cutoff of 0.7, suggesting adequate reliability (see the Appendix A).</p><p>The Cronbach alpha coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> were all above the threshold value of 0.7 that Nunnally <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> recommended. However, the alpha values as a traditional approach to evaluate reliability has been noted for a shortcoming of using restrictive assumptions regarding equal importance of all indicators. To avoid this potential bias, we also computed composite reliability that assesses whether measurement items sufficiently represent their respective constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The reliability statistics ranged between 0.93 and 0.98, which attest to the reliability of the SIR scales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Convergent and discriminant validity</head><p>In addition to reliability, we performed a series of validity tests on the six first-order SIR dimensions. Convergent validity, defined as the existence of one latent factor or construct underlying a set of measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, was verified on three criteria suggested by Fornell and Larcker <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> all indicator loadings should be significant and exceed 0.7, (2) the composite reliability should exceed 0.8, and (3) the average variance extracted for the constructs should be greater than 0.5. As mentioned above, all standardized factor loadings of the items and the composite reliability coefficients were above the suggested thresholds. Additionally, we computed the average variance extracted by the indicators corresponding to each of the six SIR dimensions. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, the average variance extracted (AVE) for all dimensions exceed the cutoff of .05. Taken together, these findings demonstrate satisfactory convergent validity of all dimensions.</p><p>Discriminant validity, which refers to uniqueness and the independence of the measures, is evaluated using three criteria. First, an examination of items' cross-loadings indicates adequate discriminant validity because the loading of each measurement item on its designated latent variable (i.e., SIR dimension) is larger than its value on any other dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Second, the correlations among all dimensions are below the suggested cutoff value of 0.8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, indicating they are distinct from each other. Third, following the procedure suggested by Fornell and Larcker <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, discriminant validity is evident when the square root of the AVE for each dimension is greater than the correlation between that dimension and any other dimensions in the model. The results are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, which indicate support for the discriminant validity of the SIR scales. 1 A telephone survey was conducted three months prior to the current study to investigate Taiwanese firms' perception of service innovation. The survey of top managers from 648 Taiwanese firms indicates that managers of the manufacturing firms mostly perceived service innovation as technology innovation or innovation in tangible products. This result suggests that the majority of top management in manufacturing firms seem to misinterpret the nature of service innovation. 2 CCIS is the largest and leading credit information agency in Taiwan. Its annual report of the top 5000 businesses in Taiwan has remained the most valuable credit information reference books for corporations and the government. CCIS also owns the most comprehensive database of business information in Taiwan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Validating higher-order constructs</head><p>Because SOSI and EMSI are both higher-order constructs formed by multiple dimensions, it is necessary to estimate the construct validity of second-order constructs and test whether any of the first-order dimensions need to be omitted due to high correlations. The six firstorder dimensions were chosen as determinants because we expect them to be relevant to either SOSI or EMSI. The coefficient of each dimension 3 to its designated construct can be used to assess the contribution and significance of individual dimensions, and can be interpreted as validity coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The results indicate that the influence (γi) of the six dimensions on their designated secondorder constructs were significant (p b .001). Furthermore, it is desirable that first-order dimensions do not correlate perfectly with each other because high multi-collinearity among them would also challenge the discriminant validity of the dimensions as formative elements of SOSI or EMSI <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Using the procedure suggested by Hair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, we performed two statistical tests to address this concern. The values of tolerance and variance inflation factor (VIF) for the six constructs are below the cut-off thresholds, indicating no multicollinearity (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). Hence, a formative model seems to be suitable.</p><p>Additionally, this study conceptualizes SIR as a third-order formative variable consisting of two second-order constructs, SOSI and EMSI. Using similar procedures, we calculated the path weights (γ i ) from the two second-order constructs-SOSI and EMSI-to SIR <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The value of SIR was obtained using the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">SIR ¼ 0:24 SOSI ð Þþ0:68 EMSI ð Þ</formula><p>If SIR, as formed by SOSI and EMSI, depicts what it is intended to measure, it should positively correlate with the two indicator items that assessed overall SIR. The correlation coefficient between the formative SIR construct and overall SIR assessment is 0.82 (p b .001), supporting the construct validity of SIR as a formative variable. To ensure the formative factor structure of SIR, we conducted the multicollinearity analysis between the two SIR forming constructs-SOSI and EMSI. The values of tolerance and variance inflation factors (VIF) are below the cut-off thresholds (Tolerance values for SOSI and EMSI = 0.26; VIF = 3.91) and indicate no multi-collinearity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Model assessment and predictive validity</head><p>We assessed the conceptual model of SIR with a structural model using partial least squares (PLS) Graph Version 3.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Since PLS does not generate the goodness-of-fit measures that are regularly used in LISREL and AMOS <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, the model fit was primarily assessed by explained variance (R 2 ), the Stone-Geisser criterion (Q 2 ), and GoF (goodness of fit) <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>. The proposed model explains a considerable proportion of the variance in SIR (R 2 = 0.80) and SI performance (R 2 = 0.52). Stone-Geisser's Q 2 , which measures the predictive power of the structural model, was computed using the blindfold approach proposed by Wold <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>. The 0.21 value of Stone-Geisser's Q 2 is considered acceptable because positive Q 2 signals sufficient predictive power <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref>. The GoF value is a general criterion measuring the global fit of the PLS model <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>. We calculated the geometric mean of average communality and average R 2 (for endogenous constructs), and obtained a GoF value of 0.41 (GoF= ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi 0:84x0:32 p</p><p>) which exceeds the cutoff value of 0.36 for a large effect size <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>. These model fit measures indicated acceptable agreement with the variance in the data.</p><p>Finally, this study provides additional tests for the factor structure of SIR. Scholars have suggested the conceptual meaning of a construct should be determined not only by its definition and operationalization but also by its relationship with antecedents and consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. As discussed in the model summary, we expect a positive relationship between SIR and SI performance if the former properly captures a firm's readiness for service innovation. In order to control the effects that might derive from other characteristics of the surveyed firm, the model includes market type (global vs. domestic), customer type (business vs. consumer customer), and company size as additional predictors of SI performance. The analysis indicates only one significant control variable-customer type, which shows that SI performance appears to be higher for firms in business markets than for those in consumer markets. Finally, SIR positively relates to SI performance (λ = 0.69, p b .001) and accounts for 52% of variance in SI performance. The results establish further support for the predictive validity of SIR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>Facing highly complex and turbulent environments, service innovation has become a gateway for firms to maintain or capture markets, outdistance competitors, and assure sustainable growth. What drives the firms to continuously innovate their service offerings and establish competitive advantage? Based on a literature review and verification by industry expert interviews, this study proposes a theoretically driven conceptualization of SIR to address this question. The conceptual mode is empirically tested with a survey of 312 service firms. The results confirm the proposed factor structure of SIR and provide evidence to support the reliability and validity of the SIR scales.</p><p>This study has important research and practical implications that benefit service innovation research in several ways. First, this study contributes to the literature of innovation and service science by proposing the SIR construct that specifies the crucial conditions for a firm's adoption of service innovation. In particular, this effort addressing issues pertaining to "stimulating service innovation" is regarded as one of the top-ten research priories for service science <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. Diagonal value (in bold): square root of AVEs, off-diagonal value: correlations. CR = composite reliabilities. 3 Following the procedure suggested by Diamantopoulos and Winklhofer <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, we model the path weights (γi) from the firstto the second-order constructs using a principal components factor analysis. The value of SOSI and EMSI were obtained using the following formula: SOSI = 0.60 (strategic investment) + 0.48 (risk tolerance) EMSI = 0.25 (SI champions) + 0.22 (Inter-Org. collaboration) + 0.23 (SI experience) + 0.43 (IT experience) Second, this study extends the literature by proposing a hierarchical and multidimensional factor structure to capture the conceptual richness of SIR with a parsimonious model. Prior research suggests that service innovation is a complex phenomenon that could only be determined through a variety of capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. The use of higher-order models in this study allows us to include the multiple determinants of SIR without sacrificing the parsimony of the model. Furthermore, higher-order models permit distinctions between indicator-level measurement error and factor-level measurement error, which, in turn, provides the most powerful means to test and evaluate the construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>.</p><p>Third, this study contributes to the knowledge of service innovation management by conceptualizing and validating a formative factor structure of SIR, which can more precisely explicate the relevance among the dimensions and the relationships among dimensions and higher order constructs. The proposed relationships among SIR, SOSI and EMSI, lend some credence to the servicedominant logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref> regarding the importance of operant resources in creating competitive advantage. While a goods-dominant view focuses on static and usually tangible resources (e.g., products and units of output) that must be acted upon to be useful, service-dominant logic emphasizes the application of operant resources that are typically bundled and capable of acting and producing effects in other resources. SOSI and EMSI represent two operant resources in preparing a firm for service innovation and together they explicate how a firm can collaborate with internal and external partners to learn and transform knowledge-based resources under the guidance of SI-focused strategy. Their formative factor structure reflects that they are collections of competences upon which the firm can continually renew, create, integrate, and transform its resources.</p><p>Four, our empirical test of SIR in a nomological net sheds some new light on the management of service innovation. Through this study, we establish that the SOSI and EMSI positively relate to SIR, which, in turn, leads to superior SI performance. The results not only validate the dimensionality of SIR, but also provide empirical support for the role of SIR in linking deployment of organization resources with service innovation success. The analysis also indicates that strategic orientation toward service innovation is warranted, but plays a lesser role in defining SIR relative to the mechanism that enables service innovation. This finding implies that the capability to reconfigure the firm's routines, processes, and systems could be of particular importance for service innovation given the processes involved in service innovation are frequently less tangible and more interwoven with the skills and knowledge embedded in the processes and routines throughout an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Thus, firms should devote their attention not only to developing a strategy that assures appropriate resources being allocated on service innovation but more importantly also striving to establish a mechanism to facilitate the involved changes.</p><p>Finally, the proposed SIR scale, which consists of precise and actionable dimensions, offers the firm a tool to gauge whether it is headed in the right direction in its effort to adopt service innovation. The firm could also use the scale among managers and staff to assess common perceptions of SIR within the firm, and the results can offer a platform for self-diagnosis and a blueprint for establishing favorable contexts for embracing and effectively implementing service innovation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Limitations and suggestions for future research</head><p>Despite the supportive evidence we obtained for validating the SIR construct, this study has its limitations. First, guided by our literature review and interviews with industry experts, we identified six dimensions that form two contexts for adopting service innovation and their respective forming dimensions. However, our SIR model might have overlooked other adopting contexts or defining dimensions of the contexts that influence SIR. Future studies may consider using different approaches, such as grounded theory, to identify these contexts in order to improve the factor structure of SIR. Second, we surveyed only one top manager in each sample company. Although our survey procedure ensured that all respondents are key informants in charge of SI-related affairs, their assessment of the firm's readiness might be biased by individual differences. Future researchers should consider including multiple respondents from each sample company. Third, the data were collected from companies in five service industries although SIR proposed in this study is anticipated to be applicable to both service and manufacturing industries. Additionally, the response rate for financial services industry is much lower relative to other industries due to the conservativeness of managers in this industry and the negative impact from the financial crisis when we conducted this survey. The unbalanced samples from the surveyed industries may limit the generalizability of the SIR framework. Including firms from manufacturing and other services industries as well as balancing the sample size from each industry in future studies should improve generalizability. Fourth, although this study establishes that firms with high readiness for service innovation perform well in SI projects, longitudinal studies would help in understanding the causal relationship between SIR and SI performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Conclusion</head><p>Innovation has long been recognized as a key driving force of economies, and innovation in services has just begun to capture attention from industry and academia. Still, despite a growing recognition of its importance, many service innovation initiatives fail or do not sustain to become a competitive advantage. Successful service innovation practices start with a firm's initiation and implementation, and the firm needs to prepare better in order to outperform its competitors. In response to the emerging trend and the lack of a comprehensive framework to capture the resources necessary for service innovation, we propose the SIR concept and define a hierarchical factor structure for this construct. That is, in addition to identifying six dimensions as the basis of the SIR concept, our research shows that the capability to bundle knowledge-based resources is the weapon that a firm has to possess to persist the SI implementation process. It is our hope that this study, as the first attempt to theorize and empirically test the SIR concept, contributes to the emergence of a research stream on service innovation. Our firm supports service innovation even if they could potentially take away sales of existing services/products. 0.76 Our firm is very willing to sacrifice sales of existing services/products in order to improve sales of its service innovation. 0.84 Our firm tends to invest in service innovation even if it causes existing service facilities to become obsolete. 0.87 Our firm has no problem replacing existing systems or machinery if it will help to create a competitive advantage in the market place. Our firm has created service delivery channels and customer interfaces that are new to the market. 0.86 Our firm has created service delivery channels and customer interfaces that were not previously offered by our firm. 0.95 Our firm has invented processes to enhance customer access to our service (e.g., expand service hours and locations). Relative to competitors in the same business sector, the percentage of service innovation that met customer needs 0.83 Relative to competitors in the same business sector, success rate of service innovation program efforts 0.91 Relative to competitors in the same business sector, the degree to which the company's new service innovation program has been successful in meeting corporate profit objectives for service innovation 0.96 Relative to competitors in the same business sector, overall performance of the service innovation program 0.88</p></div>
