<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The current separate transmission and distribution energy management system faces multiple challenges associated with integrating distributed generators (DGs) into future grids. These challenges, such as a voltage rise issue resulting in curtailment of DGs, are difficult to solve via the current separate energy management. Thus, coordination between transmission and distribution is suggested, and a coordinated transmission and distribution AC optimal power flow (TDOPF) is proposed in this paper. A mathematical TDOPF model is established and analyzed in a master-slave structure. A heterogeneous decomposition algorithm (HGD), which is inspired by heterogeneous transmission and distribution characteristics, is proposed to solve the TDOPF in a distributed manner. The HGD is compared to other typical multi-area OPF decomposition algorithms and the differences are discussed. Numerical tests verify the benefit of the TDOPF to both transmission and distribution systems. The TDOPF improves economic operations, mitigates voltage rises and decreases boundary bus mismatches. Hence, more DGs can be accommodated by the grid. In addition, a series of numerical tests indicate that the HGD competitively solves the TDOPF.</p></div>

Thus, the current TSO and DSO are almost "blind" to each other's system operations and controls.</p><p>The above separate management has been implemented for a long time, because traditional distribution systems are "passive", with very limited controls. Nevertheless, with new distribution controls available, such as controllable distributed generators (DGs) and automation devices, the passive distribution systems become "active", and thus the transmission and distribution system operations and controls should be simultaneously considered. For example, it is reported that a high penetration of DGs in California <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> will create significant difficulties for transmission system operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, which are difficult to manage via the current separate management manner. In addition, as for the well-known 2011 Arizona-Southern California outage event, a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) report indicated that one of the major reasons for the outage event was the lack of coordination between the TSO and DSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, coordinated transmission and distribution management may help to mitigate and solve critical grid operation challenges that may emerge in the future, including voltage rises, congestion issues and balancing challenges, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Take the voltage rises, which may result in curtailment of DGs' output and a waste of renewable resources, as an example. With the coordination of transmission and distribution, coordinated transmission controls can be used to offset severe voltage increases in distribution systems, which may be even impossible to mitigate using only distribution system controls. Thus, DG curtailment can be avoided via the coordination and more DGs can be accommodated thereby. Therefore, coordination between transmission and distribution is necessary and suggested in this paper.</p><p>However, it is difficult to coordinate transmission and distribution in a centralized manner. Currently, the models and data that TSOs and DSOs use are private, making it impossible to directly combine a centralized models. Furthermore, even if a centralized model was established, "the great differences in power levels, voltage levels, and line parameter values of the TPSs and DNs would lead to numerical difficulties" <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Hence, a decomposition methodology is preferable for solving the coordination problem, and an algorithm with limited communication burdens and a high computational efficiency is recommended.</p><p>Motivated by the above challenges and requirement, this paper focuses on a coordinated transmission and distribution AC optimal power flow problem (TDOPF). The contributions of this paper are summarized below.</p><p>First, different from most existing papers focusing on either an independent transmission OPF or independent distribution OPF problem, a TDOPF model, which aims at minimizing the objective function of an integrated system with all transmission and distribution operational constraints satisfied, is established in this paper. This model considers the interaction of transmission and distribution controls for an improved dispatch result in terms of an integrated system. Notably, different from <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> that concerns a coordinated transmission-distribution power flow model (mathematically a group of equations) or <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> that concern a DC OPF-related coordination (mathematically a convex optimization), this TDOPF model is mathematically a non-convex constrained optimization problem which is more difficult to analyze and solve in a distributed manner.</p><p>Second, a new decomposition algorithm, called heterogeneous decomposition (HGD), is proposed to overcome the difficulty of solving the TDOPF. "Heterogeneous" means that the TDOPF is decomposed into a series of decoupled subproblems with different characteristics. This decomposition idea is inspired by the heterogeneous operational characteristics of the transmission and distribution systems, which will be explained in the next sections. With the HGD algorithm, the centralized TDOPF model is "naturally" decomposed into a transmission subproblem and a group of distribution subproblems. Notably, HGD is different from the algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> that only concerns the feasibility of power flow equations. Since an optimization problem is concerned in the TDOPF, the proposed HGD algorithm should ensure its solution not only feasible (i.e., a feasible solution of the transmission-distribution power flow equations and other constraints) but also optimal (at least local optimal). Hence, in the HGD algorithm, each subproblem should transmit a flow-feasibility-related term as well as an optimality-related term to the other. In addition, compared with <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, since TDOPF concerns a nonlinear AC model rather than a linear DC model, and optimizes both active power and reactive power with voltage constraints considered, this OPF-oriented HGD algorithm has a different decomposition construct that includes different subproblem formulations and different coordination message content between the subproblems.</p><p>Next, the local optimality of the HGD algorithm is proved, and the convergency property is analyzed. Differences between the HGD and other typical multi-area OPF decomposition algorithms, such as the auxiliary problem principle (APP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and optimality condition decomposition (OCD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, will also be discussed in this paper.</p><p>Lastly, numerical tests have verified the potential benefits of TDOPF to both transmission and distribution systems, and the efficiency of the HGD algorithm under different system scales.</p><p>The paper is arranged as follows. First, an overview of the current separate management is presented for background. Then, a master-slave structure is applied, based on which a mathematical TDOPF model is established and analyzed. An HGD algorithm is then proposed and compares to the APP and OCD algorithms. Next, simulations are performed to verify the TDOPF benefit on both transmission and distribution using an IEEE 14-bus system integrated with four distribution systems. The computing performances of the HGD, APP and OCD are also compared with different test system scales. Finally, conclusions are presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT SEPARATE TRANSMISSION</head><p>AND DISTRIBUTION ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM The integrated power system in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> is separately managed by the TSO and DSO. The transmission part is managed by a TSO and the distribution part is managed by a DSO. A distribution substation creates a boundary between the systems. This boundary corresponds to a physical high-voltage or low-voltage busbar of a distribution substation (in China, a low-voltage busbar of a distribution substation is usually the boundary bus), and it is defined as a boundary bus in this paper. According to the authors' experience of practical power grid operation, the voltage and power injections at a boundary bus are always observable to the TSO and DSO; however, in the current separate energy management, only the voltage can be regulated by the TSO with a given boundary power injection, while only the power injections can be regulated by the DSO with a given boundary voltage.</p><p>A TSO supervises the transmission operational constraints and controllable transmission devices, and the outer distribution is simplified as a load injection into the boundary. Conversely, a DSO manages the distribution operational constraints and controllable distribution devices, with the transmission simplified as a voltage source at the boundary. In addition, in terms of operational responsibility, a TSO usually manages the voltages of the boundary bus while a DSO controls the power injections at the boundary bus to stay within the distribution station's transformer capacity. Hence, the TSO's and DSO's operational responsibilities are different or "heterogeneous" at the boundary, which inspires the following HGD algorithm.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the transmission and distribution operational constraints are neglected by the DSO and TSO, and all the available integrated system controls are not fully exploited. Because the operational constraints of the separate systems are neglected, TSO or DSO regulation decisions may violate the operational constraints of the other system. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Primary TDOPF Model</head><p>The master-slave structure proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> is applied to the TDOPF, dividing an integrated power system into a master system, boundary system and slave system, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The boundary system is composed of the boundary buses defined in Section II; the master system is composed of the components "over" the boundary buses; the slave system is composed of the components "below" the boundary buses. A transmission system consists of the master system and the boundary system; a distribution system consists of the slave system and the boundary bus which works as a slack bus.</p><p>In the master-slave structure, the current separate management manner in Section II is described as: a TSO manages the master system and boundary bus voltage while the DSO manages the slave system and supervises the power injections into the boundary bus. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. An integrated power system with a master-slave structure For the integrated system shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, A centralized TDOPF model is established below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">    M B M B S B S MS min , , , , , cc  u u x x u x x (1) subject to   MMB M ,,  f u x x 0 (2)   MMB M ,,  g u x x 0 (3)   B M B S B , , ,  f u x x x 0 (4)   BB B ,  g u x 0 (5)   S B S S ,,  f u x x 0 (6)   S B S S</formula><p>,,  g u x x 0 (7) where x is the vector of the state variables, i.e., the voltage magnitude and angle at each bus/node of the integrated system; u is the vector of the control variables, such as the active and reactive generator power, reactive power from the controllable shunts and so on, in the integrated system; cM and cS are the transmission and distribution objective functions (e.g., operational cost functions), respectively; f and g are the equality and inequality operational constraints, respectively; and superscripts/subscripts M, B and S indicate master, boundary or slave system vectors/constraints, respectively.</p><p>The objective function in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> is to minimize the transmission and/or distribution operation objective (without loss of generality, modeled using a summation); Equations in (2), ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) represent the power flow equations of the integrated system; (3), ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> represent the line and transformer power capacity constraints, the control variable operational limits (e.g., transmission generators and DG power capacities) and the allowable state variable operation regions. Notably, to simplify the TDOPF formulation, power capacity limit of a branch that connects a boundary bus with a master bus or another boundary bus, which is regarding the variables x M and x B , is moved into (3), and only the allowable operation regions of u B and x B are considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Since the constraints in (3) and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) are both supervised by the TSO, moving that kind of constraint into (3) does not affect the validity of the TDOPF model. In addition, since the boundary bus is the slack bus of the distribution system, the power capacity limit of a branch that connects a boundary bus with a slave bus, which is regarding the variables x S and x B and supervised by the DSO, is moved into <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</p><p>Remark 1: As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, only the state variables x M and x S are coupled in the boundary system. Hence, x S and u S do not appear in ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) and (3), and x M and u M do not appear in ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</p><p>Remark 2: Loads at each node are assumed uncontrollable in this model. However, the model can be adapted to controllable loads by letting u include the controllable loads and adding the corresponding constraints into the equality and inequality constraints. Besides, the TDOPF model is applicable to (but not limited to) the following two typical DG dispatch models:  Modeled as a generator with decoupled P-Q operational constraints (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>): QG are the active power and reactive power of the DG at the node i of the distribution system.  Modeled as a generator with coupled P-Q operational constraints (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>):</p><p>S,min S S,max</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">i i i PG PG PG      22 S S S 0 i i i QG PG SG    S S S S S tan tan i i i i i PG QG PG    <label>(9)</label></formula><p>where S i SG is the apparent power capacity of the DG; S i  is the power factor of the DG. Obviously, both the above models can be represented by the operational constraints in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> of the paper. Therefore, the TDOPF model in (1)-( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) and the following HGD algorithm are both applicable to the DG dispatch models,.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remark 3:</head><p>The TDOPF is established as a continuous model, which is practical approximation of real world conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Continuous OPF models often provide the basis for mixed-integer models, in which discrete variables are introduced for modelling the shunt and transformer ratios, as has been shown in numerous publications <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Therefore, the above TDOPF model and the associated decomposition algorithm may contribute to future mixed-integer TDOPF studies. For example, the mixed-integer TDOPF may be solved using a composite algorithm, in which the discrete variables are handled by the round-off strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, heuristic approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, penalty-based approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> or ordinal optimization theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, while transmission and distribution are decoupled by the following heterogeneous decomposition algorithm. Remark 4: A detailed formulation of the above TDOPF model is shown and explained in Appendix A. However, it should be noted that the model in (1)-( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is more general than the detailed one in Appendix A, so the model in ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) has a wide range of application, and so does the following HGD algorithm that is developed based on this general model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Boundary Power Flow Equation Splitting</head><p>All power injections at a boundary bus can be sorted into three groups: one flowing from the master system; one flowing from the slave system; and one injecting from the connected generators/loads/shunts.

In comparison to (4), <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> better reflect the physically connection features of the transmission and distribution.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Description of Heterogeneous Decomposition (HGD)</head><p>Per Section II, a TSO should ensure that the boundary bus voltages stay within an allowed region, e.g., 0.95 -1.05 p.u., using the available transmission controls. On the other side, a DSO should ensure that the power injection into the boundary buses stays within an allowable region by available distribution controls. Thus, the transmission and distribution operational characteristics are different, or "heterogeneous", at a boundary bus. The heterogeneous operational characteristics are due to the physically heterogeneous interaction characteristics of the transmission and distribution systems, which have been analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Inspired by the above heterogeneous operational characteristics, it is natural to envisage that the centralized TDOPF model should be decomposed in a correspondingly heterogeneous way. To be specific, the centralized model in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">14</ref>) is decomposed into a transmission OPF (TOPF) and distribution OPF subproblems (DOPFs), which have different characteristics. The TOPF should include the constraints in (2),</p><p>(3), ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>), and optimize  </p><formula xml:id="formula_15">M B M B</formula><p>, , , u u x x .

This heterogeneous decomposition corresponds to the heterogeneous TSO and DSO operational characteristics. Therefore, the HGD can potentially be adapted to the current power system operation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>END WHILE</head><p>Notably, in one iteration, the DOPF may be infeasible because an B M x value that is determined by the TOPF in the last iteration is too high or low. A relaxed DOPF (R-DOPF) should be used in those cases, in which slack variables, S ε , representing a potential violation of the constraints, are introduced into the constraints and the objective function. In fact, if a relatively large penalty, e.g., 10 5 , is used to weight S ε in the objective function, then an R-DOPF can always be used instead of the DOPF, even when the latter is feasible. This substitution makes it convenient to perform the HGD algorithm.</p><p>In addition, HGD has limited communication data available during each iteration. If there are N B boundary buses in the TDOPF, then only 8N B float data should be communicated among the TSO and DSOs for each iteration. Such communication burdens can be accepted in practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, besides the above stopping criteria, another stopping criteria relating to a lower bound and an upper bound of the integrated system objective can also be tried. Denote the lower bound and upper bound by c and c ̅, respectively. These bounds should be dynamically updated in the above iterative process. In the q th iteration of the HGD algorithm, a new evaluation of the integrated system objective is obtained, which is denoted by cq. Compare cq, c and c ̅, and replace c with cq if sufficiently close after some iteration, then terminate the algorithm. It is rather straightforward to see that this new stopping criteria is almost equivalent to the one mentioned above. However, this new stopping criteria is more direct for system operators to observe the change in the objective value in each iteration, which may be useful in certain cases.</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">c&lt;c q &lt; 1 2 (c+c ̅); replace c ̅ with cq if</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Comparison of HGD, APP and OCD</head><p>APP and OCD are two typical decomposition algorithms that have been used to solve multi-area OPF problems regarding interconnected regional transmission systems (RTSs). The APP and OCD algorithms can also be modified and applied to solve the TDOPF. Thus, they were compared to the HGD in the terms of the decomposition principles, optimality and convergence efficiency. Notably, since alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is also a kind of augmented Lagrangian based dual decomposition algorithms like APP, it is also different from the HGD in decomposition principles, subproblem formulations and so on. A further comparison of ADMM and HGD is shown in Appendix C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Decomposition principles</head><p>The APP, OCD and HGD decomposition principles are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3</ref>. The APP was originally used for interconnected RTSs with an overlap region, e.g., a real or dummy bus (Bus B in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3</ref>). The decomposition principle defines the copies of Bus B as Bus B' and Bus B", respectively, which are assigned to Area A and Area AA, respectively. This decouples Areas A and AA. Then, Areas A and AA iteratively exchange voltages xB' and xB" and power values yB' and yB" at Buses B' and B", respectively, yielding a consistent solution at Bus B <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. APP typically requires a parameter tuning process to achieve an efficient convergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The OCD's decomposition principle is based on "passing adjacent variables", as summarized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3</ref>, two dummy Buses, B2' and B1', are introduced into Areas A and AA, respectively, for decoupling. Then, voltages xB1 and xB2, power values yB1 and yB2 and multipliers λB1 and λB2 at Buses B1 and B2 should be iteratively passed and assigned to dummy Buses B1' and B2', respectively, for a consistent solution.</p><p>Inspired by the heterogeneous operational characteristics of TSO and DSO as explained in Section II, the HGD algorithm heterogeneously decomposes the system. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3</ref>, Area A considers Area AA an injection, and injection values are sent from Area AA. Meanwhile, Area AA regards Area A as a voltage source, and the voltage values and generation prices are sent from Area A.</p><p>The APP and OCD decomposition principles are both homogeneous, as they decompose the system into a series of subsystems with nearly identical characteristics, particularly identical data structure at the boundary buses. This is suitable when the subsystems are homogeneous, e.g., for two transmission grids. However, the HGD decomposition principle is heterogeneous, where Area A's and AA's data structures are different at the boundary buses. This method is helpful when the subsystems are heterogeneous, e.g., in the TDOPF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Optimality</head><p>Because the TDOPF is a non-convex problem, these three algorithms do not guarantee a globally optimal solution. However, they can always at least provide a local optimum if they converge. This has been shown for the APP in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and for the OCD in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Because the HGD's solution must satisfy the optimality conditions of the centralized model, as shown in Section IV.B, when it converges, it converges to a local optimum of the TDOPF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Convergence</head><p>The APP has been shown to converge for a convex problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The OCD's local convergence was proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. A fixed point theorem can be used to prove HGD's local convergence, which is shown in Appendix B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CASE STUDIES</head><p>Four simulation systems are constructed in the following case studies, including T14D1, T14D4, T57D10 and T57D14. A modified IEEE 14-bus system is connected to a distribution system at transmission bus #10 in T14D1. Thus, the subsystem number is 2. The IEEE 14-bus system is connected to four distribution systems at transmission buses #10, #11, #12 and #13 in T14D4, and the subsystem number is 5. A modified IEEE 57-bus is connected to 10 distribution systems in T57D10, and the subsystem number is 11. The modified IEEE 57-bus is connected to 14 distribution systems in T57D14, and the subsystem number is 15. Since a high-voltage distribution system connected with the transmission is usually approximately 3-phase balanced in practice, a single-phase distribution model is adopted in the following case studies. Moreover, the objective function in (1) is minimizing the generation cost of the integrated system, as shown in (A-26). The DG dispatch model is adopted as the one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, and the parameters of all DGs in the T14D4 are shown in Appendix D. All programs are coded and tested in MATLAB. IPOPT is used as the solver, and a semi-definite-positive (SDP)-relaxation based OPF tool, which is provided by the latest version of MATPOWER <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, is used to test if the IPOPT solution of the centralized TDOPF is the global optimum <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and to solve the global optimum if the IPOPT solution is not the global optimum.</p><p>First, T14D4 is used to compare the TDOPF results with the separate transmission and distribution OPF results (called the independent transmission OPF (ITOPF) and independent distribution OPF (IDOPF), respectively). The T14D4 configuration is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref>.</p><p>Next, the HGD computing performances are reported for T14D1, T14D4, T57D10 and T57D14 with different subsystem numbers. The results are then compared to those from the APP and OCD solutions in terms of the optimality and convergence.</p><p>The simulation results are reported below. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Comparison of TDOPF and ITOPF</head><p>This part compares the TDOPF and ITOPF to verify the TDOPF benefits in the transmission operations. We consider a typical scenario in which a disturbance occurs in T14D4. The TSO should run an OPF program to calculate a new optimal steady system state when the disturbance occurs. Suppose that the disturbance in this scenario is an outage in line 1-5 (i.e., from transmission bus #1 to bus #5), whose apparent power flow at the "from" bus is 68.46 MVA. Then, the goal of the TSO is to economically redistribute the 68.46-MVA flow. The ITOPF only uses transmission controls, while the TDOPF uses both the transmission and distribution controls.</p><p>Tables <ref type="table">I</ref> and<ref type="table">II</ref> show the TDOPF and ITOPF results in terms of the active and reactive power flows at the transmission line "from" buses. We highlighted the results that show significant changes in comparison to the base case flows (&gt; 3 MW for MW-flow and &gt; 2 Mvar for Mvar-flow). The TDOPF and ITOPF flow results are clearly different, and the TDOPF result has more significant flow changes in the lines that are adjacent to the boundary buses. This indicates that the TDOPF coordinates regulation of both the transmission generators and the distribution injections to the transmission.</p><p>The incremental flows, which are the differences between the ITOPF/TDOPF flows and the base case flow, reflect the different redistributions of the original line 1-5 power flow via the ITOPF and TDOPF solutions. These results of the ITOPF and TDOPF are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> in terms of the incremental MW-flow results. A positive number represents a MW-flow increase in a line, while a negative number represents a decrease. The arrows of the curves indicate the general courses of the incremental flows. Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>(a) shows that the MW-flows are notably regulated by only the generation side of the transmission system via the ITOPF. Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>(b) shows that the MW-flows are notably regulated by both the generation and loading sides of the TDOPF. This is because the injections of D1 to D4 are considered equal to those in the base case in the ITOPF, while they are coordinated by the DSO in the TDOPF, as demonstrated by the negative numbers in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.</p><p>The optimized active powers of all transmission generators and the ITOPF and TDOPF objectives are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. The transmission generator's expensive active power outputs decrease because the distribution's available controls are being exploited. Thus, the TDOPF objective is smaller than that of the ITOPF, indicating that the TDOPF contributes to the economic performance of the transmission operation. Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> compares the TDOPF's and ITOPF's locational marginal prices (LMPs) regarding the active power. Note that the TDOPF utilizes all available generation resources, creating lower LMPs than the ITOPF. Therefore, the demand prices can be reasonably reflected by the TDOPF.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Comparison of TDOPF and IDOPF for a Voltage Rise</head><p>This part compares TDOPF and IDOPF to verify the TDOPF benefits to solve a voltage rise issue in a distribution system. One of the largest DSO concerns is a voltage rise issue, which often occurs when a high penetration of DGs are integrated into a system. The objective function of the IDOPF is to minimize the total operational cost (modeled in (A-26)) and both the active power and reactive power of the DGs are considered controllable (modeled by ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>)). Because a boundary bus voltage is usually regulated by the TSO, it was considered uncontrollable for the DSO in the simulation. In the case of a sudden increase in the DG outputs, if it were not sufficient to make all node voltages within an allowable range just by regulating the reactive power of the DGs or reactive power from the controllable shunts, then some active power of the DGs would be curtailed by the DSO. However, in the case of the TDOPF, the root node's voltage can be coordinately regulated by the TSO, so the voltage rise issue can be solved without reducing the DG outputs. This scenario is simulated using T14D4. The T14D4 power flow solution is considered as the base case flow, where the D1's to D4's root node voltages are 1.0385, 1.0425, 1.0436 and 1.0399 p.u., respectively. The optimized IDOPF and TDOPF results are compared for a sudden DG output increase by 1.5 times.</p><p>The IDOPF and TDOPF distribution voltage profiles are compared in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref>. The TDOPF voltage profile is generally below that of the IDOPF, and only the voltage at node D4-5 (i.e., node #5 in D4) reaches the upper limit (1.05 p.u.). On the contrary, two nodes in the IDOPF profile reach the upper voltage limit and more than 10 node voltages are close to the upper limit ( &gt; 1.04 p.u.). Hence, the voltage rise issue is better mitigated by the TDOPF. The improvement in the TDOPF is due to the coordination in the boundary voltages by the transmission and distribution systems (i.e., root node voltages for the distribution). The black arrows in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref> show that the TDOPF boundary voltages are correspondingly regulated downward by the TSO as the DG outputs increase. Thus, larger room is left for the DSO to regulate the voltage profiles over a wider range. The DG curtailment of D1 to D4 is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>. The IDOPF's reduction is now avoided by the TDOPF, as the latter allows the DSO's regulation over a wider range. Moreover, as the DG capacity increases by 20%, a 6-MW curtailment takes place in the IDOPF, occupying over 10% of the DG's capacity. This reduction is also avoided by the TDOPF. This means that the TDOPF contributes to accommodating more DG resources in the distribution system.</p><p>In addition, the improved DG utilization of the TDOPF decreases the distribution operational cost by $33.26. Finally, the TSO does not know the controls that the DSO will make in the IDOPF; therefore, significant power mismatches may occur at the boundary buses. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10</ref> shows these apparent power mismatches at the boundary buses. The D4 boundary bus mismatches reach 6.67 MVA. Large mismatches may cause regulation difficulties and generate additional operational costs. Conversely, with the coordination of the TSO and DSO in the TDOPF, no boundary mismatches occurred as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Comparison of HGD, APP and OCD</head><p>The HGD, APP and OCD computing performances for T14D1, T14D4, T57D10 and T57D14 are reported in Tables III and IV. The APP is implemented according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and the parameter tuning is based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The OCD is implemented according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The convergence tolerance is 10 -4 for all of   <ref type="table">IV</ref>.</p><p>The smallest iteration number for each system is marked in blue In Table <ref type="table">III</ref>. The HGD always displays the fewest iterations in these tests. The OCD is not applicable in the T57D10 and T57D14, for the TOPF subproblem diverges in the iteration.</p><p>As for the optimality of the three algorithms, the optimal value closest to the global optimal value of the centralized model, is marked in blue in Table <ref type="table">IV</ref>. From the table, it is seen that the HGD provides the best solution for each of these scenarios. In fact, the HGD's converged solutions are not only the local optimum (this has been theoretically proved in this paper), but also the global optimal for these cases.</p><p>In addition, the objectives of the TDOPF and ITOPF in T57D10 and T57D14 are also compared in Table <ref type="table">V</ref>. In ITOPF, we assumed that the distribution power injections into the boundary buses are equal to the total loads of the distribution systems. It is seen that with the coordinated control over both transmission and distribution generators, the expensive transmission generators' outputs decrease, so the objective value of the TDOPF is lower than that of ITOPF. Hence, the economy of the transmission dispatch is improved by the TDOPF. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>A coordinated transmission and distribution OPF, called TDOPF, is proposed to cope with critical grid operation challenges, such as voltage rises, in future grids. The mathematical TDOPF model is established and analyzed based on a master-slave structure. The TDOPF benefits are numerically verified for both the transmission and distribution systems. The TDOPF contributes to improving economic operations, optimally redistributing post-outage flows and reasonably reflecting electricity prices for demands in the transmission system. The TDOPF contributes to solving a voltage increase issues in the distribution system. The voltage profiles are improved and more DG resources can be accommodated by the grid.</p><p>In order to solve the TDOPF in a distributed manner, an HGD algorithm is proposed and investigated, which is also a major contribution of this paper. A comparison of the HGD, APP and OCD is discussed and numerically verified. In these tests, the typical APP and OCD algorithms are inferior to the HGD method, which produces a preferential solution with fewer iterations. A mixed-integer TDOPF and a corresponding algorithm, which may include a combination of the current HGD and other discrete variable methods, will be investigated in future studies. Moreover, uncertainty and "N-1" operational constraints will also be considered in the TDOPF, and corresponding solutions will be studied. </p></div>

Since a 3-phase model can also be represented by the general model in (1) to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, the proposed HGD algorithm is still applicable. If the TSO only has a single-phase transmission model and the DSO has a 3-phase distribution model, then, thanks to the HGD algorithm, TSO and DSO can still use their own single-phase and 3-phase OPF model, respectively, and only a simple conversion regarding the boundary variables additionally needs in the HGD. The conversation is based on an assumption that "the power and voltage are approximately balanced at the boundary bus", which is often true for a typical high-voltage system or some medium-voltage distribution systems. Based on this assumption, the single-phase boundary variables solved by the TOPF can be converted to the 3-phase ones to be used in the DOPF; the 3-phase boundary variables solved by the can be converted to the single-phase ones to be used in the TOPF. Certainly, there is some accuracy loss at the conversion step, which is due to the fact that the TSO only has a single-phase transmission model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX B PROOF OF HGD'S CONVERGENCY</head><p>In the HGD algorithm, the TOPF subproblem is formulated as where BS h and BS S y are the TOPF's parameters that are sent from the DOPF. Based on the Sensitivity Theorem in the nonlinear programming theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, under some conditions (i.e., the primal and dual solution of the TOPF satisfy the second order sufficiency optimality conditions of the problem), there must exist the following continuously differentiable mapping </p><formula xml:id="formula_33">    M B M B T B M BS M B M B BS tran S min , , , s.t. , ,<label>, ( ) c </label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_34">  B BS MB M S BS ;;       x λ Φ yh (B-2)</formula><p>Similarly, as for the DOPF subproblem, under some conditions, there must exist the following continuously differentiable mapping S Φ : Hence, from the q th iteration to the (q+1) th iteration in the HGD, a composition mapping can be defined in terms of B MB ;   x λ as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">          BB MB B M MB 1 ; 1 ; q q q q            x λ Φ x λ (B-4)</formula><p>where the composition mapping</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">    B M S  Φ Φ Φ .</formula><p>Then, the HGD's convergence is equivalent to the convergence of the above iteration mapping in (B-4). By applying the well-known fixed point theorem to (B-4), it can be seen that as long as the spectral radius (or norm) of the derivative of B Φ is less than 1 (the derivative of B Φ can be calculated by multiplying the derivatives of M Φ and S Φ , both of which can be calculated based on the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>), the HGD algorithm must have a local one-order convergency rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX C ANALYSIS OF THE DIFFERENCE OF THE HGD AND ADMM</head><p>When applying the ADMM <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> to the TDOPF, the coupling constraint at any boundary bus i, shown in (C-1), is relaxed to the objective by introducing the corresponding multipliers λ and a penalty term By comparing the HGD algorithm with the above ADMM algorithm, since the proposed HGD algorithm is a special kind of optimality decomposition algorithms, the HGD needn't introduce the multipliers and the penalty factor ρ to relax the coupling constraints into the objective for decomposition, and the penalty regulation issue is thus avoided. Moreover, because of the different decomposition principles, the subproblem formulations of the HGD are also different from the ADMM's.</p></div>
