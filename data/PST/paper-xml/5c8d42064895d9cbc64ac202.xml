<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Atanassov <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> introduced the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) characterized by a membership function and a non-membership function, which is a generalization of the concept of fuzzy set <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> whose basic component is only a membership function. For the IFS, the sum of the membership degree and the non-membership degree of each ordered pair is less than or equal to 1. Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> developed the intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging operator, intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted averaging operator and the intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid aggregation operator. Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> developed some geometric aggregation operators, such as the intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometric operator, the intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted geometric operator, and the intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid geometric (IFHG) operator and gave an application of the IFHG operator to multiple attribute group decision making with intuitionistic fuzzy information. The IFS has received more and more attention since its appearance.  A new extension of IFS, namely, the Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS), <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> has been developed. The PFS is also characterized by the membership degree and the non-membership degree. The difference between PFS and IFS is that the square sum of the membership and non-membership degrees is a maximum of one in PFS, whereas the sum of the membership and non-membership degrees is a maximum of one in IFS. Thus, the PFS is more general than the IFS. In some cases, the PFS can solve the problems that the IFS cannot, for example, if a DM gives the membership degree and the nonmembership degree as 0.5 and 0.8, respectively, then it is only valid for the PFS. In other words, all the intuitionistic fuzzy degrees are a part of the Pythagorean fuzzy degrees, which indicates that the PFS is more powerful to handle the uncertain problems. Zhang and Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> provided the detailed mathematical expression for PFS, introduced the concept of Pythagorean fuzzy number (PFN) and also developed a Pythagorean fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) for handling the MCDM problem within PFNs. Beliakov and James <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> focused on how the notion of "averaging" should be treated in the case of PFNs and how to ensure that the averaging aggregation functions produce outputs consistent with the case of ordinary fuzzy numbers. Reformat and Yager <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> applied the PFNs in handling the collaborative-based recommender system. Peng and Yang <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> developed the division and subtraction operations for PFNs, and also developed a Pythagorean fuzzy superiority and inferiority ranking method to solve multicriteria group decision making problem with PFNs. Gou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> investigated the properties of continuous Pythagorean fuzzy information. Ren et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> proposed the Pythagorean fuzzy TODIM approach to multicriteria decision making. Zeng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> developed a hybrid method for Pythagorean fuzzy multiple-criteria decision making. Garg <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> proposed the new generalized Pythagorean fuzzy information aggregation by using Einstein Operations.

To do so, the remainder of this paper is set out as follows. In the next section, we introduce some basic concepts related to PFSs and PHFSs and some operational laws of Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy numbers (PHFNs). In Section 3, we have developed some Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Hamacher aggregation operators: Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Hamacher weighted average (PHFHWA) operator, Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Hamacher weighted geometric (PHFHWG) operator, Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Hamacher ordered weighted average (PHFHOWA) operator, Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Hamacher ordered weighted geometric (PHFHOWG) operator, Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Hamacher induced ordered weighted average (PHFHIOWA) operator, Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Hamacher induced ordered weighted geometric (PHFHIOWG) operator, and studied some special cases of the proposed operators. In Section 4, we have developed some Hamacher correlated aggregation operators with PHFNs. In Section 5, we have proposed some Hamacher induced correlated aggregation operators with PHFNs. In Section 6, we have proposed some Hamacher prioritized aggregation operators with PHFNs. In Section 7, we have proposed some Hamacher power aggregation operators with PHFNs. In Section 8, we have applied these operators to develop some models for multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problems with PHFNs. In Section 9, a practical example for is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness. In Section 10, we conclude the paper and give some remarks.</p></div>

The motivation is that when defining the membership degree of an element, the difficulty of establishing the membership degree is not because we have a margin of error (as in PFSs) or some possibility distribution (as in type 2 fuzzy sets) on the possible values, but because we have several possible PFNs.</p><p>Definition 3.

As a result of it, the development of circular economy has become a hot topic. In 2015, the government proposed to actively promote economic restructuring and upgrading, and the manufacturing sector is the focus of rectification and reform. In the same year, our country also implemented a new environmental law. It means that the government will seriously treat the environmental pollution problems. In order to control the total energy consumption, the manufacturing sector is one of the key targets of strengthening energy conservation. Faced with government regulation, legal constraints, and public opinion pressure, manufacturing enterprises have to take necessary measures to achieve "Green Development." One of these measures is to implement green supply chain management. GSCM emphasis on the joint development of the socioeconomic and ecological environment, requiring companies to consider environmental factors in product design, packaging, procurement, production, sales, logistics, waste, recycling, and other aspects. Supplier is the "Source" of the whole supply chain, and the green supplier selection is the foundation of green supply chain management. The quality of suppliers will directly affect the environmental performance of enterprises. First, the green supply chain management and the traditional supply chain management were compared, then the characteristics of green supplier partnerships were analyzed from various aspects.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we investigate the MADM problem based on the Hamacher aggregation operators with Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy information. Then, motivated by the ideal of Hamacher operation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> we have developed some Hamacher aggregation operators for aggregating Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy information: PHFHWA operator, PHFHWG operator, PHFHOWA operator, PHFHOWG operator, PHFHIOWA operator, PHFHIOWG operator, Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Hamacher induced correlated aggregation operators, Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Hamacher prioritized aggregation operators, and Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Hamacher power aggregation operators. The special cases of these proposed operators are studied. Then, we have utilized these operators to develop some approaches to solve the Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy MADM problems. Finally, a practical example for green supplier selections in green supply chain management is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness. In the future, we shall continue working in the extension and application of the developed operators to other domains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>)the Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Hamacher correlated averaging (PHFHCA) operator, where (𝜎(1), 𝜎(2), … , 𝜎(𝑛)) is a permutation of (1, 2, … , 𝑛), such that 𝑝 𝜎(𝑗-1) ≥ 𝑝 𝜎(𝑗) for all 𝑗 = 2, … , 𝑛, 𝐴 𝜎(𝑘) = {𝑥 𝜎(𝑗) |𝑗 ≤ 𝑘}, for 𝑘 ≥ 1, and 𝐴 𝜎(0) = 𝜙.</figDesc></figure>

If the decision makers provide several values for the alternative 𝐴 𝑖 under the state of nature 𝐺 𝑗 with anonymity, these values can be considered as a PHFN 𝑝 𝑖𝑗 = (ℎ 𝑖𝑗 , 𝑔 𝑖𝑗 ). In the case where two decision makers provide the same value, then the value emerges only once in 𝑝 𝑖𝑗 .
