<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>A NONHOLONOMIC system can be briefly defined as a system subject to kinematic constraints such that the dimension of the admissible velocities at each point is less than the dimension of the reachable manifold. This means the dimension of the space that we can reach is higher than the rank of the set of directions corresponding to the infinitesimal motions at our disposal. Even if a car can not slide sideways, any configuration in this direction can be reached through a maneuver: a car is a nonholonomic system. In contrast, for a holonomic system the space of admissible velocities at each point is equal to the tangent space of the reachable manifold.</p><p>Concerning path planning, the problem is much more difficult for nonholonomic systems. In absence of obstacles, the problem of finding a path to a goal in a configuration space (CS) of a holonomic system is pretty easy. Since any motion in the configuration space is admissible, any curve of CS between the origin and the goal corresponds to a solution of the path planning problem. As a direct consequence of nonholonomy, not every curve in the configuration space of a nonholonomic system corresponds to a feasible path, even if each point of this curve can be reached by the system. Therefore, even in the absence of obstacles, finding a feasible path steering the system to another reachable point is a difficult problem. 1 The only existing results deal with approximate methods (i.e., which guarantee to reach a neighborhood of the goal, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>) or exact methods for special classes of system, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Let us now add some obstacles to the workspace of the system. Naturally, some points of the configuration space (corresponding to the configurations in collision) will not be reachable anymore. Furthermore, depending on the obstacles and on the system even some points of the free configuration space (CS ) may no longer be reachable. The path planning problem then contains two questions.</p><p>1) Does any solution exist?</p><p>2) If yes, how to find at least one of them? Once again, the answer to the existence question is more difficult for nonholonomic systems. For a holonomic system there exists a simple criterion: all the points of a same connected component of CS can be linked together. Then in practice, for a holonomic system solving the existence problem also yields a solution (not necessarily the best one) to the planning problem. For a nonholonomic system, even if the goal is in the same connected component of CS there is no guarantee that we can reach it. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> This is due to the fact that not every curve in CS is an admissible one for the system. At this time, to the authors knowledge, there does not exist any criterion concerning the existence of a path for a general nonholonomic system in presence of obstacles. Even if we did, we still have to build such a solution.</p><p>The problem on which this paper focuses is the elaboration of exact and complete collision-free path planning algorithms for a general class of nonholonomic systems. To solve this problem, it is necessary to combine geometric techniques addressing the obstacle avoidance together with control techniques addressing the nonholonomic motions in order to take into account the constraints due both to the obstacles (i.e., dealing with the configuration coordinate of the system) and to the kinematic limits of the system (i.e., linking the coordinates derivatives). As far as we know, there are only two results concerning our problem.</p><p>The first general result was proposed by Sussmann and Liu <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> who built a sequence of feasible paths converging uniformly to any given path, using high frequency sinusoidal inputs. Reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> exploits the idea for a mobile robot with two trailers. However, simulation results show that this approach cannot be applied in practice, mainly because of the highly oscillatory nature of the solutions and also because of the very slow convergence.</p><p>The second issue is the scheme proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> based on optimal control that works for any small-time controllable system: it consists of approximating a given collision-free path with a sequence of length-optimal trajectories. This approach has been applied to the car-like system and leads to a very fast and complete collision-free path planner <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The weak point of this algorithm lies in the fact that the family of length optimal paths are only known for a very small number of systems.</p><p>This paper shows how this approach can be extended by replacing the optimal elementary trajectories with a family of canonical trajectories computed by any local planners respecting a certain topological property (Section III). Roughly speaking, for a suitable local planner the whole computed path should converge to its start point when the final point tends to the start point. This property may appear obvious, but in fact, it does not hold for every local planner (e.g., see Section III). We prove that given a local planner verifying this property, any complete holonomic path planner gives rise to a complete collision-free nonholonomic path planner. A probabilistically complete nonholonomic path planner can also be obtained by integrating such a local planner in a probabilistic scheme such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. An example of a suitable local planner is the one computing the length optimal paths (Section IV), but these paths are known for a very small number of systems. We propose a sufficient condition for a local planner to respect the required property (Section V) and we draw our inspiration from this sufficient condition to prove that the use of sinusoidal inputs proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> provides paths which verify the required topological properties (Section VI) for chained form systems (See Appendix B for the case of polynomial inputs proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). This planner can be applied for example to the classical tractor-trailers systems. Some samples of solution in presence of obstacles are given in conclusion. Let us first state the family of systems concerned by this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. THE CASE OF SMALL-SPACE LOCALLY CONTROLLABLE SYSTEMS</head><p>As we have seen, the question of existence of a path is an open problem in general. In this paper, we focus on a large family of system for which the existence problem can be solved in the geometric level (without considering the kinematic constraints). In order to avoid confusions due to different definitions of local controllability in the literature, we use the name of small-space locally controllable for the system defined below: Definition 1: A system is called small-space locally controllable at q, if for any neighborhood of , there exists a neighborhood whose points are all accessible for the system by paths that remain in . The system is small-space locally controllable (s.s.l.c.) if it is s.s.l.c. at any point.</p><p>For a small-space locally controllable system, it is easy to prove (and also easy to imagine) that for any number or shape of obstacles, any pair of points of the same open connected subset of CS can be linked.</p><p>Assumption 1: We assume in the following that we do not consider as admissible the motions in contact with obstacles. This implies that the boundaries of the obstacles in the configuration space are considered to be included in the obstacles. Therefore CS is an open set. Then as for a holonomic system, for a s.s.l.c. nonholonomic system any pair of points of the same connected component of CS can be linked by an admissible path for the system. In other words, as long as the addition of obstacles does not change the connectivity of CS , for s.s.c.l. nonholonomic systems (as for the holonomic systems), the set of the configurations that lose their accessibility due to the presence of obstacles are only the configurations that are in collision with the obstacles.</p><p>In other words, wherever a s.s.l.c. nonholonomic system can geometrically go, it can go despite its kinematic constraints. Then, given a s.s.l.c. nonholonomic system in a space containing obstacles, any geometric path planner<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> for our system can answer to the question of the existence of feasible collisionfree path between two configurations. The path computed by the geometric path planner can even be used as a datum line of the connected component of CS in which we have the guarantee of finding a feasible path.</p><p>It is interesting to point out that there exist general criteria (like the Lie Algebra Rank Condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>) for determining if some general class of systems (like driftless systems with bounded control) are small-space locally controllable.</p><p>The question of the existence of a solution to a path planning problem for a s.s.l.c nonholonomic system in the presence of obstacles can then be answered by only geometric consideration. In the next section, we see how we can build such a solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. TOPOLOGICAL PROPERTIES AND CONSEQUENCES</head><p>As we have seen, wherever a s.s.l.c. nonholonomic system can geometrically go, it can go despite its kinematic constraints. This is due to the fact that at any point, an clearance with respect to obstacles is enough for the system to let it reach a neighborhood of the current point. By passing from one neighborhood to an overlapping neighborhood, the system is able to reach any point of the current connected (open) subset of CS . The final path is a concatenation of several elementary paths. Now imagine that we want our path planner to be able to compute such a path. Let us call the local planner, the procedure of our global path planner that will compute the elementary paths:</p><p>Definition 2: Given a nonholonomic system and its configuration space CS, a local planner is a map CS CS CS such that , , and , , is a path respecting the kinematic constraints of . Then, given two points of the configuration space, amongst the infinite choices of the elementary paths admissible for the system between these two points, our local planner will restrict the system to the choice of a unique path. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> If we want to still be able to reach any accessible point of the system with our global planner, these elementary paths computed by our local planner have to somehow reflect the property of small-space controllability of the system which intrinsically guarantees the reachability of the goal.</p><p>Let us consider a robot with a kinematic model of a unicycle. We can define a simple local planner for this system in the following way: In order to go from to , we first reorient toward , then we follow a straight line to and finally we rotate in place again to reach the goal orientation . With this local planner we can steer our robot to any point on an empty parking, but we can never do a tight parallel parking between two cars. Indeed, with this local planner we only move forward.</p><p>In the next section we present the property that a suitable local planner should respect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Weak Topological Property (WTP)</head><p>Let us equip CS with a metric : CS CS and denote by the ball of radius around the configuration .</p><p>Definition 3: A local planner verifies the Weak Topological Property (WTP) if</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CS such that</head><p>This simply means that for any , without moving aside further than from any start configuration , a neighborhood of is still reachable using only the paths computed by our local planner (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Definition 4: A symmetrical local planner is a local planner such that CS Assumption 2: In the following we assume that CS CS and all the paths that we consider are compact subsets of CS.</p><p>Notice that usually, a path is defined by a continuous function :</p><p>CS. Since is a compact subset of , the path is also a compact subset of CS. In other respects, we have seen that we work always with open CS (see <ref type="bibr">Assumption 1)</ref>. In this case the set of obstacles in the configuration space CS is a closed set. In practice, the configuration space is some subset of . Since any compact path is bounded, we can simply consider our problem in a bounded subset of . Then the obstacle set that we have to take into account is closed and bounded in so it is compact. Therefore, Assumption 2 is quite reasonable.</p><p>Proposition 1: Let be a symmetrical local planner that respects the WTP. Any path (feasible or not) in CS can be approximated by a finite sequence of collision-free feasible paths computed by the local planner .</p><p>Proof: Let be a path in CS ( is not necessarily feasible with respect to the nonholonomic constraints). Since CS is compact (Assumption 2), for each point of there is some such that lies further than from any obstacle. Since respects WTP, there is a ball whose points are reachable from by paths computed by and remaining in . Such paths are collision-free and feasible.</p><p>The path is covered by . Since is compact (Assumption 2), we can extract a finite number of balls that cover . Let be a common point of and . The paths and are collision-free. With being symmetrical,</p><p>. So is reachable from and is reachable from ; then can be approximated by a concatenation of and for . <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref>Therefore, if a symmetrical local planner respecting the WTP is available, we can use it to approximate any collisionfree path. It suffices to find a sequence verifying the conditions of the proof. Nevertheless, designing a procedure to find such a sequence automatically is not easy. So far the authors do not know any complete algorithm able to find the sequence . This means that even if an approximation exists, the WTP is not sufficient to guarantee the algorithmic construction of the approximation. In other words, WTP does not guarantee that our problem is decidable. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Topological Property (TP)</head><p>Let us for example imagine a local planner verifying WTP and a geometric path containing a critical point such that when we move on toward , and of course since the local planner verifies WTP. See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>Then if the obstacles impose us to remain inside the tube of radius around the geometric path , any collision-free path will have to pass by the point . We do not know any algorithm able to determine this unique point of . This kind of problem may appear with discontinuous <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">7</ref> local planners (see Appendix A). Proposition 2: Let be a local planner that respects TP. There exists a procedure converging in finite time transforming any collision-free path into a feasible and collision-free one.</p><p>Proof: Let be a collision-free path. lies in CS</p><p>which is an open subset of CS. Then between any point of and any point of there is a distance which is strictly positive. Since CS is compact (see Assumption 2), there exists an such that every point of lies further than from the obstacles in CS. Let be the real number corresponding to with respect to the definition of TP. Let us consider any approximation of by a concatenation of straight lines shorter than . The vertices of this concatenation are linkable with collision-free -type paths.</p><p>Remark 1: Appendix A presents an example of a local planner verifying WTP but not TP and the associated problem of approximation of a geometric path.</p><p>Remark 2: The approximation of the geometric path by paths computed by a local planner respecting TP can be done for example by following the same algorithmic scheme as the one presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Indeed, replacing the length optimal elementary paths by the paths computed by our local planner leads again to the following complete planning algorithm.</p><p>Step 1: First a geometric path between the start point and the goal is computed (this problem has been extensively studied in the literature). If we fail in this step, we know that the problem has no solution. If we succeed, we know that a solution path in the neighborhood of exists and it can be found in Step 2.</p><p>Step 2: We try to link the start point to the goal by a path computed by the local planner. If this path is collision-free, the problem is solved. If not, we choose some equidistant via points on and we try to link the successive points by collision-free paths computed by the local planner. We increase the number of via points until success is achieved. In the sequel, we refer to this scheme as the Approximation scheme. Since the local planner respects TP, this path planner is complete. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> has already proven the convergence of this scheme in the special case where the local planner is the length optimal planner. Indeed, as an example of suitable local planner, we check in the next section that the length optimal local planner respects TP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. LENGTH OPTIMAL LOCAL PLANNER</head><p>Let us consider a nonholonomic system and denote its configuration by . is restricted to a manifold and is restricted to a distribution on . Let be a Riemannian manifold. That means is a smooth manifold and is a Riemannian metric on . Let be a regular absolutely nonholonomic distribution on . That means the Lie algebra spanned by generates the whole tangent bundle and the growth of the dimension of the Lie Algebra due to the successive bracketing of vector fields of is independent of . Then the minimum depth of Lie brackets needed to span the tangent bundle at any point is called the degree of nonholonomy of and is called an absolutely nonholonomic manifold. Let us call an admissible curve , a curve feasible for our system . That means and . The Rashevski-Chow theorem states that any two points of a nonholonomic manifold can be linked by an admissible curve. Then we can define a new metric that is the minimum length of the admissible curves linking two points of .</p><p>is a sub-Riemannian manifold. A proposition derived from the parallelepipeds theorem states that on any compact sub-Riemannian manifold there exists such that <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> This implies that the metrics and are topologically equivalent. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for more details on the above. Let us consider the curve of minimal length from to and is the minimal length of an admissible curve between and . Clearly and so</p><p>(2)</p><p>Consider a local planner computing the length optimal path for our system between any two points. We can deduce from the equation ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) that , all the points of the ball are reachable by paths computed by the length optimal local planner and remaining in the ball . Hence the length optimal local planner respects the topological property. Integrated in the Approximation scheme, this local planner leads to a fast collision-free planner for the car-like robot with bounded turning radius <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for which the problem of synthesis of shortest paths has been solved <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. However, for almost all nonholonomic systems the shortest paths are unknown. Nevertheless some numerical approximation of optimal paths has been tried for systems like tractor-trailers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The performance of these planners is limited by the performance of the numerical optimization.</p><p>Therefore, we have to find other local planners verifying TP in order to make the most of our approach. In order to help the search, the next section proposes a sufficient condition for a local planner to verify TP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SUFFICIENT CONDITION FOR A LOCAL PLANNER TO VERIFY TP Let us consider the following metric between paths parameterized over [0, 1]</head><p>where is a Euclidean metric on CS. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> we introduced a sufficient condition guaranteeing that a local planner respects TP:</p><p>Proposition 3: Given a local planner . If verifies the two following conditions:</p><p>1) is continuous in the topology associated with ; 2) CS, , then respects TP on any compact set.</p><p>Notice that has to be continuous with respect to the vector and not only with respect to and . By this way a link is established between what happens at two different start points close to each other. Such a link is necessary to pass from WTP to TP. Notice that if the stationarity condition is obviously a necessary condition for a local planner to verify TP, the continuity condition is not. Indeed, the length optimal local planner respects TP but it is not continuous in the sense above. Indeed, imagine a car-like system with a final configuration parallel to the start configuration but translated sideway. If the goal is slightly ahead of the start point, it is proved (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>) that the shortest path begin with a backward motion. Whereas if the goal is slightly behind, simple symmetry consideration imposes the shortest path to begin with a forward motion. If the goal is exactly at the same level as the start point, both types of motion have the same length and correspond to a length optimal path which is not unique anymore. The length optimal local planner is then not continuous with respect to the metric, but respects TP. Thus, the sufficient condition is not necessary.</p><p>Another sufficient condition which may be closer to a necessary and sufficient one is as follows.</p><p>1) Continuity of the length of with respect to . 2) Stationarity of at . However the sufficient condition presented earlier seems easier to verify, so it is more interesting from a practical point of view. Now, let us try to apply it to a given local planner. Namely, the local planner deduced from sinusoidal inputs for chained form systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CHAINED FORM SYSTEMS AND SINUSOIDAL INPUTS</head><p>In the following we consider a sub-family of chained form systems of dimension , having the form below <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> Because of the chained relation between the variation of one coordinate and the value of the previous coordinate, control laws can be designed to solve the motion planning problem in absence of obstacles <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The goal of this section is to prove that one of these solutions (the sinusoidal inputs) leads to a local planner that can guarantee the convergence of global obstacle avoidance schemes. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">8</ref>In practice, the interest of chained form systems lies in the fact that some real systems can be put into chained form via feedback transformations (e.g., a family of tractortrailers systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>). In other respects, some approximations of general systems may be in chained form in some specific coordinate systems (e.g., nilpotent approximations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>). In all these cases, if the system has two inputs, we can apply the sinusoidal inputs proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> to steer the system to the goal. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Sinusoidal Inputs</head><p>Let us consider the following inputs for the chained form system (3) (4)</p><p>Let us fix the value of . Then, we can define a whole family of functions where is the configuration reached from by applying the sinusoidal control (4) corresponding to with a fixed to the system (3) and integrating the equations for a time . Notice that this function depends not only on but also on . The following lemma is proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>:</p><p>Lemma 1: For each and each , is a diffeomorphism locally around the origin.</p><p>Notice that . So the domain reachable from any CS by sinusoidal inputs contains a neighborhood of . At this level, we do not know if the path joining to the points of this neighborhood remains close to . Thus, if we consider the local planner deduced from sinusoidal inputs , we do not know if it respects TP. Actually, the shape of the paths computed by depends on multiple factors such as the starting point and more specially, the free parameter . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> gives an of the influence of on the shape of the path followed by a tractortrailers system submitted to sinusoidal inputs.</p><p>In order to verify TP, must be completed by an appropriate procedure of choice of . It is easy to show for example that any fixed value for leads to a steering method that does not respect TP. Indeed, for any configuration , the path computed by the sinusoidal inputs between and itself is not stationary:</p><p>, where by assumption. (Notice that this implies that does not verify the second part of the sufficient condition of Proposition 3). On the other hand, let us assume that has a fixed non zero value. Forcing the sinusoidal steering method to turn back a stationary path in the cases that will imply a discontinuity (i.e., the first part of the sufficient condition will not be fulfilled). In order to apply the sufficient condition (and more generally in order to build a continuous steering method for chained form systems using the sinusoidal inputs), one has to prove (in a constructive way) the existence of a continuous expression of such that</p><p>(5) (6) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> Now, the general closed form expressions for and (for a chained form system of dimension ) are unknown. Thus, finding a continuous expression of inducing a convergence to zero of these unknown expressions is far from obvious! Even if we can not yet propose an expression of leading to a unique expression of satisfying TP, we prove (in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and in the following) that on any compact set and for any , it is always possible to choose and such that at any point, the whole ball of radius is -reachable from its center by . In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, we propose an expression of such as a function of and the bounds of CS. This is enough to allow the use of the sinusoidal inputs for chained form systems in a collision-free path planning scheme such as the approximation scheme.</p><p>The proof that follows is very close to the proof of the sufficient condition for TP which as we have seen can not be directly applied. It does not lead to an expression of but shows its existence in a clearer way than the proof in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. TP for Sinusoidal Inputs</head><p>As we have seen, Lemma 1 states that is a diffeomorphism locally around zero. So the domain reachable from any CS by sinusoidal inputs contains a neighborhood of . Nevertheless, we have not any guarantee to have a global steering method (i.e., reaching the whole CS from a given ) by using sinusoidal inputs. Let us consider for a given , the local planner associating to , the path between and computed by the sinusoidal inputs with the given parameter . As we have mentioned above, the subset of CS reachable by this local planner from a given point , may in general depend on and .</p><p>The assumption that we make here is that for all , there exists a neighborhood of the origin in CS such that CS and for all start point in CS, is reachable from by a path computed by .

This reasonable assumption is at least true up to dimension 6 (highest dimension of our implementations) for which , CS CS. Lemma 2: For all , is continuous on CS in the topology associated with . Proof: For a given set of parameters and , the differential equations (3) with sinusoidal inputs can be easily integrated. Let us note . and are linear combinations of sinusoidal functions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>This paper presents a general approach to the effective collision-free path planning for nonholonomic system. The main idea is motivated by the fact that the final path computed by a planner is often the concatenation of elementary paths computed by a basic procedure (the local planner) which actually restricts the domain of admissible motions of the real system. Therefore, in order to conserve the controllability of the system, the local planner has to respect some properties. For the small-space locally controllable systems, we define such a property (the Topological Property) and we show that equipped with a local planner verifying TP, a complete and exact collision-free path planner is at our disposal. Notice that in general, TP helps the convergence of any planning scheme including a local planner (for, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, Ariadne's Clue algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>). We also prove that an appropriate tuning of the parameter of the sinusoidal inputs proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> allows us to integrate the corresponding local planner into a complete collision-free planning scheme for chained form systems.</p><p>An example of system transformable into chained form is the tractor-trailers system where each vehicle is hooked to the center of the rear axle of the vehicle ahead <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> gives some samples of solution for this kind of system. The local planner uses the sinusoidal inputs and the general algorithm is the approximation scheme (see Section III-B). The average computation time for this kind of examples is 70 on a Sparc-20 Workstation. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> for the details of implementation and the tuning of the parameter .</p><p>These results correspond to the first exact and complete path planner for Tractor-Trailers yielding a reasonable solution.</p><p>Notice that given a local planner respecting TP, any geometric planner induces a collision-free nonholonomic planner through the approximation scheme. However this is not the only approach to solve the problem. Indeed, some geometric planners are already based on the use of a geometric local planner (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> for Adriane's clew algorithm and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> for Probabilistic Path Planning). These planners may be applied to a nonholonomic system by substituting the geometric local planner by a nonholonomic one. If the local planner respects TP the convergence (or probabilistic convergence) of these algorithms is guaranteed. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref> presents some results of the first Probabilistic Path Planner applied to the tractor-trailers system <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The local planner is based on the sinusoidal inputs.</p><p>Let us finish by mentioning another local planner respecting TP, which has been designed for tractor-trailers system, using its property of differential flatness <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.   For a given and a given start point , if we want the path to remain inside the ball , will have to be such that , so . Regarding the WTP, that implies for any such that . In order to remain close to the start configuration, the more we approach the hyperplane the closer we should choose the goal configuration. On the hyperplane , can have any expression verifying the WTP (we can for example associate to the points of this axis, the same families of paths than the points of rotated by and consider our problem only on</p><p>). Such a local planner is defined on the whole configuration space and can respect WTP. That means, it can be used to approximate any collision-free path with an clearance with obstacles. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">9</ref> Yet this local planner does not respect TP since for any the radius of the -reachable ball from tends to zero when tends to the hyperplane . Let us consider now the practical problem of approximating a straight line , inside a corridor with an angle of with respect to the axis, passing through the hyperplane (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>).</p><p>Assume that we follow the natural strategy which consists in reaching the farthest point on using and repeating the same operation. It is easy to verify that two points of on different sides of the hyperplane can not be directly linked by a collision-free path computed by . Indeed, assume that we begin with a , any reachable point of without collision is such that . Now, . Then . If , , and will always have the same sign. The only way of crossing the hyperplane is to choose the unique via point of which is in the hyperplane (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>), when we are close enough to the hyperplane . In which case, we will be able to use another family of curves and link close extremal points while remaining inside the corridor. In general if our algorithm of approximation does not take into account this specificity of the point (simply because we may not know it ), the probability of the choice of as an intermediate point by our algorithm is zero. Therefore, even if there exists a collision-free approximation of the straight line by paths computed by our local planner, in practice we will never find it. We will approach the -axis more and more without ever crossing it.</p><p>Furthermore, there exist some difficulties from a computational point of view. The planner being meant to run on a computer (which is a discrete calculator), the exact determination of a point can not be guaranteed.</p><p>Notice that this kind of discontinuous path planner is not so "exotic" that it may appear. As mentioned before, the length optimal path planner is discontinuous (yet it verifies TP since the length of the paths remains continuous with respect to the extremal configurations). If we consider the sinusoidal inputs for chained form systems, any discontinuous procedure of choice of the free parameter leads to a discontinuous local planner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX B CHAINED FORM SYSTEMS AND POLYNOMIAL INPUTS</head><p>In this appendix, we take an interest in other inputs for chained form systems suggested by Tilbury et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, the polynomial inputs Notice that with these inputs, the integration time is given by . So this method will yield no solution when . It is proved <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> that in other cases, for each start configuration there exists and such that the corresponding polynomial inputs steer the system from the start to the final configuration.</p><p>Therefore, it is easy to design a local planner for the whole CS using the polynomial inputs. In cases where , it suffices to chose an intermediate point (with ) and apply successively the polynomial inputs between and and then between and . The example below shows that such local planners do not lead to a local planner verifying TP.</p><p>In what follows we deal with chained form systems of dimension 3; of course there is a more general (and more tedious) counter-example for dimension . Applying the polynomial inputs in dimension , for any small ball chosen around , there will still be points of this ball (not included in the hyperplane</p><p>) such that the paths to these points computed by polynomial inputs do not remain in the ball . Therefore, the local planner mentioned above (using polynomial inputs and occasionally an intermediate point for the points of the hyperplane ), does not verify the TP. Nevertheless, even if the -reachable set from a point by polynomial inputs is not a neighborhood of , this set is not empty (for example, points of the -axis close enough to the origin are included in this set). Therefore, it may be possible to design a local planner respecting TP and using the polynomial inputs by generalizing the use of an intermediate point to a bigger set than the hyperplane . However, this hypothesis has first to be confirmed and then the procedure of choice of the intermediate point has to be find, which is a hard task. This kind of design has been done by the authors using another family of paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
