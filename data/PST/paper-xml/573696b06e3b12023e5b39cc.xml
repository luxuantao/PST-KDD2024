<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HIS PAPER is motivated by the need for a system- atic control design framework for future smart distribution systems. With the advance of metering and communication technologies, "smarter distribution" can be realized with microgrid-based configuration <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Clusters of distributed energy resources and loads, known as "microgrids", can be managed by local intelligent decision makers and coordinated by the distribution system operator (DSO) to achieve sustainable and reliable operation. Interconnected through distribution lines, microgrids exchange power to mitigate renewable resource output fluctuation and balance out the mismatch between local power generation and consumption through aggregation effect. The well functioning of such a smart distribution system heavily depends on the control architecture that manages thousands of heterogeneous resources/consumers at scale. The objective of this paper is to introduce and test such a control architecture for coupling operated microgrids that leads to guaranteed performance.</p><p>One of the main challenges of control architecture for future distribution grid is how to coordinate heterogeneous distributed energy resources (DERs), energy storage systems (ESSs) and controllable loads (CLs) so that the overall system performance is guaranteed. A promising solution would be to break the distribution system down into interconnected clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. As defined by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, such resource and load clusters can be considered as a microgrid if it has a clear electric boundary. This boundary is commonly referred to as "the point of common coupling (PCC)". In a microgrid, each power generation and/or consumption unit is controlled by its local unit controller (LUC). And all the LUCs are managed by an intelligent microgrid central controller (MGCC). Then one level above, the PCC voltage V t ∠δ t of each microgrid will be coordinated by the DSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. With such clustered configuration, the computational complexity and communicational burden can be significantly reduced for distribution system operation, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Different from direct connection of conventional synchronous generators, microgrids are commonly interfaced to the distribution grid through power electronic converters (PECs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Performing power conversion at microgrid PCCs, PEC-based interfaces can provide: 1) power quality and reliability enhancement for critical loads <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>; 2) frequency isolation between local units and the grid <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>; 3) another layer of control, e.g., emulating synchronous generator behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>A somewhat simplistic view is to treat the microgrids as miniaturized bulk power systems, with spatial and temporal scales mapped at the distribution level <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. However, the 1949-3053 c 2015 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission.</p><p>See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information. following unique features of microgrids render this approach invalid: 1) at the distribution level lines can hardly be assumed to be lossless, thus coupling between real and reactive power control need to be considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>; 2) the physical inertia of rotating masses (if any) on the source side will be decoupled from the grid with PEC-based interfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>; 3) the (external) behavior of microgrids will be primarily determined by the control function of their interfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. All these unique features render the assumption that microgrids can be effectively managed with scaled down energy management system (EMS) used in conventional power systems invalid.</p><p>For the control and management of electrically coupled microgrids, operation autonomy is desirable to reduce communicational burden and computational complexity at the interconnection level; however, a fully decentralized approach may be infeasible due to strong interactions among coupling operated microgrids. It is therefore plausible to envision a hierarchical framework with distributed local control and global coordination, while only limited information exchange is required between each MGCC and the DSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we propose an interactive control framework for coupling operated microgrids, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, to realize effective load sharing with guaranteed system-wide stability. At the primary level, model reference control (MRC)-based power sharing scheme is utilized for each microgrid interface to track a designed reference model. The MRC scheme enables online droop gain modification of each microgrid to satisfy the real time system stability and regulation requirement with respect to a specific operating condition. At the secondary level, an interactive droop management strategy is proposed based on system regulation requirement, regulating power ramping up/down capacity and a distributed stability criterion proposed in our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. At the tertiary level, an AC power flow (ACPF)-based supervisory control is adopted to dispatch nominal settings and an interaction coefficient to each MGCC respectively for the primary level model reference tracking and the secondary level droop management procedure.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. The primary level power sharing control is detailed in II. The secondary level droop management scheme is described in III. The tertiary level supervisory control is discussed in Section IV. Case studies are performed in Section V. Concluding remarks are given in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PRIMARY LEVEL POWER SHARING CONTROL</head><p>Assuming voltage source inverters (VSIs) are readily deployed as interfaces, the envisioned smart distribution system can be configured as interconnected microgrids. At the primary level, the interface VSIs can be controlled to 1) shape the microgrid external behavior with desirable dynamical response characteristic, 2) track the reference droop characteristics designed based on steady-state performance standards and system-wide stability criterion.</p><p>Considering microgrids as aggregated units interfaced through VSIs, the PCC voltage of each microgrid could be shaped through the interface control scheme implemented by the MGCC <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. For effective load sharing among VSI-interfaced units, droop-based methods are widely used to achieve a communication free control realization <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Originated from the power balancing principle of synchronous generators in large power systems, frequency deviation from nominal value is commonly used as the indicator of local real power mismatch, i.e., an imbalance between the input mechanical power and output electric real power will cause a change in local frequency. Similarly, voltage magnitude deviation indicates local reactive power mismatch <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Emulating the behaviors of synchronous generators, frequency-droop methods are commonly used for real power sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>; however, the acceptable range of frequency deviation is tightly constrained by the regulation requirement. Using frequency droop for real power sharing may cause the so-called "chattering" phenomenon with high penetration of inertia-less units interfaced by VSIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Actually, both the dynamical behavior and droop characteristics of an interface VSI can be artificially crafted <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> by its control function implemented. With synchrophasor measurement available for each interface VSI, angle droop methods can be used for real power sharing. Instead of frequency deviation, the difference between the interface VSI voltage phase angle and a synchronized reference is employed to indicate local real power mismatch. With angle droop methods, better dynamic performance can be expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>In our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, an interface control strategy is proposed using angle-droop (P-δ) method for real power sharing and voltage droop (Q-V) for reactive power sharing. Corresponding stability criteria are derived to evaluate systemwide small signal stability. Here taking a step further, we propose a MRC-based scheme for the primary level control to track a reference model designed at the secondary level based on a distributed system-wide stability criterion. As an angle droop based method, signals from the global positioning system (GPS) are required for angle referencing, but no communication is necessary among the interface VSIs at the primary level <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>When external behaviors of a VSI-interfaced microgrid is studied at the interconnection level, only the interface control function is modeled with the fast switching transients and high frequency harmonics neglected as a common practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The objective of the interface control is to track the nominal setting of the PCC voltage, i.e., V t ∠δ t tracking its reference setting</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">V ref t ∠δ ref t .</formula><p>Taking advantage of fast responding power electronic switches, the switching frequency can be designed much higher than the PCC voltage fundamental frequency in consideration of power quality. Thus the phasor representation V t ∠δ t is validated to represent the averaged VSI behavior without compromising modeling accuracy.</p><p>In current practice of droop-based interface control, the droop gains are commonly pre-designed at fixed and very conservative values to guarantee system stability for all the possible operation points <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Consequently, the ability of autonomous power sharing among microgrids will be significantly limited. Such control design approach does not require online tuning, whereas the operation optimality will be significantly sacrificed since the droop gains need to be constrained by the worst case scenario of all. Especially for a system with large penetration level of renewable energy a wide range of operating conditions need to be considered, which deteriorates autonomous power sharing capability. Here we propose a MRC-based scheme at the primary control level for droop gain online tuning of each microgrid interface so that the real time system stability and regulation requirement satisfied with respect to a specific operation point dispatched by the DSO.</p><p>For a VSI-based interface, the widely used frequency droop method gives the following control function <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ω = ω * + σ ω (P G + P R -P L -P I ), (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>where P G is the total real power generated in the microgrid.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. SECONDARY LEVEL CONTROL FOR GUARANTEED SYSTEM-WIDE STABILITY</head><p>In conventional power systems, the secondary level control is commonly implemented to eliminate the frequency deviation from its nominal value introduced by the P -ω droop control. With the proposed MRC-based scheme, the frequency deviation approaches zero as discussed in Section II. Thus such frequency restoration process is not necessary. Instead, an interactive droop management scheme is proposed here to guarantee system-wide stability at the secondary level, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Implemented by MGCCs, unit commitment of LUCs will be performed based on a distributed stability criterion. Then the aggregated real-time ramp up/down regulation capacity for each microgrid can be determined. Accordingly, the desirable P -δ, Q -V droop gains can be designed for reference model to be tracked at the primary level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Distributed Criterion for System-Wide Stability</head><p>The main advantage of the MRC-based primary level power sharing scheme proposed in Section II is that its control action is merely based on local measurements. However, we will show that some coordination is indispensable for a stable operation of microgrids connected by lossy lines.</p><p>Different from highly inductive lines at the bulk transmission level, distribution lines cannot be assumed lossless in general. Strong coupling exists between the active and reactive power flow. The droop gains of each microgrid interface need to be designed carefully because a feasible AC power flow solution cannot guarantee system-wide stability. System instability may be resulted even if all microgrids are locally stable <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>For stability study of interconnected systems having states responding in a wide range of time scales, a well-established approach is to perform model reduction through singularperturbation techniques, in which a clear separation of timescales is assumed <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. To study the impact of intermicrogrid interaction on system-wide stability, the subsystems responding much faster than the targeted time scale will be singular-perturbed, while those responding much slower will be considered constant. Thus at the interconnection level, the reference model (5) will be used to represent the interface dynamics of each microgrid for system-wide stability study assuming the primary level control objective is achieved sufficiently fast, i.e., successful tracking of the reference model. Such simplification is validated since the cluster of eigenvalues related to the reference model droop characteristics will be the closest to the imaginary axis and has the predominant impact on system-wide stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In the following, we will shown that the system-wide stability can be guaranteed if the droop gains σ δ r and σ V r of each microgrid satisfy an operating condition-dependent criterion.</p><p>Assuming the states of the reference model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">5</ref>) are successfully tracked by the close-loop plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, the small signal model for microgrid i around the nominal setting point</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">o i e = (δ * i , V * i , P * I i , Q * I i ) can be represented as follows. ẋi = A i x i + B i u i ,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">x i = [ δ i , V i ] T , u i = [ -P I i , -Q I i ] T .

However, as a centralized approach, detailed information needs to be collected from all MGCCs for each system operation point.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Interactive Droop Management</head><p>The primary level power sharing control scheme described in Section II can be interpreted as follows: when the voltage phase angle at module PCC falls from δ * i to δ i , the real power injection is allowed to increase from P * I i to P I i through ramping up regulation resources. The same logic applies to the Q -V droop characteristic. Obviously, the increase of real/reactive regulation power will counteract the voltage angle/magnitude deficiency and eventually settled down at a steady-state equilibrium on the designed droop characteristics, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. We have shown in Section III-A that the system-wide stability can be guaranteed if the droop gains σ δ r , σ V r of each microgrid satisfy the condition in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</p><p>Here we assume the steady-state performance requirement of the interface reference tracking is</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">δ i ∈ [δ min i , δ max i ] (rad), and V i ∈ [V min i , V max i ] (p.u.</formula><p>) for microgrid i.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. TERTIARY LEVEL SUPERVISORY CONTROL FOR MICROGRID MANAGEMENT</head><p>As the highest level of control for multi-microgrid systems, tertiary control is responsible for coordinating the operation of all on-line microgrids <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The main purpose is to mitigate the DER output variation and balance out the longterm mismatch between power production and consumption through aggregation effect, i.e., power exchange among interconnected microgrids. For a reliable, secure and economical operation, the reference setting of each microgrid interface can be managed by the DSO with a supervisory control scheme.</p><p>Assume effective power sharing is achieved with the primary level control and system-wide stability guaranteed with the droop management performed at the secondary level. Since distribution lines commonly have comparative resistance and reactance, an ACPF problem is formulated to generate the reference setting for each microgrid. The procedure starts with each microgrid forecasting its total local real and reactive power injection P * I , Q * I for an operation interval defined by the DSO. It should be noted that if used as the main regulation resource, the ESS of each microgrid may keep on injection or absorbing real power due to the droop-based method employed. Thus, the amount of real power generation or consumption of the ESS needs to be included in the forecasting of power injection based on its state of charge (SOC).</p><p>In the ACPF problem formulation, the PCC of the microgrid connected with the external system is designated as the swing bus; PCCs of all the other microgrids will be considered as P -Q buses at the beginning. If the physical limits of V t is hit for some buses, they will be treated as P -V buses instead.</p><p>With the ACPF solution o e = [δ * , V * , P * I , Q * I ] T obtained, the corresponding λ max defined in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_31">18</ref>) can be calculated. Then o i e and λ max will be sent to each MGCC for the primary level  reference tracking and the secondary level droop management, respectively. It should be noted that the time frame of the interaction coefficient broadcasting can be designed different from the operation point dispatch procedure. For instance, droop gains for each microgrid may can be managed with a finer resolution for better support of fast variation resources. However, if frequent change of droop gains is not allowed, conservative values can be designed based on the worst case operation scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES</head><p>In this section, a study system designed based on IEEE 123node test feeder, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>, will be used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed interactive control framework. Configured as a microgrid-based distribution system, 5 microgrids are interconnected through tie-branches (TBs), with line parameters given in Table . I.</p><p>In each microgrid, various energy sources are configured including wind farm, solar system, natural gas generators and etc, of which the aggregation will be the P G i , Q G i , i = 1 . . . 5 in our problem formulation. Local load includes residential, commercial and industrial customers, of which the aggregation will be the P L i , Q L i , i = 1 . . . 5. And also, utility-scale battery energy storage system is deployed in each microgrid serving as the regulation power P R i , Q R i , i = 1 . . . 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. System Operating Condition and Interaction Coefficient</head><p>With the ACPF problem formulated in Section V-A solved every 15 minutes, the system operating condition and the corresponding reference setting point for each microgrid can be obtained. Here nine consecutive operation points are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>. Detailed generation and load profile is given in the appendix. Corresponding to each system operating condition, the interaction coefficient λ max defined in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_31">18</ref>) can be calculated, as plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>  The interaction coefficient shows the network stressfulness at a specified operation point. It can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>, 7 that the higher utilization of the tie-branches for power exchange the larger interaction coefficient will the system have. For the operation point at 30 min, the largest real power branch flow is F 2-1 = 0.31 MW from μG 2 to μG 1 through TB 5 . The corresponding interaction coefficient λ max (15) = 0.008. For the operation point at 60 min, the largest real power branch flow is F 1-3 = 3.58 MW from μG 1 to μG 3 through TB 1 .</p><p>The corresponding interaction coefficient λ max (60) = 1.316. Apparently, the system interaction coefficient at 60 min is much larger than that at 30 min with significantly higher utilization of the network for power exchange.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Droop Gain and System-Wide Stability</head><p>As discussed in Section III, droop gains of each microgrid interface need to satisfy the criterion in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_51">27</ref>) so that the systemwide small signal stability can be guaranteed. Start with the scenario that no real time droop management is performed. Each microgrid interface VSI has its droop gain designed a priori without considering system operating condition, i.e., the plant model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">3</ref>), (4) will be used to represent the interface control dynamics.</p><p>To match the reference setting</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">P * I , Q * I , let P R = P * I + P L -P G , Q R = Q * I + Q L -Q G .

With the initial condition V t i = 0.10, δ t i = 0.05, i = 1 . . . 5, system response for the first 30 seconds is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>, from which we see that the system is unstable as the state trajectories do not converge to their reference values. Now consider the scenario that real time droop gains of each microgrid interface are managed interactively with the DSO through the procedure introduced in Section III-C. Assume for each module, the PCC voltage phase angle and magnitude are required to be regulated within ±5 • (±0.0873rad), ±0.05p.u. from their reference values, respectively.

It can be observed that the system is asymptotically stable as the state trajectories converge to their reference values at steady state.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we proposed a three-level interactive control framework for microgrid-based future smart distribution systems. With P -δ, Q -V droop control respectively for real and reactive power sharing, a model reference control (MRC)-based scheme is proposed to track a reference model. Having the predominant impact on system stability, the reference model droop gains of each microgrid interface will be managed interactively at the secondary level between the MGCC and the DSO based on a derived distributed stability criterion. At the tertiary level, an ACPF-based supervisory control scheme is utilized to dispatch reference settings and the corresponding interaction coefficient to each MGCC for the primary reference tracking and secondary level droop management, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed control framework is numerically tested in a study system designed based on IEEE 123-node test feeder.</p><p>Our future work will focus on transient stability problems related with the islands synchronization procedure during system black-start restoration.</p></div>
