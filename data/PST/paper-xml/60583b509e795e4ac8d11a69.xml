<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Side information of items, e.g., images and text description, has shown to be effective in contributing to accurate recommendations. Inspired by the recent success of pre-training models on natural language and images, we propose a pre-training strategy to learn item representations by considering both item side information and their relationships. We relate items by common user activities, e.g., co-purchase, and construct a homogeneous item graph. This graph provides a unified view of item relations and their associated side information in multimodality. We develop a novel sampling algorithm named MCNSampling to select contextual neighbors for each item. The proposed Pre-trained Multimodal Graph Transformer (PMGT) learns item representations with two objectives: 1) graph structure reconstruction, and 2) masked node feature reconstruction. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed PMGT model effectively exploits the multimodality side information to achieve better accuracies in downstream tasks including item recommendation and click-through ratio prediction. In addition, we also report a case study of testing PMGT in an online setting with 600 thousand users.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In recent years, a good range of recommendation techniques have been proposed, from classic collaborative filtering techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> to the recent deep learning models <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Besides the interactions between users and items, the multimodality side information of items has also been exploited and showed effectiveness in further improving recommendation accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Example side information of items include textual descriptions, images, and videos, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a). Traditional methods exploit item side information by manual feature engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and then employ factorization machine <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> or gradient boosting machine <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> to predict users' preferences on items. These methods often require domain-specific knowledge, and are time-consuming. Deep learning-based methods leverage the strong representation learning ability of neural networks to exploit item side information, for learning the user and/or item representations. However, existing solutions only consider a specific type of side information of items for the dedicated recommendation applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. The full multimodality side information of items are not fully exploited.</p><p>Inspired by the successes of unsupervised pre-training strategies designed for natural language processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and graph data <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>, we propose to develop an unsupervised pre-training framework to fully exploit the multimodality side information for item representations learning. Illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we construct an item multimodal graph to provide a unified view of items with their associated multimodality side information. In this item multimodal graph, each node is an item and the edges model their relationships (e.g., co-purchase or co-viewership, depending on the application domain). We then pre-train graph neural network (GNN) on this item multimodal graph to enable the GNN model to capture both item relationships and their multimodality side information.</p><p>The unified item multimodal graph well distinguishes our work from previous studies where side information of items and their relationships are studied separately. We argue that these two types of information complement each other in solving recommendation problems. We hence focus on effective pre-training on top of this item multimodal graph to benefit item recommendation. Moreover, we also show that our pre-training benefit other E-commerce applications like click-through ratio (CTR) prediction.  The contributions made in this paper are as follows. First, we propose a novel pre-training framework, namely Pre-trained Multimodal Graph Transformer (PMGT), to exploit items' multimodality information through unsupervised learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep pre-training method developed to exploit the multimodality side information of items for recommender systems. Second, we decompose the learning objective of PMGT into two sub-objectives: (i) graph structure reconstruction, and (ii) masked node feature reconstruction. To handle large-scale graph data, we develop an algorithm, named Mini-batch Contextual Neighbors Sampling (i.e., MCNSampling), for effective and scalable training. Moreover, we employ the attention mechanism to aggregate the item's multimodality information, and a diversitypromoting Transformer framework to model the influences between an item and its contextual neighbors in the graph. Lastly, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PMGT model, we conduct extensive experiments on real datasets for different applications. The results on two downstream tasks, i.e., item recommendation and CTR prediction, demonstrate that PMGT is more effective than existing graph-based pre-training methods in fully exploiting items' multimodality information. To further show the effectiveness of PMGT, we report a case study of applying this model in an online E-commerce platform.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Pre-training methods have been widely applied in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. It has been shown that pre-training is effective in boosting performances of various downstream applications. For example, a general pretraining paradigm for CV tasks is firstly training a model on the ImageNet dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and then fine-tuning the pre-trained model for a specific task. NLP is another domain where pre-training is usually adopted. The shallow pre-training methods, e.g., word2vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and GloVe <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, learn word representations based on the word cooccurrence patterns in a corpus of documents. Recently, significant progress has been made in developing deep pre-training models for contextual word representations. For example, ELMo <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> employs a bidirectional language model to learn high-quality deep contextdependent word representations. The BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and XLNET <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> models use attention mechanisms to learn the word representations.</p><p>Significant improvements are achieved when applying these pretrained models on various NLP tasks.</p><p>On graph data, many embedding techniques have been developed in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Representative shallow graph embedding methods include TransE <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, DeepWalk <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, LINE <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, and Node2vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The recent popularity of GNNs motivates the development of pretraining strategies for GNN models. In general, these methods pretrain GNNs by solving the graph reconstruction problem. For example, Kipf et al. introduce the variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) framework for graph reconstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Hamilton et al. propose a general inductive framework called GraphSAGE <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, which exploits node features to generate node embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood. Velickovic et al.</p><p>propose the Deep Graph Infomax model <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> that aims to maximize the mutual information between the node representations and the representation of the graph. Recently, self-supervised learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is employed to simultaneously pre-train GNNs at both node and graph levels, and an example is the self-supervised learning method for graph neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Similarly, the generative framework GPT-GNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> employs a self-supervised attributed graph generation task to pre-train GNNs, by effectively capturing both semantic and structural properties of the graph. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, a self-supervised graph neural network pre-training model is proposed to capture the universal network topological properties across multiple networks. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, the proposed Graph-BERT model employs attention mechanism to aggregate the neighborhood information of a target node in the graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">THE PROPOSED PRE-TRAINING MODEL</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the proposed PMGT framework. Observe that PMGT contains four main components: 1) contextual neighbors sampling, 2) node embedding initialization, 3) transformer-based encoder, and 4) graph reconstruction. Before we detail each component in this section, we provide the preliminary background.</p><p>In this work, we construct a homogeneous graph G = (V, E) to provide a uniform view of items' multimodality side information and their relationships. Here, V denotes the set of nodes (i.e., items), and E denotes the set of edges between them. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> Each node ℎ has multiple types of side information. We denote the 𝑖-th modality feature of the node ℎ by x 𝑖 ℎ , and the number of modality by 𝑚. In G, we denote the one-hop neighbors of ℎ by N ℎ , and use 𝜔 ℎ𝑡 to denote the weight of the edge between two nodes ℎ and 𝑡, where 𝜔 ℎ𝑡 &gt; 0. For a node ℎ, we use C ℎ to denote its contextual neighbors selected by a sampling algorithm, e.g., the MCNSampling algorithm. Given the item graph G and the contextual neighbors of each node, PMGT aims to obtain the node representations that can capture the multimodality information of nodes and the graph structure. Then, the learned node representations can be applied in downstream tasks directly or with adjustments such as fine-tuning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Contextual Neighbors Sampling</head><p>For each node ℎ, there exist some relevant nodes in the graph that may help enrich its representation. These relevant nodes are referred as the contextual neighbors of ℎ. To efficiently select contextual neighbors for a batch of nodes during the training of PMGT, we develop a sampling algorithm named MCNSampling. MCNSampling iteratively samples a list of nodes for a target node ℎ with a predefined sampling depth 𝐾. Let S 𝑘−1 ℎ denote the bag of nodes sampled at the (𝑘 −1)-th step. For each node 𝑡 in S 𝑘−1 ℎ , we randomly sample 𝑛 𝑘 nodes with replacement from 𝑡's one-hop neighbors N 𝑡 at the 𝑘-th step. The probability that a node 𝑡 ′ ∈ N 𝑡 being sampled is proportional to the weight 𝜔 𝑡𝑡 ′ of the edge between nodes 𝑡 and 𝑡 ′ . Note that a node may appear multiple times in S 𝑘−1 ℎ . In the MCNSampling algorithm, we treat all node instances in S 𝑘−1 ℎ as "different nodes" and perform the sampling procedure.</p><p>In our sampling algorithm, we select contextual neighbors by considering 1) the sampled frequency of a node, and 2) the number of sampling steps between the target node ℎ and a sampled node in the sampling process. For every node 𝑡 ∈ V \ ℎ, we empirically define its importance to the target node ℎ at the 𝑘-th sampling step (𝑘 ≤ 𝐾) as follows,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝑠 𝑘 𝑡 = 𝑓 𝑘 𝑡 × (𝐾 − 𝑘 + 1),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where 𝑓 𝑘 𝑡 denotes the number of times 𝑡 appearing in S 𝑘 ℎ . That is, a node 𝑡 is considered more relevant to the target node ℎ, if 𝑡 is sampled more frequently and it has a smaller sampling steps to ℎ. The final importance score of a node 𝑡 to ℎ is defined as follows,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑠 𝑡 = 𝐾 𝑘=1 𝑠 𝑘 𝑡 .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Then, we sort all nodes in V \ℎ according to their importance scores in descending order, and choose the 𝑆 top-ranked nodes as the sampled contextual neighbors of ℎ. The details of the MCNSamping algorithm are summarized in Algorithm 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Node Embedding Initialization</head><p>After the neighborhood sampling, we concatenate the target node ℎ and its ordered contextual neighbors C ℎ , denoted by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">I ℎ = [ℎ, ℎ 1 , ℎ 2 , • • • , ℎ 𝑆 ].</formula><p>ℎ 𝑗 is the 𝑗-th node in C ℎ , and 1 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑆. For each node 𝑡 ∈ I ℎ , we apply the attention mechanism to obtain its multimodal representation M 𝑡 as follows,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">X 𝑖 𝑡 = x 𝑖 𝑡 W 𝑖 𝑀 + b 𝑖 𝑀 , 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑚 X 𝑡 = X 1 𝑡 ⊕ X 2 𝑡 ⊕ • • • ⊕ X 𝑚 𝑡 , 𝛼 𝑡 = softmax tanh(X 𝑡 )W 𝑠 + b 𝑠 , M 𝑡 = 𝑚 𝑖 𝛼 𝑖 𝑡 X 𝑖 𝑡 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where W 𝑖 𝑀 ∈ R 𝑑 𝑖 ×𝑑 0 and b 𝑖 𝑀 ∈ R 1×𝑑 0 denote weight matrix and bias term for the 𝑖-th modality, W 𝑠 ∈ R (𝑚𝑑 0 )×𝑚 and b 𝑠 ∈ R 1×𝑚 denote weight matrix and bias term for attention mechanism. ⊕ is the concatenation operation. That is, the multimodality side information of each item is concatenated to contribute to the comprehensive representation learning. 𝛼 𝑖 𝑡 denotes the 𝑖-th element of 𝛼 𝑡 . The position of a node in the input list I ℎ reflects its importance to the target node ℎ. Thus, we argue that the order of nodes in I ℎ is important in learning node representations. The position-id embedding is used to identify the node order information of an input list,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P 𝑡 = P-Embedding 𝑝 (𝑡) ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where 𝑝 (𝑡) denotes the position id of node 𝑡 in I ℎ , P 𝑡 ∈ R 1×𝑑 0 denotes the position-based embedding for 𝑡. Our main objective is to obtain the representation of the target node ℎ. Intuitively, the target node and its contextual neighbors should play different roles in the pre-training. To identify the role differences, we add the following role-based embedding to each node 𝑡 ∈ I ℎ ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">R 𝑡 = R-Embedding 𝑟 (𝑡) ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where 𝑟 (𝑡) and R 𝑡 ∈ R 1×𝑑 0 denote the role label and role-based embedding of the node 𝑡, respectively. In practice, we set the role label of the target node as "Target" and the role labels of the contextual neighbors as "Context". Based on the embeddings stated above, we aggregate them together to define the initial input embedding for a node 𝑡 ∈ I ℎ as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">H 0 𝑡 = Aggregate M 𝑡 , P 𝑡 , R 𝑡 .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>In this work, we simply define the Aggregate(•) function as vector summation. The initial input embeddings for the nodes in the input list I ℎ can be stacked into a matrix </p><formula xml:id="formula_7">H 0 = [H 0 0 ; H 0 1 ; • • • ; H 0 𝑆 ] ∈ R (𝑆+1)×𝑑 0 ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">S 0 ← [ℎ], S 1 , S 2 , • • • S 𝐾 ← [ ], 𝑠 𝑡 ← 0 ∀𝑡 ∈ V \ ℎ; 4: for 𝑘 = 1, 2, • • • , 𝐾 do 5:</formula><p>for 𝑡 ∈ S 𝑘−1 do Sort the nodes in V \ ℎ according to the importance scores in descending order;</p><p>11:</p><p>Choose 𝑆 top-ranked nodes as the contextual neighbors C ℎ of ℎ and append it to C 𝐵 ; 12: end for 13: return C 𝐵</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Transformer-based Graph Encoder</head><p>We use the Transformer framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> to model the mutual influences between a node and its contextual neighbors. Given the node representations H ℓ−1 at the (ℓ − 1)-th layer, the output at the ℓ-th layer of original Transformer model is defined as follows,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">H ℓ = FFN softmax( QK ⊤ 𝑑 ℎ )V , Q = H ℓ−1 W ℓ 𝑄 , K = H ℓ−1 W ℓ 𝐾 , V = H ℓ−1 W ℓ 𝑉 ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where W ℓ 𝑄 , W ℓ 𝐾 , W ℓ 𝑉 ∈ R 𝑑 0 ×𝑑 0 denote the weight matrices, FFN(•) is the feed forward network. Here, we omit the residual network in the formula for convenience.</p><p>For the target node ℎ, there may exist some sampled nodes in C ℎ , whose representations are similar to the representation of ℎ. Assume that all the sampled contextual neighbors are relevant to ℎ. We hope the proposed model can capture the diversity of the sampled contextual neighbors, by concentrating on the nodes that are relevant but not very similar to the target node. To achieve this objective, we design a diversity-promoting attention mechanism and include it into the attention network of Transformer,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">S = H ℓ−1 W ℓ 𝑆 , U 1 = softmax E − SS ⊤ ||S|| 2 ||S|| ⊤ 2 + I ,<label>(8)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">U 2 = softmax( QK ⊤ 𝑑 ℎ</formula><p>),</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">H ℓ = FFN (𝛽U 1 + (1 − 𝛽)U 2 )V ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where W 𝑙 𝑆 ∈ R 𝑑 0 ×𝑑 0 is the weight matrix, E ∈ R (𝑆+1)×(𝑆+1) is a matrix where all its elements are 1, ||S|| 2 ∈ R (𝑆+1)×1 denotes the ℓ 2 row norm of S, and I ∈ R (𝑆+1)×(𝑆+1) denotes the identity matrix.</p><p>In Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">8</ref>), "-" denotes the element-wise division of two matrices. Note that the larger the similarity between two different nodes, the smaller the attention weight between them in U 1 . The objective of adding I in the definition of U 1 is to include the node's self information. 𝛽 is a constant (0 ≤ 𝛽 ≤ 1) balancing the contributions of the two attention weights. After obtaining the output H 𝐿 at the last layer of the encoder, we obtain H 𝐿 0 as the representation of target node ℎ, denoted as h for simplicity. Then, H 𝐿 will be used in the following pre-training tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Model Optimization</head><p>PMGT is pre-trained with the following two objectives: 1) graph structure reconstruction, and 2) masked node feature reconstruction. To ensure the learned node representations can capture the graph structure, we define the following loss function <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">L 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 = 1 |V | ℎ ∈V 1 |N ℎ | 𝑡 ∈N ℎ − log 𝜎 ( h ⊤ t ||h|| 2 ||t|| 2 ) − 𝑄 • E 𝑡 𝑛 ∼𝑃 𝑛 (𝑡 ) log 𝜎 (− h ⊤ t 𝑛 ||h|| 2 ||t 𝑛 || 2 ) ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where 𝜎 (•) is the sigmoid function, 𝑃 𝑛 and 𝑄 denote the negative sampling distribution and the number of negative samples. The node feature reconstruction task focuses on capturing the multimodal features in the learned node representations. Previous methods, e.g., GRAPH-BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, design an attribute reconstruction task without masking operations. Thus, the models' abilities in aggregating the features of different nodes may be limited. In this work, we design a masked node feature reconstruction task, which aims to reconstruct the features of masked nodes by other non-masked nodes in I ℎ . As the representation of the target node ℎ is needed to reconstruct the graph structure in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">10</ref>), we do not apply the masking operation to the target node ℎ. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, we randomly choose 20% of nodes in the list I ℎ \ℎ for masking. If the node 𝑡 is chosen, we replace 𝑡 with: 1) the [Mask] node 80% of the time, (2) a random node 10% of the time, and (3) the unchanged node 𝑡 10% of the time. Then, the masked item list will be input to the model, and the output H 𝐿 will be used to reconstruct the multimodal features of the masked nodes. We set the input features of the [Mask] node to 0, and define the feature reconstruction loss as follows,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">L 𝑓 𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 = 1 |V | ℎ ∈V 1 |M ℎ | 𝑡 ∈M ℎ 𝑚 𝑖 H 𝐿 𝑡 W 𝑖 𝑟 − x 𝑖 𝑡 2 2 ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where M ℎ denotes the set of masked nodes in I ℎ , H 𝐿 𝑡 denotes the representation of 𝑡 in H 𝐿 , and W 𝑖 𝑟 is the weight matrix for the 𝑖-th modality information reconstruction.</p><p>The model parameters of PMGT can be learned by minimizing the combined objective function,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">L 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 + 𝜆L 𝑓 𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 . (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">)</formula><p>The entire framework can be effectively trained by the end-to-end backpropagation algorithm. To make the training of the model more stable, a mini-batch of nodes are randomly sampled to update the model. When applying the pre-trained PMGT model in downstream tasks, the learned node representations can be either fed into the new tasks directly or with necessary adjustment (e.g., fine-tuning).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">EXPERIMENTS 4.1 Experimental Settings</head><p>4.1.1 Experimental Datasets. The experiments are performed on the Amazon review dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and Movielens-20M dataset<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . Amazon Datasets. We choose the following 5-score review subsets of the Amazon review dataset for experiments, i.e., "Video Games", "Toys and Games", and "Tools and Home Improvement" (respectively denoted by VG, TG, and THI). The metadata of a product includes its text description and the URL of its image <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> , which are used to extract the textual and visual features of the product respectively. In the experiments, we use the rating data generated before 2015-01-01 for building the product graph, and the rating data generated since 2015-01-01 for studying the performance of the item recommendation and CTR prediction tasks. In these two downstream tasks, we convert all the observed review ratings to be positive interactions and filter out the products that are not included in the product graph. Moreover, we build the product graph based on users' review behaviors. Let 𝑟 ℎ𝑡 denotes the number of users who have commonly reviewed the two products ℎ and 𝑡. If 𝑟 ℎ𝑡 ≥ 3, we connect the two products ℎ and 𝑡 in the graph. In the graph, there inevitably exist some popular nodes with large degrees. This usually causes that the popular nodes with large degrees are more likely to be sampled in the contextual neighbors sampling procedure. To alleviate this problem, we define the edge weight based on the vertex degrees of an edge. Empirically, we define the weight 𝜔 ℎ𝑡 of the edge 𝑒 ℎ𝑡 between the nodes ℎ and 𝑡 as follows,</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">𝜔 ℎ𝑡 = log(𝑟 ℎ𝑡 ) + 1 log( 𝑑 ℎ * 𝑑 𝑡 ) + 1 ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where 𝑑 ℎ and 𝑑 𝑡 denote the degrees of the nodes (i.e., products) ℎ and 𝑡 in the graph, respectively. The operation of log(•) alleviates the problem of large variance of edge weights in the product graph. By inversely proportional to the degrees of nodes ℎ ad 𝑡, we reduce the weights of popular nodes. Movielens-20M Dataset. For the Movielens-20M dataset (denoted by ML), we construct the movie graph based on the tags of movies. The tags of a movie are obtained from the MovieLens Tag Genome Dataset <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> , which includes 11 million computed tag-movie relevance scores from a pool of 1,100 tags applied to 10,000 movies. For each movie, we only keep the tags with relevance scores larger than 0.9. Then, we use 𝑟 ℎ𝑡 to denote the number of common tags two movies ℎ and 𝑡 have. If 𝑟 ℎ𝑡 ≥ 3, we construct an edge between the two movies ℎ and 𝑡, and the weight 𝜔 ℎ𝑡 of the edge 𝑒 ℎ𝑡 between two nodes ℎ and 𝑡 is defined following Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">13</ref>). We collect the movie trailers from Youtube and extract keyframes for each movie trailer. These keyframes are used as the movie images for extracting the visual modality of a movie. The movie descriptions are collected from TMDB <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> . In addition, the rating data generated since 2008-01-01 are used to evaluate the performance of item recommendation and CTR prediction tasks, where we keep ratings larger than 3 as positive interactions. Multimodal Feature Extraction. In the experiments, we use the pre-trained Inception-v4 network <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> to extract the visual features of each image. Then, we average the visual features of all the images of an item (i.e., product or movie) to obtain its visual modality. For the text description of an item, we utilize the pre-trained BERT model <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> to extract the features of each sentence. Then, we average the features of all the sentences in the description of an item to obtain its textual modality. Empirically, we set the length of the sentence to 128. For the ML dataset, we separate the audio track from the movie trailer with FFmpeg<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref> and adopt VGGish <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> to obtain the acoustic modality of the movie. The dimensionality of the visual, textual, and acoustic modalities are 1,536, 768, and 128, respectively. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> summarizes the statistics of these experimental datasets used for item recommendation and CTR prediction tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Setup and Metrics.</head><p>After the data pre-processing in Section 4.1.1, an item multimodal graph G is built, and a set of user-item interactions D 𝑑𝑜𝑤𝑛 is prepared for studying downstream tasks.</p><p>In the pre-training task, we randomly keep 90% of nodes and their relationships in G to pre-train the item representations. The remaining 10% of nodes (denoted by V 𝑣𝑎𝑙 ) are used to construct the validation data for choosing the hyper-parameters of different pre-training models. For each node 𝑡 in V 𝑣𝑎𝑙 , we randomly sample a node 𝑡 + from its one-hop neighbors in G, and use the pair (𝑡, 𝑡 + ) as a positive example in validation data. And we also randomly sample a node 𝑡 − that is not connected with 𝑡 in G, and use the pair (𝑡, 𝑡 − ) as a negative example in validation data. The model parameters are chosen based on the AUC (i.e., Area under the ROC Curve) computed on all the validation data.</p><p>For downstream tasks, we choose Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> as the base model for item recommendation task, and Deep &amp; Cross Network (DCN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> as the base model for CTR prediction task. For item recommendation task, we randomly select 80% of the interactions in D 𝑑𝑜𝑤𝑛 as training data to update the NCF model, and the remaining 20% of interactions in D 𝑑𝑜𝑤𝑛 are used for testing. Moreover, we also randomly hold out 10% of the training data for tuning the hyper-parameters of NCF. In the training of NCF, for each positive interaction pair, we randomly sample one item that has no interactions with the user as negative feedback to update the model. The item recommendation performances achieved by NCF are evaluated by Recall@10, Recall@20, NDCG@10, and NDCG@20 (respectively denote by REC-R@10, REC-R@20, REC-N@10, and REC-N@20). To improve the evaluation efficiency, we randomly sample 1000 items that the testing user has not interacted with to compute the recall and NDCG. For CTR prediction task, we use D 𝑑𝑜𝑤𝑛 to simulate the CTR data. For each possible user-item pair in D 𝑑𝑜𝑤𝑛 , we randomly sample 5 items that have no interactions  <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and AliGraph <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> frameworks. Adam <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> is used as the optimizer for learning model parameters, and the learning rate is chosen from {10 −4 , 10 −3 , 10 −2 }.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Performance Comparison</head><p>After pre-training on the item graph, we use the pre-trained item representations to initialize the item embeddings in the downstream tasks. Then, we train the NCF and DCN models and fine-tune the item embeddings based on the user-item interaction data. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> summarizes the performances of NCF and DCN initialized with item representations pre-trained by different methods. We make the following observations. Compared with the random initialization, initializing the base models with pre-trained item representations usually achieves better item recommendation and CTR prediction performances. This demonstrates the pre-training strategies can benefit downstream tasks in recommendation scenarios. The deep pre-training methods GRAPH-BERT, GPT-GNN, and PMGT usually outperform other shallow pre-training methods, by employing GNN to aggregate the neighbor information, and using node feature reconstruction and graph structure reconstruction tasks to pretrain the model. Moreover, PMGT usually achieves the best item recommendation and CTR prediction performances on all datasets. This demonstrates the effectiveness of PMGT in exploiting the item graph structure and item features. In addition, we can also note that PMGT achieves smaller improvements on the ML dataset. One potential reason is that the interaction data of the ML dataset are denser. Thus, with the random initialization, the base models can learn sufficiently good item representations for downstream tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Ablation Study</head><p>We also study the effectiveness of PMGT in exploiting different modality information. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, we can note that the original methods considering multimodality information usually   outperform the variants that only consider single modality information. This observation is as expected. It indicates that representing items with multimodality information can achieve better performance. PMGT is superior to GRAPH-BERT and GPT-GNN with considering single modality information in most scenarios. This observation again demonstrates that PMGT is more effective in capturing different types of modality information than baseline methods. Moreover, we also study the effectiveness of the two graph reconstruction tasks in learning node representations. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> summarizes the performances of PMGT variants on the TG and ML datasets. We can note that the original PMGT model with two tasks consistently outperforms the variants using a single task as the pre-training objective. This indicates that both the graph structure reconstruction task and the masked node feature reconstruction task are essential for learning useful node representations to benefit downstream tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Parameter Sensitivity Study</head><p>In this section, we study the performances of PMGT with respect to (w.r.t.) different settings of three important hyper-parameters. Firstly, we vary the number of Transformer layers 𝐿 from 1 to 5. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5a</ref>, the best item recommendation and CTR prediction performances are achieved by setting 𝐿 to 3 and 2, respectively. Further stacking more layers does not help improve the performances of downstream tasks. Moreover, we vary the weight of the diversity-promoting attention score 𝛽 in {0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0}. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5b</ref>, the recommendation accuracy can be improved by considering diversity-promoting attention in the Transformer-based encoder, when 𝛽 is set to 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0. This indicates it is important to consider the diversity of contextual neighbors when learning the node representations. Moreover, we also note that the best performances of both downstream tasks are achieved by setting 𝛽 to 1.0. However, more experiments are needed to study whether this is a general observation on different datasets.</p><p>In the current implementation, we keep 𝛽 to enable the flexibility of PMGT. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5c</ref> summarizes the performances of PMGT w.r.t. different settings of the number of contextual neighbors 𝑆. We observe that PMGT usually achieves good performances by setting 𝑆 to a small value (e.g., 5 and 10). This indicates that a small number of contextual neighbors can capture the important neighborhood information of a node. Further increase of 𝑆 tends to include noise information, thus may not help improve the model performances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Convergence Speed Study</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> shows the convergence speed of the training losses of both NCF and DCN models on the TG dataset. We initialize the item embeddings in the NCF and DCN models by the following strategies: 1) random initialization, 2) initializing using the representations pre-trained by GRAPH-BERT, 3) initializing using the representations pre-trained by GPT-GNN, and 4) initializing using the representations pre-trained by PMGT. We can make the following observations. Compared with the random initialization, initializing item embeddings with the pre-trained representations achieves faster convergence speed. This once again demonstrates the effectiveness of the pre-training strategies. Moreover, both NCF and DCN models achieve the fastest convergence speed by using pre-trained representations by PMGT. The pre-trained PMGT model gives the downstream model a good initial state, thus can help the downstream model achieves faster and earlier convergence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CASE STUDY IN ONLINE PLATFORM</head><p>A case study is conducted in the video recommendation scenario of one of the world's largest E-commerce platforms. The video graph is built based on users' watching behaviors. Let 𝑟 ℎ𝑡 denote the number of users who have watched the videos ℎ and 𝑡 within one hour. If 𝑟 ℎ𝑡 ≥ 10, we build an edge between the nodes ℎ and 𝑡 in the video graph. The weight of the edge 𝑒 ℎ𝑡 between ℎ and 𝑡 is defined following Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">13</ref>). Finally, there are about 4 million nodes and 500 millions of edges in the video graph used for this case study. Given the pre-trained video representations by PMGT, for a user, we retrieve 50 most similar videos for each video she has watched, based on the Cosine similarity between the video representations. Then, ItemKNN is used to rank and recommend the retrieved videos to the user.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>This paper proposes a novel pre-training GNN framework, named PMGT (i.e., Pre-trained Multimodal Graph Transformer), which exploits items' multimodal information guided by the unsupervised learning tasks on graph. Two graph reconstruction tasks, i.e., graph structure reconstruction and masked node feature reconstruction, are used as learning objectives to pre-train the model. The learned representation of an item not only integrates the multimodal information of the item itself but also aggregates the information of its contextual neighbors in the graph. The superiority of PMGT has been validated by two downstream tasks (i.e., item recommendation and CTR prediction) on real datasets. In this work, we focus on the homogeneous graph of items. For future work, we would like to investigate how to extend the proposed model to process the heterogeneous item graph.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: An example about item multimodal graph.
