<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>A S has been observed by many authors, the storage and retrieval of digital information is a special case of digital communications. To quote E. R. Berlekamp <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>: Communication links transmit information from here to there. Computer memories transmit information from now to then. Thus as information theory provides the theoretical underpinnings for digital communications, it also serves as the foundation for understanding fundamental limits on reliable digital data recording, as measured in terms of data rate and storage density.</p><p>A block diagram which depicts the various steps in recording and recovering data in a storage system is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. This "Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>" is essentially the same as the well-known Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> used by Shannon in his classic paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[173]</ref> to describe a general communication system, but with the configuration of codes more explicitly shown.</p><p>As in many digital communication systems, a concatenated approach to channel coding has been adopted in data recording, consisting of an algebraic error-correcting code in cascade with a modulation code. The inner modulation code, which is the focus of this paper, serves the general function of matching the recorded signals to the physical channel and to the signal-processing techniques used in data retrieval, while the outer error-correction code is designed to remove any errors remaining after the detection and demodulation process. (See <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> in this issue for a survey of applications of error-control coding.)</p><p>As we will discuss in more detail in the next section, a recording channel can be modeled, at a high level, as a linear, intersymbol-interference (ISI) channel with additive Gaussian noise, subject to a binary input constraint. The combination of the ISI and the binary input restriction has presented a challenge in the information-theoretic performance analysis of recording channels, and it has also limited the applicability of the coding and modulation techniques that have been overwhelmingly successful in communication over linear Gaussian channels. (See <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> in this issue for a comprehensive discussion of these methods.)</p><p>The development of signal processing and coding techniques for recording channels has taken place in an environment of escalating demand for higher data transfer rates and storage capacity-magnetic disk drives for personal computers today operate at astonishing data rates on the order of 240 million bits per second and store information at densities of up to 3 billion bits per square inch-coupled with increasingly severe constraints on hardware complexity and cost.</p><p>The needs of the data storage industry have not only fostered innovation in practical code design, but have also spurred the development of a rigorous mathematical foundation for the theory and implementation of constrained codes. They have also stimulated advances in the information-theoretic analysis of input-constrained, noisy channels.</p><p>In this paper, we review the progress made during the past 50 years in the theory and practical design of constrained modulation codes for digital data recording. Along the way, we will highlight the fact that, although Shannon did not mention storage in his classic two-part paper whose golden anniversary we celebrate in this issue-indeed random-access storage as we know it today did not exist at the time-a large number of fundamental results and techniques relevant to coding for storage were introduced in his seminal publication. We will also survey emerging directions in data-storage technology, and discuss new challenges in information theory that they offer.</p><p>The outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows.</p><p>In Section II, we present background on magnetic-recording channels. Section II-A gives a basic description of the physical recording process and the resulting signal and noise characteristics. In Section II-B, we discuss mathematical models that capture essential features of the recording channel and we review information-theoretic bounds on the capacity of these models. In Section II-C, we describe the signal-processing and -detection techniques that have been most widely used in commercial digital-recording systems.</p><p>In Section III-A, we introduce the input-constrained, (noiseless) recording channel model, and we examine certain timedomain and frequency-domain constraints that the channel input sequences must satisfy to ensure successful implementation of the data-detection process. In Section III-B, we review Shannon's theory of input-constrained noiseless channels, including the definition and computation of capacity, the determination of the maxentropic sequence measure, and the fundamental coding theorem for discrete noiseless channels.</p><p>In Section IV, we discuss the problem of designing efficient, invertible encoders for input-constrained channels. As in the case of coding for noisy communication channels, this is a subject about which Shannon had little to say. We will summarize the substantial theoretical and practical progress that has been made in constrained modulation code design.</p><p>In Section V, we present coded-modulation techniques that have been developed to improve the performance of noisy recording channels. In particular, we discuss families of distance-enhancing constrained codes that are intended for use with partial-response equalization and various types of sequence detection, and we compare their performance to estimates of the noisy channel capacity.</p><p>In Section VI, we give a compendium of modulation-code constraints that have been used in digital recorders, describing in more detail their time-domain, frequency-domain, and statistical properties.</p><p>In Section VII, we indicate several directions for future research in coding for digital recording. In particular, we consider the incorporation of improved channel models into the design and performance evaluation of modulation codes, as well as the invention of new coding techniques for exploratory information storage technologies, such as nonsaturation recording using multilevel signals, multitrack recording and detection, and multidimensional page-oriented storage.</p><p>Finally, in Section VIII, we close the paper with a discussion of Shannon's intriguing, though somewhat cryptic, remarks pertaining to the existence of crossword puzzles, and make some observations about their relevance to coding for multidimensional constrained recording channels.</p><p>Section IX briefly summarizes the objectives and contents of the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. BACKGROUND ON DIGITAL RECORDING</head><p>The history of signal processing in digital recording systems can be cleanly broken into two epochs. From 1956 until approximately 1990, direct-access storage devices relied upon "analog" detection methods, most notably peak detection. Beginning in 1990, the storage industry made a dramatic shift to "digital" techniques, based upon partial-response equalization and maximum-likelihood sequence detection, an approach that had been proposed 20 years earlier by Kobayashi and Tang <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[130]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[131]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[133]</ref>. To understand how these signalprocessing methods arose, we review a few basic facts about the physical process underlying digital magnetic recording. (Readers interested in the corresponding background on optical recording may refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[84]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[102,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ch. 2]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[163]</ref>.) We distill from the physics several mathematical models of the recording channel, and describe upper and lower bounds on their capacity. We then present in more detail the analog and digital detection approaches, and we compare them to the optimal detector for the uncoded channel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Digital Recording Basics</head><p>The magnetic material contained on a magnetic disk or tape can be thought of as being made up of a collection of discrete magnetic particles or domains which can be magnetized by a write head in one of two directions. In present systems, digital information is stored along paths, called tracks, in this magnetic medium. We store binary digits on a track by magnetizing these particles or domains in one of two directions. This method is known as "saturation" recording. The stored binary digits usually are referred to as "channel bits." Note that the word "bit" is used here as a contraction of the words "binary digit" and not as a measure of information. In fact, we will see that when coding is introduced, each channel bit represents only a fraction of a bit of user information. The modifier "channel" in "channel bits" emphasizes this difference. We will assume a synchronous storage system where the channel bits occur at the fixed rate of channel bits per second. Thus is the duration of a channel bit. In all magneticstorage systems used today, the magnetic medium and the read/write transducer (referred to as the read/write head) move with respect to each other. If the relative velocity of a track and the read/write head is constant, the constant time-duration of the bit translates to a constant linear channel-bit density, reflected in the length corresponding to a channel bit along the track.</p><p>The normalized input signal applied to the recording transducer (write head) in this process can be thought of as a two-level waveform which assumes the values and over consecutive time intervals of duration</p><p>In the waveform, the transitions from one level to another, which effectively carry the digital information, are therefore constrained to occur at integer multiples of the time period , and we can describe the waveform digitally as a sequence over the bipolar alphabet where is the signal amplitude in the time interval</p><p>In the simplest model, the input-output relationship of the digital magnetic recording channel can be viewed as linear. Denote by the output signal (readback voltage), in the absence of noise, corresponding to a single transition from, say, to at time Then, the output signal generated by the waveform represented by the sequence is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> with Note that the "derivative" sequence of coefficients consists of elements taken from the ternary alphabet and the nonzero values, corresponding to the transitions in the input signal, alternate in sign.</p><p>A frequently used model for the transition response is the function often referred to as the Lorentzian model for an isolated-step response. The parameter is sometimes denoted , an abbreviation for "pulsewidth at 50% maximum amplitude," the width of the pulse measured at 50% of its maximum height. The Lorentzian step response with is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>The output signal is therefore the linear superposition of time-shifted Lorentzian pulses with coefficients of magnitude equal to and alternating polarity. For this channel, sometimes called the differentiated Lorentzian channel, the frequency response is where</p><p>The magnitude of the frequency response with is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The simplest model for channel noise assumes that the noise is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). That is, the readback signal takes the form where and for all There are, of course, far more accurate and sophisticated models of a magnetic-recording system. These models take into account the failure of linear superposition, asymmetries in the positive and negative step responses, and other nonlinear phenomena in the readback process. There are also advanced models for media noise, incorporating the effects of material defects, thermal asperities, data dependence, and adjacent track interference. For more information on these, we direct the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Channel Models and Capacity</head><p>The most basic model of a saturation magnetic-recording system is a binary-input, linear, intersymbol-interference (ISI) channel with AWGN, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>.</p><p>This model has been, and continues to be, widely used in comparing the theoretical performance of competing modulation, coding, and signal-processing systems. During the past  decade, there has been considerable research effort devoted to finding the capacity of this channel. Much of this work was motivated by the growing interest in digital recording among the information and communication theory communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. In this section, we survey some of the results pertaining to this problem. As the reader will observe, the analysis is limited to rather elementary channel models; the extension to more advanced channel models represents a major open research problem.</p><p>1) Continuous-Time Channel Models: Many of the bounds we cite were first developed for the ideal, low-pass filter channel model. These are then adapted to the more realistic differentiated Lorentzian ISI model.</p><p>For a given channel, let denote the capacity with a constraint on the average input power. Let denote the capacity with a peak power constraint Finally, let denote the capacity with binary input levels It is clear that</p><p>The following important result, due to Ozarow, Wyner, and Ziv <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[159]</ref>, states that the first inequality is, in fact, an equality under very general conditions on the channel ISI.</p><p>Peak-Power Achievable Rate Lemma: For the channel shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, if is square integrable, then any rate achievable using waveforms satifying is achievable using the constrained waveforms We now exploit this result to develop upper and lower bounds on the capacity Consider, first, a continuous-time, bandlimited, additive Gaussian noise channel with transfer function if otherwise.</p><p>Assume that the noise has (double-sided) spectral density Let be the total noise power in the channel bandwidth. Shannon established the well-known and celebrated formula for the capacity of this channel, under the assumption of an average power constraint on the channel input signals. We quote from <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[173]</ref>:</p><p>Theorem 17: The capacity of a channel of band perturbed by white thermal noise of power when the average transmitter power is limited to is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> (We have substituted the notation for Shannon's notation to avoid confusion.)</p><p>This result is a special case of the more general "waterfilling" theorem for the capacity of an average input-power constrained channel with transfer function and noise power spectral density <ref type="bibr">[74, p. 388]</ref> where denotes the range of frequencies in which and satisfies the equation By the peak-power achievable rate lemma, this result provides an upper bound on the capacity of the recording channel. Applications of this bound to a parameterized channel model are presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>.</p><p>An improved upper bound on the capacity of the low-pass AWGN channel was developed by Shamai and Bar-David <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[171]</ref>. This bound is a refinement of the waterfilling upper bound, based upon a characterization of the power spectral density of any unit process, meaning a zero-mean, stationary, two-level continuous-time random process <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[175]</ref>. For a specified input-power spectral density , a Gaussian input distribution maximizes the capacity. Therefore, for a given channel transfer function where and the supremum is taken over all unit process power spectral densities. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[171]</ref>, an approximate solution to this optimization problem for the ideal low-pass filter was used to prove that peak-power limiting on the bandlimited channel does indeed reduce capacity relative to the average-power constrained channel. This bounding technique was applied to the differentiated Lorentzian channel with additive colored Gaussian noise in <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">[207]</ref>.</p><p>We now consider lower bounds to the capacity Shannon <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[173]</ref> considered the capacity of a peak-power input constraint on the ideal bandlimited AWGN channel, noting that "a constraint of this type does not work out as well mathematically as the average power limitation." Nevertheless, he provided a lower bound, quoted below: Theorem 20: The channel capacity for a band perturbed by white thermal noise of power is bounded by where is the peak allowed transmitter power (We have substituted the notation for Shannon's notation to avoid confusion.)</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[159]</ref>, the peak-power achievable rate lemma was used to derive a lower bound on for the ideal, binary-input constrained, bandlimited channel nats/s A lower bound for the more accurate channel model comprising a cascade of a differentiator and ideal low-pass filter was also determined. For this channel, it was shown that nats/s In both cases, the discrepancy between the lower bounds and the water-filling upper bounds represents an effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) difference of or about 7.6 dB at high signal-to-noise ratios.</p><p>Heegard and Ozarow <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[83]</ref> incorporated the differentiated Lorentzian channel model into a similar analysis. To obtain a lower bound, they optimize, with respect to , the inequality where is the pulse power spectral density for the differentiated Lorentzian channel with Their results indicate that, just as for the low-pass channel and the differentiated low-pass channel, the difference in effective signal-to-noise ratios between upper and lower bounds on capacity is approximately , for large signal-to-noise ratios. The corresponding bound for the differentiated Lorentzian channel with additive colored Gaussian noise was determined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">[207]</ref>.</p><p>Shamai and Bar-David <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[171]</ref> developed an improved lower bound on by analyzing the achievable rate of a random telegraph wave, that is, a unit process with time intervals between transitions independently governed by an exponential distribution. Again, the corresponding bound for the differentiated Lorentzian channel with additive colored Gaussian noise was discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">[207]</ref>. Bounds on capacity for a model incorporating slope-limitations on the magnetization are addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Computational results for the differentiated Lorentzian channel with additive colored Gaussian noise are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">[207]</ref>. For channel densities in the range of -, which corresponds to channel densities of current practical interest, the required SNR for arbitrarily low error rate was calculated. The gap between the best capacity bounds, namely, the unit process upper bound and the random telegraph wave lower bound, was found to be approximately 3 dB throughout the range.</p><p>2) Discrete-Time Channel Models The capacity of discretetime channel models applicable to digital recording has been addressed by several authors, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[193]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[88]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[87]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[172]</ref>. The capacity of an average input-powerconstrained, discrete-time, memoryless channel with additive, independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise is given by the well-known formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> where is the noise variance and is the average inputpower constraint. This result is the discrete-time equivalent to Shannon's formula (2) via the sampling theorem. Smith <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[180]</ref> showed that the capacity of an amplitude-constrained, discrete-time, memoryless Gaussian channel is achieved by a finite-valued random variable, representing the input to the channel, whose distribution is uniquely determined by the input constraint. (Note that, unlike the case of an average input-power constraint, this result cannot be directly translated to the continuous-time model.)</p><p>Shamai, Ozarow, and Wyner <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[172]</ref> established upper and lower bounds on the capacity of the discrete-time Gaussian channel with ISI and stationary inputs. We will encounter in the next section a discrete-time ISI model of the magneticrecording channel of the form , for For the channel decomposes into a pair of interleaved "dicode" channels corresponding to In <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[172]</ref>, the capacity upper bound was compared to upper and lower bounds on the maximum achievable information rate for the normalized dicode channel model with system polynomial , and input levels These upper and lower bounds are given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> and respectively, where is the capacity of a binary input-constrained, memoryless Gaussian channel. Thus the upper bound on is simply the capacity of the latter channel. These upper and lower bounds differ by 3 dB, as was the case for continuous-time channel models.</p><p>For other results on capacity estimates of recording-channel models, we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[149]</ref>. The general problem of computing, or developing improved bounds for, the capacity of discrete-time ISI models of recording channels remains a significant challenge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Detectors for Uncoded Channels</head><p>Forney <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> derived the optimal sequence detector for an uncoded, linear, intersymbol-interference channel with additive white Gaussian noise. This detection method, the well-known maximum-likelihood sequence detector (MLSD), comprises a whitened matched filter, whose output is sampled at the symbol rate, followed by a Viterbi detector whose trellis structure reflects the memory of the ISI channel. For the differentiated Lorentzian channel model, as for many communication channel models, this detector structure would be prohibitively complex to implement, requiring an unbounded number of states in the Viterbi detector. Consequently, suboptimal detection techniques have been implemented. As mentioned at the start of this section, most storage devices did not even utilize sampled detection methods until the start of this decade, relying upon equalization to mitigate effects of ISI, coupled with analog symbol-by-symbol detection of waveform features such as peak positions and amplitudes. Since the introduction of digital signal-processing techniques in recording systems, partial-response equalization and Viterbi detection have been widely adopted. They represent a practical compromise between implementability and optimality, with respect to the MLSD. We now briefly summarize the main features of these detection methods.</p><p>1) Peak Detection: The channel model described above is accurate at relatively low linear densities (say and where the noise is generated primarily in the readback electronics. Provided that the density of transitions and the noise variance are small enough, the locations of peaks in the output signal will closely correspond to the locations of the transitions in the recorded input signal. With a synchronous clock of period , one could then, in principle, reconstruct the ternary sequence and the recorded bipolar sequence The detection method used to implement this process in the potentially noisy digital recording device is known as peak detection and it operates roughly as follows. The peak detector differentiates the rectified readback signal, and determines the time intervals in which zero crossings occur. In parallel, the amplitude of each corresponding extremal point in the rectified signal is compared to a prespecified threshold, and if the threshold is not exceeded, the corresponding zero crossing is ignored. This ensures that low-amplitude, spurious peaks due to noise will be excluded from consideration. Those intervals in which the threshold is exceeded are designated as having a peak. The two-level recorded sequence is then reconstructed, with a transition in polarity corresponding to each interval containing a detected peak. Clock accuracy is maintained by an adaptive timing recovery circuit-known as a phase-lock loop (PLL)-which adjusts the clock frequency and phase to ensure that the amplitude-qualified zero crossings occur, on average, in the center of their respective clock intervals.</p><p>2) PRML: Current high-density recording systems use a technique referred to as PRML, an acronym for "partialresponse (PR) equalization with maximum-likelihood (ML) sequence detection." We now briefly review the essence of this technique in order to motivate the use of constrained modulation codes in PRML systems.</p><p>Kobayashi and Tang <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[133]</ref> proposed a digital communications approach to handling intersymbol interference in digital magnetic recording. In contrast to peak detection, their method reconstructed the recorded sequence from sample values of a suitably equalized readback signal, with the samples measured at time instants At channel bit densities corresponding to , the transfer characteristics of the Lorentzian model of the saturation recording channel (with a time shift of ) closely resemble those of a linear filter with step response given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> where Note that at the consecutive sample times and , the function has the value , while at all other times which are multiples of , the value is . Through linear superposition (1), the output signal generated by the waveform represented by the bipolar sequence is given by which can be rewritten as where we set</p><p>The transition response results in controlled intersymbol interference at sample times, leading to output-signal samples that, in the absence of noise, assume values in the set Thus in the noiseless case, we can recover the recorded bipolar sequence from the output sample values , because the interference between adjacent transitions is prescribed. In contrast to the peak detection method, this approach does not require the separation of transitions.</p><p>Sampling provides a discrete-time version of this recordingchannel model. Setting , the input-output relationship is given by In -transform notation, whereby a sequence is represented by the input-output relationship becomes where the channel transfer function satisfies</p><p>This represention, called a partial-response channel model, is among those given a designation by Kretzmer <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[134]</ref> and tabulated by Kabal and Pasupathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[117]</ref>. The label assigned to it-"Class-4"-continues to be used in its designation, and the model is sometimes denoted "PR4."</p><p>For higher channel bit densities, Thapar and Patel <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[190]</ref> introduced a general class of partial-response models, with step-response functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> The corresponding input-output relationship takes the form where the discrete-time impulse response has the form where The frequency response corresponding to has a first-order null at zero frequency and a null of order at the Nyquist frequency, one-half the symbol frequency. Clearly, the PR4 model corresponds to The channel models with are usually referred to as "extended Class-4" models, and denoted by E PR4. The PR4, EPR4, and E PR4 models are used in the design of most magnetic disk drives today.</p><p>Models proposed for use in optical-recording systems have discrete-time impulse responses of the form where These models reflect the nonzero DC-response characteristic of some optical-recording systems, as well as their high-frequency attenuation. The models corresponding to and were also tabulated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[117]</ref>, and are known as Class-1 (PR1) or "duobinary," and Class-2 (PR2), respectively.

The trellis structure for the E PR4 channel has states. In the case of the PR4 channel, the input-output relationship permits the detector to operate independently on the output subsequences at even and odd time indices.

Specifically, in order to reduce the effects of pulse interference, one can demand that the derivative sequence of the channel input contain some minimum number, say , of symbols of value zero between consecutive nonzero values. Similarly, to prevent loss of clock synchronization, one can require that there be no more than some maximum number, say , of symbols of value zero between consecutive nonzero values in</p><p>In this context, we mention that two conventions are used to map a binary sequence to the magnetization pattern along a track, or equivalently, to the two-level sequence</p><p>In one convention, called nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ), one direction of magnetization (or ) corresponds to a stored and the other direction of magnetization (or ) corresponds to a stored .

It is easy to see that and, therefore, Thus under the NRZI precoding convention, the constraints on the runlengths of consecutive zero symbols in are reflected in corresponding constraints on the binary information sequences</p><p>The set of sequences satisfying this constraint can be generated by reading the labels off of the paths in the directed graph shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>.</p><p>2) Constraints for PRML Channels: Two issues arise in the implementation of PRML systems that are related to properties of the recorded sequences. The first issue is that, just as in peak detection systems, long runs of zero samples in the PR channel output can degrade the performance of the timing recovery and gain control loops. This dictates the use of a global constraint on the number of consecutive zero samples, analogous to the constraint described above.</p><p>The second issue arises from a property of the PR systems known as quasicatastrophic error propagation <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. This refers to the fact that certain bi-infinite PR channel output sequences are represented by more than one path in the detector trellis. Such a sequence is produced by at least two distinct channel input sequences. For the PR channels under consideration, namely, those with transfer polynomial , the difference sequences , corresponding to pairs of such input sequences and , are easily characterized. (For convenience, the symbols and are denoted by and , respectively, in these difference sequences.) Specifically, if and , then these difference sequences are and If and , the difference sequences are of the form and Finally, if and , then they are and As a consequence of the existence of these sequences, there could be a potentially unbounded delay in the merging of survivor paths in the Viterbi detection process beyond any specified time index , even in the absence of noise. It is therefore desirable to constrain the channel input sequences in such a way that these difference sequences are forbidden. This property makes it possible to limit the detector path memory, and therefore the decoding delay, without incurring any significant degradation in the sequence estimates produced by the detector.</p><p>In the case of PR4, this has been accomplished by limiting the length of runs of identical channel inputs in each of the even and odd interleaves, or, equivalently, the length of runs of zero samples in each interleave at the channel output, to be no more than a specified positive integer By incorporating interleaved NRZI (INRZI) precoding, the and constraints on output sequences translate into and constraints on binary input sequences The resulting constraints are denoted</p><p>, where the " " may be interpreted as a constraint, emphasizing the point that intersymbol interference is acceptable in PRML systems. It should be noted that the combination of constraints and an INRZI precoder have been used to prevent quasicatastrophic error propagation in EPR4 channels, as well.</p><p>3) Spectral-Null Constraints: The family of runlength-limited constraints and PRML constraints are representative of constraints whose description is essentially in the time domain (although the constraints certainly have implications for frequency-domain characteristics of the constrained sequences). There are other constraints whose formulation is most natural in the frequency domain. One such constraint specifies that the recorded sequences have no spectral content at a particular frequence ; that is, the average power spectral density function of the sequences has value zero at the specified frequency. The sequences are said to have a spectral null at frequency For an ensemble of sequences, with symbols drawn from the bipolar alphabet and generated by a finite labeled directed graph of the kind illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, a necessary and sufficient condition for a spectral null at frequency , where is the duration of a single recorded symbol, is that there exist a constant such that <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> for all recorded sequences and <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[145]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[162]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">[209]</ref>. In digital recording, the spectral null constraints of most importance have been those that prescribe a spectral null at or DC. The sequences are said to be DC-free or charge-constrained. The concept of running digital sum (RDS) of a sequence plays a significant role in the description and analysis of DC-free sequences. For a bipolar sequence , the RDS of a subsequence , denoted RDS is defined as RDS From (6), we see that the spectral density of the sequences vanishes at if and only if the RDS values for all sequences are bounded in magnitude by some constant integer For sequences that assume a range of consecutive RDS values, we say that their digital sum variation (DSV) is Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> shows a graph describing the bipolar, DC-free system with DSV equal to DC-free sequences have found widespread application in optical and magnetic recording systems. In magnetic-tape systems with rotary-type recording heads, such as the R-DAT digital audio tape system, they prevent write-signal distortion that can arise from transformer-coupling in the write electronics. In optical-recording systems, they reduce interference between data and servo signals, and also permit filtering of low-frequency noise stemming from smudges on the disk surface. It should be noted that the application of DCfree constraints has certainly not been confined to data storage. Since the early days of digital communication by means of cable, DC-free codes have been employed to counter the effects of low-frequency cutoff due to coupling components, isolating transformers, and other possible system impairments <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>Sequences with a spectral null at also play an important role in digital recording. These sequences are often referred to as Nyquist free. There is in fact a close relationship between Nyquist-free and DC-free sequences. Specifically, consider sequences over the bipolar alphabet If is DC-free, then the sequence defined by is Nyquist-free. DC/Nyquist-free sequences have spectral nulls at both and Such sequences can always be decomposed into a pair of interleaved DC-free sequences. This fact is exploited in Section V-C in the design of distanceenhancing, DC/Nyquist-free codes for PRML systems.</p><p>In some recording applications, sequences satisfying both charge and runlength constraints have been used. In particular, a sequence in the charge-RLL constraint satisfies the runlength constraint, with the added restriction that the corresponding NRZI bipolar sequence be DCfree with DSV no larger than Codes using and constraints-known, respectively, as "zero-modulation" and "Miller-squared" codes-have found application in commercial tape-recording systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[160]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[139]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[150]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Discrete Noiseless Channels</head><p>In Section III-A, we saw that the successful implementation of analog and digital signal-processing techniques used in data recording may require that the binary channel input sequences satisfy constraints in both the time and the frequency domains.</p><p>Shannon established many of the fundamental properties of noiseless, input-constrained communication channels in Part I of his 1948 paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[173]</ref>. In that section, entitled "Discrete Noiseless Systems," Shannon considered discrete communication channels, such as the teletype or telegraph channel, where the transmitted symbols were of possibly different time duration and satisfied a set of constraints as to the order in which they could occur. We will review his key results and illustrate them using the family of runlength-limited codes, introduced in Section III-A. Shannon first defined the capacity of a discrete noiseless channel as <ref type="bibr">(7)</ref> where is the number of allowed sequences of length The following quote, which provides a method of computing the capacity, is taken directly from Shannon's original paper (equation numbers added): Suppose all sequences of the symbols are allowed and these symbols have durations What is the channel capacity?

Again, quoting from the paper:</p><p>A very general type of restriction which may be placed on allowed sequences is the following: We imagine a number of possible states For each state only certain symbols from the set can be transmitted (different subsets for the different states). When one of these has been transmitted the state changes to a new state depending both on the old state and the particular symbol transmitted.</p><p>Shannon then proceeded to state the following theorem which he proved in an appendix: Theorem 1: Let be the duration of the th symbol which is allowable in state and leads to state Then the channel capacity is equal to where is the largest real root of the determinant equation: <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> where if and is zero otherwise.</p><p>The condition that different states must correspond to different subsets of the transmission alphabet is unnecessarily restrictive.

In the first, we let the be the collection of allowable runs of consecutive 's followed by a , as before.

(The notion of adjacency matrix can be extended to graphs with a multiplicity of distinctly labeled edges connecting pairs of states.) Thus we see that the channel capacity is equal to the logarithm of the largest real eigenvalue of the connection matrix of the constraint graph shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>.</p><p>Shannon proceeded to produce an information source by assigning nonzero probabilities to the symbols leaving each state of the graph. These probabilities can be assigned in any manner subject to the constraint that for each state, the sum of the probabilities for all symbols leaving that state is . Shannon gave formulas as to how to choose these probabilities such that the resulting information source had maximum entropy. He further showed that this maximum entropy is equal to the capacity Specifically, he proved the following theorem.</p><p>Theorem 8: Let the system of constraints considered as a channel have a capacity If we assign where is the duration of the th symbol leading from state to state and the satisfy then is maximized and equal to</p><p>It is an easy matter to apply Shannon's result to find these probabilities for codes.

Thus the maximum entropy is achieved by choosing as the largest real root of this equation and the maximum entropy is equal to the capacity The probabilities of the symbols which result in the maximum entropy are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> (where now the branch labels are the probabilities of the binary symbols and not the symbols themselves).</p><p>The maximum-entropy solution described in the theorem dictates that any sequence of length , starting in state and ending in state , has probability where denotes the probability of state Therefore, This is a special case of the notion of "typical long sequences" again introduced by Shannon in his classic paper.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Encoders and Decoders</head><p>Encoders have the task of translating arbitrary source information into a constrained sequence. In coding practice, typically, the source sequence is partitioned into blocks of length , and under the code rules such blocks are mapped onto words of channel symbols. The rate of such an encoder is To emphasize the blocklengths, we sometimes denote the rate as It is most important that this mapping be done as efficiently as possible subject to certain practical considerations. Efficiency is measured by the ratio of the code rate to the capacity of the constrained channel. A good encoder algorithm realizes a code rate close to the capacity of the constrained sequences, uses a simple implementation, and avoids the propagation of errors in the process of decoding.</p><p>An encoder may be state-dependent, in which case the codeword used to represent a given source block is a function of the channel or encoder state, or the code may be state-independent. State-independence implies that codewords can be freely concatenated without violating the sequence constraints. A set of such codewords is called self-concatenable. When the encoder is state-dependent, it typically takes the form of a synchronous finite-state machine, illustrated schematically in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>.</p><p>A decoder is preferably state-independent. As a result of errors made during transmission, a state-dependent decoder could easily lose track of the encoder state, and begin to make errors, with no guarantee of recovery. In order to avoid error propagation, therefore, a decoder should use a finite observation interval of channel bits for decoding, thus limiting the span in which errors may occur. Such a decoder is called a sliding-block decoder. A sliding-block decoder makes a decision on a received word on the basis of the -bit word itself, as well as preceding -bit words and upcoming -bit words. Essentially, the decoder comprises a register of length -bit words and a logic function that translates the contents of the register into the retrievedbit source word. Since the constants and are finite, an error in the retrieved sequence can propagate in the decoded sequence only for a finite distance, at most the decoder window length. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref> shows a schematic of a sliding-block decoder. An important subclass of sliding-block decoders are the block decoders, which use only a single codeword for reproducing the source word, i.e., Generally speaking, the problem of code design is to construct practical, efficient, finite-state encoders with slidingblock decoders. There are several fundamental questions related to this problem. a) For a rate , what encoder input and output block sizes and , with , are realizable? b) Can a sliding-block decodable encoder always be found? c) Can 100% efficient sliding-block decodable encoders be designed when the capacity is a rational number ? d) Are there good bounds on basic complexity measures pertaining to constrained codes for a given constraint, such as number of encoder states, encoder gate complexity, encoding delay, and sliding-block decoder window length? Many of these questions have been answered fully or in part, as we now describe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Graphs and Constraints</head><p>It is very useful and convenient, when stating code existence results and specifying code construction algorithms, to refer to labeled graph descriptions of constrained sequences. More precisely, a labeled graph (or a finite labeled directed graph) consists of a finite set of states ; a finite set of edges , where each edge has an initial state and a terminal state, both in ; and an edge labeling</p><p>, where is a finite alphabet. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref> shows a "typical" labeled graph.

For a constrained system presented by a labeled graph , it will be very useful to have an explicit description of the words in , decomposed into such nonoverlapping blocks of length Let be a labeled graph. The th power of , denoted , is the labeled graph with the same set of states as , but one edge for each path of length in , labeled by the -block generated by that path.

It is important to note that a given constrained system can be presented by many different labeled graphs and, depending on the context, one presentation will have advantages relative to another. For example, one graph may present the constraint using the smallest possible number of states, while another may serve as the basis for an encoder finite-state machine.</p><p>There are important connections between the theory of constrained coding and other scientific disciplines, including symbolic dynamics, systems theory, and automata theory. Many of the objects, concepts, and results in constrained coding have counterparts in these fields. For example, the set of bi-infinite sequences derived from a constrained system is called a sofic system (or sofic shift) in symbolic dynamics. In systems theory, these sequences correspond to a discretetime, complete, time-invariant system. Similarly, in automata theory, a constrained system is equivalent to a regular language which is recognized by a certain type of automaton <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[94]</ref>. The interrelationships among these various disciplines are discussed in more detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[127]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[142]</ref>.</p><p>The bridge to symbolic dynamics, established in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, has proven to be especially significant, leading to breakthroughs in both the theory and design of constrained codes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Properties of Graph Labelings</head><p>In order to state the coding theorems, as well as for purposes of encoder construction, it will be important to consider labelings with special properties.</p><p>We say that a labeled graph is deterministic if, at each state, the outgoing edges have distinct labels. In other words, at each state, any label generated from that state determines a unique outgoing edge from that state. Constrained systems that play a role in digital recording generally have natural presentations by a deterministic graph. For example, the labeled graphs in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> are both deterministic. It can be shown that any constrained system can be presented by a deterministic graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[144]</ref>. Similarly, a graph is called codeterministic if, for each state, the incoming edges are distinctly labeled. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> is not codeterministic, while Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> is.</p><p>Many algorithms for constructing constrained codes begin with a deterministic presentation of the constrained system and transform it into a presentation which satisfies a weaker version of the deterministic property called finite anticipation. A labeled graph is said to have finite anticipation if there is an integer such that any two paths of length with the same initial state and labeling must have the same initial edge. The anticipation of refers to the smallest for which this condition holds. Similarly, we define the coanticipation of a labeled graph as the anticipation of the labeled graph obtained by reversing the directions of the edges in A labeled graph has finite memory if there is an integer such that the paths in of length that generate the same word all terminate at the same state. The smallest for which this holds is called the memory of and is denoted A property related to finite anticipation is that of being -definite. A labeled graph has this property if, given any word , the set of paths that generate all agree in the edge A graph with this property is sometimes said to have finite memory-and-anticipation. Note that, whereas the definition of finite anticipation involves knowledge of an initial state, the -definite property replaces that with knowledge of a finite amount of memory.</p><p>Finally, as mentioned in Section III, a labeled graph is lossless if any two distinct paths with the same initial state and terminal state have different labelings.</p><p>The graph in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> has finite memory , and it is definite because, for any given word of length at least , all paths that generate end with the same edge.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Finite-Type and Almost-Finite-Type Constraints</head><p>There are some special classes of constraints, called finitetype and almost-finite type, that play an important role in the theory and construction of constrained codes. A constrained system is finite-type (a term derived from symbolic dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[138]</ref>) if it can be presented by a definite graph. Thus the -RLL constraint is finite-type. There is also a useful intrinsic characterization of finite-type constraints: there is an integer such that, for any symbol and any word of length at least , we have if and only if where is the suffix of of length</p><p>The smallest such integer , if any, is called the memory of and is denoted by Using this intrinsic characterization, we can show that not every constrained system of practical interest is finite-type. In particular, the charge-constrained system described by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> is not. To see this, note that the symbol " " can be appended to the word but not to the word Nevertheless, this constrained system falls into a natural broader class of constrained systems. These systems can be thought of as "locally finite-type." More precisely, a constrained system is almost-finite-type if it can be presented by a labeled graph that has both finite anticipation and finite coanticipation.</p><p>Since definiteness implies finite anticipation and finite coanticipation, every finite-type constrained system is also almostfinite-type. Therefore, the class of almost-finite-type systems does indeed include all of the finite-type systems. This inclusion is proper, as can be seen by referring to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>. There, we see that the charge-constrained systems are presented by labeled graphs with zero anticipation (i.e., deterministic) and zero coanticipation (i.e., codeterministic). Thus these systems are almost-finite-type, but not finite-type. Constrained systems used in practical applications are virtually always almostfinite-type.</p><p>Another useful property of constrained systems is irreducibility. A constraint is irreducible if, for every pair of words in , there is a word such that is in Equivalently, is irreducible if and only if it is presented by some irreducible labeled graph. In coding, it usually suffices to consider irreducible constraints.</p><p>Irrreducible constrained systems have a distinguished presentation called the Shannon cover, which is the unique (up to labeled graph isomorphism) deterministic presentation of with a smallest number of states. The Shannon cover can be used to determine if the constraint is almost-finitetype or finite-type. More precisely, an irreducible constrained system is finite-type (respectively, almost-finite-type) if and only if its Shannon cover has finite memory (respectively, finite coanticipation).</p><p>Referring to Section III, recall that the (base-capacity of a constrained system is given by cap where is the number of -blocks in The (base-) capacity of an irreducible system can be obtained from the Shannon cover. In fact, as mentioned in Section III, if is any irreducible lossless presentation of , then cap</p></div>

The output of the decoder will be identical to the input to the encoder, possibly with a shift of input -blocks.

Finally, for any positive integers and satisfying the inequality cap , there is a rate finite-state -encoder that operates at rate In particular, choosing and relatively prime, one can design an invertible encoder using the smallest possible codeword length compatible with the chosen rate For completeness, we also state the more simply proved finite-state inverse-coding theorem.</p><p>Finite-State Inverse-to-Coding Theorem: Let be a constrained system.

The decoder error propagation is limited to five input bits. The same underlying encoder graph was independently constructed by Jacoby <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[112]</ref> using "look-ahead" code design techniques. Weathers and Wolf <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[112]</ref> applied the state-splitting algorithm to design a -state, sliding-block-decodable encoder with error propagation at most 5 input bits. This encoder has the distinction of achieving the smallest possible number of states for this constraint and rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[143]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>For</head><p>-RLL constrained systems, an explicit description of such a labeling was found by Gu and Fuja <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[79]</ref> and, independently, by Tjalkens <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[191]</ref>. They show that their labeling yields the largest rate attainable by any block-decodable encoder for any given -RLL constrained system. The Gu-Fuja construction is a generalization of a coding scheme introduced by Beenker and Immink <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The underlying idea, which is quite generally applicable, is to design block-decodable encoders by using merging bits between constrained words <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[112]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[104]</ref>.

When the concatenation of the current codeword with the preceding one violates the constraint, the encoder inverts one of the first zeroes in the current codeword. The condition guarantees that such an inversion can always resolve the constraint violation. In this case, the first bits of each codeword may be regarded as the merging bits.</p><p>Immink <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[106]</ref> gave a constructive proof that codes with merging bits can be made for which As a result, codes with a rate only 0.1% less than Shannon's capacity can be constructed with codewords of length Such long codewords could present an additional practical problem-beyond that of mapping the input words to the constrained words, which can be handled by enumerative coding-because a single channel bit error could corrupt the entire data in the decoded word. One proposal for resolving this difficulty is to use a special configuration of the error-correcting code and the recording code <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[106]</ref>.</p><p>Another well-known application of this method is that of the Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation (EFM) code, a rate code which is implemented in the compact audio disc <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[96]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[84]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[109]</ref>. A collection of 256 codewords is drawn from the set of length-words that satisfy the constraint. With this codebook, two merging bits would suffice to achieve a rate block-decodable code. However, in order to induce more favorable low-frequency spectral characteristics in the recorded code sequences, the encoding algorithm introduces an additional merging bit, yielding the rate block-decodable EFM encoder. 5) Extensions: In this section, we present strengthened versions of both the finite-state coding theorem and the ACH theorem.</p><p>A noncatastrophic encoder is a tagged -encoder with finite anticipation and the additional property that, whenever the sequences of output labels of two right-infinite paths differ in only finitely many places, the corresponding sequences of input tags also differ in only finitely many places. A rate finite-state tagged -encoder is noncatastrophic if the corresponding tagged -encoder is noncatastrophic. Noncatastrophic encoders restrict error propagation in the sense that they limit the number of decoded data errors spawned by an isolated channel error. They do not necessarily limit the time span in which these errors occur. The concept of noncatastrophicity appears in the theory of convolutional codes, as well, where it actually coincides with sliding-block decodability <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[137,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ch. 10]</ref>.</p><p>The following theorem is due to Karabed and Marcus <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[120]</ref>.</p><p>Noncatastrophic Encoder Theorem: Let be a constrained system.

It implements the proof of the finite-state coding theorem and provides a recipe for constructing finite-state encoders that, for finite-type constraints, are sliding-block-decodable. The state-splitting approach combines ideas found in Patel's construction of the Zero-Modulation (ZM) code <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[160]</ref> and earlier work of Franaszek <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> with concepts and results from the mathematical theory of symbolic dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[138]</ref>.</p><p>The ACH algorithm proceeds roughly as follows.

There are several elements of the code design that influence the window size, such as initial presentation, choice of approximate eigenvector, selection of outsplittings, excess edge elimination, and input tag assignment. There are approaches that, in some cases, can be used during the application of the state-splitting algorithm to help reduce the size of the decoder window, but the problem of minimizing the window size remains open. In this context, it should be noted that there are alternative code-design procedures that provide very useful heuristics for constructing slidingblock-decodable encoders with small decoding window. They also imply useful upper bounds on the minimum size of the decoding window and on the smallest possible anticipation (or decoding delay) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In particular, Hollmann <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[92]</ref> has recently developed an approach, influenced by earlier work of Immink <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[103]</ref>, which combines the state-splitting method with a generalized look-ahead encoding technique called boundeddelay encoding, originally introduced by Franaszek <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. In a number of cases, it was found that this hybrid code design technique produced a sliding-block-decodable encoder with smaller window length than was achieved using other methods.

Universality of State Splitting</head><p>The guarantee of a sliding-block decoder when is finitetype, along with the explicit bound on the decoder window length, represent key strengths of the state-splitting algorithm. Another important property is its universality. In this context, we think of the state-splitting algorithm as comprising a selection of a deterministic presentation of a constrained system , an -approximate eigenvector , a sequence of -consistent out-splittings, followed by deletion of excess edges, and finally an input-tag assignment, resulting in a tagged -encoder. For integers and a function from -blocks of to the -ary alphabet (such as a sliding-block decoder), we define to be the induced mapping on bi-infinite sequences given by where For convenience, we use the notation to denote For a tagged -encoder with sliding-block decoder , we take the domain of the induced mapping to be the set of all bi-infinite (output) symbol sequences obtained from We say that a mapping is a sliding-block -decoder if is a sliding-block decoder for some tagged -encoder. The universality of the state-splitting algorithm is summarized in the following theorem due to Ashley and Marcus <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, which we quote from <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[144]</ref>.</p><p>Universality Theorem: Let be an irreducible constrained system and let be a positive integer. a) Every sliding-block -decoder has a unique minimal tagged -encoder, where minimality is in terms of number of encoder states. b) If we allow an arbitrary choice of deterministic presentation of and -approximate eigenvector , then the state-splitting algorithm can find a tagged -encoder for every sliding-block -decoder. If we also allow merging of states (i.e., -merging as described above), then it can find the minimal tagged -encoder for every sliding-block -decoder. c) If we fix to be the Shannon cover of , but allow an arbitrary choice of -approximate eigenvector , then the state-splitting algorithm can find a tagged -encoder for every sliding-block -decoder , modulo a change in the domain of , possibly with a constant shift of each bi-infinite sequence prior to applying (but with no change in the decoding function itself). If we also allow merging of states, then, modulo the same changes, it can find the minimal tagged -encoder for every sliding-block decoder. In particular, it can find a sliding-block decoder with minimal decoding window length.</p><p>Certain limitations on the use of the algorithm should be noted, however <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. If we apply the state-splitting algorithm to the Shannon cover of an irreducible constrained system , it need not be able to find a sliding-block -decoder with smallest number of encoder states in its minimal tagged -encoder. Similarly, if we start with the Shannon cover of an irreducible constrained system and, in addition, we fix to be a minimal -approximate eigenvector (i.e., with smallest eigenvector component sum), then the algorithm may fail to find a sliding-block -decoder with minimum decoding window length <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[119]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[103]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>The universality of the state-splitting algorithm is an attractive property, in that it implies that the technique can be used to produce the "best" codes. However, in order to harness the power of this design tool, strategies for making the right choices during the execution of the construction procedure are required. There is considerable room for further research in this direction, as well as in the development of other code-construction methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H. Practical Aspects of High-Rate Code Design</head><p>The construction of very high rate -constrained codes and DC-balanced codes is an important practical problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[102]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">[208]</ref>. The construction of such high-rate codes is far from obvious, as table look-up for encoding and decoding is an engineering impracticality. The usual approach is to supplement the source bits with bits. Under certain, usually simple, rules the source word is modified in such a way that the modified word plus supplementary bits comply with the constraints. The information that certain modifications have been made is carried by the supplementary bits. The receiver, on reception of the word, will undo the modifications. In order to reduce complexity and error propagation, the number of bits affected by a modification should be as small as possible. We now give some examples of such constructions.</p><p>A traditional example of a simple DC-free code is called the polarity bit code <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The source symbols are supplemented by one bit called the polarity bit. The encoder has the option to transmit the -bit word without modification or to invert all symbols. The choice of a specific translation is made in such a way that the running digital sum is as close to zero as possible. It can easily be shown that the running digital sum takes a finite number of values, so that the sequence generated is DC-balanced.</p><p>A surprisingly simple method for transforming an arbitrary word into a codeword having equal numbers of 's and 's-that is, a balanced or zero-disparity word-was published by Knuth <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[129]</ref> and Henry <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[85]</ref>. Let be the disparity of the binary source word Let be the running digital sum of the first bits of or and let be the word with its first bits inverted. For example, if we have and</p><p>If is of even length , and if we let stand for , then the quantity is It is immediate that (no symbols inverted), and (all symbols inverted). We may, therefore, conclude that every word can be associated with at least one , so that , or is balanced. The value of is encoded in a (preferably) zero-disparity word of length even. If and are both odd, we can use a similar construction. The maximum codeword length of is governed by Some other modifications of the basic scheme are discussed in Knuth <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[129]</ref> and Alon <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>The sequence replacement technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[202]</ref> converts source words of length into -constrained words of length The control bit is set to and appended at the beginning of the -bit source word. If this -bit sequence satisfies the prescribed constraint it is transmitted. If the constraint is violated, i.e., a runlength of at least 's occur, we remove the trespassing 's. The position where the start of the violation was found is encoded in bits, which are appended at the beginning of the -bit word. Such a modification is signaled to the receiver by setting the control bit to . The codeword remains of length</p><p>The procedure above is repeated until all forbidden subsequences have been removed. The receiver can reconstruct the source word as the position information is stored at a predefined position in the codeword. In certain situations, the entire source word has to be modified which makes the procedure prone to error propagation. The class of rate -constrained codes, was constructed to minimize error propagation <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[111]</ref>. Error propagation is confined to one decoded 8-bit symbol, irrespective of the codeword length Recently, the publications by Fair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> and Immink and Patrovics <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[110]</ref> on guided scrambling brought new insights into high-rate code design. Guided scrambling is a member of a larger class of related coding schemes called multimode codes. In multimode codes, the -bit source word is mapped into -bit codewords. Each source word can be represented by a member of a selection set consisting of codewords. Examples of such mappings are the guided scrambling algorithm presented by Fair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, the DC-free coset codes of Deng and Herro <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, and the scrambling using a Reed-Solomon code by Kunisa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[135]</ref>. A mapping is considered to be "good" if the selection set contains sufficiently distinct and random codewords.</p><p>The encoder transmits the codeword that minimizes, according to a prescribed criterion, some property of the encoded sequence, such as its low-frequency spectral content. In general, there are two key elements which need to be chosen judiciously: a) the mapping between the source words and their corresponding selection sets, and b) the criterion used to select the "best" word.</p><p>The use of multimode codes is not confined to the generation of DC-free sequences. Provided that is large enough and the selection set contains sufficiently different codewords, multimode codes can also be used to satisfy almost any channel constraint with a suitably chosen selection method. For given rate and proper selection criteria, the spectral content of multimode codes is very close to that of maxentropic RDSconstrained sequences. A clear disadvantage is that the encoder needs to generate all possible codewords, compute the criterion, and make the decision.</p><p>In the context of high-rate multimode codes, there is interest in weakly constrained codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[107]</ref>. Weakly constrained codes may produce sequences that violate the constraints with probability It is argued that if the channel is not free of errors, it is pointless to feed the channel with perfectly constrained sequences. We illustrate the effectiveness of this idea by considering the properties of two examples of weak codes. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">18</ref> shows the probability that no sequence taken from a selection set of size of random sequences obeys the constraint. Let the code rate , the codeword length , and the size of the selection set Then we observe that with probability a codeword violates the constraint. The alternative implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[111]</ref> requires a rate of -four times the redundancy of the weakly constrained code-to strictly guarantee the same constraint.</p></div>

CONSTRAINED CODES FOR NOISY RECORDING CHANNELS</head><p>In Section III-A, we indicated how the implementation of timing recovery, gain control, and detection algorithms in recording systems created a need for suitably constrained recording codes. These codes are typically used as an inner code, in concatenation with an outer error-correcting code. The error-correcting codes improve system performance by introducing structure, usually of an algebraic nature, that increases the separation of code sequences as measured by some distance metric, such as Hamming distance.</p><p>A number of authors have addressed the problem of endowing constrained codes with advantageous distance properties. Metrics that have been considered include Hamming distance, edit (or Levenshtein) distance, and Lee distance. These metrics arise in the context of a variety of error types, including random-bit errors, insertion and deletion errors, bitshift errors, and more generally, burst errors. Code constructions, performance analyses, as well as lower and upper bounds on the achievable size of constrained codes with specified distance properties are surveyed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[144]</ref>.</p><p>It is fair to say that the application of constrained codes with random or burst-error correction capabilities, proposed largely in the context of storage systems using symbol-bysymbol detection such as peak detection, has been extremely limited. However, the advent of digital signal processing techniques such as PRML has created a new role for recording codes, analogous to the role of trellis-coded modulation in digital communications. In this section, we describe how appropriately constrained code sequences can improve PRML system performance by increasing the separation between the channel output sequences with respect to Euclidean distance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. PRML Performance Bounds and Error Event Analysis</head><p>The design of distance-enhancing constrained codes for recording channels requires an understanding of the performance of the PRML Viterbi detector, which we now briefly review. The detector performance is best understood in terms of error events. For a pair of input sequences and , define the input error sequence and the output error sequence A closed error event corresponds to a polynomial input error sequence where and are finite integers, , and A closed error event is said to be simple if the condition is not true for any integer where is the memory of the channel. An open error event corresponds to a right-infinite input error sequence of the form where infinitely many are nonzero, but the Euclidean norm is finite In general, for an error event , with corresponding input error sequence and output error sequence , the squared-Euclidean distance is defined as The number of channel input-bit errors corresponding to an error event is given by</p><p>The ML detector produces an error when the selected trellis path differs from the correct path by a sequence of error events. The union bound provides an upper bound to the probability of an error event beginning at some time by considering the set of all possible simple error events first event at time where the values , known as the error event distance spectrum, are defined by At moderate-to-high SNR, the performance of the system is largely dictated by error events with small distance In particular, the events with the minimum distance will be the dominant contributors to the union bound, leading to the frequently used approximation For a number of the PR channel models applicable to recording, the error event distance spectrum values, as well as the corresponding input error sequences, have been determined for a range of values of the distance <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">[198]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The calculation is made somewhat interesting by the fact, mentioned in Section II-C2, that the PR trellises support closed error events of unbounded length having certain specified, finite distances.

Code Design Strategy</head><p>The characterization of error sequences provides a basis for the design of constrained codes that eliminate events with a small Euclidean distance, thereby increasing the minimum distance and giving a performance improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[123]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[182]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[122]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[154]</ref>.

The final step in the design procedure is to construct an efficient code into the constraints This can be accomplished using code design techniques such as those discussed in Section IV.</p><p>It is useful to distinguish between two cases in implementing this strategy for the PR channels we have discussed.

Consequently, and perhaps surprisingly, the design of high-rate, distanceenhancing codes with acceptable encoder/decoder and Viterbi detector complexity proves to be considerably simpler for the channels in the second group, namely, the channels with relatively larger intersymbol interference.</p><p>We now turn to a discussion of some specific distanceenhancing constraints and codes for partial-response channels.</p></div>

Matched-Spectral-Null Constraints</head><p>As mentioned above, spectral-null constraints, particularly those with DC-nulls and/or Nyquist-nulls, are well-matched to the frequency characteristics of digital recording channels, and have found application in many recording systems prior to the introduction of PRML techniques.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Runlength Constraints</head><p>Certain classes of runlength constraints have distanceenhancing properties when applied to the magnetic and optical PR channels. For example, the NRZI constraint has been applied to the EPR4 and the E PR4 magnetic channels, as well as the PR1 and PR2 optical channels; see, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[152]</ref> and the references therein. On the EPR4 and PR1 channels, the constraint does not increase minimum distance. However, it does eliminate some of the minimum distance error-events, thereby providing some performance improvement. Moreover, the incorporation of the constraint into the detector trellis for EPR4 leads to a reduction of complexity from eight states to six states, eliminating those corresponding to the NRZ channel inputs and . In the case of E PR4, Behrens and Armstrong <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> showed that the constraint provides a 2.2-dB increase in minimum squared-Euclidean distance. To see why this is the case, observe that forbidding the input error strings will prevent all closed error events with Forbidding, in addition, the strings prevents all open events with as well.

Specifically, the constraint and the complementary constraint are sufficient to ensure the elimination of closed and open events with</p><p>The capacity of this constraint satisfies , and a rate , finite-state encoder with state-independent decoder is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[122]</ref>. The corresponding detector trellis requires 12 states. Thus with a modest increase in complexity, this code achieves essentially the same performance as the rate code, while increasing the rate by 20%. This line of reasoning may be used to demonstrate the distance-enhancing properties of another class of NRZI runlength constraints, referred to as maximum-transition-run (MTR) constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[154]</ref>. These constraints limit, sometimes in a periodically time-varying manner, the maximum number of consecutive 's that can occur. The MTR constraints are characterized by a parameter , which determined the maximum allowable runlength of 's. These constraints can be interpreted as a generalization of the constraint, which is the same as the MTR constraint with</p><p>The MTR constraint with was introduced by Moon and Brickner <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[154]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr">Soljanin [181]</ref>).

The capacity of this constraint is Imposing an additional constraint, which we now denote , on the maximum runlength of 's reduces the capacity, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">IX</ref>.  The MTR constraint supports codes with rates approaching its capacity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[154]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[155]</ref>. However, in practical applications, a distance-enhancing code with rate or higher is considered very desirable.

For example, the TMTR constraint defined by , which limits the maximum runlength of 's beginning at an even time-index to at most , has capacity The constraint has been shown to support a rate block code. Graph representations for the TMTR constrained system are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">20</ref>. The states in the upper graph are depicted as either circles or squares, corresponding to odd time indices and even time indices, respectively. The numbering of states reflects the number of 's seen since the  last . In the upper graph , each state represents a unique such number. The lower graph is obtained by successively merging states with identical follower sets.</p><p>The TMTR constraint eliminates all closed error events with on the E PR4 channel by preventing the input error sequences As with the MTR constraint, it can be shown that all open error events with can be eliminated by an appropriately designed rate , TMTR block code <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[123]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> [24], <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.

For the PR4 channel, and specified free Euclidean distance at the channel output, the runlength constraints and complexity of precoded convolutional codes have been found to be slightly inferior to those of matched-spectral-null (MSN) codes. For example, a rate precoded convolutional code was shown to achieve 3-dB gain (unnormalized for rate loss) with constraints and a 16-state detector trellis with 256 branches (per interleave). The comparable MSN code with this gain achieved the equivalent of constraints and used a six-state detector trellis with 24 branches (per interleave).</p><p>Recently, a modified version of this precoding approach was developed for use with a rate turbo code <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[168]</ref>.

Performance simulations of this coding scheme on a PR4 channel with AWGN demonstrated a gain of 5.3 dB (normalized for rate loss) at a bit-error rate of , relative to the uncoded PRML channel. Turbo equalization, whereby the PR detector is integrated into the iterative decoding procedure, was also considered. This increased the gain by another 0.5 dB. Thus the improvement over the previously proposed rate codes, which achieve 2-dB gain (normalized for rate loss) is approximately 3.3-3.8 dB. The remaining gap in between the rate turbo code performance at a bit-error rate of and the upper bound capacity limit (3) at rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[172]</ref> is approximately 2.25 dB <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[168]</ref>. The corresponding gap to the upper bound capacity limit at rate for the precoded convolutional code and the MSN code is therefore approximately 5.5-6 dB. This estimate of the SNR gap can be compared with that implied by the continuous-time channel capacity bounds, as discussed in Section II-B.</p></div>

Nonsaturation Multilevel Recording</head><p>At various times during the past, the possibility of abandoning saturation recording, "linearizing" the digital magneticrecording channel, and incorporating nonbinary signaling has been examined. In all such studies, however, the potential increase in recording density that might accrue from the application or adaptation of coded-modulation techniques developed for digital communications has been outweighed by the increase in detector complexity and, more fundamentally, the cost in signal-to-noise ratio that accompanies the linearization process. However, several novel storage technologies can support multilevel alphabets, such as electron-trapping optical memories ETOM <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[148]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and optical recording with multivalued magnetooptic media <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[176]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Existence of Multidimensional Crossword Puzzles</head><p>As mentioned in the preceding section, multidimensional constrained codes represent a new challenge for information theorists, with potentially important applications to novel, high-density storage devices. We feel it is particularly fitting, then, to bring our survey to a close by returning once more to Shannon's 1948 paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[173]</ref> where, remarkably, in a short passage addressing the connection between the redundancy of a language and the existence of crossword puzzles, Shannon anticipated some of the issues that arise in multidimensional constrained coding.</p><p>Specifically, Shannon suggested that there would be cases where the capacity of a two-dimensional constraint is equal to zero, even though the capacity of the constituent onedimensional constraint is nonzero, a situation illustrated by certain two-dimensional constraints. We cite the following excerpt from Shannon's 1948 paper:</p><p>The ratio of the entropy of a source to the maximum value it could have while still restricted to the same symbols will be called its relative entropy.</p><p>One minus the relative entropy is the redundancy.</p><p>The redundancy of a language is related to the existence of crossword puzzles. If the redundancy is zero any sequence of letters is a reasonable text in the language and any twodimensional array of letters forms a crossword puzzle. If the redundancy is too high the language imposes too many constraints for large crossword puzzles to be possible. A more detailed analysis shows that if we assume the constraints imposed by the language are of a rather chaotic and random nature, large crossword puzzles are just possible when the redundancy is 50%. If the redundancy is 33%, three-dimensional crossword puzzles should be possible, etc.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge Shannon never published a more detailed exposition on this subject. This led us to try to construct a plausibility argument for his statement. We assume that the phrase "large crossword puzzles are just possible" should be taken to mean that the capacity of the corresponding two-dimensional constraint is nonzero.</p><p>Let denote the number of source symbols, denote the source binary entropy, and denote the relative entropy. We begin with all by arrays that can be formed from symbols. We eliminate all arrays that do not have all of their rows and columns made up of a concatenation of allowable words from the language. The probability that any row of the array is made up of a concatenation of allowable words from the language is equal to the ratio of the number of allowable concatenations of words with letters, , to Thus assuming statistical independence of the rows, the probability that all rows are concatenations of allowable words is this ratio raised to the th power, or or The identical ratio results for the probability that all columns are made up of concatenations of allowable words. Now assuming that the rows and columns are statistically independent, we see that the probability for an array to have all of its rows and all of its columns made up of concatenations of allowable words is equal to</p><p>The assumption of independence of the rows and columns is made with the sole justification that this property might be expected to be true for a language that is "of a rather chaotic and random nature." Multiplying this probability by the number of arrays yields the average number of surviving arrays, which grows exponentially with provided that A similar argument for three-dimensional arrays yields the condition This is Shannon's result. (The authors thank K. Shaughnessy <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[174]</ref> for contributions to this argument.) We remark that for ordinary English crossword puzzles, we would interpret the black square to be a 27th symbol in the alphabet. Thus to compute the "relative entropy" of English, we divide the entropy of English by</p><p>In this context, we would propose using an unusual definition of the entropy of English, which we call , based upon the dependencies of letters within individual words, but not across word boundaries, since the rows and columns of crossword puzzles are made up of unrelated words separated by one or more black squares. To compute for the English language, we can proceed as follows. Assume that is the number of words in an English dictionary with letters, for We lengthen each word by one letter to include the black square at the end of a word and then add one more word of length to represent a single black square. (This allows more than one black square between words.) Following Shannon, the number of distinct sequences of words containing exactly symbols, , is given by the difference equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> Then, is given by the logarithm of the largest real root of the equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> The distribution of word lengths in an English dictionary has been investigated by Lord Rothschild <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[166]</ref>.

Connections to Two-Dimensional Constraints</head><p>Unfortunately, a direct application of Shannon's statement to the and constraints leads to a problem. Their one-dimensional capacities and, therefore, their relative entropies, are equal, with However, we have seen that the capacity of the two-dimensional constraint is zero, while that of the two-dimensional constraint is nonzero. In order to resolve this inconsistency with Shannon's bound, we tried to modify the argument by more accurately approximating the probability of a column satisfying the specified row constraint, as follows.</p><p>Although the one-dimensional capacities of the two constraints are equal, the one-dimensional constraints have different first-order entropies In particular, for the constraint and for the constraint, since the relative frequency of 's is higher for the constraint than for the constraint. In the previous plausibility argument for Shannon's result, once one chooses the rows of the array to be a concatenation of allowable words, the relative frequencies of the symbols in each column occur in accordance with the relative frequency of the symbols in the words of the language. Thus the probability that any column is a concatenation of allowable words is equal to Proceeding as above, we find that the average number of surviving arrays grows exponentially with provided that for two-dimensional arrays, or for three-dimensional arrays.</p><p>However, for both the one-dimensional and constraints, we find Therefore, this modified analysis still does not satisfactorily explain the behavior of these two constraints. A possible explanation is that a further refinement in the argument is needed. Another possibility is that these constraints are not "chaotic and random" enough for Shannon's conclusion, and our plausibility arguments, to apply.</p></div>

In the letter, Gilbert recalls a conversation he had with Shannon 50 years ago on this subject. Referring to Shannon's paper, he says: I didn't understand that crossword example and tried to reconstruct his argument. That led to a kind of handwaving "proof," which I showed to Claude. Claude's own argument turned out to have been something like mine Fortunately, I outlined my proof in the margin of my reprint of the paper (like Fermat and his copy of Diophantos). It went like this:</p><p>The argument that followed is exactly the same as the one presented in Section VIII-A above, with the small exception that arrays were assumed to be square. In fact, in a subsequent e-mail correspondence [78], Gilbert describes a calculation of the redundancy of English along the lines suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>. Thus we see that the study of multidimensional constrained arrays actually dates back 50 years to the birth of information theory. A great deal remains to be learned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. SUMMARY</head><p>In this paper, we have attempted to provide an overview of the theoretical foundations and practical applications of constrained coding in digital-recording systems. In keeping with the theme of this special issue, we have highlighted essential contributions to this area made by Shannon in his landmark 1948 paper. We described the basic characteristics of a digital-recording channel, and surveyed bounds on the noisy-channel capacity for several mathematical channel models. We then discussed practical equalization and detection techniques and indicated how their implementation imposes constraints on the recording-channel inputs. Following a review of Shannon's fundamental results on the capacity of discrete noiseless channels and on the existence of efficient codes, we presented a summary of key results in the theory and practice of efficient constrained code design. We then discussed the application of distance-enhancing constrained codes to improve the reliability of noisy recording channels, and compared the resulting performance to estimates of the noisy-channel capacity. Finally, we pointed out several new directions that future research in the area of recording codes might follow, and we concluded with a discussion of the connection between Shannon's remarks on crossword puzzles and the theory of multidimensional constrained codes. Through the inclusion of numerous references and indications of open research problems, we hope to have provided the reader with an introduction to this fascinating, important, and active branch of information theory, as well as with some incentive and encouragement to contribute to it.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
