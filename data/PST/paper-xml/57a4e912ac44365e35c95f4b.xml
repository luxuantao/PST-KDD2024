<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In recent years, the support vector machines (SVMs) have been very successful in remote sensing image classification, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data and limited training samples. Nevertheless, the vector-based feature alignment of the SVM can lead to an information loss in representation of hyperspectral images, which intrinsically have a tensor-based data structure. In this paper, a new multiclass support tensor machine (STM) is specifically developed for hyperspectral image classification. Our newly proposed STM processes the hyperspectral image as a data cube and then identifies the information classes in tensor space. The multiclass STM is developed from a set of binary STM classifiers using the one-against-one parallel strategy. As a part of our tensor-based processing chain, a multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA) is used for preprocessing, in order to reduce the tensorial data redundancy and, at the same time, preserve the tensorial structure information in sparse and high-order subspaces. As a result, the contributions of this work are twofold: a new multiclass STM model for hyperspectral image classification is developed, and a tensorial image interpretation framework is constructed, which provides a system consisting of tensor-based feature representation, feature extraction, and classification. Experiments with four hyperspectral data sets, covering agricultural and urban areas, are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Our experimental results show that the proposed STM and MPCA-STM can achieve better results than traditional SVM-based classifiers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>I N THE past decades, hyperspectral imaging has attracted extensive research efforts since such data provide continuous bands throughout the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as exhibit the potential to precisely discriminate between different land cover types using a wealth of spectral information [1], <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Supervised hyperspectral image classification where pixels are labeled to one of the predefined classes, is among the most active research areas in hyperspectral analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Many supervised classification methods have been developed for hyperspectral imagery <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, including random forest <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, spectral unmixing <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, subpixel mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, decision trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and several others <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. As a supervised machine learning technique, support vector machine (SVM) has achieved great success in various applications, including military problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, biological analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and pattern recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. It aims to acquire a classification hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Taking advantage from its ability in dealing with high-dimensional data sets and limited training samples, SVM has been shown to be successful for hyperspectral image classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>However, when the ratio between the number of spectral bands and the number of available training samples is unbalanced, hyperspectral image classification becomes an ill-posed problem that can reduce the interpretation accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>To alleviate the problem of information redundancy in hyperspectral spaces, SVM is often implemented together with the dimensionality reduction preprocessing <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Meanwhile, semisupervised SVMs have been also developed for solving the problem of limited training samples in high-dimensional feature spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In addition, variations of the SVM-based algorithms include postprocessing based on decision rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, consideration of spatial information <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, composite kernels <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, and active learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>It should be noted that the vector-based processing mode and feature alignment traditionally used by the SVM can lead to the loss of structural information for hyperspectral imagery, which has an intrinsic tensor-based data structure. Specifically, the spatial relationship between pixels cannot be effectively exploited in a vector-based approach for feature representation and interpretation. Inspired by the tensor learning methods developed in the area of signal processing, a support tensor machine (STM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> can be achieved by generalizing the SVM to its tensorial version based on multilinear algebra principles. The goal is to keep the robust performance of the classic SVM formulation while, at the same time, preserving the manifold data structure in sparse and high-dimensional feature spaces. STM has been applied to multiple applications, such as data retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, face recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, and gait recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. However, in the existing literature, few studies have been reported for applying STM to remote sensing problems in general and hyperspectral image classification problems in particular. In this context, here, we develop a new multiclass STM and a tensor-based hyperspectral image processing chain to solve the multiclass classification for remote sensing imagery. Our systematic framework includes tensor-based feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and classification. Specifically, in this paper, a multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> is used to reduce data redundancy due to the sparse and redundant high-dimensional tensor feature space for the hyperspectral data. The main contribution of this work is to introduce and adapt STM into hyperspectral remote sensing image classification. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by a set of experiments conducted on four hyperspectral data sets covering various land cover types. In addition, the parameters (e.g., window size, number of training samples, penalty coefficient, and feature dimensionality) are analyzed in detail in experiments.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. A brief review of multilinear algebra is given in Section II. The proposed STM and its multiclass version are described in Section III, followed by the tensor-based dimensionality reduction framework, which is described in Section IV. Experimental results and a comparison with state-of-the-art methods for hyperspectral image classification are provided in Section V. Section VI analyzes the impact of parameters in the developed processing chain. The last section concludes this paper with some remarks and hints at plausible future research lines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. TENSOR AND MULTILINEAR ALGEBRA</head><p>The proposed STM classification framework was based on multilinear algebra theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and processes the tensorial input data in a multidimensional manner. In the related literature, a multidimensional array is defined as a tensor, which is represented as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A ∈ R L 1 ×L 2 ×•••×L N .</formula><p>The order of the tensor A is N , and each order is called the ith mode. An arbitrary element of A is a scalar, which is denoted by a l 1 ,l 2 ,...,l i ,...,l N , where 1 ≤ l i ≤ L i , and 1 ≤ i ≤ N , with l i being the location of this element in the ith mode. According to this definition, a tensor is the higher order equivalent of a vector (one-order tensor) and a matrix (two-order tensor). In this context, a hyperspectral data cube can be regarded as a three-order tensor A ∈ R L 1 ×L 2 ×L 3 , in which orders 1 and 2 represent the spatial domain and order 3 represents the spectral domain. Some definitions related to basic tensor algebra <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> are given as follows.</p><p>Definition 2.1 (Mode-d Matricizing): Also known as mode-d matrix unfolding, the mode-d matricizing of an N -order tensor </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A ∈ R L 1 ×L 2 ×•••×L N is denoted by mat d A ∈ R L d ×(L 1 L 2 ,...,L d-1 L d+1 ,...,L N ) ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">∈ R L 1 ×L 2 ×•••×L N and a matrix U ∈ R L d ×L d , which is defined as (A × d U T ) l 1 ×l 2 ×•••×l d-1 ×l d ×l d+1 ×•••×l N = l d A l 1 ×l 2 ×•••×l d-1 ×l d ×l d+1 ×•••×l N U l d ×l d (1)</formula><p>where l 1 , l 2 , . . . , l N represent the indices of each mode. It should be emphasized that the dth mode size of tensor A is equal to the second mode size of matrix U. The mode-d product can be regarded as incorporating the information of the input tensor and matrix. Meanwhile, as the first mode size of U varies, dimensionality reduction and data filtering can be implemented via this operation. A visual illustration of mode-1 product between a three-order tensor and a matrix is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. </p></div>

Binary STM</head><p>As aforementioned, SVM employs optimization algorithms to find the optimal separation boundaries between classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. These optimal boundaries are calculated by minimizing the errors among all possible boundaries estimated by the available samples for each class. The decision function of the classic SVM is y(a) = sign(ω T a + b), where a ∈ R L×1 is the unlabeled vector input, y ∈ {-1, +1} refers to the predicted label, b is the bias term, and ω ∈ R L×1 is the projection matrix. The model parameters can be calculated by solving the following optimization problem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">⎡ ⎢ ⎣ min ω,b,ξ f (ω, b, ξ) = 1 2 ω 2 + c N i=1 ξ i s.t. y i [ω T a i + b] ≥ 1 -ξ i , 1 ≤ i ≤ N ξ i ≥ 0 ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ .

In the equation, ξ is the slack variable vector used to deal with the linearly nonseparable cases, and c is a regularization coefficient for penalizing misclassification errors. M is the number of total training samples, and A i (1 ≤ i ≤ M ) corresponds to the ith training tensor.</p><p>Based on the objective function defined in (5), the Lagrangian for STM is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">L ω k N k=1 , b, ξ, α = f ω k N k=1 , b, ξ - N i=1 α i y i c i A i N k=1 × k ω k + b -ξ i (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>where α i ≥ 0 (i = 1, 2, . . . , M) are the Lagrangian multipliers. The derivations of L(ω k N k=1 , b, ξ, α) with respect to variables ω k (k = 1, 2, . . . , N) and b should be set to 0 in the optimization process, which can be solved by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">∂ ω j f = M i=1 α i y i dc i dz (A i × j ω j )<label>(7)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">∂ b f = M i=1 α i y i dc i dz (8) with z = A i N k=1 × k ω k + b.</formula><p>However, the weight matrix ωj in (7) depends on matrix ω i (1 ≤ i ≤ N , i = j) and hence cannot be solved independently. An alternating projection optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> is therefore adopted to obtain the local optimal solution. Specifically, the parameters associated with ω i are iteratively solved while keeping the other parameters fixed. After achieving convergence, with the parameters ω and b resolved, the classification hyperplane obtained is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">A N k=1 × k ω k + b = 0.<label>(9)</label></formula><p>A graphical illustration of the scenario corresponding to a two-class problem in a high-dimensional input space solved with STMs is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Multiclass STM</head><p>The STM is intrinsically a binary classifier. It can be adapted to multiclass classification problems, however, with a one-against-one (OAO) parallel strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Similarly, the multiclass STM can be extended from the binary STM by finding a series of hyperplanes which pairwisely maximize the margin between positive and negative samples from different classes, as well as predict the class label by majority voting. This way, the outputs of all binary classifiers are taken into account for constructing the multiclass STM.</p><p>Let us consider a multiclass problem defined by a set Ω = {C 1 , C 2 , . . . , C S } consisting of S information classes; the decision function y i,j (A) between each possible pair of classes C i and C j (i = j) can be obtained. The OAO strategy constructs S(S -1)/2 binary STMs to model all the possible pairwise classifications. Subsequently, an unlabeled sample A is classified by applying each pairwise classifier and computing the score function which sums the number that this sample is assigned to that class label as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Score i = S i=1,i =j y i,j (A). (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">)</formula><p>The class with the highest score is then considered as the predicted label for the unlabeled sample A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. STM-Based Classification</head><p>To obtain the tensorial inputs corresponding to the labeled and unlabeled samples, a local neighborhood around the central pixel is extracted to represent a spatial-spectral tensor. For example, the tensor representation with a series of window sizes is graphically illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> considering two types of vector representation: band interleaved by pixel (BIP) and band sequential (BSQ). After the tensor feature representation is obtained, the labeled training tensors are used for generating the classification hyperplanes, which can be used to interpret the unlabeled ones.</p><p>It should be noted that the conventional vector-based analysis approach needs to unfold the cubic features into vectors for feature description and classification since traditional classifiers can only process vector inputs. However, the proposed STM is able to directly model the spectral-spatial tensor, which is naturally aligned as a cube for image interpretation. Compared with the traditional SVM, this characteristic presents a main methodological advantage of STM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. REDUNDANCY REDUCTION FOR STM</head><p>Although the tensor-based processing approach described in the previous section can fully exploit the image spectral-spatial data structure and preserve the data manifold, the tensorbased data representation will necessarily lead to information redundancy due to the fact that a sparse hyperspectral feature space is derived from hundreds of continuous spectral channels. Moreover, due to the spatial similarity, the spectral signals of neighboring pixels are likely to be quite correlated, which is also a source of redundancy. The sparse and highdimensional feature space exists in both spectral and spatial domains, particularly when the neighboring pixels (in a moving window) in a hyperspectral image are simultaneously taken into consideration for classification. Therefore, the direct use of tensor inputs will lead to a large amount of data redundancy, which poses problems to computational storage and efficiency, particularly for hyperspectral data with limited training samples. In this regard, reducing the redundancy is a crucial step for the proposed tensor processing and classification framework.</p><p>To deal with this problem, dimensionality reduction and feature extraction methods have been commonly applied. Here, we consider a tensor dimensionality reduction method and adapt it to the proposed tensor-based processing framework. Specifically, we use the MPCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> as preprocessing for the STM classifier. This way, a novel tensor-based image interpretation framework is proposed by effectively integrating tensor-based dimensionality reduction and classification. Please note that, in the proposed framework, MPCA can be replaced by other tensor-based dimensionality reduction methods, e.g., higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. MPCA</head><p>The basic idea of the MPCA is to extract the most significant signal components for all the tensor modes, while retaining as much as possible the data variation in the original data set. The potential of the MPCA-based tensor feature extraction has been shown in high-order computer vision and pattern recognition applications, such as face <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, handwriting <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, and gait recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. However, few studies have been devoted to the use of MPCA for hyperspectral image feature extraction in the existing literature.</p><p>MPCA formulation involves the acquisition of projection matrices and low-dimensional tensors. Given a set of</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">N -mode tensors {A m ∈ R L 1 ×L 2 ×•••×L N }, m = 1, 2, . . . , M, we attempt to derive the projection matrices U d ∈ R L d ×D d , d = 1, 2, . . . , N, with which the low-dimensional repre- sentation of input tensor B ∈ R L 1 ×L 2 ×•••×L N can be ob- tained by B = B× 1 U T 1 × • • • × d U T d × • • • × N U T N , with B ∈ R D 1 ×D 2 ×•••×D N .</formula><p>However, it is an NP-hard problem to obtain all N projection matrices simultaneously. For this purpose, the alternating least square (ALS) algorithm can be used to solve the optimization of projection matrices approximately <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. The procedure of MPCA can be summarized by the following steps: 3) Optimization of the projection matrices with ALS.</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">1) Data centralization: Ãm = A m -A, A = (1/M ) M m=1 A m . 2) At</formula><p>The initial projection is formed by calculating Pm = </p><formula xml:id="formula_19">Ãm × 1 U T 1 × • • • × d U T d × • • • × N U T N and</formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">= Ãm × 1 U T 1 × • • • × d U T d × • • • × N U T</formula><p>N and the corresponding scatter ψ k can be updated. If the difference of the scatter matrix ψ kψ k-1 is smaller than a predefined threshold, the optimization of projection matrices is completed. 4) The low-dimensional tensor can be obtained by applying the mode-d product between the input tensor and the optimized projection matrix:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">B = B× 1 U T 1 × • • • × d U T d × • • • × N U T N .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. MPCA-STM</head><p>The traditional vector-based image processing framework unfolds high-order features into vectors, which are subsequently fed into a vector-based classifier. This vector-based image processing strategy cannot sufficiently exploit the intrinsic tensor-based data structure. However, the tensor-based data representation is necessarily subject to the problem of data redundancy. As aforementioned, the redundancy is caused by the sparse hyperspectral feature space in both spectral (hundreds of continuous spectral channels) and spatial (similar pixels in the neighborhood) domains. In this context, in order to guarantee the efficiency and successful application of the STM to hyperspectral image classification, redundancy reduction is needed for preprocessing. In this paper, a tensor-based dimensionality reduction method (e.g., MPCA) is used for preprocessing of the STM classification. The whole procedure of the proposed tensor-based classification framework is therefore summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. Here, the tensor-based redundancy reduction refers to both the spectral and spatial dimensions. In the following, {D spa , D spa , D spe } are used to denote the reduced dimensions for a hyperspectral image, where D spa and D spe are the spatial and spectral dimensions after reduction, respectively. The same value of dimensionality (i.e., D spa ) is defined for the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) directions in the spatial domain, since no prior information is available to determine which direction is the most relevant. In the following, we provide a set of experimental results to evaluate the classification accuracy of the framework presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EXPERIMENTS</head><p>The proposed classification framework has been validated using four real hyperspectral images acquired from the instruments: Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), Reflective Optics System Imaging Spectrometer (ROSIS-03), Hyperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experiment (HYDICE), and Pushbroom Hyperspectral Imager (PHI). The considered images are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>.</p><p>To verify the effectiveness of the proposed tensor-based classification framework, the proposed STM and MPCA-STM are compared with SVM with various kernel functions (e.g., the linear kernel and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel). Furthermore, in this study, PCA-SVM is also carried out to consider dimensionality reduction in the SVM classification for comparison with MPCA-STM. Specifically, analogous to MPCA-STM, the pixels in a window are stacked as a long feature vector, and PCA is then used to reduce the information redundancy in the vector. The reduced features are then input to an SVM for classification. The model parameters (i.e., penalty coefficient c and bandwidth γ for the RBF kernel) of the SVM are selected based on fivefold cross validation. The classification accuracy is assessed by using the overall accuracy (OA) and the κ coefficient based on a confusion matrix. Each classification scenario is repeated ten times with different randomly selected training sets, and the mean and standard deviation of the classification results are reported for the assessment of classification performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Experiments With the AVIRIS Indian Pines Data Set</head><p>The Indian Pines data were collected by the AVIRIS sensor in 1992 over an agricultural area in northern Indiana, USA. This hyperspectral image contains 16 classes with 145 × 145 pixels and 220 spectral bands between 0.4 and 2.5 μm. The classes and the corresponding numbers of training and test samples are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>. For each class, we randomly select a very limited number of 15 pixels for each class for training and use the remaining samples for accuracy assessment. The window size for the STM classification is set empirically to 9 × 9, and the reduced dimensionality in MPCA-STM is set as {1,1, 40} according to our cross-validation experiments. Please note that the first principal component in the spatial domain is sufficient to represent the local image cube, as will be discussed in Section VI-D.</p><p>The classification maps and accuracy assessment for the AVIRIS Indian Pines are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>. By analyzing the classification accuracies, it is observed that the SVM with the RBF kernel (RBF-SVM) outperforms the linear SVM (Lin-SVM) since the former can effectively discriminate samples that are not linearly separable. It can be seen that the proposed STM outperforms the SVM in terms of accuracies, as the SVM neglects the local correlation of neighboring pixels, which also leads to salt and pepper noise. Compared with SVM with linear and RBF kernel, the proposed multiclass STM increases the accuracy of OA by 11.8% and 5.0%, respectively. It can be also seen that the highest accuracy, i.e., OA = 80.6%, is achieved by MPCA-STM, which significantly outperforms STM. This demonstrates that large amount of redundancy exists in the tensor-based hyperspectral image representation, and a spectral-spatial dimensionality reduction approach is necessary for the tensor-based image interpretation. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>, the proposed STM and MPCA-STM methods outperform PCA-SVM in terms of improvements of OA (0.2% and 18.2%, respectively). The better performance of the STM methods can be attributed to the fact that they process an image as a cube, but the PCA-SVM realigns the cube into a  vector, which does not sufficiently exploit the spatial correlation between pixels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. ROSIS-03 Pavia University Data Set</head><p>The data set considered in this experiment is a highresolution hyperspectral image (610 × 340 pixels) acquired by the ROSIS-03 sensor on the campus of the University of Pavia, Italy. A total of 115 spectral bands was acquired in the range 0.43-0.86 μm of the visible and infrared spectrum with a 1.3-m spatial resolution. The geospatial objects in this image refer to nine thematic classes, consisting of urban, soil, and vegetation features. In total, 42 776 labeled pixels are used for validation, as listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>. The window size of the proposed tensorbased classifier and PCA-SVM is set empirically to 7 × 7, and a limited number of 20 pixels per class are randomly selected as  training samples. The reduced dimensionality for MPCA-STM is chosen as {1,1, 20}. This aspect is discussed in detail in Section VI-D.</p><p>The classification maps obtained by the considered algorithms are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref>, and the corresponding accuracy scores are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>. Misclassifications in this case lie in spectrally similar objects such as meadows-bare soil, gravel-bricks, which implies that spectral information alone is inadequate for classification purposes. The accuracies can be improved using the proposed STM, which actually considers the intrinsic spectral-spatial data structure. For instance, the classification accuracies of bare soil and meadows classes are increased by 2% and 12%, respectively, compared with RBF-SVM. Furthermore, when redundancy reduction is considered, MPCA-STM yields 12.1% and 11.6% improvements in terms of OA, compared with Lin-SVM and RBF-SVM,  respectively. Compared with PCA-SVM, STM and MPCA-STM achieve an accuracy increase of 0.5% and 10.4%, respectively, benefitting from the tensor-based data processing. In this experiment, it can be also observed that the proposed MPCA-STM not only exploits the implicit spectral-spatial information of hyperspectral data via tensor representation but also overcomes the issues caused by redundancy by incorporating STM with MPCA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. HYDICE Data Set</head><p>The HYDICE airborne hyperspectral data flight over the Washington DC Mall has been also considered in experiments. These data consist of 210 spectral bands from 0.4 to 2.4 μm, among which 19 bands were discarded due to water absorption. The test image contains 280 × 307 pixels with a 5-m spatial resolution. The reference data consist of 19 332 test samples, as listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref>, from which a limited number of 20 pixels per class are randomly selected as training samples. The classification results using Lin-SVM, RBF-SVM, STM, and MPCA-STM are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref>. The corresponding classifi-cation maps are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref>. In this experiment, the window size is chosen as 3 × 3 for PCA-SVM, STM, and MPCA-STM. The reduced dimensionality for MPCA-STM is set to {1,1, 20}.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref>, the proposed tensor-based classifiers can give substantially more accurate results than vector-based approaches. Compared with Lin-SVM and RBF-SVM, the improvements of OA achieved by STM are 6.4% and 3.2%, respectively, whereas the increments obtained by MPCA-STM are 10.6% and 7.3%, respectively. It can be also observed from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref> that Lin-SVM is not very effective for discrimination between bare soil, roads, and buildings due to their similar spectral reflectance. The classification of these similar classes is slightly improved with RBF-SVM. In the case of STM, where tensors are considered as the basic processing unit and, hence, the contextual spectral spatial relationship can be considered adequately, the classification accuracy for the roof is improved by 14.8% and 6.3%, respectively, compared with Lin-SVM and RBF-SVM. In this experiment, the proposed MPCA-STM achieves an increment of 5.3% compared with STM, by reducing the redundancy in the tensor-based spectral-spatial domain.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. PHI Data Set</head><p>The PHI is a Chinese hyperspectral sensor based on pushbroom imaging technique with a focal plain detector, which has a field of view of 21 • and a spatial resolution of 1.5 mrad. The data set used here (346 × 512 pixels) was acquired by the PHI sensor over a mixed agricultural area of Xiaqiao in Jiangsu Province, China. The wavelength range for the data set is from 0.417 to 0.854 μm, and 80 spectral bands are available. Eleven land cover classes are labeled with 2372 pixels used as reference based on a field survey. The challenge for this data set is to discriminate multiple crop types, which have very similar spectral properties, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9</ref>. The figure presents the spectral reflectance curves, where C, V, S, G, and O refer to corn, vegetation, soil, grass, and other classes (including lime and rocks), respectively. The classes C41, C42, C43, and C44 represent different types of corn. In experiments, a limited number of 20 pixels are randomly selected from each class as training samples.</p><p>In this experiment, STM and MPCA-STM are implemented with a 9 × 9 window, and the reduced dimensionality for the MPCA is {1, 1, 30}. From the classification results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">IV</ref>, it can be seen that (compared with Lin-SVM and RBF-SVM) the improvements of OA achieved by STM are 11.4% and 9.4%, respectively, when the local contextual information is included in the classification. Similarly, in this experiment, MPCA-STM further improves the classification accuracy of the original STM by removing the data redundancy in the sparse and hyperspectral tensor space, resulting in the highest accuracy (OA = 97.35%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. DISCUSSION</head><p>The experimental results in the previous section show that the proposed STM and MPCA-STM can achieve a satisfactory performance for hyperspectral remote sensing image classification. Moreover, they provide more accurate results than the traditional SVM by constructing a new tensor-based image feature representation and interpretation framework, which is particularly appropriate for the intrinsic tensor data structure of hyperspectral data. Here, the parameters for the proposed STM and MPCA-STM, namely, the window size, training samples, penalty coefficient, and tensor dimensionality, are discussed in detail in order to better understand the tensor-based image processing system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Window Size for the Tensorial Feature Representation</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10</ref> shows the classification accuracies of STM and MPCA-STM with different window sizes for the four considered experimental data sets. STM and MPCA-STM are implemented using window sizes varying from 3 × 3 to 9 × 9 by randomly choosing 20 pixels (15 pixels for AVIRIS data set) from each class for training. In the figure, the dash lines represent the accuracies obtained by RBF-SVM with the same training samples. The reduced dimensionality for MPCA is set to {1,1, 40} (AVIRIS), {1,1, 20} (ROSIS-03), {1,1, 20} (HYDICE), and {1,1, 30} (PHI), respectively.</p><p>From the perspective of image classification, small windows may not contain sufficient spatial information, whereas large windows can complicate the analysis with the possibility that multiple objects or classes are included in the window. In our experiments, it was found that the window size does not show a significant influence on the results obtained, demonstrating the robustness of the tensor image processing system. In addition, it can be seen that the tensor-based classifiers obtain a better performance than SVM for different window sizes. Meanwhile, it can be also seen that MPCA-STM significantly outperforms the original STM in nearly all the cases since redundancy reduction is very important for the tensor-based processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Influence of the Number of Training Samples</head><p>To investigate the impact of the number of training samples on the proposed tensor-based classification framework, different numbers of training samples are used in this experiment. Specifically, for each data set, training samples are randomly generated from the reference data using a number of training samples per class that ranges from 5 to 95 pixels and using the remaining ones for testing. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">11</ref>, the OA values increase rapidly with the increment of the number of training samples, and then, the accuracy curves become stable when 20-40 samples per class are used. In addition, it can be observed that the proposed tensor-based classifiers outperform the classic SVM and contextual SVM (i.e., PCA-SVM) in all cases, particularly for small numbers of training samples. This reveals that the proposed tensor feature presentation has a potential for addressing the classification uncertainty with small numbers of training samples, since tensor-based classifiers yield much better results than vector-based methods when IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Penalty Coefficient of the STM</head><p>The penalty coefficient c determines the degree by means of which the classifier penalizes the negative samples in the training. It is an important parameter for STM since it controls the generalization of the classifier. Here, a series of experiments are conducted to investigate how the penalty coefficient c affects the performance of STM and MPCA-STM. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">12</ref> shows the obtained classification accuracies as a function of the coefficient c ∈ [2 -16 , 2 16 ]. From the figure, it can be seen that the accuracy curves are parabolic. This phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that a small value means giving less penalty to misclassified samples, which can mix up margin support tensors and nonmargin support tensors (i.e., fall on the "wrong" side of this margin) in a problem that is not linearly separable. On the other hand, a large value can shrink the classification margin and result in performance degradation. The optimal value of the penalty parameter can be determined by cross validation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Reduced Dimensionality for MPCA-STM</head><p>Here, the impact of using reduced spatial and spectral dimensions (i.e., D spa and D spe ) for the proposed MPCA-STM is analyzed. The overall accuracies of MPCA-STM for different numbers of dimensions (in both spectral and spatial directions) are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">13</ref>, where the xand y-axes refer to the spatial and spectral dimensions after reduction, respectively; and the z-axis denotes the OA (%). The highest accuracy achieved by the original STM with the optimal parameters is also indicated with a dot dashed line. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">13</ref> shows that reduced dimensionality is an important parameter, which significantly influences the performance of MPCA-STM. Specifically, we have found that the 1-D or 2-D principal components are adequate for the tensor feature representation in the spatial domain. In particular, when the first spatial principal component is considered, the performances of the MPCA-STM are much better than the original STM regardless of the spectral dimensionality. An exception is the HYDICE DC mall experiment, where the high classification accuracy (between 80% and 90%) corresponds to wide spatial dimension (between 1 and 5), but relatively narrow spatial dimension (between 1 and 50). This suggests that the spatial redundancy is relatively smaller in this study area. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Computational Load</head><p>Here, the computational cost for different methods is compared in Table <ref type="table">V</ref>. From the table, we can conclude that the moving-window-based classifiers are subject to more processing time than the traditional vector-based ones. It should be noted that PCA-SVM leads to large computational burden due to the pixel-by-pixel alignment of the local window. Additionally, the use of MPCA can remarkably alleviate the computational burden of STM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE LINES</head><p>In this paper, we have presented a new tensor-based framework for classification of hyperspectral remote sensing imagery. Specifically, we have developed a new multiclass STM, which extends the traditional vector-based feature representation and classification strategy such as the SVM to a tensorbased version. In particular, tensor-based processing is naturally appropriate for hyperspectral remote sensing imagery, which has an intrinsic tensor data structure. Furthermore, our work reveals that information redundancy exists in the sparse and high-dimensional feature space for hyperspectral data. As a result, redundancy reduction becomes a crucial issue, particularly when the tensor data representation is considered, since redundancy can exist in both spectral and spatial directions.</p><p>Accordingly, we introduced an MPCA, which is a tensorbased dimensionality reduction algorithm, and then constructed a novel MPCA-STM classifier. MPCA-STM takes advantage of tensor feature extraction and at the same time solves the problem of information redundancy.</p><p>In order to validate the effectiveness of the newly developed STM and MPCA-STM, a series of experiments were conducted using four representative hyperspectral data sets, covering various land cover types (e.g., rural, urban, and agriculture). In all the experiments, the proposed STM outperformed the SVM in terms of both quantitative accuracy scores and visual inspection. Moreover, the interpretation accuracy can be further improved when MPCA-STM is carried out, since data redundancy is reduced simultaneously in both the spectral and spatial domains. These results demonstrate that our proposed methods exhibit potential for hyperspectral classification.</p><p>Hyperspectral data play an important part in quantitative remote sensing, precision agriculture, detailed land cover mapping, and military applications. The tensor-based system presented in this paper represents a novel method for processing and understanding hyperspectral imagery, by fully considering its intrinsic tensor data structure. In the future, we will conduct further experiments to fully substantiate the potential of the proposed tensor-based system for replacing the traditional vectorbased data representation, providing more accurate analysis </p></div>
