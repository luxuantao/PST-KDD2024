<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Existing results on distributed consensus and flocking algorithms critically rely on maintaining a connected communication network among the agents, either for all time (as in <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>) or over sequences of bounded time intervals (as in <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>). In this technical note, we relax this assumption and propose a distributed control framework that guarantees velocity alignment, cohesion, separation, and connectivity of the networked multi-agent system, by construction.</p><p>Inspired by the flocking and schooling phenomena observed in nature are many recent applications in control theory and robotics. Any attempt to list related references in this technical note is bound to be partial and incomplete, hence, we rather focus on work that emphasizes on the connectivity aspect of networked dynamical systems. In <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, network connectivity is maintained by means of potential fields that guarantee positive definiteness of the second smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian matrix, while in <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> a measure of local connectedness of a network is introduced that under certain conditions is sufficient for global connectedness. Distributed maintenance of nearest neighbor links by means of unbounded "edge tension" functions is addressed in <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, where a control hysteresis is also introduced to avoid infinite control inputs when new links are about to be inserted to the network. Similarly, in <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>, a system of interconnected unicycles is steered to a common configuration by means of nonsmooth, potential-based control inputs that turn unbounded when the distance between adjacent agents approaches a certain threshold. Invariance of the level sets of an appropriate function ensures that initially established links will be preserved along the system's trajectories.</p><p>In this technical note, we address the problem of velocity synchronization in a network of n interconnected agents, while maintaining connectivity of the underlying proximity-based graph and ensuring collision avoidance among the agents. Unlike previous approaches, our proposed framework allows switching among connected network topologies that are due to both addition, as well as deletion of communication links between agents. As in <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> the dynamics of an agent are expressed by a double integrator</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">_ x i (t) = v i (t) (1a) _ v i (t) = u i (t) (1b)</formula><p>where xi(t); vi(t) 2 m denote the position and velocity vectors of agent i at time t, respectively, and u i (t) 2 m is a switching control input that relies exclusively on nearest neighbor information. Unlike <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>, the switching signal (set of neighbors) can be also controlled in the discrete space of graphs as in <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>, and combined with the continuous agent motion, it gives rise to a closed-loop multi-agent hybrid system. Under the assumption that the communication network is initially connected, the overall system is shown to always stabilize to an equilibrium characterized by fixed inter-agent distances and aligned agent velocities. Our convergence results rely on recent work on the stability of switched systems <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> and essentially complete the safety, namely connectivity control, results employed from <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref> with liveness guarantees. Collision avoidance is also guaranteed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>Consider a network of n agents in m with integrated wireless communication capabilities and denote by (i; j) a communication link between agents i and j. We assume that such links can be enabled and disabled in time due to agent mobility and/or control decisions and, as in <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>, we employ proximity graphs to represent the agents' communication network. Motivation for relating the agents' ability to establish communication links to the distance between them comes from the fact that radio signal strength attenuates with distance, with the probability of a successful transmission rapidly decreasing beyond a certain threshold. To capture such radio signals, we propose a rather qualitative model for the communication network, where new communication Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Partitioning of the neighborhood of an agent according to its ability to communicate and the requirement to avoid collisions. Regions where communication links are established or lost are qualitatively associated to signal strength, ranging from strong to weak and no signal at all. The inner-most disk marks the area around agent i where collision avoidance maneuvers are initiated. Note a region of width &gt; 0 between the areas where links can be added or deleted, which introduces a dwell time &gt; 0 between any changes in the network topology. The dashed line shows the path of agent j , and the solid lines indicate a link between agents i and j . links can be established only between agents whose distance becomes smaller than some threshold R &gt; 0. Beyond that threshold, we assume there is considerable uncertainty over the agents' ability to successfully communicate, hence, communication links are lost. On the other hand, to avoid collisions, agents are not supposed to get too close to each other. Once their distance falls below a threshold r &gt; 0, collision avoidance maneuvers must be initiated. The proposed dynamic network is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and can be formally captured by a dynamic proximity graph G(t) = (V ; E(t)), where V = f1; . . . ; ng denotes the set of vertices indexed by the set of agents and E(t) V 2V denotes the time varying set of links, such that for constants r, R, and satisfying 0 &lt; 2r &lt; R and 0 &lt; =2 &lt; minfR 0 2r; rg, we have: • if kx ij (t)k 2 2 [0; r), then (i; j) 2 E(t); • if (i; j) 6 2 E(t) and kx ij (t)k 2 2 [r; R 0 r 0 =2), then (i; j) is a candidate link to be added to E(t);</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">• if kx ij (t)k 2 2 [R 0 r 0 =2; R 0 r + =2), then (i; j) preserves its membership status in E(t) (no addition or deletion); • if (i; j) 2 E(t) and kxij(t)k 2 2 [R 0 r + =2; R), then (i; j) is a candidate link to be deleted from E(t); • if kx ij (t)k 2 2 [R; 1), then (i; j) 6 2 E(t);</formula><p>where x ij (t) 1 = x i (t) 0 x j (t). We assume undirected networks G(t), where communication links are bidirectional, i.e., (i; j) 2 E(t) if and only if (j; i) 2 E(t). Any vertices i and j of an undirected graph G(t) that are joined by a link (i; j) 2 E(t), are called adjacent or neighbors at time t. Hence, we can define the set of neighbors of agent i at time t, by N i (t) 1  = fj 2 Vj(i; j) 2 E(t)g. If G(t) is such that there exists a path, i.e., a sequence of distinct vertices such that consecutive vertices are adjacent, between any two of its vertices, then we say that G(t) is connected.</p><p>Given any dynamic proximity graph G(t) = (V ; E(t)) consisting of n mobile agents as in (1), define the set of control laws</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">u i (t) 1 = 0 j2N (t) (v i (t) 0 v j (t)) 0 j2N (t) r x ' ij (t) (2)</formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2</ref>.

Hence, the problem addressed in this technical note can be stated as follows.</p><p>Problem 1 (Connectivity Preserving Flocking): Given an initially connected network G(t0) consisting of n agents described by ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>), (2), determine local controllers N i (t) so that the overall dynamic network G(t) is connected for all time, all agent velocities are aligned and collisions among the agents are avoided. To obtain local controllers N i (t) that guarantee invariance of the whole mobile network G(t) with respect to connectivity, we choose an equivalent algebraic representation of a dynamic graph = (V; E(t)) using the laplacian matrix where A(t) = (aij (t)) corresponds to the adjacency matrix of the graph G(t), such that a ij (t) = 1 if (i; j) 2 E(t) and a ij (t) = 0 oth- erwise, and 1(t) = diag( n j=1 a ij (t)) denotes the valency matrix. 1   The spectral properties of the Laplacian matrix are closely related to graph connectivity. In particular, if 1 (t) 2 (t) . . . n (t) are the ordered eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix L(t), then 1(t) = 0 for all t, with corresponding eigenvector 1, and 2(t) &gt; 0 if and only if G(t) is connected <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. The above algebraic representation of a graph G(t), along with auction-based link deletions, leads to the desired distributed connectivity controllers N i (t) for Problem 1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">L(t) 1 = 1(t) 0 A(t)<label>(4)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. DISTRIBUTED CONNECTIVITY CONTROL</head><p>Consider a dynamic graph G(t) = (V; E(t)) defined by the time varying set of edges E(t). 2 The goal in this section is to design local controllers that allow every agent to add or delete communication links with neighbors without violating connectivity of G. As connectivity is a global graph property, it is necessary that every agent has sufficient knowledge of the network structure in order to safely delete a link with a neighbor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>). 3 Such knowledge can be obtained through local estimates of the network topology (Section III-A), which, along with a tie breaking mechanism obtained by means of gossip algorithms and distributed market-based control (Section III-B), ensure connectivity even when combinations of multiple deletion requests could possibly violate it (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Local Estimates of the Network Topology</head><p>Let Gi = (V; Ei) denote a local estimate of the global network G that agent i can obtain using information from its nearest neighbors N i . Let also A i = (a [i]   jk ) denote the adjacency matrix associated with the graph G i and define its dynamics by 4   A i (t + 1) := :(A i (t) $ V i (t)) <ref type="bibr">(5)</ref> where the control input Vi = (v [i]  jk ) 2 f0; 1g n2n is such that v [i]   jk = 1</p><p>if a control action is taken to add or delete link (j; k) (Table <ref type="table">I</ref>). It can 1 Since we do not allow self-loops, we define a (t) = 0 for all i. 2 To simplify notation, we hereafter often drop dependence on time t. be shown that the control input Vi can be decomposed into two disjoint components V a i and V d i regulating link additions and deletions, respectively, as <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref> Vi 1 where E i = _ j6 =i (e i e T j _e j e T i ), and e i is a column vector with all en- tries 0 except for the ith entry that is 1. This results in the local network dynamics (5) being essentially a consensus (with inputs) on the adjacency matrix estimates A i . In particular, for a fixed network topology (no inputs), the dynamics (5) reduce to</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">A i := _ j2N (A i _ A j );</formula><p>which for local initialization of the estimates A i with nearest neighbor links, provide every agent with a rough picture of the overall network. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Controlling Addition and Deletion of Links</head><p>Unlike link additions, deletion of nearest neighbor links is a challenging task. Although knowledge of the estimate Gi allows every agent i to determine adjacent links that if deleted individually, preserve network connectivity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>), it is not sufficient for dealing with simultaneous link deletions by multiple nonadjacent agents that may disconnect G (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>). For this, we require that at most one link be deleted from G at a time and employ an auction-based framework to achieve agreement of all agents regarding the link that is to be deleted (Algorithm 1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithm 1 Link deletion controller for agent i</head><p>Require: Si := fj 2 N d i j2(Ei n f(i; j)g) &gt; 0g;</p><p>Require r i 1 = [i j b] T and T i := e i ;</p><p>1: if ^n j=1 T ij = 0 then 2: ri := rj, where j = maxfarg max k2N fri3; r k3 gg; = fj 2 Nijkxijk 2 2 [R0r+=2;R)g that if agent i deletes a link (i; j) with, then G i remains connected. For any j 2 S i , agent i initializes a request r i 1 = [ijb] T 2 3 containing the link (i; j) to be deleted and a bid b 0, such that b &gt; 0 if Si 6 = ; and b = 0 otherwise, indicating how "important" this request is. 5 This request is propagated in the network, along with a vector of tokens T i 2 f0; 1g n , initialized as Ti := ei, indicating that agent i has placed its bid. During every auction, every agent i communicates with its neighbors and updates its vector of tokens T i (line 3, Algorithm 1), as well as its request r i with the request rj corresponding to the agent j that has placed the highest bid r j3 , i.e., j 2 arg max k2N fr i3 ; r k3 g. In case of ties on the bids, i.e., if arg max k2N fr i3 ; r k3 g contains more than one agents, then the agent j with the maximum label is selected (line 2, Algorithm 1). Note ), where n is the size of the matrix <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. This complexity can be reduced to O(n) for sparse symmetric matrices <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>, as is typically the Laplacian matrix L(t) of large networks. Consequently, our approach is scalable to relatively large networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Agent Synchronization</head><p>Communication time delays, packet losses, and the asymmetric network structure, may result in auctions starting asynchronously, outdated information being used for future decisions, and consequently, agents reaching different decisions for the same auction. In the absence of a common global clock, the desired synchronization is ideally event triggered, where by a triggering event we understand the time instant that a message Msg[i] 1 = fA i ; r i ; T i g has been received by any of agent i's neighbors j 2 Ni. We achieve such a synchronization by labeling every auction in the set {1,2,3} and requiring that all information exchange takes place among neighbors that are in equally labeled auctions. Essentially, "fast" agents wait for their "slower" peers and, hence, all agents are always synchronized in the sequence {1,2,3,1,2,3,. ..} (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</p><p>5 Letting b 0 be a function of the distance kx k , j 2 S or the size of the neighbor set jN j can be associated with signal strength or power constraint properties of the overall network. N &gt; 0 such that 'ij &gt; M. If we pick M &gt; cwe reach a contradiction, since by definition x ij 2 ' 01 ij ([0; c]) = fx ij j' ij (x ij ) cg. Thus, all sets ' 01 ij ([0; c]) are bounded and hence, compact. Therefore, the set is compact as an intersection of finite compact sets. It follows that G is also compact, as a closed subset of a compact set.</p><p>So far we have shown that the level sets G of 'G are both pos- itively invariant and compact. The invariance of G implies that no collisions between agents occur. We now use these results to show that all agent velocities become asymptotically the same. Note first that compactness and positive invariance of G implies that (x; v) 2 mn(n01)=2 2 mn remains bounded in every bounded time interval</p><p>[tp ;tp ) and, hence, in the union Q. Moreover, since 'G 2 C 2 in its domain, the right-hand-side of ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) is locally Lipschitz, which implies that ( _ x; _ v) is also bounded in every bounded time interval which suggests that y Q 2 L 1 . We now proceed to showing that y Q (t) ! 0 as t ! 1. Our argument is along the lines of <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>: suppose that this is not true. Then, there exists an " &gt; 0 and an infinite sequence of times s 1 ;s 2 ; . . . such that the values y Q (s ); y Q (s 2 ); . . are away from zero by at least ". It follows from ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) that the times s1;s2; . . . necessarily belong to Q. Since yQ is uniformly continuous, we can find a &gt; 0 such that each s i is contained in some interval of length , on which y Q (t) "=2. (Recall that the length of each such interval in Q is lower bounded by &gt; 0.) This contradicts the fact that y Q 2 L 1 . Hence, y Q (t) ! 0 as t ! 1, which suggests that v ! 1 T for some 2 m . This means that the corresponding components of agent velocities converge asymptotically to common values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. THE CLOSED-LOOP HYBRID AGENT</head><p>Integration of the discrete topology controllers described in Section III with the continuous motion controllers (1), ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) give rise to a hybrid model i 2 i 2 i for every agent i, consisting of a topology control i , an auction i and a navigation automaton i , respectively [11] (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>). The topology controller of agent i updates its network estimate A i with addition and deletion of links (Section III-A). For this, it requires the control input V d i that regulates link deletions, as well as the network estimates A j of agent i's neighbors in order to compute the control input V a i that regulates link additions (Section III-B). The control input V d i is provided by the auction controller and relies on the max-requests r j and tokens T j of agent i's neighbors (Algorithm 1). To capture the continuous agent motion, the navigation controller i coordinates with the associated topology and auction controllers to obtain the agent's set of neighbors N i , which it uses, along with their positions xj for j 2 Ni, to update its own position xi ((1) and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>)). The updated agent positions are then provided to the topology controller that further updates agent i's network estimate A i and the resulting set of neighbors Ni. Note that in the proposed hybrid system, all variables are considered shared, however, the only variables that are practically needed are the ones provided by every agent's neighbors, which guarantees the local nature of the proposed control framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. SIMULATION RESULTS</head><p>We apply the proposed hybrid controller in coordination problems where connectivity of the network can not be trivially maintained.</p><p>We consider n = 30 agents in 2 , symmetrically distributed on the perimeter of a unit circle, with initial velocities chosen randomly within the unit square and parameters r = 0:15 and R = 0:5.</p><p>The agents are denoted with dots, while the links between them are indicated by either solid or dashed lines, depending on whether the corresponding inter-agent distances are in the [0; R 0 r) or [R 0 r; R) region, respectively. Solid curves attached to every agent indicate the recently traveled paths, while arrows correspond to the agents' velocities (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref>). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref>(a)-8(c) show the evolutions with time (log-scale) of the Fiedler eigenvalue 2 (t), the auxiliary function y Q (t), and the minimum distance minijfkxij (t)k 2 g between agents. One can clearly see that the network always remains connected, all agent velocities are asymptotically aligned and collisions among agents are always avoided, as desired.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this technical note, we offer a solution to the problem of producing flocking behavior in a group of mobile agents, without assuming network connectivity or forcing all initial links to be maintained over all time. By means of a distributed topology control protocol, all possible network links are subject to creation or deletion, depending on the spatial distribution of the agents at any given time instant. The discrete network protocol ensures connectivity of the dynamic network, as well as a hysteresis between topology changes, properties which a continuous decentralized motion controller exploits to guarantee velocity synchronization and collision avoidance. The two controllers are combined into a hybrid architecture, where topology control facilitates motion coordination, and motion control preserves the topology dictated by the discrete network controller.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Fig. 3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. Agent synchronization. Assume agent i is in auction 1. Necessary for agent i to transition to auction 2 is that all other agents are also in auction 1, since otherwise agent i will be missing tokens from the agents that are not in auction 1 yet (currently in auction 3) and Algorithm 1 will not be able to converge. Once agent i transitions to auction 2, it initializes all variables for that auction with the latest values from auction 1, while it maintains the variables of auction 1 for agents that are still in auction 1 and it clears all variables of auction 3 since, no agent is in this auction any more <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Correctness</head><p>Correctness of the proposed distributed coordination framework is obtained by construction and is discussed in detail in the previous subsections. Those ideas are summarized in the following result. 6  Theorem 3.2 (Correctness): Assume an initially connected network G of agents that are initialized with nearest neighbor information. Then, the proposed scheme for distributed addition and deletion of communication links guarantees that G remains always connected.</p><p>Proof: The proof relies on the following observations: 7</p><p>(a) All network estimates G i are spanning subgraphs of the overall network G, i.e., E i E, which implies that connectivity can be checked locally for Gi and the results can be extended to G.</p><p>(b) Agreement of all agents on the link that is to be deleted, is guaranteed by convergence of the max-consensus in Algorithm 1. (c) Points (a) and (b) above ensure that all agents agree on the link that is to be deleted and that this deletion does not violate connectivity. The synchronization scheme described in Section III-C ensures that no outdated information is used in any auction. Consequently, links can be deleted continuously one-by-one, without destroying connectivity of the network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. INTEGRATION WITH AGENT MOBILITY: VELOCITY ALIGNMENT AND COLLISION AVOIDANCE</head><p>With the topology control component of Section III adding and deleting edges at will, the agent control law (2) experiences discontinuities, and induces a switching nonlinear closed-loop dynamical system (1), (2). Let t p for p = 1; 2; ... denote the switching times when the topology of G(t) changes, and define a switching signal G(t) : [0; 1) ! GC, where GC denotes the set of all connected graphs on n vertices. 8 As discussed in Section III, the topology controller guarantees that the sequence of proximity graphs consists of connected graphs, while communication time delays (Section V) and the idle -annulus between the regions where links can be added and deleted (Figs. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and<ref type="figure">2</ref>), introduce a dwell time &gt; 0 between transitions in the network topology G(t). Hence, we can now state our main result.  <ref type="formula">2</ref>), assume that G(t0) 2 GC and tp 0 tp01 &gt; &gt; 0 for all switching times t p &gt; 0. Then, G(t) 2 G C for all t &gt; 0, and kx ij (t)k 2 &gt; 0 for all i; j 2 V and all t &gt; 0. Moreover, v i ! v j as t ! 1, for all i; j 2 V. 6 Implementation on a real robotic platform showed that our approach is also feasible as well as highly successful in enabling a network of robots to adapt to disturbances [95% packet loss using multicast User Datagram Protocol (UDP)] while maintaining network connectivity <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. 7 Due to space limitations, a more rigorous proof is omitted. More details can be found in <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>. 8 Note that G(t) is also a map from the real time-line to the set of graphs.</p><p>Proof: Let tp ; tp ; .. . denote an infinite subsequence of switching times such that the switching signal G(t) in each of the intervals [t p ; t p ) for q = 1; 2; ... is the same. Denote the union of these intervals by Q and for all time t 2 Q, let </p><p>where B K is the incidence matrix of the complete proximity graph <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>, and define the function 'G : mn(n01)=2 2 mn ! + with 9</p><p>For any c &gt; 0, let G = f(x; v) 2 mn(n01)=2 2 mn j' G cg denote the level sets of 'G and observe that (cf. <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>)</p><p>Equation ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and the Kronecker product notation () simplifies the expression for _ 'G to _ ' G = 0v T (L G I m )v; <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref> which is always nonpositive, since the Laplacian L G is always positive semidefinite. Hence, for any signal G, the level sets G are positively invariant, implying that for any (i; j) 2 E, ' ij remains bounded. On the other hand, if for some (i; j) 2 E, kx ij k 2 ! R, then ' ij (x ij ) ! 1. Thus, by continuity of 'G in its domain, it follows that kxijk 2 &lt; R, for all (i; j) 2 E and t 2 [t p ; t p +1 ). In other words, all links in G are maintained between switching times, and since G(t p ) 2 G C for q = 1; 2; .. ., we have that G(t) 2 GC for all t 2 [tp ; tp +1), hence, for all t 2 Q. A similar argument for the case where kx ij k 2 ! 0 can be used to establish collision avoidance.</p><p>Since the addition of an edge between agents i and j can occur only in the region where kx ij k 2 2 [r; R 0 r 0 =2), such an event temporarily has no effect on the value of n i=1 j2N ' ij (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). In conjunction with <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref> we conclude that ' G(t ) ' G(t ) , so if ' G(t ) is bounded, so is ' G(t ) for all q = 1; 2; .... Moreover, the level sets of G are closed by continuity of ' G in its domain. Note now that</p><p>The velocity set fvjkvk 2 2 cg is closed and bounded and hence, compact. Moreover, for all (i; j) 2 E the sets ' 01 ij ([0;c]) are closed by continuity of ' ij in the interval (0;R). They are also bounded; to see this, suppose there exist indices i and j for which ' 01 ij ([0;c]) is unbounded. Then, for any choice of N 2 (0;R), there exists an x ij 2 ' 01 ij ([0;c]) such that kx ij k 2 &gt; N . Allowing N ! R, and given that lim kx k !R 'ij = 1, it follows that for any M &gt; 0, there is a 9 We denote by the set [0; 1).</p></div>			</div>
