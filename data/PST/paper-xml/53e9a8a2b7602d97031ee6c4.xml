<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>As pointed out by Greco, Matarazzo and Slowinski <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> the original rough set approach does not consider criteria, i.e. attributes with ordered domains. However, in many real problems the ordering properties of the considered attributes may play an important role. E.g. in a bankruptcy evaluation problem, if firm A has a low value of the debt ratio (Total debt/Total assets) and firm B has a large value of the same ratio, within the original rough set approach the two firms are just discernible, but no preference is established between them two with respect to the attribute "debt ratio". Instead, from a decisional point of view, it would be better to consider firm A as preferred to firm B, and not simply "discernible", with respect to the attribute in question.</p><p>Motivated by the previous considerations, Greco, Matarazzo and Slowinski <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> proposed a new rough set approach to take into account the ordering properties of criteria. Similarly to the original rough set analysis, the proposed approach is based on approximations of a partition of objects in some pre-defined categories. However, differently from the original approach, the categories are ordered from the best to the worst and the approximations are built using dominance relations, being specific order binary relations, instead of indiscernibility relations, being equivalence relation. The considered dominance relations are built on the basis of the information supplied by condition attributes which are all criteria. In this paper we generalize this approach considering a set of condition attributes which are not all criteria.</p><p>The paper is organized in the following way. In the second section, the main concepts of the rough approximation based on criteria and attributes are introduced. In section 3 we apply the proposed approach to a didactic example to compare the results with the original rough set approach. Final section groups conclusions. and V q is a domain of the attribute q, and f : U × Q → V is a total function such that f (x, q) ∈ V q for every q ∈ Q, x ∈ U , called an information function (cf. Pawlak <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>).</p><p>Moreover, an information table can be seen as decision table assuming the set of attributes Q = C ∪ D and C ∩ D = ∅, where set C contains so called condition attributes, and D, decision attributes.</p><p>In general, the notion of attribute differs from that of criterion, because the domain (scale) of a criterion has to be ordered according to a decreasing or increasing preference, while the domain of the attribute does not have to be ordered. We will use the notion of criterion only when the preferential ordering of the attribute domain is important in a given context. Formally, for each q ∈ C which is a criterion there exists an outranking relation (Roy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>) S q on U such that xS q y means "x is at least as good as y with respect to attribute q". We suppose that S q is a total preorder, i.e. a strongly complete and transitive binary relation on U . Instead, for each attribute q ∈ C which is not a criterion, there exists an indiscernibility relation I q on U which, as usual in rough sets theory, is an equivalence binary relation, i.e. reflexive, symmetric and transitive. We denote by C &gt; the subset of attributes being criteria in C and by C = the subset of attributes which are not criteria, such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C &gt; ∪ C = = C and C &gt; ∩ C = = ∅.</formula><p>Moreover, for each P ⊆ C we denote by P &gt; the set of criteria contained in C, i.e. P &gt; = P ∩ C &gt; , and by P = the set of attributes which are not criteria contained in C, i.e. P = = P ∩ C = .</p><p>Let R P be a reflexive and transitive binary relation on U , i.e. R P is a a partial preorder on U , defined on the basis of the information given by the attributes in P ⊆ C. More precisely, for each P ⊆ C we can define R P as follows: ∀x, y ∈ U , xR P y if xS q y for each q ∈ P &gt; (i.e. x outranks y with respect to all the criteria in P ) and xI q y for each q ∈ P = (i.e. x is indiscernible with y with respect to all the attributes which are not criteria in P ). If P ⊆ C &gt; (i.e. if all the attributes in P are criteria) and xR P y, then x outranks y with respect to each q ∈ P and therefore we can say that x dominates y with respect to P . Let us observe that in general ∀x, y ∈ U and ∀P ⊆ C, xR P y if and only if x dominates y with respect to P &gt; and x is indiscernible with y with respect to P = .</p><p>Furthermore let Cl = {Cl t , t ∈ T }, T = {1, • • • , n}, be a set of classes of U , such that each x ∈ U belongs to one and only one Cl t ∈ Cl. We suppose that ∀r, s ∈ T , such that r &gt; s, the elements of Cl r are preferred (strictly or weakly <ref type="bibr">(Roy [6]</ref>)) to the elements of Cl s . More formally, if S is a comprehensive outranking relation on U , i.e. if ∀x, y ∈ U xSy means "x is at least as good as y", we suppose</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">[x ∈ Cl r , y ∈ Cl s , r &gt; s] ⇒ [xSy and not ySx].</formula><p>In simple words the classes Cl represent a comprehensive evaluation of the objects in U : the worst objects are in Cl 1 , the best objects are in Cl n , the other objects belong to the remaining classes Cl r , according to an evaluation improving with the index r ∈ T . E.g. considering a credit evaluation problem we can have T = {1, 2, 3}, Cl = {Cl 1 , Cl 2 , Cl 3 } and Cl 1 represents the class of the "un-acceptable" firms, Cl 2 represents the class of "uncertain" firms, Cl 3 represents the class of "acceptable" firms.</p><p>Starting from the classes in Cl, we can define the following sets:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Cl ≥ t = s≥t Cl s , Cl ≤ t = s≤t Cl s . Let us remark that Cl ≥ 1 = Cl ≤ n = U , Cl ≥ n = Cl n and Cl ≤ 1 = Cl 1 . Furthermore ∀t = 2, • • • , n we have: Cl ≤ t-1 = U -Cl ≥ t (1)</formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Cl ≥ t = U -Cl ≤ t-1 . (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>For each P ⊆ C, let be</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">R + P (x) = {y ∈ U : yR P x}, R - P (x) = {y ∈ U : xR P y}. Let us observe that, given x ∈ U , R + P (x)</formula><p>represents the set of all the objects y ∈ U which dominates x with respect to P &gt; (i.e. the criteria of P ) and are indiscernible with x with respect to P = (i.e. the attributes of P ). Analogously R - P (x) represents the set of all the objects y ∈ U which are dominated by x with respect to P &gt; and are indiscernible with x with respect to P = .</p><p>We say that, with respect to P ⊆ C and t ∈ T , x ∈ U belongs to Cl ≥ t without any ambiguity if x ∈ Cl ≥ t and y ∈ Cl ≥ t for all the objects y ∈ U dominating x with respect to P &gt; and indiscernible with x with respect to P = .</p><p>Formally, remembering the reflexivity of R P , we can say that x ∈ U belongs to Cl ≥ t without any ambiguity if R + P (x) ⊆ Cl ≥ t . Furthermore we say that, with respect to P ⊆ C and t ∈ T , y ∈ U could belong to Cl ≥ t if there exists at least one object x ∈ Cl ≥ t such that y dominates x with respect to P &gt; and y is indiscernible with x with respect to P = , i.e. y ∈ R + P (x). Our definitions of lower and upper approximation are based on the previous ideas. Thus, with respect to P ⊆ C, the set of all the objects belonging to Cl ≥ t without any ambiguity constitutes the lower approximation of Cl ≥ t , while the set of all the objects which could belong to Cl ≥ t constitutes the upper approximation of Cl ≥ t . Formally, ∀t ∈ T and ∀P ⊆ C we define the lower approximation of Cl ≥ t with respect to P , denoted by P Cl ≥ t , and the upper approximation of Cl ≥ t with respect to P , denoted by P Cl ≥ t , as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P Cl ≥ t = {x ∈ U : R + P (x) ⊆ Cl ≥ t }, P Cl ≥ t = x∈Cl ≥ t R + P (x).</formula><p>We say that, with respect to P ⊆ C and t ∈ T , x ∈ U belongs to Cl ≤ t without any ambiguity if x ∈ Cl ≤ t and y ∈ Cl ≤ t for all the objects y ∈ U dominated by x with respect to P &gt; and indiscernible with x with respect to P = .</p><p>Formally, remembering the reflexivity of R P , we can say that x ∈ U belongs to Cl ≤ t without any ambiguity if R - P (x) ⊆ Cl ≥ t . Furthermore we say that with respect to P ⊆ C, y ∈ U could belong to Cl ≤ t if there exists at least one object x ∈ Cl ≤ t such that x dominates y with respect to P &gt; and y is indiscernible with x with respect to P = , i.e. y ∈ R - P (x). Thus, with respect to P ⊆ C, the set of all the objects belonging to Cl ≤ t without any ambiguity constitutes the lower approximation of Cl ≤ t , while the set of all the objects which could belong to Cl ≤ t constitutes the upper approximation of Cl ≤ t . Formally, ∀t ∈ T and ∀P ⊆ C, we define the lower approximation of Cl ≤ t with respect to P , denoted by P Cl ≤ t , and the upper approximation of Cl ≤ t with respect to P , denoted by P Cl ≤ t , as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P Cl ≤ t = {x ∈ U : R - P (x) ⊆ Cl ≤ t }, P Cl ≤ t = x∈Cl ≤ t R - P (x).</formula><p>The P -boundary (doubtful region) of Cl ≥ t and Cl ≤ t are respectively defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Bn P (Cl ≥ t ) = P Cl ≥ t -P Cl ≥ t , Bn P (Cl ≤ t ) = P Cl ≤ t -P Cl ≤ t .</formula><p>∀t ∈ T and ∀P ⊆ C we define the accuracy of the approximation of Cl ≥ t and Cl ≤ t as the ratios:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">α P (Cl ≥ t ) = card(P Cl ≥ t ) card(P Cl ≥ t ) , α P (Cl ≤ t ) = card(P Cl ≤ t ) card(P Cl ≤ t )</formula><p>, respectively. The coefficient</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">γ P (Cl) = card(U -(( t∈T Bn P (Cl ≤ t )) ∪ ( t∈T Bn P (Cl ≥ t )))) card(U )</formula><p>is called the quality of approximation of partition Cl by set of attributes P , or in short, quality of classification. It expresses the ratio of all P -correctly classified objects to all objects in the table. Each minimal subset P ⊆ C such that γ P (Cl) = γ C (Cl) is called a reduct of Cl and denoted by RED Cl . Let us remark that an information table can have more than one reduct. The intersection of all reducts is called the core and denoted by CORE Cl .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">An example</head><p>The following example (based on a previous example proposed by <ref type="bibr">Pawlak [5]</ref>) illustrates the concepts introduced above. In Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, twelve warehouses are described by means of five attributes:</p><p>-A 1 , capacity of the sales staff, -A 2 , perceived quality of goods, -A 3 , high traffic location, -A 4 , geographical region, -A 5 , warehouse profit or loss.</p><p>In fact, A 1 , A 2 and A 3 are criteria, because their domains are ordered, A 4 is an attribute, whose domain is not ordered, and A 5 is a decision attribute, defining two ordered decision classes. More in detail we have that -with respect to A 1 "high" is better than "medium" and "medium" is better than "low", -with respect to A 2 "good" is better than "medium", -with respect to A 3 "yes" is better than "no", -with respect to A 5 "profit" is better than "loss". </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Comparison of the results</head><p>The advantages of the rough set approach based on dominance and indiscernibility relations over the original rough set analysis, based on the indiscernibility relation, can be summarized in the following points. The results of the approximation are more satisfactory. This improvement is represented by a smaller reduct ({A 1 , A 4 } against {A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , A 4 }). Let us observe that even if the quality of the approximation is deteriorated (0.67 vs. 0.83), this is another point in favour of the proposed approach. In fact, this difference is due to the warehouses 5 and 7. Let us notice that with respect to the attributes A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , which are criteria, warehouse 5 dominates warehouse 7 and with respect to the attribute A 4 , which is not a criterion, the warehouse 5 and 7 are indiscernible. However warehouse 5 has a comprehensive evaluation worse than warehouse 7. Therefore, this can be interpreted as an inconsistency revealed by the approximation by dominance and indiscernibility that cannot be pointed out when we consider the approximation by indiscernibility only.</p><p>From the viewpoint of the quality of the set of decision rules extracted from the information table by the two approaches, let us remark that the decision rules obtained from the approximation by dominance and indiscernibility relations give a more synthetic representation of knowledge contained in the information table. The minimal set of decision rules obtained from the new approach has a smaller number of rules (4 against 6), uses a smaller number of attributes and descriptors than the set of the decision rules obtained from the classical rough set approach, obtains rules supported by a larger number of objects. Furthermore, let us observe that the rules obtained from the original rough sets approach present some problems with respect to their interpretation. E.g. rule 3 obtained by the original rough set approach says that if the capacity of the sale staff is medium, the perceived quality of goods is medium and if the warehouse is not in a high traffic location then the warehouse makes profit. One can expect that improving the quality of the warehouse, e.g. considering a warehouse with the same capacity of the sales staff and the same quality of goods but located in a high traffic location the warehouse should also make profit. Surprisingly, the warehouse 5 of the considered decision table has these characteristics but it makes loss. Finally, let us remark that rule 4 from the new approach is an approximate rule, as well as rule 4 from the classical approach. However, rule 4 from the new approach is based on a small number of descriptors and supports a greater number of actions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>We presented a new rough set approach whose purpose is to approximate sets of objects divided in ordered predefined categories considering criteria, i.e. attributes with ordered domains, jointly with attributes which are not criteria. We showed that the basic concepts of the rough sets theory can be restored in the new context. We also applied the proposed methodology to an exemplary problem approached also with the classical rough set analysis. The comparison of the results proved the usefulness of the new approach.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Example of an information table.By means of the classical rough set approach we approximate the class Cl 1 of the warehouses making loss and the class Cl 2 of the warehouses making profit.
