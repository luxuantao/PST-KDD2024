<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HE fundamental goal of an electric power system is to maintain a secure and an economic process for electricity generation, transmission, and distribution. However, in the practical operation phase, a power system is always exposed to various disturbances, such as sudden load changes, unexpected element outages, short-circuit faults, and so on. Once occurred, the disturbance can harm the power system security and may result in catastrophic consequences such as wide-spread blackouts that affect the society and the economy significantly.</p><p>As one essential security criterion, dynamic security refers to the ability of a power system to survive the dynamic transition from an initial operating equilibrium to a viable new equilibrium with most limits bounded after being subject to a disturbance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. To protect a power system against the risk of blackouts, DSA needs to be performed to examine various credible disturbances in advance. Once the disturbance is identified as insecure, appropriate security control actions need to be implemented to protect the power system if the contingency really occurs. Mathematically, the dynamics of a power system can be modeled as a large set of nonlinear DAEs, which cannot be analytically solved. The conventional DSA is therefore based on TDS that solves the DAEs via step-by-step integrations. Although accurate, the TDS method is very time-consuming and difficult to provide useful information about the system's dynamic security characteristics.</p><p>With continuous load growth yet unmatched infrastructure investments, modern power systems are being pushed to operate near their dynamic security limit. In the meantime, with the evolution to the smart grid paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, today's power systems are integrated with a growing capacity of renewable energy resources (such as wind and solar power), which are generally stochastic and difficult to predict, bringing significant uncertainties to the operation of a power system. Consequently, system operators are expecting much faster DSA tools to enable real-time monitoring of the power system dynamic security condition.</p><p>In recent years, the intelligent system (IS) strategy has been identified as a promising approach to fulfill this need <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. By learning from a dynamic security database, the nonlinear relationship between the power system operating parameters (input) and the corresponding security index (output) can be extracted and reformulated in an IS. During the online application phase, the system's stability can be assessed as soon as the input is available. The IS-based DSA not only provides much faster online decision-making speed, but also outperforms the conventional methods for its less data requirement, stronger generalization capacity, and extensibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, making it an ideal candidate for future smart grid applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>In the literature, a variety of ISs based on learning algorithms, such as ANN <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, SVM <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, DT <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and data-mining technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, have been reported. However, most of them are designed for transient stability assessment, which focuses on the generator rotor angle performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Yet, very few deal with other dynamic security criteria such as voltage stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Besides, it is observed that the reported models usually suffer from extensive learning/tuning burden and unsatisfactory accuracy. A comprehensive review and classification on previous works can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>This paper focuses on another yet increasingly important dynamic security concern-the short-term voltage stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and develops a hierarchical IS for its real-time assessment. Unlike rotor angle stability, the short-term voltage stability involves a fast and complex load dynamics, which is even more difficult to capture. The instability can propagate very rapidly and trigger significant load shedding or even wide-spread blackouts. Nowadays, due to the increased penetration of the wind power, the short-term voltage stability is becoming a critical concern in terms of LVRT capability for wind turbines. To address the ST-VSA problem, we employ a feedforward NNRWs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and employ the ensemble learning strategy to design a hierarchical IS. We model the ST-VSA problem as a transient voltage collapse subproblem that corresponds to a classification process and an unacceptable dynamic voltage deviation subproblem that corresponds to a regression process. The two subproblems are sequentially handled by two ensemble-based classifier and predictor models. The developed IS is numerically tested on the New England 39-bus system, and compared with other popular learning algorithms. The simulation results have verified its effectiveness and superiority in accuracy and learning speed over the compared algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTIONS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Short-Term Voltage Instability: Mechanism and Phenomenon</head><p>The IEEE and CIGRE joint task force defines the voltage stability as the ability of a power system to maintain steady voltages at all buses in the system after being subjected to a disturbance from a given initial operating condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. As a major threat to the power system security, the loss of voltage stability can result in progressive voltage drop or rapid voltage collapse, which can trigger significant load shedding or even wide-spread blackouts. Over the past decades, many major blackouts around the world have been found directly associated with this phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>In general, voltage instability stems from the attempt of load dynamics to restore the power consumption beyond the capability of the combined transmission and generation system <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, the voltage stability can be divided into the long-term and the short-term phenomena. The long-term voltage stability involves slower acting equipment, such as tap-changing transformers, thermostatically controlled loads, and generator current limiters <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. It can be modeled as algebraic equations and solved by power flow-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Therefore, its computation speed can be fast enough to enable (near) real-time implementation. By contrast, the short-term voltage stability phenomenon involves complex dynamics of load components such as induction motors tending to restore their consumed power in a very short time frame (say several seconds) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Following a large disturbance, the induction motors decelerate dramatically by the voltage dip or may stall if the electrical torque cannot overcome the mechanical load. This in turn draws a very high reactive current that affects adversely the voltage magnitudes. As a consequence, an unacceptable transient voltage performance (e.g., delayed voltage recovery) may be experienced, and/or transient voltage collapse may occur. With increased penetration of induction motor loads (e.g., air-conditioners), today's power systems tend to be more vulnerable to the short-term voltage instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Dynamic Load Model</head><p>As mentioned above, the key driving force of voltage instability is the tendency of dynamic loads to restore their consumed power within a very short time frame. Therefore, modeling dynamic loads is a necessity for the short-term voltage stability study.</p><p>In this paper, we employ a composite load model CLOD defined in the commercial power system simulation package Power System Simulator for Engineering (PSS/E) to represent various dynamic load components. As shown in  Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, this load model is an aggregation of LM, SM, discharge lighting, transformer exciting current, and constant power load, as well as the voltage-dependent load, all of which are fed from many real-world substations. However, other dynamic load models can also be used if necessary.</p><p>The mathematical model of induction motors is also represented by DAEs. Hence, the whole mathematical model of the power system for the short-term voltage stability study composes a very large set of nonlinear DAEs that can be compactly formulated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">dx dt = f(x, y, p, λ) (1) 0 = g(x, y, p, λ)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where set (1) corresponds to the differential equations of the system components, including generators, motors, dynamic loads, as well as their control systems, and so on; and set (2) corresponds to the algebraic equations of the network and static loads. Vector x denotes the state variable (e.g., generator angles and dynamic bus voltages); vector y denotes algebraic variables (e.g., static load voltages and angles); vector p stands for controllable parameters (e.g., AVR set-points); and vector λ represents uncontrollable parameters (e.g., load levels). The DAEs cannot be analytically solved. Rather, one can solve it via step-by-step integrations. In practice, the ST-VSA is realized based on TDS, which is, however, very computationally burdensome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Simulation Study</head><p>Using the composite load model CLOD, we examine the impact of load dynamics on the short-term voltage performance of a power system. Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> show the dynamic voltage response in the New England 39-bus system following the short-circuit disturbances with different severity degrees <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>The voltage trajectories are obtained by TDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. For each figure, the upper and lower windows, respectively, show the voltage response without the load dynamics (i.e., the dynamic load model is not used, and a constant power load is used), and with load dynamics (i.e., the dynamic load model is used).</p><p>For each figure, it can be seen that without load dynamics, the bus voltages recover very fast to the normal level and the system is stable. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, a very severe disturbance is applied, and the lower window shows that transient voltage collapse occurs ∼1.6 s. The voltage collapse is an unacceptable situation for a practical power system, since it can lead to more serious consequences, such as cascading failures and/or blackouts. For Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, a less severe disturbance is applied, and the lower window shows that some buses (in particular, bus 20 and bus 34) experience a prolonged voltage depression and delayed voltage recovery. In practice, the delayed voltage recovery can trigger UVLS devices that curtail a significant amount of loads.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Short-Term Voltage Stability Indices</head><p>As shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, the short-term voltage stability study mainly focuses on: 1) fast voltage collapse (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) or 2) unacceptable postdisturbance voltage deviation (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</p><p>To evaluate the short-term voltage performance, some industrial criteria, such as North American Electric Reliability Corporation criteria, has been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. However, they only define the unacceptable voltage-dip magnitude and the duration time, and can only provide a binary answer to the stability status, namely, stable or unstable.</p><p>In this paper, we model the ST-VSA problem as the transient voltage collapse subproblem and an unacceptable dynamic voltage deviation subproblem. The first subproblem checks the existence of a short-term equilibrium of the postcontingency system and the second subproblem quantifies the degree of stability.</p><p>1) Transient Voltage Collapse Index: The evaluation of transient voltage collapse is a binary question, that is, whether or not the system loses the short-term equilibrium following a disturbance. Consequently, the TVCI can be a binary index, namely, 1 or 0.</p><p>2) Transient Voltage Severity Index for Unacceptable Dynamic Voltage Deviation: After the system withholds a short-term equilibrium, the system may still experience unacceptable voltage deviation, such as prolonged voltage depression and delayed voltage recovery. Actions of motor protective devices can trip a significant amount of loads. In contrast to transient voltage collapse, the severity of an unacceptable dynamic voltage deviation can be varying depending on the severity of a disturbance. Hence, a continuous index should be used to quantify such phenomenon. In practice, the degree of severity in voltage deviation can be reflected by the magnitude of the voltage violation and the associated duration time. This paper employs a straightforward index called TVSI proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> to quantify this phenomenon</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">TVSI = N i=1 T t =T c TVDI i,t N × (T -T c ) (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>where N is the total number of buses in the system, T is the considered transient time frame, T c is the fault clearing time, and TVDI is the transient voltage deviation index, calculated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">TVDI i,t = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ |V i,t -V i,0 | V i,0 , if |V i,t -V i,0 | V i,0 ≥ μ 0, otherwise ∀t ∈[T c , T ]<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where V i,t denotes the voltage magnitude of bus i at time t, which is obtained from TDS, and μ is the threshold to define unacceptable voltage deviation level, which can be set according to the industrial criteria, e.g., 20%. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. TVSI only accounts for the buses with unacceptable voltage violation during the transient period, and it measures not only the voltage violation magnitude but also the associated duration time in the whole system level. It can provide a quantitative comparison of the system transient voltage performance following a disturbance. A smaller TVSI value means the transient voltage performance is better.</p><p>Both of the indices can be calculated via performing TDS to obtain the voltage trajectories, while the former is a binary value and the later is a continuous value. Taking the simulation results in Section II-C, for example, the TVCI is 0 for  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PROPOSED INTELLIGENT SYSTEM</head><p>The ST-VSA can be converted as a classification subproblem for transient voltage collapse and a regression subproblem for unacceptable dynamic voltage deviation. The latter depends on the result of the former. In this paper, we develop a hierarchical IS for the real-time ST-VSA. The IS is based on the ensemble learning strategy where NNRWs are employed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Neural Nets With Random Weights</head><p>NNRWs were originally proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> which suggested a fast implementation of learning for SLFNs (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</p><p>Given a training data set with N instances in total,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ℵ N = {(x j , t j )|x j ∈ R n , t j ∈ R m } N j =1</formula><p>, where x j is the n × 1 input vector and t j is a m ×1 target vector, the output function of the SLFN with Ñ hidden nodes is</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">f Ñ (x j ) = Ñ i=1 β i • ϑ(w i • x j + b i ) = t j , j = 1, 2, . . . , N (5)</formula><p>where ϑ is the activation function, w i is the weight vector connecting the ith hidden node and the input nodes, β i is the weight vector connecting the i th hidden node and the output nodes, b i is the bias of the i th hidden node, and w i •x j denotes the inner product of w i and x j .</p><p>NNRW is completely different from the traditional iterative learning based ANNs as it learns via randomly selecting the input weights and biases for hidden nodes w and b, and analytically determining the output weights β via direct matrix calculations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) can be rewritten into a compact format as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Hβ = T (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">)</formula><p>where H is called the hidden layer output matrix of the network. On a training data set, given the activation function and the hidden node number, the NNRW learning process can be briefly summarized as three major steps.</p><p>Step 1: Randomly generate the input weights w i and b i , for i = 1, . . . , Ñ .</p><p>Step 2: Calculate the hidden layer output matrix H.</p><p>Step 3: Calculate the output weights matrix β = H † T, where H † can be Moor-Penrose generalized inverse of H.</p><p>NNRW can be applied for both data regression and pattern classification, where the real-time requirement with domain applications is concerned with. Compared with the traditional learning algorithms, NNRW builds a learner model through solving a standard linear regression problem; therefore, its learning speed can be thousands times faster and requires much less computation memory. Another important merit of NNRW is its efficient tuning mechanism: given an activation function, only the hidden neuron nodes number needs to be tuned, which can be efficiently achieved via a linear validation procedure. Besides, NNRW can avoid difficulties, such as stopping criteria, learning rate setting, learning epochs, and local minima, that can be commonly encountered by the traditional algorithms.</p><p>In the literature, NNRW has been comprehensively validated on a number of benchmark and real-world problems from both classification and regression areas, showing the feasibility for data modeling in real-time. However, the random weight neural networks perform unstably because each resulting model can be regarded as an instance of a random variable. Some supervised mechanisms should be researched, so that the selected random weights to initialize the neural networks can achieve a better modeling performance (at least better than the mean of the random models).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Neural Network Ensemble</head><p>The simplicity and efficiency properties of the NNRW make it a promising candidate for tackling large-scale learning tasks. However, as an undesired side effect, the randomly selected input parameters of the NNRW may lead to stability issues, meaning that the classification/regression results are not consistent for different runs.</p><p>As extensively investigated and demonstrated in the literature, ensemble learning scheme, such as bagging and boosting <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, is an effective strategy to increase the accuracy of a single learner. By combining a set of different single learners, they can compensate for each other, and the whole model can reduce aggregated variance and bias, and therefore tends to increase accuracy over the individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. As a general strategy open to any learning methods, the feasibility and efficiency of the ensemble learning, however, depends greatly on the characteristic of the individual learners. Since NNRW is stochastic in nature, and has a very fast learning speed, it is an ideal candidate for ensemble learning. Besides, benefiting from the ensemble effect, the robustness of single NNRWs can be improved by the whole model. The effectiveness of building ensemble for NNRWs has been verified in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Based on the idea proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, this paper designs a new ensemble model of NNRWs for the ST-VSA problem. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>, in the ensemble model, M single NNRWs are combined in parallel, all of which have common input variables. In the initialization stage, the ensemble model randomly assigns a hidden node number to each NNRW within an optimal range, [L 1 , L 2 ], which is determined from a pretuning procedure. In the training stage, the single NNRWs are trained according to Step 1-Step 3 and export their individual outputs. Given the stochastic nature of the NNRW, the output of each NNRW can be diverse. In result-aggregation stage, for regression problem, the average value of the individual outputs is used, and for classification problem, the majority class of the individual outputs is adopted as the final classification result.</p><p>It is important to note that, in addition to inherently selecting random input layer parameters for single NNRWs, the ensemble model also assigns random hidden node numbers to the NNRW individuals; this, on the one hand, aims to expand the internal diversity of the ensemble model, which is paramount for accuracy improvement, and on the other hand, is motivated by the observation that the NNRW usually has an optimal range rather than a fixed number of hidden nodes (since under different random input parameter sets, the optimal number of hidden nodes can be varied) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In doing so, the randomness can be generalized, leading to enhanced robustness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Application for Real-Time ST-VSA</head><p>In the offline stage, a voltage stability database is prepared by performing comprehensive TDS considering various scenarios and/or collecting fault records. Then, the IS is trained by the database. In the real-time application stage, once the input is available, the short-term voltage stability can be assessed by the IS rapidly, and the results are used to support control decision-makings. Also in the online stage, with updated system information (e.g., network structure, load composition, and so on), a new stability database can be generated to update/enrich the IS. Note that this online updating aims to keep the IS adaptive to unexpected system changes.</p><p>The proposed hierarchical IS for the real-time ST-VSA is conceptually described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>.</p><p>The IS consists of an ensemble classifier and an ensemble predictor based on the proposed NNRW ensemble. They are pretrained in the offline stage with forecasted operating conditions (e.g., day ahead) and corresponding voltage collapse status and TVSI. For the online application, the realtime system measurements (including generator outputs, bus loads, bus voltage magnitudes, bus angles, and so on) are collected by Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition or PMU devices. Once the input measurements are obtained, they are first dropped to the classifier which determines the transient voltage collapse condition of an unknown operating condition with respect to a certain disturbance, if voltage collapse is ascertained, remedial control actions should be taken to protect the power system from the voltage collapse should the disturbance really occurs; otherwise, the measurements are then dropped to the predictor to evaluate the TVSI of the operating condition. If the predicted TVSI is unacceptable, e.g., less than a certain threshold, remedial actions will be armed. During the online application phase, the classifier and predictor can also be updated using the latest online operating information.</p><p>Due to the very fast training speed of the NNRW, the IS model can be updated online. The updating can be done periodically, e.g., hourly or half-daily, depending on practical needs. The data for updating can be obtained from TDS results on the real-time system operation points. The simulation results can be saved as new training data. Such new training data can be used as a new set or attached to the initial training database to retrain the IS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Automatic Feature Selection</head><p>Automatic feature selection aims to select a most important subset from the whole input set for training the model. Thus, the irrelevant/redundant features can be removed and the total size of the training data can be significantly reduced, resulting in faster training speed and higher accuracy. For the power system DSA applications, an automatic feature selection can identify the significant operating variables that best describe the dynamic security characteristics of the system, and hence provide useful information for security control <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Besides, using only the significant features as the DSA model input can reduce the parameter measurement requirements.</p><p>Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> present a comprehensive survey and a review of feature selection techniques for intelligent DSA and introduce an alternative algorithm called RELIEF. Unlike other feature selection algorithms, the idea behind RELIEF is to evaluate the quality of single features according to how well their values distinguish among instances near each other. It not only considers the difference in features' values and classes, but also the distance between the instances, so good features can gather similar instances and separate dissimilar ones, providing qualitative estimation on the importance of the features. RELIEF has been successfully used in our previous works and yield satisfactory results <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. This paper also applies the RELIEF for the automatic feature selection for the proposed ST-VSA model.</p><p>The basic RELIEF is to iteratively update the weight of each feature as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">W [X] i+1 = W [X] i -diff(X, R i , H )/m + diff(X, R i , M)/m, i ≤ m (7)</formula><p>where X denotes a feature, R i is the instance sampled in the i th iteration, H is the nearest instance from the same class as R i (called nearest hit), while M is the nearest instance from the different classes with R i (called nearest miss), and m is the number of sampled instances guaranteeing the weights between [-1, 1]. Function diff(X, R, R ) calculates the difference between the values of feature X for two instances R and R</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">diff(X, R, R ) = |value(X, R) -value(X, R )| max(X) -min(X) . (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>From the statistics point of view, the weight of feature X is an approximation of the difference of probabilities</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">W [X] = P(diff. value of X|nearest inst. from the diff. class) -P(diff. value of X|nearest inst. from the same class).<label>(9)</label></formula><p>To deal with noises, incomplete data, and multiclass problems, RELIEF was extended with the following weight updating equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">W [X] i+1 = W [X] i - k j =1 diff(X, R i , H j )/(m • k) + k C =class(R i ) ⎡ ⎣ P(C) 1 -P(class(R i )) • k j =1 diff(X, R i , M j (C)) ⎤ ⎦ (m • k) (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>where C is a class label, P(C) is the prior probability of class C, and k is an user-defined parameter. Instead of finding the nearest one hit and miss, (10) finds k nearest hits and misses to average their contribution in updating the weight, thereby reducing the risk of miss estimation; the introduction of P(C) aims to estimate the ability of separating each pair of classes.</p><p>To identify a set of significant features for training the NNRW ensemble, the features with higher W values can be selected since they can better differentiate instances among classes. As supplementary benefits, the selected features can provide insight into the critical variables that impact the short-term voltage most, which is valuable for designing preventive controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. SIMULATION RESULTS</head><p>The developed hierarchical IS is tested on the New England 10-machine 39-bus system (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>), which is a popular test system for stability study <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>The numerical simulation is conducted on a 64-bit PC with 3.1-GHz CPU and 4-GB RAM. TDS is performed using commercial software PSS/E <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and the proposed algorithms are realized in the MATLAB platform. For the test system, the dynamic load parameter is assumed as: 1) LM-20%; 2) SM-30%; 3) discharge lighting-5%; 4) transformer exciting current-5%; 5) constant power load-30%; and 6) voltage-dependent load-10%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Database Generation</head><p>To train the proposed IS model, a comprehensive stability database is necessary. In practice, this can be obtained by performing simulations on various scenarios and/or fault recordings. In this paper, we artificially generate such a database through OPF calculation and TDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. A total of 700 different operating states covering a variety of different load/generation patterns ranging from 80% to 120% of the base loading level are generated through OPF calculation. A three-phase short-circuit fault is considered first (denoted as fault #1). The fault is applied to bus 15 with a duration time of 0.2 s. For each operating condition, the following candidate features are selected as the input vector: 1) P, Q load, voltage magnitude, and angle of each load bus; 2) P, Q generation of each generator; and 3) total P, Q load and generation of the whole system. For each operating condition, there are a total of 136 candidate features.</p><p>TDS is then performed on each generated operating condition to determine their TVCI and TVSI. The total simulation time is 5 s and the simulation step is 0.01 s. The illustration of the dynamic response of this system under the assumed fault is already given in the lower window of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. In calculating the TVSI, μ is set to 20%. For the 700 generated samples, 256 of them (36.6%) experience voltage collapse and 444 (63.4%) do not experience voltage collapse.</p><p>The structure of the short-term voltage stability database is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>.</p><p>Note that the input features are normalized into the range of [0, 1]. For TVCI, 1 represents the voltage collapse occurs   while 0 not. Only the samples with 0 TVCI have a TVSI. The histogram plot of the TVSI of the samples is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>, where it can be seen that the range [0.3, 1.5] occupies the major proportion.</p><p>Note that during the training phase the classifier is trained by all of the samples and the TVCI is used as the training target, while the predictor is only trained by the samples whose TVCI is 0, and only the TVSI is used as the training target.</p><p>Given the 700 samples, we randomly pick up 25%, i.e., 175 samples as the testing set, leaving the remaining 525 samples serve as the training set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Feature Selection</head><p>We use the RELIEF algorithm to select the significant features. The RELIEF values of the 136 features are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>, where it can be seen that different features can IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>. RELIEF value for each candidate feature. varying capabilities to distinguish the operating conditions in terms of the status of the short-term voltage stability. A large RELIEF value indicates a stronger capability. The top three features are the voltage angle of bus 24, Q load of bus 27, and voltage angle of bus 26, all of them are voltage related variables of the system. In the following test, we use the top 20 features as the model inputs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Model Tuning</head><p>According to the NNRW theory, a certain hidden node number should be predetermined before training. This corresponds to the optimal hidden node range [L 1 , L 2 ] for the NNRW ensemble. Since the hidden node has a direct impact on the accuracy of a single NNRW, the range [L 1 , L 2 ] needs to be well tuned in advance. For this purpose, the training data set is randomly divided into two nonoverlapped sets, one for training and the other for validation. [L 1 , L 2 ] can be determined at the range where the lowest validation error is obtained. To measure the performance of the proposed IS, percentage classification accuracy is used for the classifier, and the MAPE is used for the predictor</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">MAPE = d i=1 |y i -ŷi | |y i | • d (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>where y i and ŷi are the actual and predicted TVSI value, respectively, and d is the total number of the testing samples. The tuning profiles are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">12</ref>. It can be seen that for the classifier, with continuously increased hidden nodes, the classification accuracy increases sharply, but then reduces gradually. The highest classification accuracy 12. Tuning profile for the predictor. range occurs when 30 to 60 hidden nodes are used. For the predictor, a similar trend is also observed (with continuously added hidden nodes, the prediction error decreases sharply and then increases gradually), and when 15 to 50 hidden nodes are used, the resulting MAPE is at the lowest range. Therefore, these hidden node numbers are used to train the ensemble model.</p><p>Also from Figs. 11 and 12, it can be observed from the tuning process that a single NNRW can achieve maximum 95.5% classification accuracy and minimum 4.56% prediction MAPE. Besides, it is worth mentioning that the training of a single NNRW is very fast, it only costs 0.01 s to learn the tuning data set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Performance Test</head><p>In this paper, we use 100 individual NNRWs to build the ensemble model. Once the model is well trained, it can be applied online. As soon as the input variables (significant features) are available (e.g., measured by PMUs), the shortterm voltage stability can be determined instantaneously.</p><p>The testing set is used to validate the trained IS model. For comparison purpose, the single NNRW is also tested. Besides, some state-of-the-art single learning algorithms, including Radial basis function neural network, SVM and DT, are also tested with the same training and testing data sets. The performance of the algorithms is presented in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_1">III</ref>.</p><p>As Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref> shows, the proposed IS outperforms the others in both classification and prediction performance. Importantly, it should be noted that the proposed IS significantly increases the performance over the single NNRW, achieving a very high classification accuracy and a very low prediction error.</p><p>As Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">III</ref> shows, the training efficiency of the proposed IS is very high, although 100 NNRWs are used, the overall training time is 28 s, depending on the number of hidden nodes, one single NNRW only cost ∼0.3 s for training, this owes to the unique learning process of the NNRW-randomly selecting the input weights and analytically determining the output weights. Compared with other learning models, DT is fastest since its learning procedure does not require time-consuming iterative process. SVM and RBFNN are generally slower due to the time-consuming optimization process during the model training. Given the very high training speed, the online updating of the model can be readily achieved, e.g., periodically and half-daily. Once TDS results are available, they can be attached to the original training data to retrain the IS model. For all of the models, the classification/prediction process is very fast, which costs around 1 for one single test sample, indicating a real-time decision-making speed for ST-VSA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Extended Accuracy Test</head><p>In the above test, only fault contingency is considered. In practice, it is usually needed to assess more fault contingencies depending on likelihood to occur. For a comprehensive test of the accuracy, another two contingencies are tested here. The two contingencies have previously been studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and their details are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">IV</ref>. Given the 700 generated operating states, the two contingencies are simulated yielding to another two databases. The databases are then used to train and test the proposed IS model and compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms through the same procedure of the above test. The classification and prediction performance are shown in Tables V and VI, respectively.  To summarize the overall performance, the average performance metrics on the three contingencies for each model are compared in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">13</ref>. In average, the proposed IS model still outperforms the others in both classification and prediction subproblems, owing to the ensemble effect.</p><p>V. CONCLUSION Today's power systems are integrated with growing capacity of renewable energies, such as wind and solar power. These renewable energies are intermittent in nature, and hence can introduce significant uncertainties and complexities to secure and reliable operation of the power system. In order to protect the power system against dynamic insecurity that could lead to blackouts, the real-time DSA is becoming necessary in the control center. The IS strategy is a promising approach to enable the real-time DSA. Although widely researched in the literature, most works focus on the rotor angle stability problem. This paper concentrates on another yet increasingly important dynamic insecurity phenomenon-the shortterm voltage instability, which involves a fast and complex load dynamics. We decompose the whole problem into a transient voltage collapse subproblem that corresponds to a classification process, and an unacceptable dynamic voltage deviation subproblem that corresponds to a regression process. IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS The so-called TVSI is used to quantify the unacceptable dynamic voltage deviation. Then, a hierarchical IS is developed to address the two subproblems sequentially. The IS is based on the ensemble learning strategy and NNRW algorithm. It can be implemented in an offline training, a real-time application, and an online updating pattern. The RELIEF algorithm is used to select the most significant features as the training input. The proposed IS is validated on the New England 39-bus system and compared with some other state-of-theart learning algorithms. The simulation results show that the hierarchical IS can effectively increase the performance over a single NNRW and outperform the compared algorithms in both classification and prediction.</p><p>In the future, it would be interesting to expand the proposed model to other stability assessment problems, e.g., frequency stability assessment. Besides, more efforts can be devoted to the ensemble strategy and results aggregation scheme.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
