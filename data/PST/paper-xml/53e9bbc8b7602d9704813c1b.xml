<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>There has been much interest in recent years in cryptographic schemes based on pairings on elliptic curves. In a flurry of research results, many new and novel protocols have been suggested, including one-round three-way key exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, identity-based encryption <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">75]</ref>, identity-based signatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70]</ref>, and short signature schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Some of these protocols have already been deployed in the marketplace, and developers are eager to deploy many others.</p><p>However, whereas standard elliptic curve cryptosystems such as ElGamal encryption or ECDSA can be implemented using randomly generated elliptic curves, the elliptic curves required to implement pairing-based systems must have certain properties that randomly generated elliptic curves are unlikely to have. To this end it is important that it should be easy to find such "pairing-friendly" elliptic curves for all kinds of applications and all desired levels of security.</p><p>Our contribution in this paper is threefold:</p><p>• To gather all of the existing constructions of pairing-friendly elliptic curves into a single coherent framework; • To describe several new constructions of pairing-friendly elliptic curves that improve on existing constructions for certain embedding degrees; • To recommend curves to use for a variety of security levels and performance requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Pairings and Embedding Degrees</head><p>The most common pairings used in applications are the Tate and Weil pairings on elliptic curves over finite fields; other proposed pairings include the Eta pairing <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the Ate pairing <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, and their generalizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Given an elliptic curve E defined over a finite field F q , all of these pairings take as inputs points on E that are defined over F q or over an extension field F q k and give as output an element of F × q k . For a pairingbased cryptosystem to be secure, the discrete logarithm problems in the group E(F q ) of F q -rational points on E and in the multiplicative group F × q k must both be computationally infeasible. The best known discrete logarithm algorithm on elliptic curves is the parallelized Pollard rho algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">86]</ref>, which has running time O( √ r) where r is the size of largest prime-order subgroup of E(F q ). On the other hand, the best algorithm for discrete logarithm computation in finite fields is the index calculus attack (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>) which has running time subexponential in the field size. Thus to achieve the same level of security in both groups, the size q k of the extension field must be significantly larger than r. The ratio of these sizes is measured by two parameters: the embedding degree, which in most cases <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">1</ref> is the degree k of the extension field that the pairing maps into; and the parameter ρ = log q/ log r, which measures the base field size relative to the size of the prime-order subgroup on the curve. We will call an elliptic curve with a small embedding degree and a large prime-order subgroup pairing-friendly. (For precise definitions of all of these terms, see Sect. <ref type="bibr">2.)</ref> There has been much speculation about the exact sizes of r and q k required to match standard sizes of keys for symmetric encryption, using, for example, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>. The problem is complicated by the fact that the effectiveness of index calculus attacks is not yet fully understood, especially over extension fields. We outline in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> our own view of the matter, distilled from material taken from various authoritative sources, in particular <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. The listed bit sizes are those matching the security levels of the SKIPJACK, Triple-DES, AES-Small, AES-Medium, and AES-Large symmetric key encryption schemes.</p><p>As we can see from the table, to achieve varied levels of security it is necessary to construct curves with varying embedding degree. We give two different ranges for the embedding degree because the ratio of the extension field size q k to the subgroup size r depends not only on the embedding degree k but also on the parameter ρ; specifically, we have log q k / log r = ρ • k. Thus, for example, if we wish to set up a system with a 160-bit elliptic curve subgroup and a 1280-bit extension field, we could use a curve with embedding degree 8 and ρ = 1 (though we currently know of no such curves), a curve with embedding degree 4 and ρ = 2, or anything in between with ρ • k = 8.</p><p>In general, curves with small ρ-values are desirable in order to speed up arithmetic on the elliptic curve. For example, an elliptic curve with a 160-bit subgroup and ρ = 1 is defined over a 160-bit field, while a curve with a 160-bit subgroup and ρ = 2 is defined over a 320-bit field, and the group operation can be computed much more quickly on the first curve. On the other hand, though, at times a larger ρ-value is acceptable for the sake of fast pairing evaluation. For example, at a security level of 80 bits, using a 512bit q, a 160-bit r, and k = 2 represents an efficient setup for some choices of curves and protocol; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[78]</ref> for a detailed explanation. Therefore k = 2 (marked with an asterisk) has been included in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> at the 80-bit security level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Our Framework</head><p>A primary contribution of this paper is to give a classification of the known methods for constructing pairing-friendly elliptic curves. A diagram outlining this classification is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>The designers of the first pairing-based protocols proposed the use of supersingular elliptic curves <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. However, such curves are limited to embedding degree k = 2 for prime fields and k ≤ 6 in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, so for higher embedding degrees, we must turn to ordinary curves.</p><p>There are a large number of constructions of ordinary elliptic curves with prescribed embedding degree. All of these constructions are based on the complex multiplication (CM) method of curve construction, and all construct curves over prime fields. The CM algorithm takes as input a prime power q (which in our applications will always be prime) and an integer n, and constructs an elliptic curve over F q with n points <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In Sect. 2 we will give a list of conditions for a given k such that if q and n satisfy these conditions, then the algorithm will terminate in a reasonable amount of time and the curve constructed will have embedding degree k.</p><p>The highest-level distinction we make in our framework is between methods that construct individual curves and those that construct parametric families of curves. The former type are methods that give integers q and r such that there is an elliptic curve E over F q with a subgroup of order r and embedding degree k with respect to r. The latter type are methods that give polynomials q(x) and r(x) such that if q(x 0 ) is a prime MNT, GMV, Freeman Cyclotomic families (Sect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref>.1) Sporadic families (Sect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref>.2) Scott-Barreto families (Sect. <ref type="bibr">6.3)</ref> power for some value of x 0 , there is an elliptic curve E over F q(x 0 ) with a subgroup of order r(x 0 ) and embedding degree k with respect to r(x 0 ). (In practice the prime power q(x 0 ) is always prime.) Parametric families have the advantage that the sizes of the finite field and the prime-order subgroup can be varied simply by specifying x 0 .</p><p>Supersingular curves, which we discuss in Sect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref>, do not fall into families. There are also two constructions in the literature that produce ordinary elliptic curves with small embedding degree that are not given in terms of families: the method of Cocks and Pinch <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and that of Dupont, Enge, and Morain <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. In Sect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> we describe these two methods and discuss their merits and drawbacks.</p><p>The remaining constructions of ordinary elliptic curves with small embedding degree fall into the category of families of curves. Here we make another distinction. The construction of such curves depends on our being able to find integers x, y satisfying an equation of the form Dy 2 = 4q(x)t (x) 2   for some fixed positive integer D and polynomials q(x) and t (x). The parameter D is the CM discriminant (often called simply the "discriminant"), which we will define formally in Sect. <ref type="bibr">2</ref>. In some cases, this equation will only have solutions for some set of (x, y) that grows exponentially; we call such families sparse. In others, this equation may be satisfied for any x, and in fact we can write y as a polynomial in x, and the equation gives an equality of polynomials; we call such families complete.</p><p>Sparse families, discussed in Sect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref>, are primarily based on the ideas of Miyaji, Nakabayashi, and Takano <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. These families give most of the known constructions of curves of prime order but are currently limited to embedding degrees k ≤ 10. Complete families, discussed in Sect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref>, exist for arbitrary k but usually lead to curves with ρ &gt; 1.</p><p>All of the constructions of complete families can be viewed as choosing a polynomial r(x) parameterizing the pairing-friendly subgroup size and computing polynomials in Q[x] that map to certain elements of the number field K = Q[x]/(r(x)). We can then further classify the complete families according to the properties of the number field K. We briefly list here the families and the corresponding type of number field.</p><p>• Cyclotomic families (Sect. <ref type="bibr">6.1)</ref>: K is a cyclotomic field, r is a cyclotomic polynomial, and K contains √ -D for some small D. Constructions appear in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</p><p>• "Sporadic" families (Sect. <ref type="bibr">6.2</ref>): K is a (perhaps trivial) extension of a cyclotomic field, r is not a cyclotomic polynomial, and K contains √ -D for some small D. Constructions appear in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>; we give new examples in Sect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref>. <ref type="bibr">2</ref>.</p><p>• Scott-Barreto families (Sect. <ref type="bibr">6.3</ref>): K is an extension of a cyclotomic field, and K contains no √ -D for any small D. Constructions appear in <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">New Constructions</head><p>In addition to classifying construction methods, in Sect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> we give several new constructions of pairing-friendly elliptic curves. Our focus throughout is to construct families with minimal ρ-value, as we believe that such families will be most useful in practice.</p><p>In Sect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref>.1 we use the method of Brezing and Weng to demonstrate families of pairing-friendly elliptic curves with ρ ≤ 2 for every embedding degree k ≤ 1000 that is not divisible by <ref type="bibr">72.</ref> Examples of these constructions have previously appeared in the literature for specific values of k, but the families have not been described in the general terms that we use, and even the examples that do appear have not all been shown to satisfy the criteria necessary to produce valid parameters for constructing pairingfriendly curves (our Definition 2.7). We conjecture that our constructions extend to all k not divisible by 72; these conjectures are mainly of theoretical interest, as we do not expect that curves with k &gt; 1000 will be necessary in practice in the foreseeable future.</p><p>In Sects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref>.2 and 6.3 we give a few more examples of new complete families of curves for certain small values of k. Most of these families have ρ-values smaller than those achieved by any construction in Sect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref>. <ref type="bibr">1.</ref> Our most significant contribution with regard to new constructions is Theorem 6. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref>. The constructions of Sects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref>.1 and <ref type="bibr">6.2</ref> have in common that we first fix a (small) squarefree CM discriminant and then compute the corresponding complete family of curves, all with the same discriminant. We refer to such constructions as basic constructions. However, to ensure maximum security, some users may desire a greater degree of randomness in cryptosystem parameters. Such users will prefer more flexibility with regard to the CM discriminant, in particular to be able to have variable discriminants within a family of curves. This is achieved through Theorem <ref type="bibr">6.19</ref>, which, given a parametric family of curves with fixed discriminant that satisfies certain conditions, allows us to build a family of curves with variable square-free CM discriminant and the same ρvalue. Thus, combining a basic construction with Theorem 6.19 yields a general method for constructing families of curves with variable CM discriminant and ρ &lt; 2. Previous constructions with variable discriminant required either ρ ≥ 2 or k ≤ 6.</p><p>In Sect. <ref type="bibr">6.4</ref> we use Theorem <ref type="bibr">6.19</ref> to give examples of variable-discriminant parametric families for any embedding degree k satisfying gcd(k, 24) ∈ {1, 2, 3, 6, 12}. In particular, Constructions 6.20 and 6.24 combine Theorem <ref type="bibr">6.19</ref> with the method of Brezing and Weng to give new families of curves for k ≡ 3 (mod 4) and k ≡ 2 (mod 8), respectively. When k is not divisible by 3, these families have ρ-value smaller than that of any other known variable-discriminant complete family with the same embedding degree. Furthermore, the families with k ≡ 10 (mod 24) and k ≥ 34 have ρ-value smaller than any other known complete family with the same embedding degree, with either fixed (in advance) or variable discriminant. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> lists the variable-discriminant family with smallest ρ-value for each k ≤ 50.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">Recommendations</head><p>The body of this paper gathers in one place for the first time all known methods for constructing pairing-friendly elliptic curves. In Sect. 8 we distill this information into recommendations for users wishing to implement pairing-based protocols. As requirements for security and performance will vary from system to system, we provide several different recommendations among which users will choose according to their needs.</p><p>Section 8.1 discusses our recommendations for the case where minimizing ρ is not necessary; in general we recommend the Cocks-Pinch method (Theorem 4.1).</p><p>Section 8.2 considers the case where we wish to minimize ρ. We summarize our recommendations in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>. For each embedding degree k, 1 ≤ k ≤ 50, the table gives two options: a parametric family of curves with CM discriminant 1 or 3, and a parametric family of curves with variable CM discriminant, both of which minimize ρ in their respective category. In general, we recommend the former to users for whom performance is paramount, and the latter to users who are suspicious of curves with small CM discriminant.</p><p>Our families are described in terms of polynomials whose values give the field size and subgroup size for the pairing-friendly curve, and the ρ-value of a family is defined in terms of these polynomials. In each case we have checked that our families can be used to produce explicit curves and that the ρ-values of these curves are very close to the ρ-value of the family.</p><p>Section 8.3 considers the case where we wish to take advantage of certain techniques for speeding up pairing evaluation. These techniques, discussed in Sect. 7, offer the greatest improvement when the embedding degree is of the form k = 2 i 3 j . Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> gives a recommended family of curves for each such embedding degree less than <ref type="bibr">50.</ref> Finally, Sect. <ref type="bibr">8.4</ref> discusses curves with subgroups whose orders are composite numbers that are presumed to be infeasible to factor. Such curves, first proposed for use by Boneh, Goh, and Nissim <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, are used in a number of recent protocols and are an active subject of research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">How to Generate Pairing-Friendly Curves</head><p>We assume that the reader is familiar with elliptic curves and finite fields; for a good exposition of the former, see Silverman's book <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[82]</ref>, and for the latter, see the book of Lidl and Niederreiter <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. We begin by fixing some notation related to elliptic curves. Let E be an elliptic curve defined over a field K; we may also use E/K (read "E over K") to denote such a curve. We denote by E(K) the group of K-rational points of E and by #E(K) the order of this group when it is finite. For any integer r, we let E[r] denote the group of all r-torsion points of E (defined over an algebraic closure K of K) and by E(K) <ref type="bibr">[r]</ref> the group of r-torsion points of E that are defined over K.</p><p>For any prime power q, we let F q denote the field of q elements. If E is an elliptic curve over F q , we define the trace of E/F q to be t = q + 1 -#E(F q ). A theorem of Hasse (the "Hasse bound") says that |t| ≤ 2 √ q [82, Theorem V. <ref type="bibr">1.1]</ref>. If gcd(t, q) = 1, the elliptic curve E is said to be ordinary; otherwise E is supersingular. (For a multitude of equivalent definitions of supersingularity, see [82, Theorem V. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>.1].)</head><p>Let E/K be an elliptic curve. If the ring of K-endomorphisms of E, denoted End(E), is strictly larger than Z, then we say that E has complex multiplication or that E is a CM curve. All elliptic curves over finite fields are CM curves, with End(E) ⊗ Q isomorphic to either a quadratic imaginary field (if E is ordinary) or a quaternion algebra (if E is supersingular). If E/F q is ordinary, we define the complex multiplication discriminant (or CM discriminant) of E to be the square-free part D of the nonnegative integer 4qt 2 . (Other authors may define the CM discriminant to be negative, or to be the discriminant of the quadratic imaginary field</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Q( √ -D).) With this definition, we have End(E) ⊗ Q ∼ = Q( √ -D).</formula><p>By abuse of notation, we may extend this definition to supersingular curves E/F q , but in this case D has no relation to End(E).</p><p>The original application of pairings to cryptography, due to Menezes, Okamoto, and Vanstone <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> and Frey and Rück <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, was the use of the Weil or Tate pairing (respectively) to reduce the discrete logarithm problem in the group of points on an elliptic curve to a discrete logarithm problem in the multiplicative group of a finite field. As these pairings are bilinear and nondegenerate, they can be used to "embed" a subgroup of an elliptic curve into a subgroup of the multiplicative group of a finite field.</p><p>It is well known from the theory of elliptic curves that if E is an elliptic curve defined over a field K and r is an integer prime to char K, the Weil pairing is a nondegenerate bilinear map</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">e r : E[r] × E[r] → μ r ⊂ K,</formula><p>where μ r is the group of rth roots of unity in K [82, Sect. <ref type="bibr">III.8</ref>]. If the group E(K) <ref type="bibr">[r]</ref> is cyclic, the nondegeneracy of the pairing allows us to "embed" E(K) <ref type="bibr">[r]</ref> into the multiplicative group of the extension field K(μ r ). We call the degree of this extension the "embedding degree" of E. Definition 2.1. Let E be an elliptic curve defined over a field K, and suppose E has a K-rational point of order r with gcd(r, char K) = 1. The embedding degree of E with respect to r is the extension degree</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">[K(μ r ) : K]. Remark 2.2.</formula><p>If K is a finite field F q and r | #E(F q ) is relatively prime to q, the following three conditions are equivalent:</p><p>(1) E has embedding degree k with respect to r.</p><p>(2) k is the smallest integer such that r divides q k -1.</p><p>(3) k is the order of q in (Z/rZ) × .</p><p>We often ignore r when stating the embedding degree, as it is usually clear from the context.</p><p>Hitt <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> observed that when q = p m , the Weil and Tate pairings take values in the field F = F p (μ r ). The field F is called the minimum embedding field of E with respect to r. If q is not prime, then F may be a proper subfield of F q k . Since the security of a pairing-based cryptosystem depends on the difficulty of the discrete logarithm in F × , in these cases one must be careful to choose parameters so that F is sufficiently large. On the other hand, since most of the curves we consider are defined over prime fields, we may safely ignore this result for the bulk of our discussion. We will however take this observation into account when discussing supersingular curves defined over non-prime fields (Sect. 3).</p><p>For constructive applications of pairings, the embedding degree of E needs to be small enough so that the pairing is easy to compute but large enough so that the discrete logarithm in F × q k is computationally infeasible. Balasubramanian and Koblitz <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> showed that for a random elliptic curve E over a random field F q and a prime r ≈ q, the probability that E has embedding degree less than log 2 q with respect to r is vanishingly small, and in general the embedding degree can be expected to be around r. Luca, Mireles, and Shparlinski <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> have obtained similar results for fixed values of q. These results imply that if r and q are both of size around 2 160 (the smallest values currently acceptable for security in implementations), pairings on a random curve take values in a field of around 2 160 bits, so the computation is completely hopeless.</p><p>To avoid the Pohlig-Hellman attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>, the points on E(F q ) used in cryptographic protocols should have prime order. Our problem is thus to find elliptic curves that have large prime-order subgroups and small embedding degrees. Such curves are commonly referred to as "pairing-friendly," but this term has never been formally defined. We make the notion precise in the following definition. Definition 2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref>. Suppose E is an elliptic curve defined over a finite field F q . We say that E is pairing-friendly if the following two conditions hold:</p><p>(1) there is a prime r ≥ √ q dividing #E(F q ), and</p><p>(2) the embedding degree of E with respect to r is less than log 2 (r)/8.</p><p>In this definition, the bound on the subgroup size r is based on the result, due to Luca and Shparlinski <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, that curves having small embedding degree with respect to r are abundant if r &lt; √ q and quite rare if r &gt; √ q. The bound on the embedding degree is based on the rationale that embedding degrees of practical interest in pairing-based applications depend on the desired security level, of which r is a clear measure. In particular, the bound log 2 (r)/8 is chosen to roughly reflect the bounds on k given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Recently a number of pairing-based protocols have been proposed that require elliptic curves E/F q that have small embedding degree with respect to a large composite number r of known factorization, such as an RSA modulus. By analogy with Definition 2.3, we will say that such an E is pairing-friendly if r &gt; √ q and the embedding degree of E with respect to r is less than log 2 (r)/8.</p><p>Since supersingular elliptic curves have embedding degree 2 over prime fields F p with p ≥ 5 and have embedding degree at most 6 in any case <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, a supersingular curve is always pairing-friendly if it has a large prime-order subgroup. Section 3 discusses supersingular curves in more detail.</p><p>If we want to vary the embedding degree to achieve higher security levels, we must construct pairing-friendly ordinary elliptic curves. This turns out to be a difficult task.</p><p>There are a number of methods in the literature for constructing such curves, all of which follow essentially the same high-level structure:</p><p>(1) Fix k and compute integers t, r, q such that there is an elliptic curve E/F q that has trace t, a subgroup of prime order r, and embedding degree k. (2) Use the complex multiplication method to find the equation of the curve E over F q .</p><p>The difficult part of such algorithms is finding t, r, q as in Step (1) while ensuring that Step (2) remains feasible.</p><p>An ordinary elliptic curve with these properties can be constructed if and only if the following conditions hold:</p><p>(1) q is prime or a prime power.</p><p>(2) r is prime.</p><p>(3) t is relatively prime to q. (4) r divides q + 1t.</p><p>(5) r divides q k -1, and r q i -1 for 1 ≤ i &lt; k. (6) 4qt 2 = Dy 2 for some sufficiently small positive integer D and some integer y.</p><p>Condition (1) ensures that there is a finite field with q elements. Since the proportion of prime powers to primes is virtually zero, we will in general take q to be a prime number. Condition (6) implies that t ≤ 2 √ q; together with condition (3), this implies that there exists an ordinary elliptic curve E defined over F q with #E(F q ) = q + 1t (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[88,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 4.1]</ref>). Conditions (2) and (4) combine to tell us that E(F q ) has a subgroup of prime order r. By Remark 2.2, condition ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_33">5</ref>) is equivalent to E having embedding degree k with respect to r.</p><p>We now know that if such t, r, q can be constructed, then there exists an ordinary elliptic curve E/F q with embedding degree k and an order-r subgroup. The requirement that D be sufficiently small in condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> is necessary for us to be able to find the equation of such a curve. The method we use is the complex multiplication (CM) method of curve construction, due originally to Atkin and Morain <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The CM method, which was devised for use in primality testing, constructs a curve with endomorphism ring isomorphic to a given order O in a quadratic imaginary field Q( √ -D) and can be used to construct a curve with a specified number of points. The complexity of the method is O(|D O | 1+ ), where D O is the discriminant of the order O <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. Given current computational power, the method can construct curves over finite fields when |D O | ≤ 10 12 <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[83]</ref>. In practice we can always take O to be the ring of integers in Q( √ -D), in which case |D O | = D or 4D and D is the CM discriminant of the resulting curve. Thus we see that "sufficiently small" in condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> can be taken to be D &lt; 10 12 .</p><p>The equation in condition ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_44">6</ref>) is called the CM equation. If we use condition (4) to write q + 1t = hr for some h, then the CM equation is equivalent to</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Dy 2 = 4hr -(t -2) 2 .</formula><p>(2.1)</p><p>We call h the cofactor of the pairing-friendly curve. Constructions of pairing-friendly curves make substantial use of the theory of cyclotomic polynomials and cyclotomic fields. We recall a few basic facts here; for a deeper discussion, see Lidl and Niederreiter's book <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. For every positive integer k, we let ζ k denote a primitive kth root of unity in Q, i.e., an algebraic number such that (ζ k ) k = 1 and (ζ k ) = 1 for any positive &lt; k. The minimal polynomial of ζ k is known as the kth cyclotomic polynomial and is denoted Φ k (x). These polynomials have integer coefficients and can be defined recursively by setting Φ 1 (x) = x -1 and using the formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">x k -1 = d|k Φ d (x) (2.2)</formula><p>for k &gt; 1. The degree of Φ k (x) is denoted ϕ(k) and is also called Euler's totient function; it gives the number of positive integers less than or equal to k that are relatively prime to k.</p><p>The following observation is crucial for the construction of prime-order curves with embedding degree k. Proposition 2.4. Let k be a positive integer, E/F q an elliptic curve with #E(F q ) = hr where r is prime, and let t be the trace of E/F q . Assume that r kq. Then E/F q has embedding degree k with respect to r if and only if Φ k (q) ≡ 0 (mod r), or, equivalently, if and only if Φ k (t -1) ≡ 0 (mod r).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof.</head><p>Let us first assume that E has embedding degree k with respect to r. Then r | q k -1 but r q i -1 for any 1 ≤ i &lt; k. By (2.2) and since r is prime, this means r | Φ k (q). Now, since q + 1t = hr, q ≡ t -1 (mod r), so r | Φ k (t -1).</p><p>Conversely, if r | Φ k (t -1), then r | Φ k (q) and thus r | q k -1; this means that E/F q has embedding degree at most k. It remains to show that r q i -1 for any 1 ≤ i &lt; k. We follow Menezes' proof <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr">Lemma 6.2</ref>]. Let f (x) = x k -1 and F = Z/rZ. Then F is a field. Since r k, we have gcd(f (x), f (x)) = 1 in F[x]. Thus, f has only single roots in F. Using (2.2) and the fact that q is a root of Φ k (x) over F, we obtain Φ d (q) ≡ 0 (mod r) for any</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">d | k, 1 ≤ d &lt; k. Therefore, r q d -1 for any d | k, 1 ≤ d &lt; k.</formula><p>Finally, we note that r q i -1 for any positive i that does not divide k, since in this case we would have r | q gcd(i,k) -1. Proposition 2.4 tells us that we can replace condition (5) necessary to construct a pairing-friendly curve with the following:</p><p>(5 ) r divides Φ k (t -1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Families of Pairing-Friendly Curves</head><p>For applications, we would like to be able to construct curves of specified bit size. To this end, we describe "families" of pairing-friendly curves for which the curve parameters t, r, q are given as polynomials t (x), r(x), q(x) in terms of a parameter x. The idea of parameterizing t, r, q as polynomials has been used by several different authors in their constructions, including Miyaji, Nakabayashi, and Takano <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>; Barreto, Lynn, and Scott <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>; Scott and Barreto <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref>; and Brezing and Weng <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Our definition of a family of pairing-friendly curves is a formalization of ideas implicit in these works. The definition provides a concise description of many existing constructions and gives us a framework that we can use to discover previously unknown pairing-friendly curves.</p><p>Since the values of q(x) and r(x) will be the sizes of a field and a group in which we wish to do cryptography, respectively, the polynomials we construct will need to have the property that for many values of x, q(x) is a prime power (which in general we will take to be a prime), and r(x) is prime or a small cofactor times a prime. However, one drawback to the description of q and r as polynomials is that very little is known about prime values of polynomials. For example, it is not even known that x 2 + 1 takes an infinite number of prime values. Thus when describing the polynomials that we wish to take prime values, we must impose conditions that make it likely that they will do so.</p><p>Our definition is motivated by the following fact: if f (x) ∈ Z[x], then a famous conjecture of Buniakowski and Schinzel (see <ref type="bibr">[53, p. 323]</ref>) asserts that a nonconstant f (x) takes an infinite number of prime values if and only if f has positive leading coefficient, f is irreducible, and gcd({f (x) : x ∈ Z}) = 1. Furthermore, a conjecture of Bateman and Horn <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> vastly generalizes the prime number theorem to give the expected density of such prime values. For our purposes, we must also consider polynomials with rational coefficients; our definition incorporates the natural generalization of these conjectures to such polynomials. Definition 2.5. Let f (x) be a polynomial with rational coefficients. We say that f represents primes if the following conditions are satisfied:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(1) f (x) is nonconstant. (2) f (x) has positive leading coefficient. (3) f (x) is irreducible. (4) f (x) ∈ Z for some x ∈ Z (equivalently, for an infinite number of x ∈ Z). (5) gcd({f (x) : x, f (x) ∈ Z}) = 1.</formula><p>Clearly each of the conditions of Definition 2.5 is necessary for f to take an infinite number of prime values; their sufficiency is conjectural. We note that testing whether a polynomial f (x) represents primes is a finite calculation: condition (4) can be tested by computing f (x) for all integers x ∈ [0, N) for some N such that N • f (x) ∈ Z[x], while condition (5) can be tested by computing some f (n) ∈ Z and determining whether f (x) is identically zero mod p for all primes p dividing f (n). In addition, if either f (x) = ±1 for some x or f (x) takes two distinct prime values, then conditions (4) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_33">5</ref>) are both satisfied.</p><p>We need one more definition before we can define families of pairing-friendly curves.</p><p>Definition 2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">A polynomial f (x) ∈ Q[x] is integer-valued if f (x) ∈ Z for every x ∈ Z.</formula><p>For example, f (x) = 1 2 (x 2 + x + 2) is integer-valued and represents primes.</p><p>Definition 2.7. Let t (x), r(x), and q(x) be nonzero polynomials with rational coefficients.</p><p>(i) For a given positive integer k and positive square-free integer D, the triple (t, r, q) parameterizes a family of elliptic curves with embedding degree k and discriminant D if the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p>(1) q(x) = p(x) d for some d ≥ 1 and p(x) that represents primes.</p><p>(2) r(x) is nonconstant, irreducible, and integer-valued and has positive leading coefficient. (3) r(x) divides q(x) + 1t (x). (4) r(x) divides Φ k (t (x) -1), where Φ k is the kth cyclotomic polynomial. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> The equation Dy 2 = 4q(x)t (x) 2 has infinitely many integer solutions (x, y).</p><p>If these conditions are satisfied, we often refer to the triple (t, r, q) as a family. (ii) For (t, r, q) as in (i), if x 0 is an integer and E is an elliptic curve over F q(x 0 ) with trace t (x 0 ), then we say E is a curve in the family (t, r, q).

(iv) We say that a family (t, r, q) is complete if there is some y(x) ∈ Q[x] such that Dy(x) 2 = 4q(x)t (x) 2 ; otherwise we say that the family is sparse. (v) We say that (t, r, q) parameterizes a potential family of curves if conditions (2)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_33">5</ref>) of (i) are satisfied; in this case p(x) may or may not represent primes.</p><p>Part (i) of Definition 2.7 is designed so that if (t, r, q) parameterizes a family of curves with embedding degree k, and (x 0 , y 0 ) is a solution to the equation of condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> such that t (x 0 ) is an integer and p(x 0 ) is an integer prime, then there exists an elliptic curve E/F q(x 0 ) with a subgroup of order r(x 0 ) and embedding degree k. If D &lt; 10 12 , then E can be constructed via the CM method. All of the ordinary families we describe below have d = 1 in condition (1), so q(x) will represent primes and the curves we construct will be defined over prime fields. However, we do allow d &gt; 1 in order to fit the supersingular curves of Sect. <ref type="bibr">3.3</ref> into this framework as well as to accommodate any future constructions over non-prime fields.</p><p>We note that it may happen that a triple (t, r, q) satisfying Definition 2.7(i) does not lead to any explicit examples of elliptic curves; for example, if t (x) is never an integer simultaneously with q(x). However, all of the families we present in this paper have been shown to produce explicit examples of pairing-friendly elliptic curves for certain values of x.</p><p>In addition to finding an x 0 such that q(x 0 ) is prime, for cryptographic applications, we also need r(x 0 ) to be prime or very nearly prime. The conditions (2) on r(x) suggest that this will often be the case. Assuming that the Bateman-Horn conjecture is true, by fixing a y 0 and choosing values of x 0 near y 0 , the expected time needed to find an x 0 with the necessary properties grows linearly in deg q and deg r and quadratically in log y 0 ; see [32, Algorithm 4.1 and Proposition 4.2] for details.</p><p>Condition (3) of Definition 2.7(i) ensures that for a given value of x for which q(x) is prime, r(x) divides #E(F q(x) ). If in fact r(x) = q(x) + 1t (x), then for values of x for which r(x) and q(x) are both prime, #E(F q ) will be prime. This is the ideal case, but it is difficult to achieve in practice. We therefore define a parameter ρ that represents how close to this ideal a given curve or family of curves is. This parameter expresses the ratio of the size q of the field to the size r of the prime-order subgroup of E(F q ).

If there are curves in the family (t, r, q) whose order is prime, then deg r = deg q and ρ(t, r, q) = 1; this is the "ideal" case.

Since the subgroup order r must divide both #E(F q ) and Φ k (1) = q -1, we see that r is a factor of gcd(#E(F q ), q -1) = √ q ± 1, and therefore such curves must have ρ ≥ 2.</p><p>To construct supersingular curves with embedding degree 1, we let q = √ q and let E/F q be a curve with trace zero, i.e., #E(F q ) = q + 1.

Both methods can be used to construct curves with arbitrary embedding degree; however, both methods produce curves with ρ ≈ 2, which may not be suitable for certain applications. Neither method produces families of curves in the sense of Definition 2.7, but we will see in Sect. 6 that the Cocks-Pinch method does generalize to produce families with ρ &lt; 2. Furthermore, the Cocks-Pinch method has the advantage that it can produce curves with prime-order subgroups of nearly arbitrary size. The subgroups of Dupont-Enge-Morain curves, on the other hand, must have an order r that is the value of a certain polynomial, which results in the value of r being more difficult to specify precisely.</p></div>

(4) Let t ∈ Z be congruent to t mod r. Let q = (t 2 + a)/4.</formula><p>If q is an integer and prime, then there exists an elliptic curve over F q with an order-r subgroup and embedding degree k. If a = Dy 2 with D &lt; 10 12 , then E can be constructed via the CM method.</p><p>The key idea of the Dupont-Enge-Morain method is to use the following property of resultants [53, Corollary IV. <ref type="bibr">8.4</ref>]: if f (x) and g(x) are polynomials over a field K, then Res x (f (x), g(x)) = 0 if and only if f (x) and g(x) have a common root in K. When we consider Φ k (x -1) and a + (x -2) 2 as polynomials in the two variables a, x, the resultant R is a single-variable polynomial in a of degree ϕ(k). If we choose a such that r = R(a) is prime, then R(a) ≡ 0 (mod r), and thus Φ k (x -1) and a + (x -2) 2 have a common factor g(x) when considered as polynomials mod r, i.e., in F r [x]. We will show in Lemma 4.5 below that r ≡ 1 (mod k), which implies that Φ k (x) splits into distinct linear factors in F r (x). Since g(x) | Φ k (x), the polynomial g(x) has a root t ∈ F r . The values of t and r computed thus satisfy r | Φ k (t -1) and r | Dy 2 + (t -2) 2 . By construction of q, the CM equation holds, which then yields q + 1t ≡ 0 (mod r).</p><p>As in the Cocks-Pinch construction, there is no reason to believe a priori that t is much smaller than r, and thus in general q ≈ r 2 . We conclude that the curves produced by this method tend to have ρ values around 2.</p><p>The following lemma suggests that it should be easy to find values of a such that R(a) in Step ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) is prime; see also the discussion preceding Definition 2.5. Proof. Since both polynomials input to the resultant are monic and have integer coefficients, R(a) is also monic with integer coefficients. If k ≤ 2, we are done since any monic linear polynomial represents primes. We may thus assume that k ≥ 3.</p><p>Let</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">ζ k ∈ Q be a root of Φ k (x), and let K = Q(ζ k ).</formula><p>The properties of resultants (see [53, Proposition IV. <ref type="bibr">8.3]</ref>) then imply that From (4.1) we see that 2 . By well-known properties of cyclotomic polynomials (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr">Sect. VI.3]</ref>) we have that if k = p m is a prime power, then Φ k (1) = p, and otherwise Φ k (1) = 1. If k is not a prime power then this implies that gcd({R(a) : a ∈ Z}) = 1. If k = p m is a prime power, then to draw the same conclusion we must show that p R(a) for some a ∈ Z.</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">R(a) = Norm K/Q a + (ζ k -1) 2 .

Then the prime p is totally ramified in K = Q(ζ k ), with a unique prime factor p satisfying σ (p) = p for all σ ∈ Gal(K/Q). Furthermore, in the residue field F p the cyclotomic polynomial Φ k (x) has a single root 1 with multiplicity ϕ(k). It follows that σ (a + (ζ k -1) 2 ) ≡ a (mod p) for every σ ∈ Gal(K/Q), and therefore R(a) ≡ a ϕ(k) ≡ 1 (mod p) whenever gcd(a, p) = 1. We conclude that gcd({R(a) : a ∈ Z}) = 1 if k is a prime power.</p><p>We have now shown that R(a) represents primes in the sense of Definition 2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref>. If r = R(a) is prime for some a, then the element a + (ζ k -1) 2 ∈ K has prime norm r, and it follows that r splits completely into principal ideals in K. Since the primes splitting completely in K = Q(ζ k ) are exactly those congruent to 1 mod k, this completes the proof.</p><p>Like the Cocks-Pinch method, the Dupont-Enge-Morain method is effective for computing curves with arbitrary embedding degree k. However, whereas in the former method we could choose the subgroup size r nearly arbitrarily, in this method r is a value of the polynomial R(a). Since R(a) has degree ϕ(k), the primes r we find will grow roughly like a ϕ (k) . One can also take r to be any prime factor of R(a) congruent to 1 mod k, but such r will still be roughly the size of R(a) since it will only be feasible to compute an r of cryptographic size if the remaining factors of R(a) are small. Thus the possible subgroup orders r are more restricted in the Dupont-Enge-Morain method than in the Cocks-Pinch method. This is the only significant difference between the two methods, and thus we recommend using the Cocks-Pinch method for applications where a curve with arbitrary embedding degree and ρ ≈ 2 is desired.</p></div>

However, Freeman <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> discovered one example where this does occur for k = 10. The construction uses the following factorization of Φ 10 (u(x)), discovered by Galbraith, McKee, and Valença <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.

Via the substitution X = 15x + 5, this CM equation is equivalent to the generalized Pell equation X 2 -15Dy 2 = -20. For any D for which the latter equation possesses an integer solution, this yields a sparse family (t, r, q) with embedding degree 10, which can be computed by mimicking the MNT strategy.

The constructions in this section work by choosing the parameters D, t (x), r(x), q(x) such that the righthand side of the CM equation is always D times the square of a polynomial y(x). These constructions thus give complete families of curves in the sense of Definition 2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref>.</p><p>There are two principal strategies for constructing complete families, one due to Scott and Barreto <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref> and the other due originally to Barreto, Lynn, and Scott <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and in its fullest generality to Brezing and Weng <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Both start in the same way: fix an embedding degree k, choose an irreducible polynomial r(x)</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">∈ Z[x] such that K ∼ = Q[x]/(r(x)</formula><p>) is a number field containing the kth roots of unity, and then choose t (x) to be a polynomial mapping to 1 + ζ k , where ζ k is a primitive kth root of unity in K.</p><p>At this point the two strategies diverge. Brezing and Weng use the fact that if K contains a square root of -D, then since r(x) = 0 in K, we can factor the CM equation (6.1) in K as</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">t (x) -2 + y √ -D t (x) -2 -y √ -D ≡ 0 mod r(x).</formula><p>Since t (x) → ζ k + 1 ∈ K, it now becomes clear that if we choose y(x) to be a polynomial mapping to (ζ k -1)/ √ -D in K, then the CM equation is automatically satisfied for any x.</p><p>If we do not know that K contains an element of the form √ -D for some small D, then we may apply the Scott-Barreto strategy. This strategy is to take the t (x) and r(x) from above and search (usually via computer) for cofactors h(x) that make the right-hand side of the CM equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_44">6</ref>.1) either a perfect square or a linear factor times a perfect square. The CM equation then becomes 2 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">Dy 2 = (ax + b)g(x)</formula><p>If a = 0, then we take D = b and y = g(x). If a &gt; 0, we may choose any D and make the substitution x → Dz 2 -b a . If we then set y = zg(x), the CM equation is automatically satisfied for any z.</p><p>In both cases, we finish by constructing q(x) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">q(x) = 1 4 t (x) 2 + Dy(x) 2 .</formula><p>If q(x) represents primes and r(x) has positive leading coefficient, then (t, r, q) parameterizes a complete family of pairing-friendly curves.</p><p>The success of either strategy depends heavily on the choice of number field K. The obvious choice is to set K to be a cyclotomic field Q(ζ ) for some that is a multiple of k and define r(x) to be the th cyclotomic polynomial Φ (x). Then K contains the kth roots of unity. Furthermore, it is a standard result of the theory of cyclotomic fields that</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">K contains √ -1 if 4 | , K contains √ -2 if 8 |</formula><p>, and K contains ( -1 p )p for any odd prime p dividing . Thus, for any k and D, we can use a cyclotomic field in the Brezing-Weng construction; see Murphy and Fitzpatrick's work <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> for more details. We call families constructed in this manner "cyclotomic families," and we discuss some of the most efficient constructions (i.e., those with smallest ρ-value) in Sect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref>.1 below.</p><p>We may achieve even better success by choosing K to be a (perhaps trivial) extension of a cyclotomic field, with r(x) not a cyclotomic polynomial. There are two ways of creating such an extension. The first is to evaluate the cyclotomic polynomial Φ at some polynomial u(x). If Φ (u(x)) is irreducible, we have gained nothing, but if Φ (u(x)) factors as r 1 (x)r 2 (x) with r 1 irreducible, then we may set K = Q[x]/(r 1 (x)). Then K is a field containing the th roots of unity, and u(x) maps to an th root of unity in K. If we know that √ -D ∈ Q(ζ ), then √ -D ∈ K as well, and we may use the Brezing-Weng construction; otherwise we may apply the Scott-Barreto construction.</p><p>The second method, due to Kachisa, Schaefer, and Scott <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, is to find a noncyclotomic polynomial r(x) such that K = Q[x]/(r(x)) is isomorphic to the cyclotomic field Q(ζ ). Such a polynomial r(x) can be computed as the minimal polynomial of a randomly chosen element of Q(ζ ). Given this r(x), we can find a polynomial z(x) mapping to ζ in K and proceed as in the Brezing-Weng method.</p><p>Since nontrivial factorizations of Φ (u(x)) are rare for random u(x) and, furthermore, the q(x) produced by the Kachisa-Schaefer-Scott technique do not usually represent primes, we will call families of curves obtained by either of these techniques "sporadic" families; they are discussed in Sect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref>.2 below. Although such families are rare, they may have better ρ-values than curves constructed using a cyclotomic field. This was most spectacularly demonstrated by Barreto and Naehrig <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, who used the first method to construct curves of prime order with embedding degree 12 (Example 6.8 below).</p><p>We have checked that all of the families we describe in this section can be used to produce explicit examples of pairing-friendly elliptic curves and have confirmed that for parameters of cryptographic size, the ρ-value of a curve is very close to the ρ-value of its family. As listing examples of curves is beyond the scope of this paper, we either refer the reader to the original papers describing the constructions or suggest trying various values of x until a value is found such that q(x) is a prime of the desired size.</p></div>

Brezing and Weng stated the construction in greatest generality; their theorem is below. An alternative interpretation of the construction can be found in the paper of Freeman <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, which generalizes the method to produce higher-dimensional abelian varieties.

In general, we expect the smallest possible degree for t (x) and y(x) to be deg(r) -1, so ρ will not be much less than 2. However, for certain clever choices of the number field K, we may construct polynomials t and y with smaller degree, thus improving the ρ-value.</p><p>We now examine in detail some constructions that make use of Theorem 6. <ref type="bibr">1.</ref> Here and in the following examples, for α ∈ K and f (x</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">) ∈ Q[x], we use the notation α → f (x) to mean that f (x) represents α in K = Q[x]/(r(x)).</formula><p>Barreto, Lynn, and Scott <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> gave the first construction along the lines of Theorem 6.1. They construct families by taking the polynomial r(x) defining the number field K to be the kth cyclotomic polynomial, choosing ζ k → x in K (so t (x) = 1 + x) and using the fact that if k is divisible by 3, then √ -3 ∈ K. Brezing and Weng <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> give a more general construction by setting r(x) to be a cyclotomic polynomial Φ (x) for some multiple of the desired embedding degree k and choosing various representatives for ζ k in Q[x]/(r(x)). The discriminants D in these constructions are often taken to be 1 or 3, and any cyclotomic polynomial satisfies condition (2) of Definition 2.7(i). The tricky part of most of these constructions is ensuring that the resulting q(x) represents primes.</p><p>We begin with a construction given by Brezing and Weng, who state the construction for prime embedding degrees k; we observe that the construction extends readily to all odd k. We choose K to be a cyclotomic field containing a fourth root of unity √ -1, so we may choose D = 1. Construction 6.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Let k be odd, k &lt; 1000.

Now, q(x) is an integer whenever x is odd, and q(1) = 1. Thus if q is irreducible, then it represents primes. Computations with Magma <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> show that q(x) is irreducible for all odd k &lt; 1000. (This pattern of irreducibility motivates us to conjecture that q(x) is indeed irreducible for all odd k.) Lastly, y(x) ∈ Z for all x ∈ Z. The claimed ρ-value follows from (6.2) as deg r = 2ϕ(k) and deg t &lt; deg y = k + 2.</p><p>We next observe that if k is odd, then ζ 2k = -ζ k . Thus if we change the sign of the polynomials representing ζ k in Construction 6.2, the same construction can be used to create families with embedding degree 2k and the same ρ-values.

In addition, q(x) is an integer whenever x is odd. Unfortunately, we find that q(x) is always even when x is odd, so q fails condition (5) of Definition 2.5 and thus does not represent primes.</p><p>But all is not lost! We note that t, r, q of Construction 6.20 are even polynomials and y(x) is an odd polynomial, so for certain values of α, we may apply Theorem 6.19 to make the substitution x 2 → αx 2 in t, r, q.

Since p is unramified and α is square free, any prime p lying over p must divide (α) exactly, which completes the proof.</p><p>Corollary 6. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref>. Let k be a positive integer, and let α be a square-free integer with α k. Then Φ k (αx 2 ) is irreducible.</p><p>Proof. We apply Proposition 6.22 with f (x) = Φ k (x), using the fact that any prime dividing disc Φ k also divides k. For k = 1 or 2, the result follows directly from the square-free property of α.</p><p>We now return to the task of applying Theorem 6.19 to Construction 6. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref>. Since k is odd, the r(x) of Construction 6.20 is equal to Φ 4k (x) = Φ k (-x 2 ). It thus follows from Corollary 6.23 that (in the notation of Theorem <ref type="bibr">6.19</ref>) r (αx 2 ) = Φ k (-αx 2 ) is irreducible for any square-free α k, so condition (b) of Theorem <ref type="bibr">6.19</ref> is satisfied for such α. Furthermore, condition (c) is clearly satisfied since y(x) = x k + (-1) (k+1)/2 x has integer coefficients. Thus by Theorem 6.19, the substitution x 2 → αx 2 gives a potential family of curves with discriminant α for any positive square-free α k.</p><p>To obtain a family of curves in the sense of Definition 2.7(i), it remains only to check that the new q, which we denote as</p><formula xml:id="formula_95">q α (x) = 1 4 α k+1 x 2k+2 + α k x 2k + 4(-α) (k+1)/2 x k+1 + αx 2 + 1 ,</formula><p>represents primes. Since 4q 1 ( √ x) is a monic polynomial with constant term 1, it defines a number field L = Q(θ ) with θ a unit in O L . By Proposition <ref type="bibr">6.22</ref> and the fact that disc f (x 2 ) = (disc f (x)) 2 , we conclude that if k ≡ 3 (mod 4) and k &lt; 1000, then for any square-free α not dividing disc q(x), the polynomial q α (x) is irreducible. Other than by checking each value of α and k individually, we have no way of showing that gcd({q α (x) : x, q α (x) ∈ Z}) = 1. In practice it appears that, for various k and squarefree α both congruent to 3 (mod 4), this condition does hold and therefore q α (x) does indeed represent primes, but we cannot prove this result.</p><p>As in the derivation of Construction 6.3 from Construction 6.2, we may use the fact that ζ 2k = -ζ k when k is odd to derive an analogous construction for embedding degrees that are twice an odd number.

We make the substitution x 2 → αx 2 , where α is an odd square-free integer not dividing the embedding degree k. In both cases we have k odd and r(x) = Φ 4k (x) = Φ k (-x 2 ), so r (αx 2 ) is irreducible by Corollary 6. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref>.

Furthermore by Proposition 6.22 q (αx 2 ) is irreducible whenever q(x) is irreducible and α disc q. Since D = 2 in Construction 6.7, if q (αx 2 ) represents primes, then Theorem <ref type="bibr">6.19</ref> gives a family of pairing-friendly curves with discriminant 2α. If q (αx 2 ) represents primes, then α must be odd; if k is divisible by 4, then we must have α ≡ 1 (mod 4).</p><p>We can also apply Theorem <ref type="bibr">6.19</ref> to the cases presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>; we leave the details to the reader.</p></div>

(5) Select a square-free positive integer α k disc q such that after the substitution x 2 → αx 2 , the resulting polynomial q (αx 2 ) represents primes. (In each case, r (αx 2 ) is irreducible by Corollary 6.23, and q (αx 2 ) is irreducible by Proposition <ref type="bibr">6.22.)</ref> This condition requires α to have the following form:</p><p>• α odd for Constructions 6.2, 6.3, and 6.7 with 4 k.</p><p>• α ≡ 1 (mod 4) for Construction 6.7 with 4 | k.</p><p>• α ≡ 3 (mod 4) for Constructions 6.20 and 6.24.</p><p>(6) Let D = 2α if Construction 6.7 was used, and let D = α otherwise.</p><p>Then (t (αx 2 ), r (αx 2 ), q (αx 2 )) parameterizes a family of elliptic curves with embedding degree k and discriminant D. In particular, for values of α and x such that q (αx 2 ) is prime, there is an elliptic curve over F q (αx 2 ) with a subgroup of order r (αx 2 ) and embedding degree k.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Balancing Security</head><p>When choosing an elliptic curve for pairing applications, one usually begins by fixing in advance a desired bit size b 1 for the prime-order subgroup of the elliptic curve and a desired bit size b 2 for the finite field in which the discrete logarithm must be infeasible. To achieve these bit sizes exactly one must have b 2 /b 1 = ρ • k. This relation may allow a number of choices for curves with the desired security levels. In general, a smaller ρ is desirable to minimize bandwidth requirements and the time necessary to perform elliptic curve arithmetic. For example, a curve with k = 4 and ρ = 2 over a 320-bit field provides the same security levels as a (hypothetical) curve with k = 8 and ρ = 1 over a 160-bit field; however, points on the former curve generally require twice as much storage space and base field operations take roughly four times as much time.</p><p>While in general choosing minimal ρ for the same security levels will optimize performance, there are other factors that may affect performance, most notably twists (Sect. <ref type="bibr">7.3 below)</ref>. A (hypothetical) curve with k = 6 and ρ = 4/3 over a 214-bit field F q would provide the same security as the curves in the previous example, but if the curve had a sextic twist, the group operations could be computed in F q instead of F q k . Whether this would be faster than the k = 8, ρ = 1 curve would likely depend on the specific implementation.</p><p>Furthermore, there is no reason that the subgroup and field sizes need to be exactly the minimum necessary for desired security, and unbalancing one of the parameters may in fact improve performance. To continue with our example, a curve with k = 6 and ρ = 2 over a 320-bit field overshoots our desired security level for discrete log in the finite field, but such a curve may be advantageous if it has a sextic twist. (And such curves do in fact exist!) In general, if ρ • k &gt; b 2 /b 1 , then the finite field will be larger than required, and if ρ • k &lt; b 2 /b 1 , then the elliptic curve subgroup will be larger than required. We also note that curves with ρ &gt; 2 could be chosen to balance ρ • k with b 2 /b 1 , though such curves would in general have inefficient group operations.</p></div>

On the other hand, many protocols require that the two inputs to the pairing be from the same cyclic group P . One way of getting around this conflict is to use a distortion map, which is an efficiently computable endomorphism φ such that φ(P ) ∈ P .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.">Twists and Compression</head><p>A twist of E/F q is an elliptic curve E /F q that is isomorphic to E over F q . The minimal d for which E and E are isomorphic over F q d is the degree of the twist. All elliptic curves have quadratic (i.e., degree 2) twists. The only curves with higher-order twists are those with CM discriminant 1 (defined by equations of the form y 2 = x 3 + ax), which have quartic twists, and those with CM discriminant 3 (defined by equations of the form y 2 = x 3 + b), which have cubic and sextic twists. (For a more theoretical description of twisting, see [82, Chap. X]. Over fields of characteristic 2 or 3, the situation is slightly more complicated, but the degree of a twist must still divide <ref type="bibr">6.)</ref> In general, the points input into a pairing on a curve of embedding degree k take the form P ∈ E(F q ), Q ∈ E(F q k ). However, Barreto, Lynn, and Scott <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> use the quadratic twist to show that when k is even, one can take Q to be a point on E (F q k/2 ), where E is a quadratic twist of E. In fact we usually prefer k to be even as this facilitates the "denominator elimination" optimization of Barreto, Kim, Lynn, and Scott <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Barreto and Naehrig <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> extend this idea to curves with sextic twists and embedding degree k divisible by 6, showing that Q can be taken to be a point on E (F q k/6 ), where E is a sextic twist of E. Hess, Smart, and Vercauteren <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr">Sect. 5</ref>] unify these ideas in a general framework that also takes into account cubic and quartic twists.</p><p>On any curve with embedding degree k that has a degree-d twist with d | k, the output of the Tate pairing can be given as an element of F q k/d instead of F q k , with the loss of log 2 d bits of information. This "compression" technique was introduced for quadratic twists by Scott and Barreto <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[80]</ref> and extended to sextic twists by Barreto and Naehrig <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>; similar ideas apply to quartic and cubic twists. While these techniques apply only to the output of the pairing, Naehrig, Barreto, and Schwabe <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> give methods for executing the entire pairing computation over a proper subfield of F q k .</p><p>A twist of degree k on a curve with embedding degree k would be ideal for implementation, as it would allow all curve points and pairing values to be given over the base field F q . Unfortunately, such a curve must either be supersingular or have ρ-value nearly 2. The precise formulation of this statement and its proof were presented to us by Frederik Vercauteren. Proposition 7.1. Let E be an elliptic curve over F q with a subgroup of prime order r &gt; 3 and embedding degree k &gt; 1 with respect to r. If E has a twist E /F q of degree k and r &gt; 4 √ q, then E is supersingular.</p><p>Proof. By [42, Theorem 3] there is a unique degree-k twist of E such that r divides #E (F q ). We take E to be this twist. The hypothesis r &gt; 4 √ q implies that there is at most one multiple of r in the Hasse interval [q + 1 -2 √ q, q + 1 + 2 √ q], and since #E(F q ) and #E (F q ) must both be in this interval by Hasse's theorem, we conclude that #E(F q ) = #E (F q ). By Tate's theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[85,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 1]</ref> there is an isogeny ψ : E → E defined over F q .</p><p>The hypothesis that E is a twist of E of degree k &gt; 1 tells us that E and E are isomorphic over an extension field of F q but are not isomorphic over F q . Composing this isomorphism with the isogeny ψ gives an endomorphism φ of E that is not defined over F q . Since φ is not defined over F q , it does not commute with the Frobenius endomorphism of E. We conclude that End(E) is noncommutative, and therefore E must be supersingular.</p><p>As an immediate corollary, if E is an ordinary elliptic curve with embedding degree k &gt; 1 and a degree-k twist, then r ≤ 4 √ q, so ρ(E) ≥ 2 -4 log 2 log r . In particular, any ordinary family with one of the of the following combinations of embedding degree and discriminant must have ρ-value at least 2: embedding degree 6 and discriminant 3; embedding degree 4 and discriminant 1; or embedding degree 2 and any discriminant (cf. Proposition 2.9). Such families do exist: see, for example, Construction 6.4 for k = 4, D = 1, or Construction 6.6 for k = 6, D = 3.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusion: Your One-Stop Shop for Pairing-Friendly Curves</head><p>The selection of a pairing-friendly elliptic curve for a given application depends on many factors. The most important are the desired security levels in the elliptic curve group E(F q ) and in the multiplicative group F × q k . However the choice of a curve may also be influenced by the choice of pairing used, the need for speed in the pairing computation, the level of precision necessary in the bit sizes, and doubts about the security level of curves with "special" properties, such as supersingular curves, curves with extra automorphisms, curves defined over very small fields (e.g., Koblitz curves), or curves with extremely small CM discriminant. Thus in our quest to fulfill the title of this section, we present several different options for choice of curves.</p><p>To implement pairing-friendly curves in real life, depending on the security level desired, an administrator will choose (minimum) bit sizes desired for the prime-order subgroup of the elliptic curve and of the extension field, and select a construction method from our recommendations below. If the construction produces a sparse family of curves, then to find explicit parameters one uses the MNT method as described in Sect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref>. If the construction produces a complete family of curves (t (x), r(x), q(x)), to compute parameters for a specific curve one then must loop through inputs x of the appropriate size until an x 0 is found such that q(x 0 ) is a prime integer, t (x 0 ) is an integer, and r(x 0 ) is prime or has a large prime factor. If the degrees of these polynomials are too large relative to the desired security levels, finding such an x 0 may be difficult.</p><p>Specifically, let g(x) be a polynomial of degree d. We approximate g(x) as x d and compute the number of (b + 1)-bit numbers produced by g(x). This is the number of  The consequence of this heuristic result is that if we are using a family to generate pairing-friendly curves and wish to specify precisely the field and subgroup sizes, the degrees of the polynomials r(x) and q(x) cannot be too large. For example, if we were trying to generate curves having a 512-bit subgroup with r(x) of degree 32, we would expect to find only about four 512-bit prime values of r(x). The requirement that q(x) is prime imposes even stricter conditions; if q(x) has degree ρd, then only around 1/ρb of the x that give prime values for r will also give prime values for q.</p><formula xml:id="formula_100">x such that x d ∈ [2 b , 2 b+1 ), which is 2 b/d (2 1/d -1). Since 2 1/d -1 ≈ log(2)/d</formula><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> gives the maximum recommended values of deg r for various security levels if strict control of the field and subgroup sizes is desired. For each bit size b + 1 of r(x), we compute d such that 2 b/d /(b 2 d log 2) = 1 and recommend max deg r(x) slightly larger than this d.</p><p>If one is willing to be flexible about the bit sizes of the curve parameters, then one may be able to increase x indefinitely until prime q(x) and r(x) are found, and in lucky cases the first instance where this occurs will be near the desired bit size. For example, let q(x) and r(x) be the polynomials given by Construction 6.6 with k = 32; these polynomials have degrees 34 and 32, respectively. If we are looking for a 512-bit primeorder subgroup to match the security level of 256-bit AES, choosing x = 66100 makes q(x) a 543-bit prime and r(x) a 513-bit prime, which is very close to our specified bit size.</p><p>Even so, if deg r(x) &gt; 40, we expect to find very few prime values even of r(x) alone that are as large as 512 bits. Therefore, we cannot recommend any families of curves with deg r(x) so high.</p><p>Remark 8. <ref type="bibr">1.</ref> If we can apply Theorem 6.19 to vary the CM discriminant as well as x, then we will be able to generate more prime values of q(x) and r(x). In particular, since the degrees of q (αx 2 ) and r (αx 2 ) in α are half the degrees in x, if we fix x and vary the square-free part of the parameter α, we can expect to find more prime values than if we fix α and vary x. This idea first appears in the paper of Comuta, Kawazoe, and Takahashi <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, who independently demonstrated examples of this approach; their construction is equivalent to applying Theorem 6.19 to our Constructions 6.3 and 6.24 and fixing x = 1. The restriction that the square-free part of α be (roughly) less than 10 12 will not in general pose a problem, since even with x = 1 we may still find values of r with as many as 20 • deg r(x) bits. Thus for constructions using Theorem 6.19, it is perfectly acceptable to take deg r(x) as large as 80.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.">Our Recommendations: Curves with ρ ≈ 2</head><p>If minimizing ρ is not desired, we recommend the Cocks-Pinch method (Sect. <ref type="bibr">4.1)</ref>. This method has several advantages: it works for any embedding degree k, it works for any CM discriminant D (within the limits of the CM method, roughly D &lt; 10 12 ), and the size r of the prime-order subgroup E(F q ) is chosen in advance. The only disadvantage is that ρ is around 2, so the number of bits needed to specify a point on E will be about twice the minimum number of bits needed to obtain a given level of security.</p></div>

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> gives the best known values of ρ for families of curves with embedding degree k ≤ 50. These values of k should cover all desired security levels for the foreseeable future.</p><p>For each embedding degree k, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> gives the best ρ-value achieved by two different constructions.</p><p>The first construction listed is the one that yields the smallest ρ-value when the CM discriminant D is 1 or 3.

Curves with D = 1 or 3 have both low-degree endomorphisms and twists; the former may be used to speed up elliptic curve arithmetic <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, while the latter can speed up pairing computation for certain embedding degrees k (see Sect. <ref type="bibr">7.3</ref>). The table shows that in a large majority of cases, the optimal ρ-value is achieved by Construction 6.6; other constructions do better for some small k, k ≡ 4 (mod 6), and k divisible by <ref type="bibr">18.</ref> However, there are known methods to improve the efficiency of Pollard's rho algorithm on curves with D = 1 or 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. These methods lead to a decrease in security of only a few bits, but some users may take their existence as a warning that curves with small CM discriminant are in some sense special and should be avoided. Therefore, we also indicate the optimal ρ-values for families with variable CM discriminant, the allowed discriminants D, and the constructions which produce these ρ-values. Here, whenever we indicate (in the last column) a construction of the form 6.x+, this means that the corresponding basic construction from Sect. 6 is combined with the substitution x 2 → αx 2 (Theorem <ref type="bibr">6.19</ref>) to construct curves with variable D; see the algorithm on p. 266 for details. Note that to date we know of no variable-discriminant construction when k = 20 or when k is a multiple of 8; in these cases a family with D ≤ 3 or a Cocks-Pinch curve must be used.</p><p>We have checked that all of the families listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> can be used to produce explicit examples of pairing-friendly elliptic curves and have confirmed that for parameters of cryptographic size, the ρ-value of a curve is very close to the ρ-value of its family.</p><p>All families in the table except for one lead to curves over prime fields, and the minimum embedding field is F q k for such curves. The lone exception is the supersingular family with k = 3. The minimum embedding field for a curve in this family is either F q 3 or F q 3/2 ; see Sect. <ref type="bibr">3.3</ref> for details.</p><p>Explanation of Symbols in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> bold Entries in bold in the table indicate that curves of prime order can be constructed with the given embedding degree. italic Entries in italic indicate that while the ρ-value achieved for the given family may be optimal, the degrees of the polynomials involved are too high to make the construction practical. For fixed-discriminant curves, we require deg r ≤ 40, and for variable-discriminant curves, we require deg r ≤ 80; see Remark 8.1 and the preceding discussion. In cases where deg r(x) is too large, if one is not willing to allow for very little control over the bit sizes of r and q, the Cocks-Pinch method should be used to achieve the desired embedding degree and discriminant, constructing a curve with ρ ≈ 2. † A ρ-value marked with a † is smaller than any ρ-value previously reported. In particular, for k ∈ {7, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19}, we achieve ρ-values smaller than those reported by Brezing and Weng <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, who state that their ρ-values are "probably optimal." # To achieve the ρ-values marked with a # , we recommend supersingular curves.</p><p>• k = 2: For both the small D and the variable D cases, arbitrary ρ-values can be easily achieved with supersingular curves (see Sect. <ref type="bibr">3.2)</ref>. Depending on the residue class of q (mod 12), we can construct curves with D = 1, D = 3, or D ≡ 3 (mod 4) with ( -D q ) = -1 (see Algorithm 3.3). As discussed in Remark 3.1, we have no hesitation recommending supersingular curves over ordinary curves with the same embedding degree. For those who believe that supersingular curves must be avoided, we recommend the Cocks-Pinch construction.</p><p>• k = 3, small D: We recommend a supersingular curve over F p 2 ; see Sect. <ref type="bibr">3.3.</ref> The minimal embedding field (i.e., the field in which the Weil and Tate pairings take values) will be F p 6 = F q 3 if t = p and F p 3 = F q 3/2 if t = -p. Since the minimal embedding field-and not the embedding degree-determines discrete log security in the finite field <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, users should be careful to choose curve parameters giving the desired security level.</p><p>If a curve over a prime field is required, Construction 6.6 gives a family with ρ-value 2. + A construction marked with a + indicates that the given basic construction is combined with the substitution x 2 → αx 2 (Theorem <ref type="bibr">6.19</ref>) to construct families with the given discriminant; see the algorithm on page 266 for details. * For k = 15, 28, or 44 and variable D, we use the same technique as in Construction <ref type="bibr">6.7</ref>, the only difference being that y(x) → (ζ k -1)/ √ -2 reduces further modulo r(x).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3.">Our Recommendations: Curves with Efficient Arithmetic</head><p>In Sect. 7 we saw two general techniques for speeding up pairing computations that depend on the embedding degree k: using twists to define elliptic curve points and pairing values over smaller extension fields (Sect. <ref type="bibr">7.3)</ref>, and constructing extension fields in towers defined by simple polynomials (Sect. <ref type="bibr">7.4</ref>). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> recommends curves that can take advantage of both of these techniques. The embedding degrees we consider are of the form k = 2 a 3 b , as this choice allows for the construction of extension fields in towers. If k is divisible by 4, then curves with CM discriminant 1 have twists that can be used to work over F q k/4 instead of F q k . If k is divisible by 3, then curves with CM discriminant 3 have twists that can be used to work over F q k/3 (if k is odd) or F q k/6 (if k is even).</p><p>For each k = 2 a 3 b less than 50, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> lists the family with highest-order twists; if more than one such construction exists, we choose the one with smallest ρ-value. The entries for k = 3, 4, 6 reflect the result of Proposition 7.1: curves with embedding degree k and a degree-k twist must either have ρ ≥ 2 or be supersingular.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.4.">Our Recommendations: Curves of Composite Order</head><p>Several recently proposed protocols require curves that have small embedding degree with respect to a composite number r that is presumed to be infeasible to factor, such as an RSA modulus. Currently, the only effective means of generating such curves are to construct supersingular curves over prime fields (Sect. <ref type="bibr">3.2)</ref> or to use the Cocks-Pinch method (see Remark 4.3).</p><p>For pairing-based cryptosystems using elliptic curves of composite order to be secure, three problems must be infeasible: the discrete logarithm on the elliptic curve E(F q ), the discrete logarithm in the finite field F × q k , and factorization of the curve order #E(F q ). Since there exist subexponential-time factorization algorithms but only exponential-time elliptic curve discrete log algorithms, the size of the elliptic curve group will be determined by the security level desired for the factoring problem. In particular, since factorization of a large composite number r takes roughly the same amount of time as the discrete logarithm in a finite field of size around r (as both algorithms use the Number Field Sieve), the parameters should ideally be chosen so that #E(F q ) ≈ q k . We thus deduce that pairing-friendly curves of composite order should have ρ-values and embedding degrees chosen to minimize ρ • k. By Remark 2.10 and the discussion of Sect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref>.1, we see that the smallest possible ρ-value of a curve of cryptographic size with embedding degree 1 and small CM discriminant is very close to 2. On the other hand, supersingular curves over prime fields (Sect. <ref type="bibr">3.2)</ref> have embedding degree 2 and can have ρ-values very close to 1 for any specified group order r.</p><p>We conclude that k = 1 ordinary curves (such as those given in Example 6.17) and k = 2 supersingular curves both provide the minimum possible value for ρ • k and are thus optimal for protocols requiring composite-order subgroups. For implementations, we recommend the supersingular option, as these curves can take advantage of the computational speedups of Sects. <ref type="bibr">7.3 and 7.4</ref>, while the k = 1 curves cannot.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Lemma 4 . 5 .</head><label>45</label><figDesc>Fix a positive integer k, and let R(a) ∈ Z[a] be defined as in Theorem 4.4 above.
