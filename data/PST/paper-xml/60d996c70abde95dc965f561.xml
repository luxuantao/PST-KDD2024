<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Given a temporal dense tensor and an arbitrary time range, how can we e ciently obtain latent factors in the range? Tucker decomposition is a fundamental tool for analyzing dense tensors to discover hidden factors, and has been exploited in many data mining applications. However, existing decomposition methods do not provide the functionality to analyze a speci c range of a temporal tensor. The existing methods are one-o , with the main focus on performing Tucker decomposition once for a whole input tensor. Although a few existing methods with a preprocessing phase can deal with a time range query, they are still time-consuming and su er from low accuracy. In this paper, we propose Z T , a fast and memory-e cient Tucker decomposition method for nding hidden factors of temporal tensor data in an arbitrary time range. Z T fully exploits block structure to compress a given tensor, supporting an e cient query and capturing local information. Z T answers diverse time range queries quickly and memory-e ciently, by elaborately decoupling the preprocessed results included in the range and carefully determining the order of computations. We demonstrate that Z T is up to 171.9× faster and requires up to 230× less space than existing methods while providing comparable accuracy.</p></div>

Tucker decomposition, one of the tensor decomposition methods, has been recognized as a crucial tool for discovering latent factors and detecting relations between them.</p><p>In practice, we analyze a given temporal tensor from various perspectives. Assume a user is interested in investigating patterns of various time ranges using Tucker decomposition. Given a temporal tensor and a user-provided time range (start time and end time) query, our goal is to nd the patterns of the temporal tensor at the range using Tucker decomposition. For example, given a temporal tensor including matrices collected between Jan. 1, 2008 to May 6, 2020, a user may be interested in Tucker decomposition of a subrange between Jan. 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020 (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Since Tucker decomposition generates factor matrices and a core tensor to accurately approximate an input tensor, answering time range queries, (i.e., performing Tucker decomposition of di erent sub-tensors) yields di erent Tucker results. However, conventional Tucker decomposition methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> based on Alternating Least Square (ALS) is not appropriate for answering diverse time range queries since they target performing Tucker decomposition once for a given tensor; the methods require a high computational cost and large storage space since they need to perform Tucker decomposition of the sub-tensor included in a time range query from scratch, every time the query is given. Due to this limitation, the existing methods are not e cient in exploring diverse time ranges for a given temporal tensor.</p><p>A few methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> with a preprocessing phase can be adapted to the time range query problem; before the query phase, they preprocess a given tensor, and perform Tucker decomposition with the preprocessed tensor for each time range query. However, they su er from an accuracy issue for narrow time ranges since preprocessed results are tailored for performing Tucker decomposition of the whole given temporal tensor. The results fail to capture local patterns that appear only in a speci c range.   In this paper, we propose Z T (Zoomable Tucker decomposition), a fast and memory-e cient Tucker decomposition method to analyze a temporal tensor for diverse time ranges. Z T enables us to discover local patterns in a narrow time range (zoom-in), or global patterns in a wider time range (zoomout). Z T consists of two phases: the preprocessing phase and the query phase. The preprocessing phase of Z T exploits block structure to lay the groundwork in achieving an e cient query phase and capturing local information. In the query phase, Z T addresses the high computational cost and space cost by elaborately decoupling block results and carefully determining the order of computation. Thanks to these ideas, Z T answers an arbitrary time range query with higher e ciency than existing methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the e ectiveness and e ciency of our method compared to other methods. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">X &lt;i &gt; i-th temporal block tensor (∈ I 1 × ...I N −1 × b) A &lt;i &gt; (k ) k -th</formula><p>• Algorithm.

However, they are still unsatisfactory in terms of time, space, and accuracy for the time range query problem since they are tailored for performing Tucker decomposition of only the whole tensor once. We address the challenges with the following main ideas:</p></div>

I2 Elaborately decoupling block results decreases the computational cost of Tucker decomposition for a tensor obtained in a given time range. I3 Carefully determining the order of computation minimizes intermediate data generation while avoiding redundant computation. Z T e ciently computes Tucker decomposition for various time range queries. Z T consists of two phases: the preprocessing phase and the query phase. The preprocessing phase is computed once for a given temporal tensor, while the query phase is computed using the results of the preprocessing phase for each time range query. Z T compresses a given tensor block by block along the time dimension in the preprocessing phase. Z T performs Tucker decomposition for each block. In the query phase, Z T performs Tucker decomposition for each time range query by 1) adjusting the rst and the last blocks included in the time range to t the range and 2) carefully stitching the block results in the time range.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Preprocessing Phase</head><p>The objective of the preprocessing phase is to manipulate a given temporal tensor for an e cient query phase. In the query phase, performing Tucker decomposition from scratch requires high computational cost and large space cost as the number of queries increases. To avoid it, compressing a given tensor is inevitable to provide fast processing in the query phase. Additionally, we consider that compressed results need to contain local patterns that appear only in speci c ranges. The preprocessing phase of existing Tucker decomposition methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> fails to support high e ciency of the query phase while maintaining local patterns. Then, how can we compress a given tensor to deal with various time range queries? Our main idea is to exploit a block structure: 1) carefully designating the form of a block, and 2) selecting a compression approach for each block. In this paper, we 1) split a given temporal tensor into sub-tensors along the time dimension, and 2) leverage Tucker decomposition for each sub-tensor. The idea allows Z T to support an e cient query phase and capture local patterns. Additionally, the preprocessing phase is extensible for new incoming tensors by performing Tucker decomposition of them.</p><p>To capture local information, we split a given tensor along the time dimension. Let the reconstruction error at each timestep t be  <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2 0 0 9 2 0 1 1 2 0 1 3 2 0 1 5 2 0 1 7 2 0 2</ref>  </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">X(t )− X(t ) 2 F X(t ) 2 F</formula><p>where X(t) is an input sub-tensor obtained at each timestep t and X(t) is the sub-tensor at timestep t reconstructed from Tucker results. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows the reconstruction errors of Stock dataset at each time point. Given a sub-tensor in a range that has relatively high errors, performing Tucker decomposition of the sub-tensor (orange line in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) provides lower errors than the preceding result computed from a whole temporal tensor (blue line in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). This observation implies that decomposing a sub-tensor allows us to capture local information, leading to low errors. Based on the observation, we construct sub-tensors by splitting a temporal tensor along the time dimension and perform Tucker decomposition of each sub-tensor. It provides lower error than performing Tucker decomposition of a whole tensor on all the timesteps, by capturing local information.</p><p>To support an e cient query phase, we store the Tucker decomposition results of sub-tensors. There are the two bene ts to leveraging Tucker decomposition in the preprocessing phase: 1) saving the space cost due to the small preprocessed results compared to the given tensor, and 2) enabling the query phase to exploit the mixedproduct property applicable to mixing matrix multiplication and Kronecker product, i.e., (</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">A T ⊗ B T )(C ⊗ D) = (A T C ⊗ B T D). Computing (A T C ⊗ B T D) requires less costs than computing (A T ⊗ B T )(C ⊗ D)</formula><p>when the size of the four matrices is I × and I &gt;&gt; . The reason is that the size of A T C and B T D is only × while the size of (A T ⊗ B T ) and (C ⊗ D) is 2 × I 2 and I 2 × 2 , respectively. We further present the exploitation of this property to achieve high e ciency of the query phase in Sections 3.2.3 and 3.2.4.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> presents an overview of the preprocessing phase. Without loss of generality, we assume that the temporal mode is the last mode (N th mode). We express a given tensor X as temporal block tensors</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">X &lt;i &gt; ∈ R I 1 ×I 2 ×•••×I N −1 ×b for i = 1, ..., I N b (line 2 in Algo- rithm 1)</formula><p>where b is a block size and I N is the dimensionality of the time dimension. Then, we perform Tucker decomposition for each temporal block tensor X &lt;i &gt; (line 4 in Algorithm 1), and store each factor matrix (A &lt;i &gt; ) (n) in a set C n and the core tensor G &lt;i &gt; in a set C N +1 (lines 5 and 6 in Algorithm 1). Since the preprocessing phase is computed once and a ects errors of the query phase, this phase prefers an accurate but slow Tucker decomposition method rather than a fast but approximate Tucker decomposition one. Speci cally, we use Tucker-ALS, which is stable and accurate, in this phase.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">𝐀 "𝟏$ (𝟏) 𝑏 𝑏 𝑏 Tucker result of 𝓧 "𝟏$ Tucker result of 𝓧 "𝟐$ Tucker result of 𝓧 "𝟑$ 𝓧 "𝟏$ 𝓧 "𝟐$ 𝓧 "𝟑$ Time 𝐀 "𝟏$ (𝟐) 𝓖 "𝟏$ 𝐀 "𝟏$ (𝟑)</formula><p>𝐀 "𝟐$ (𝟏)</p><p>𝐀 "𝟐$ (𝟐)</p><p>𝐀 "𝟐$ (𝟑)</p><p>𝓖 "𝟐$ 𝐀 "𝟑$ (𝟏)</p><p>𝐀 "𝟑$ (𝟐)</p><p>𝓖 "𝟑$ 𝐀 "𝟑$ (𝟑) </p></div>

S2. We adjust the Tucker results of X &lt;S &gt; and X &lt;E &gt; to t the range since a part of them may not be within the given range. S3. Given the Tucker results of X &lt;i &gt; for i = S, .., E included in the range, Z T updates factor matrices by eciently stitching the Tucker results. S4. After that, Z T updates the core tensor using factor matrices updated at Step S3 and the Tucker results. S5. Z T repeatedly performs Steps S3 and S4 until convergence.</p><p>The most important challenge of the e cient query phase is how to minimize the computational cost for updating factor matrices (Step S3) and the core tensor (Step S4) of the time range while minimizing the intermediate data. To tackle the challenge, our main ideas are to 1) elaborately decouple X(n) ⊗ N k n Ã(k)T based on preprocessed results, and 2) carefully determine the order of computation. We rst give an objective function and an update rule for the query phase (Section 3.2.1). Then, we describe how to achieve high e ciency of Z T in detail (Sections 3.2.2 to 3.2.4).</p></div>

Tucker decomposition, one of the tensor decomposition methods, has been recognized as a crucial tool for discovering latent factors and detecting relations between them.In practice, we analyze a given temporal tensor from various perspectives. Assume a user is interested in investigating patterns of various time ranges using Tucker decomposition. Given a temporal tensor and a user-provided time range (start time and end time) query, our goal is to nd the patterns of the temporal tensor at the range using Tucker decomposition. For example, given a temporal tensor including matrices collected between Jan. 1, 2008 to May 6, 2020, a user may be interested in Tucker decomposition of a subrange between Jan. 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020 (see Figure1). Since Tucker decomposition generates factor matrices and a core tensor to accurately approximate an input tensor, answering time range queries, (i.e., performing Tucker decomposition of di erent sub-tensors) yields di erent Tucker results. However, conventional Tucker decomposition methods<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> based on Alternating Least Square (ALS) is not appropriate for answering diverse time range queries since they target performing Tucker decomposition once for a given tensor; the methods require a high computational cost and large storage space since they need to perform Tucker decomposition of the sub-tensor included in a time range query from scratch, every time the query is given. Due to this limitation, the existing methods are not e cient in exploring diverse time ranges for a given temporal tensor.A few methods<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> with a preprocessing phase can be adapted to the time range query problem; before the query phase, they preprocess a given tensor, and perform Tucker decomposition with the preprocessed tensor for each time range query. However, they su er from an accuracy issue for narrow time ranges since preprocessed results are tailored for performing Tucker decomposition of the whole given temporal tensor. The results fail to capture local patterns that appear only in a speci c range.</figDesc></figure>

As shown in Figures 7(a) to 7(c), there are trade-o relationships between running time and reconstruction error for narrow time range queries. In Figures 7(d) to 7(f), the running time of Z T is inversely proportional to b for a wide range query while the reconstruction error is not sensitive to b. A large b prevents the preprocessing phase from capturing local information so that it is challenging to serve narrow time range queries.
