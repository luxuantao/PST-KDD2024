<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>S explained in Part I of this paper [l J, a genetic algorithm A employs three essential operators: selection, crossover, and mutation. The selection operator is formulated after the Darwinian principle of "survival of the fittest." The crossover and mutation operators have been inspired by the mechanisms of gene mutation and chromosome recombination found in biological genetics. Their computational role is to introduce diversity into the population, probing new regions unexplored by the selection operator. Various heuristic crossover schemes have been proposed in the genetic algorithm (GA) literature. Typically, given two parents, the two-point crossover consists in randomly choosing a crossover site and switching the sub-strings to the right side of the site, resulting in two offsprings. The multi-point crossover scheme is a natural extension of the two-point operator in that more than one crossover site can be chosen. The uniform crossover represents the extreme case of the multi-point scheme mandating that every pair of bits be exchanged with a certain probability. <ref type="bibr">Eshelman et al.</ref> [21 presented a qualitative account comparing the "disruptiveness" of these schemes. Whitley <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> presented an excutable model that predicts the string gainboss due to one-point crossover and uniform crossover. Syswerda 141 studied the disruptive effect of a uniform crossover operator. Booker [ 5 ] quantified bias in various crossover operators in Manuscript received <ref type="bibr">May 5, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">revised</ref>  <ref type="bibr">August 13, 1993.</ref>  the space of binary strings. Qi and Palmieri <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> derived exact equations for the expected number of any particular string resulting from one-point crossover within a finite population. Despite the operational difference between these heuristic variants, a common feature of all the crossover operators is that they do not disrupt common string patterns between the two parents, allowing "good" patterns that have survived from selection to be preserved while continuing to search for new regions as a result of crossing over between the non-common strings. In short, crossover maintains a good balance between exploiting the currently good regions and exploring new regions where better solutions may be found. This observation has led Holland to introduce the concept of schema <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, defined as "any type of allowable partial string patterns or the hyperplanes in the space of strings." Holland maintained that schemas form the essential functional entities actually processed by the genetic algorithm, and presented the Schema Theorem, stating that subspaces with higher than average payoffs will be allocated exponentially more trials over time, while those subspaces with below-average payoffs will receive exponentially fewer trials. This is under the assumption that crossover and mutation are not too disruptive. Based on similar arguments, Goldberg proposed the "Building Block Hypothesis" <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>: given any short, low-order schema partition, a GA is expected to converge to the hyperplane with the best average fitness (the expected winner), where a short, low-order schema is interpreted as a string pattern with a small number of defining elements so closely packed that it is quite immune to potential disruptions by crossover [8J.</p><p>The Schema Theorem and the Building Block Hypothesis convey the general sense that the genetic algorithm searches for an optimal solution by allocating increasing numbers of sample points to the hyperplanes with high average fitness that are not easily disrupted by crossover. Unfortunately, the above-mentioned results are largely qualitative in nature. This work attempts to show quantitatively how the crossover operator affects the population distribution by casting it into the formal mathematical framework of stochastic processes, and deriving recursive equations goveming the population density under repeated crossover. More detailed proofs for some of the results presented in this paper can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref>, and The crossover operation of evolutionary algorithms, as explained in the introduction, aims at increasing the population diversity through a reshuffling of coordinates between the parent vectors. Obviously a "mating" strategy would be helpful in this respect. For example, we could allow only population members with relatively high fitness to exchange coordinates, or perhaps define a probability of crossover that depends on the fitness of the two drawn parents. We prefer to confine our analysis in the following to the simplest case of uniform crossover. We believe that the results obtained here are illuminating by themselves, and that joined with those concerning selection and mutation, form a visually appealing picture of the genetic search. It would not be too hard to modify the analysis to include the other strategies, but we prefer here to limit ourselves to the simplest canonical case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">THE UNIFORM CROSSOVER</head><p>Consider two random vectors in F C Rm, each drawn from a large population independently with the same probability distribution: the crossover operator works as follows: after the two "parents" are drawn, each corresponding pair of coordinates exchange their values independently, with the same probability 0 &lt; p &lt; 1. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> illustrates the idea schematically. At time step IC, two m-dimensional real vectors xf, and xi swap independently their lth coordinates x:') and xi('), 1 = 1.2:..,m, with probability p . One of the two resulting vectors is arbitrarily discarded.</p></div>

The second possibility is that the two parents swap only one coordinate, which could be either the first one or the second. This happens with probability 2p(l -p ) .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>A simple example is given here to illustrate (1): Suppose a two-dimensional population starts with a zero mean Gaussian distribution with standard deviations u1, u2 associated with the two dimensions, and a correlation coefficient of p between the two coordinates, denoted by N(u1, u 2 , p ) . The two associated marginal distributions can be written as N(ul) and N(a2), respectively, that should be understood to represent one-dimensional zero mean Gaussian densities with standard deviation 01 and 02, respectively.

Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> actually represents a special case of the simple example above, with ~1 = 2, o2 = 1, and p = 0.95. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> depicts a slightly different case with the initial distribution being a summation of two Gaussian densities, and the same formula in the above simple example is used to generate densities at different stages. Note how the marginal distribution of each coordinate remain unchanged during crossover. It is easy to see from (1) that f,W</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">( . ) = J,$z),i = L 2 , V k .

The above result, which we could refer to as the epistasis theorem, implies that all the crossmoments between the coordinates converge to zero asymptotically. For example, the cross-covariance a:") between the two coordinates follows the recursion </p><formula xml:id="formula_8">(4) qk+l (112) = [p2 + (1 -p ) 2 ] C 7 y ) ,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B . The Crossover in More Dimensions</head><p>All the above results for the two-dimensional case can be extended to the situation with m 2 3. Before doing this we need to define notations that will be used: Assuming a large population size as before, we denote the generic vector in the m-dimensional Euclidean space representing the population at time IC, by X k 4 [x;), . . e , xi"]. It is also useful to denote any of its subvector of length 1 (0 5 2 5 m) by [z~",...,~~"] and its complementary subvector by [z!'+'), . . . , xtm)], where {il,Z~,*..,il}, with 1 5 il &lt; i 2 &lt; ...it 5 m, is a subset of the set of indices { 1,2, . . , m } and {Zl+1, . . , im} its complement. Accordingly, let the density function of the vector X k be fz;),...,zkm) (dl), . . . , dm)). Also denote the densities of the subvectors defined above by and respectively. 2 The recursion is generalized to higher dimensions by the following theorem. The m-dimensional density resulting from crossover is a convex combination of all the products of lower-order densities before crossover. Each term in the mixture is a product of two joint densities corresponding to a binary partition of the random vector under consideration. The mixture exhausts all such binary partitions. For each fixed 0 5 1 5 m, there are such partitions, therefore the sum of the mixing coefficients is:</p><p>It is now easy to check that since the crossover is performed only between analogous coordinates, independently and with the same probability, results conceming any subvector remain <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> the same as if that subvector is the full vector for a lower dimensional space with dimensionality equal its length. For example, the first-order marginal densities do not change, namely [similar to ( 2 ) ] :</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">fzpl = fzp (z), a = l,...,m,Vk 2 0.</formula><p>Also the second-order densities satisfy:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">( J ) (&amp;), &amp;)) = f x;; 1 ,x b + 1 = [Pz + (1 -m z ~t 4 4 1</formula><p>(z(? z ( j ) )</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">+ 2 P ( l -P)fz:,) ( J i ) ) f z ( J ) ( 2 ( j ) ) , 15 i # j 5 m,Vk 2 0,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>similar to (1). We are now ready to state the epistasis theorem.</p></div>

It should be pointed out that Geiringer [13] presented a similar theorem in a slightly different context (population genetics), which was derived from her results similar to Theorem 1. The authors of this paper were not aware of Geiringer's results at the time of our independent derivation, however we should emphasize that our derivation is primarily in the context of the multi-dimensional continuous space, making it possible to investigate the combined effect of crossover and selection in a more quantitative manner. The immediate consequences of Theorem 2 is that all the cross central moments among the coordinates of the population vector will converge to zero under repeated crossover. In particular, let {pk}r&amp; and {Xk}r=o denote the sequences of mean vectors and covariance matrices, respectively, associated with the sequence of the m-dimensional densities {fzy~,,,,,z~m)}~=O, Write Xk = [0f"']5=~.

Since p 2 + (1 -&lt; 1, the asymptotic convergence to zero of the covariance is ! l monotonic. The same result applies to all the cross central moments between coordinates. Uniform crossover reduces the correlation among the coordinates of the population vector by a factor [p' + (1 -P ) ~] where p is the probability of crossover on each coordinate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="111.">FORMING THE GENERAL PICTURE</head><p>It is now straightforward to combine large sample results for selection and mutation with that for crossover, in order to analyse the behavior of a general genetic algorithm in continuous space (GACS) under the large-sample assumption.

The order assumed here is merely for analytical convenience, and will not alter the asymptotic distribution of the population significantly.</p><p>Denote with Xk the m-dimensional random vector representing the population at time k. Let x'k be the random vector after selection at time k but before crossover, and x"k represent the random vector after crossover but before mutation. Denote and f[(x), respectively.

Similarly, After substituting ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) into (3, the recursive relation for uniform crossover, and simple algebraic manipulations, we have the following formulas conceming the joint effects of selection, crossover and mutation. For all k 2 0, Selection+Crossover:</p><p>respectively.

This is indeed a desirable property for any sensible population-oriented search, since a set of hyperplanes each containing high average fitness would usually indicate a good</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">- fk(x)&amp;(zftl), . . . , dx(2m) -Lm-[ --E[gkl Lm-[ f k ( N . . . , d z m ) ) 1 x g(Z(z1) , . . . x ( z m ) ) d z ( z i + 1 1 . . , dx(xm 1 . ! &gt; (<label>1 3)</label></formula><p>solution lying around the intersection of these planes, where more samples should be generated. It is remarkable that the simple crossover operator discussed above actually achieves this useful feature. With (17), ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) and (19), we can simulate the large sample behavior of the GACS given any fitness function g(x). We have not yet obtained convergence results for the combined scheme. It would be desirable to derive conditions on mutation variance and probability of crossover to ensure monotonicity and convergence. Generally, a small probability of crossover will always guarantee convergence on the largesample scenario. It is desirable in the finite-size population framework of the computational strategy to use the largest crossover probability that will ensure convergence within the assumptions of a given fitness function. Goldberg et al. <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> were able to predict a control map identifying regions of global convergence in the space of selective pressure and the probability of crossover for a simple GA, based on an preliminary analysis for the likelihood of generating new building blocks through mixing. It is conceivable to formulate a certain type of "optimality" criterion for the combined process of selection, crossover, and mutation to achieve an increased average (or best) fitness value over members of the population, while maintaining a reasonable degree of population diversity. In this formulation the probabilities of crossover naturally become control variable for the algorithmic process and certain bounds could be derived for the parameter, as has been done for the selection/mutation combination in Part I [I] of this paper. This would require a characterization of the fitness function that is "smooth" under crossover. Equation ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) seems to suggest that the fitness landscape itself may be modeled as a stochastic process in multi-dimensional space and its smoothness be characterized in terms of the relationships among the mean fitness values over various hyperplanes. These issues are currently under investigation.</p><p>It should be stressed that the results of large sample analyses in this section apply in similar fashion to the case of discrete solution spaces; e.g., binary strings. One only has to replace all the probability density functions by their corresponding probability mass functions and all the integrations by the proper summations. The value of the mass function corresponding to any specific binary string would represent the frequency (or proportion) of that string within the entire population. The analytical results of this section therefore remain valid in the discrete case as long as the population size is large, and they provide a viable theoretical tool for studying the large sample behavior of crossover in the canonical binary space GA's.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</head><p>We conclude ?art I1 by summarizing main results obtained Properties of the crossover operator: The interesting behavior of the crossover operator, which is in fact a second order nonlinear mixing operation within the population, has been explored for the canonical case of uniform crossover. The recursive equation for the density functions associated with the uniform crossover operator and pointing out some of their possible extensions. has been derived. The population density function resulting from crossover is always a convex combination of the products between the previous ones. It should be noted that these properties hold for a wide class of crossover schemes, including the so-called "two-point crossover."</p><p>The method of analysis leading to the current results can be applied to those case(s) with little modification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variants of the crossover operator:</head><p>The coordinatewise uniform crossover defined here is only one scheme among many possible alternatives. Nonetheless, the results with this particular operator reveal some fundamental properties of recombination-like operations in general, and should be easily extendable to GA's in discrete spaces. Specifically, the crossover operator explores multi-dimensional space by breaking down the correlations (epistasis) among the various coordinates of the space, while keeping the marginal distribution of each individual coordinate unchanged. In general, any recombination scheme would result in a probability distribution being the convex combination of products of the complementary ones before recombination. The fundamental consequence is that the population entropy always increases after crossover [ 101.</p><p>Altemative classes of recombination schemes for real vectors could be explored, such as those studied in <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. They are referred to as nonrandom mating schemes, with parents randomly drawn, but deterministically combined to form child vectors. This can be done by matrix convex combination of the two parent vectors: The offspring is a summation of its two parents scaled by two weighting matrices satisfying certain conditions of boundedness. In fact, a large class of recombination schemes for GACS can be formulated in this way: If the weighting matrices are deterministic, the resulting strategy is nonrandom. Otherwise the strategy is stochastic. The latter encompasses a large class of random crossover schemes. The uniform crossover operator analysed in this paper represent a special case of the stochastic scheme: The two scaling matrices are diagonal containing only 0's or l's, and they add up to the identity matrix. The crossover operator formulated in a recent paper on the "real-coded" genetic algorithms [15] is another instance of the same strategy, in that the weighting matrices are still diagonal, but may contain elements other than 0's and l's, and the two matrices may not add up to the identity matrix. It seems possible that a unified analysis be given to a wider class of recombination-like operators in the continuous space, encompassing the aforementioned crossover operators. Karlin's work [17] might be of interest in this respect. It should be pointed out that from a biological point of view the term "crossover" in the phenotypical space such as the Euclidean space is rather misleading, since it is usually reserved for chromosomes in the genotypic spaces. The term "multifactorial inheritance" is used in <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref> to describe various transmission rules for generating one generation from the other in the continuous space. Further investigation should focus on what the role of various crossover schemes can be in global searches. In general, crossover is an exploratory operator "smarter" than blind mutations. It increases the entropy of the population while keeping the total variance of the vector bounded to that of the initial population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Extension to discrete-space GA:</head><p>The results of large sample analyses obtained in this paper can be extended to the canonical discrete space GA with some modifications. One only has to replace the probability density functions (PDF's) with their corresponding probability mass functions (PMF's, or frequencies), and the result will still hold. It is hoped that the results may provide certain clue as to how the crossover and selection operators can be made to balance each other, resulting in a robust search strategy in a complex environment.</p></div>
