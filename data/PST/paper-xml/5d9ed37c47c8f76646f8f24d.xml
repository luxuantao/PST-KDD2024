<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experts are assumed to be mutually independent and incomplete decision matrices are used, in traditional large-scale group decisionmaking (LSGDM). Social network analysis (SNA) methods are useful for managing LSGDM problems considering the social relationships among experts. This study develops a novel SNA-based decision framework for addressing LSGDM problems with incomplete interval type-2 fuzzy information. First, a community detection algorithm is designed to classify experts, and a trust propagation and aggregation mechanism is developed to obtained experts indirect trust values and weights based on the social trust network. Second, a multi-objective programming model integrated with trust relationships among experts is constructed to estimate the missing values in incomplete interval type-2 fuzzy decision matrices. The proposed estimation approach is robust and effectively estimates missing values while maintaining high discrimination levels. Subsequently, an SNA-based consensus-reaching model is designed for achieving a group consensus based on a twofold feedback adjustment mechanism, namely, adaptive judgment and weight feedback. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. A simulation and comparison study is conducted to verify the efficiency and advantages of the SNA-based consensus-supporting framework for LSGDM.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Group decision making (GDM) is a type of participatory procedure in which two or more decision makers (DMs) or experts collectively achieve a common solution for a decision-making problem <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>. As the complexity of the decision object and the information that is involved increases, more stakeholders participate in the decision process, and integrated group knowledge will be more helpful to understand the decision that is made <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[13]</ref>. When decisions must be made by a large number of stakeholders, it is referred to as large-scale GDM (LSGDM) 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[25]</ref>. The main characteristics of LSGDM problems are their uncertainty, complexity and intra-group conflicts, which can potentially lead to unmotivated DMs and non-cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Language is the most direct and effective tool for DMs to express their assessment information due to its convenience and closeness to peoples true feelings. Zadeh <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[45]</ref> proposed the concept of linguistic terms. Accordingly, several types of fuzzy sets, such as type-1 fuzzy sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, intuitionistic fuzzy sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[31]</ref> and interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, have been employed to translate linguistic ratings 10 into numerical expressions. As more parameters are involved in IT2FSs, the information in linguistic terms can be well retained, which can yield accurate results in the process of determining linguistic terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22]</ref>. Hence, IT2FSs are suitable for capturing the uncertainty and vagueness of linguistic terms. As the basic elements of IT2FSs, interval type-2 fuzzy numbers (IT2FNs) have been widely used to model linguistic decision information in GDM and LSGDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Qin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[27]</ref> developed an extended interval type-2 fuzzy TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multi-criteria decision making) to address multi-criteria GDM (MCGDM) problems. Chen and Kuo <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> 15 proposed a new MCGDM method for autocratic decision-making based on IT2FNs, enhanced Karnik-Medel (KM) algorithms and the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator. Moreover, Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[40]</ref> developed a solution to solve interval type-2 fuzzy double LSGDM problems.</p><p>Although numerous methods have been proposed to solve interval type-2 fuzzy GDM and LSGDM problems, limitations exist. First, almost all of these methods for coping with interval type-2 fuzzy GDM and LSGDM problems require DMs to provide complete assessments 20 over all the available alternatives. Given the time pressure, the lack of domain knowledge, or their limited expertise, DMs providing complete assessments in some decision situations is unrealistic, especially those involving numerous alternatives or conflicting and dynamic sources of information. Second, no measure is designed to eliminate the intra-group conflicts among DMs under an acceptable level before deriving the group solution. In this sense, experts may not accept the group solution because they think that their opinions have not been seriously</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M</head><p>A N U S C R I P T enough considered. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">25</ref> Various estimation methods have been developed within the context of fuzzy preference relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">17]</ref>, linguistic preference relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[49]</ref> and linguistic distribution assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[46]</ref> to cope with incomplete assessments. These estimation methods are based on iterative algorithms or motivated by programming models, which are highly dependent on the known preference information that is provided by DMs. If the preference values are ignorant, then these estimation methods become ineffective <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[17]</ref>. Moreover, these estimation methods are suitable for solving various GDM problems with fuzzy sets, linguistic term sets, hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets and linguistic distribution 30 assessments. Whether they are applicable to LSGDM problems with IT2FNs requires further verification.</p><p>A frequently used method is implementing a consensus-reaching process (CRP) to obtain a collective solution that is as close as possible to a unanimous agreement to eliminate the conflict among DMs by reducing it under an acceptable degree <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">30]</ref>. Solutions have been proposed to provide support in LSGDM contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[13]</ref>. Various clustering methods, such as fuzzy c-means <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[15]</ref> and self-organizing maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[25]</ref> have been applied to reduce the necessary number of large-scale experts and improve the efficiency of CRPs. For the feedback and 35 adjustment in the CRPs in LSGDM, most methods based on the judgment feedback mechanism (JFM) modify the judgments of the experts or clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">34]</ref>, and a control parameter is set to determine how much of the judgment is inherited from the original judgment. Other methods based on the weight feedback mechanism (WFM) modify the weights of the experts or clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[41]</ref>, and the incompatible experts weights are reduced in each iteration.</p><p>Practically, for the JFM-based CRP methods, identifying the exact value for the control parameter is difficult and the value is generally 40 fixed in each iteration, which cannot reflect the actual decision making situations cautiously. For the WFM-based CRP methods, only DMs who hinder the group consensus are punished for their incompatible behaviors while other DMs who promote the group consensus are not rewarded for their positive behaviors. In this sense, several DMs may think that their contributions do not receive as much attention as they perhaps deserve and take negative actions (for example, non-cooperative behaviors) in the following discussion. Moreover, most consensusbased methods for LSGDM regard DMs as independent individuals who have no relationships with other members. In practice, most DMs 45 in an LSGDM problem are stakeholders or have several types of relationships in the problem being solved. This idea implies that the social relationships among DMs who participate in the same LSGDM may have been already established. Thereby, the assessments of DMs with respect to alternatives may be influenced by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[17]</ref>. Therefore, when the relationships of DMs are arranged in a social network structure</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</formula><p>that is characterized by various social relationships, the traditional methods for LSGDM that focus exclusively on analyzing preference information in order to achieve a consensus are no longer sufficient in some real-word domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>50</head><p>Social network analysis (SNA) has become one of the most popular methodologies for investigating social relationships among members.</p><p>SNA provides a way to reveal the interconnections among individuals; in it, an expert is easily influenced by his/her most trusted experts in the social network, thereby affecting the result of the GDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">32]</ref>. Related studies have presented the advantages of SNA-based methods for dealing with the complexity of GDM and LSGDM problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">48]</ref>. Two mainstream SNA-based consensus approaches have been developed to achieve the predefined consensus level (CL) in GDM and LSGDM. In the first mainstream research methods, the 55 SNA-based CRPs are in static social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">29]</ref>. In the second mainstream research methods, the SNA-based CRPs are in dynamic social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[48]</ref>. The former regards the social network as a reliable source to identify the weights of the DMs or estimate the missing values that are not provided by several DMs. The latter adjusts the weights of the DMs by revising the trust assessments in the social network. Moreover, SNA-based clustering methods have been developed to reduce the dimension of large-scale DMs within the context of IT2FNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39]</ref>. However, no CRPs are considered in these interval type-2 fuzzy LSGDM methods, which are not feasible or sufficient in 60 practical situations.</p><p>In summary, despite the pioneer research proposing various LSGDM models, they still suffer from limitations. Concretely, our interest focuses on investigating the following three challenges for LSGDM problems with IT2FNs in a social network-driven setting.</p><p>(1) Only a few models of LSGDM consider the characteristics and inherit diversity of the social relationships among DMs.</p><p>(2) Almost no models consider the situations where DMs may provide incomplete assessments within the context of LSGDM with IT2FNs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>65</head><p>(3) Traditional consensus-reaching methods for LSGDM only adjust the preference values or weights of DMs, which are not cautious enough to consider the personalized characteristics of each DM when achieving a consensus. Moreover, little attention has been paid to developing effective consensus-reaching methods for LSGDM with IT2FNs.</p><p>On the basis of the motivations that are summarized above, this study draws on SNA to develop a novel decision framework for LSGDM with incomplete interval type-2 fuzzy information. In the proposed framework, DMs elicit trust ratings regarding other DMs in their social 70 network and assessments of a set of alternatives with respect to criteria with linguistic terms, which are then transformed into IT2FNs. For</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>the incomplete IT2FN sociomatrix, trust propagation and aggregation operators are proposed to establish the trust relationships among DMs that are in indirect contact. For the incomplete IT2FN decision matrices, a multi-objective programming model is constructed to estimate missing values. The proposed estimation approach provides a robust and effective solution for addressing the missing values. To support the CRP, this study continues the research line of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">39]</ref> and provides a community detection approach for reducing the dimension of the social 75 trust network with large scale DMs and a weight determination method for identifying the weights of each DM. Thereafter, an SNA-based approach for undertaking the CRP is developed to achieve the predefined CL. A twofold feedback adjustment mechanism, namely, JFM and WFM, is designed to modify the DMs preferences and weights according to their contributions to the group consensus. In this way, every DM can be given a tailored and personalized treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first consensus-supporting approach for LSGDM with incomplete interval type-2 fuzzy information.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Effect of the proposed approach for estimating missing values</head><p>The trust relationships among experts are incorporated into the process of estimating the missing values in the proposed approach. The optimal solutions of Eq. ( <ref type="formula">23</ref>) are regarded as the final estimated preference values. We consider that studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">38]</ref> derived the overall values of the trusted experts and regarded them as the final estimated preference values by using the weighted averaging aggregation operator, where the weights are identified according to the SNA-based method. In the following, the proposed approach is compared with the aggregation 495 operator-based method for managing incomplete IT2FN decision matrices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p>Take the estimated IT2FNs in R1 as an example. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> shows the estimated IT2FNs and the discrimination of expert e 1 that are yielded by the aggregation operator-based method and the proposed approach. The table also exhibits that the results yielded by the two methods are different. The estimated values that are obtained by the proposed approach can guarantee higher discrimination levels than the aggregation operator-based method. Moreover, the aggregation operator-based method is used to estimate the missing values in other 500 incomplete IT2FN decision matrices.   From Figures 8-10, the following observations can be distinguished.</p><p>(1) The consensus success ratios of M1 are higher than those of M2 in certain situations because the red mapping surfaces of M1 are higher than the blue mapping grid surfaces of M2, as shown in . Particularly, the consensus success ratios of M1 are 1 in most 545 situations. Hence, the proposed approach can increase the success ratio of achieving the predefined CL by adopting the adaptive JFM and WFM.</p><p>(2) The consensus rounds of M1 are lower than those of M2 because the red mapping surfaces of M1 are lower than the blue mapping grid surfaces of M2, as shown in . Hence, the proposed approach can accelerate the convergence speed and achieve the predefined CL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>550</head><p>(3) The adjusted distances of M1 are lower than those of M2 when experts adopt divergent behavior because the red mapping surfaces of M1 are lower than the blue mapping grid surfaces of M2, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">10(c</ref>). However, the adjusted distances of M1 are higher than those of M2 when experts adopt disobedient behavior because the red mapping surfaces of M1 are higher than the blue mapping grid surfaces of M2, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>(c). Although the proposed approach relatively enlarges the modification amount of the incompatible experts' preference information, the approach achieves the predefined CL with a limited number of iterations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>555</head><p>In summary, the proposed approach has the following advantages over existing methods. First, the proposed SNA-based preference estimation approach can effectively estimate the missing values in incomplete IT2FN decision matrices and maintain high discrimination levels. Second, the proposed SNA-based consensus-reaching approach can effectively manage the non-cooperative behaviors in the CRP in the context of LSGDM with IT2FNs. Third, the developed twofold feedback adjustment mechanism, namely, the JFM and WFM of the proposed SNA-based consensus-reaching approach, can accelerate the convergence speed and achieve the predefined CL. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>This study investigates the LSGDM problems with incomplete interval type-2 fuzzy information and develops methods for missing value estimation and CRP based on SNA. The primary features and contributions of the proposed framework are summarized as follows:</p><p>(1) A community detection algorithm is designed to reduce the dimension of the social trust network with large-scale experts. Interval type-2 fuzzy trust propagation and aggregation operators are proposed to establish the trust relationships between experts who are in indirect 565 contact. Accordingly, the experts are classified into several subclusters and their weights are obtained based on their trust relationships among them.</p><p>(2) An SNA-based estimation method is proposed to estimate the missing preference values in IT2FN decision matrices based on the multiobjective programming model. The comparison results affirm that the proposed approach is robust and effectively estimates missing values by keeping high discrimination levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>570</head><p>(3) An SNA-based CRP framework is proposed to achieve the predefined CL, in which a twofold feedback adjustment mechanism, namely, JFM and WFM is developed to modify experts' preference values and weights according to their contributions to the group. The simulation and comparative analysis results validate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach for solving LSGDM problems with incomplete interval type-2 fuzzy information.</p><p>Meanwhile, several interesting research directions are highlighted for future work. Granular computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[19]</ref> is becoming a popular </p></div>			</div>
