<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Professional competence in applied disciplines such as OR/MS requires both technical expertise and critically reflective skills. Yet, a widespread misconception has taken hold of the OR/MS community: 'critical' and 'emancipatory' systems methodologies are opposed to 'hard' and 'soft' ones as if they were sensible alternatives. Accordingly, adequate 'methodology choice' is now widely considered a key condition of reflective professional practice; critical systems thinking (CST) is understood to deal mainly with this issue. The present paper argues that this conception of CST is neither theoretically sound nor conducive to reflective practice. An examination of the two major current strands of CST suggests some basic requirements of an alternative conception: (1) Reflective practice depends more on a framework of critical argumentation and discourse than on a framework of methodology choice. (2) A well-conceived discursive systems approach will give a proper place to the public sphere. (3) The much-discussed emancipatory orientation of CST inheres in the methodological requirements of discourse rather than in an arbitrary 'commitment' on the part of the systems practitioner. (4) Systemic boundary critique-the methodological core concept of critical systems heuristics (CSH)-allows us to translate these requirements into practical methodology. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) Contrary to present conceptions of methodological pluralism or 'complementarism', boundary critique must not be subordinated to methodology choice, for it is constitutive of all critical inquiry and practice. These considerations lead to a reconstitution of CST, and to a new view of reflective professional practice in general, as critically systemic discourse.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction: systems thinking as critical discourse</head><p>Critical systems thinking (CST) is about critical systems practice. That is, it stands or falls by the ability to promote reflective professional practice. If this is so, one must wonder whether the prevailing association of CST with methodology choice is adequate. This paper argues that CST is more appropriately understood as a form of critical discourse, whatever methodologies may be used. Only thus can we expect it to fulfil its purpose of promoting reflective practice.</p><p>In Critical Heuristics 1 and on other occasions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> I have offered a detailed philosophical argument for the shift from the prevailing 'monological' to a more dialogical or discursive understanding of the systems approach. That argument was developed against the background of two contrasting philosophical conceptions of discursive rationality in applied science, as represented by Popper's <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> model of empirical-analytic science and by Habermas' <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> model of critical social theory. A crucial difference between them concerns the way they handle the unsolved problem of practical reason: How can we rationally establish the normative foundation of knowledge and action? In contexts of practical decision-making and action, what we take to be true and right implies value judgements; what does it mean to be 'rational' when the values of the parties concerned differ? Whose rationality is 'rational'? Empirical-analytic science tends to identify practical reason with the help that science can give us in selecting adequate means for reaching given ends. Practical reason thus becomes merely instrumental reason, a form of theoretical reason that may secure efficacious action but has nothing to say about the ends it serves. For critical theory, on the other hand, an instrumental rationality that is uncritical of its own normative implications is merely an apparent rationality; to reduce practical to instrumental reason means to immunize the value implications of claims to truth and rationality against the critical efforts of practical reason. This may be true, but the difficulty is that critical theory then defines practical reason in such an ideal way that it cannot be practised. Critical systems heuristics (CSH) was conceived as a way out of this dilemma.</p><p>My way of proceeding in the present essay will be different; I will argue directly against present notions of CST. I invite the reader to examine with me some core concepts of CST as they are used in the current literature. As this examination will demand some patience from the reader, a preliminary clarification of four main threads of the argument may be helpful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dialogical versus monological systems approach</head><p>The prevailing approach to applied science is expert-driven in that it locates true competence solely in expertise. To be considered competent to have an opinion, one must be an expert in the matter under discussion. Concerned lay people may be listened to, but when it comes to judging an issue, they are not really considered competent. The underlying concepts of expertise and rationality are in this sense 'monological' (leading to a monologue of experts) rather than dialogical. The approach relies on a theory of knowledge that is rooted in the model of the empirical sciences and (in the case of OR/MS and other applied disciplines) in systems theory. Although discourse among those considered competent does play an important role in this model, expertise rather than dialogue is the main driving force.</p><p>A thoroughly discursive approach, in contrast, would be dialogue-driven; it would derive its concepts of expertise and rationality from a theory of knowledge rooted in discourse theory-the theory of rational discourse-and in practical philosophy, the branch of philosophy that is concerned with the problem of practical reason. To be considered competent, one must make a cogent argument, that is, substantiate one's concerns and reasons in a way that is credible to all parties concerned. Another distinctive feature of a discursive approach as I understand it is that it goes beyond the conventional 'problem-solving' stance of OR/MS and other applied disciplines. It recognizes that the answers we get are rarely better than the questions we ask. Hence, it is usually better to ask the right questions without having the answers than to have the answers without having asked, and continuing to ask, the right questions. 'Competence depends more on the questions we ask than on the answers we find'. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> A discursive approach will therefore shift the emphasis in the way it understands and uses methodologies, from 'problem solving' to learning and solution questioning. It will focus on facilitating systematic processes of examining the validity claims that underpin solutions. Equally important, it will not let the problem-solving methodology used define the problem or limit the questions that are asked about the problem. The quality of a discursive approach reveals itself in the openness of the process of questioning that it promotes. A high-quality process should make sure that the questions that may be asked are not limited by any prior definition of 'the' problem or solution approach, or of the group of those who may ask questions. This is the discursive perspective that CSH seeks to associate with systems thinking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A discourse theory of critique</head><p>The discursive shift that I advocate is inspired, in different ways, by the dialectical systems approach of Churchman <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> and by the discourse-theoretic turn of both contemporary practical philosophy and critical social theory, particularly as represented by the theory of communicative action of Habermas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> However, I need to emphasize an essential difference between my work on CSH and these two approaches, a difference that most commentators in the field of CST have tended to ignore thus far. I mean CSH's critical turn away from a concept of rationality that is so ideally comprehensive that it remains unachievable in practice. For different reasons, both Churchman and Habermas pursue such ideal concepts of rationality. Churchman is motivated by his holistic understanding of the system idea, which leads him into a heroic quest for comprehensiveness; Habermas is motivated by his search for a consensus theory of truth, which leads him to adopt an ideal model of rational discourse.</p><p>In distinction to Churchman, I try to associate the systems idea with practicable forms of critique rather than with a heroic quest for comprehensive knowledge and understanding. In distinction to Habermas, my approach is discursive but not consensus-oriented. The point of a consensus theory of truth and practical reason is that any validity claim inherently refers to the possibility of rationally defendable consensus; but as we have learned from Habermas, rationally defendable consensus depends on the assumption of an 'ideal speech situation', that is, a situation of symmetric argumentative chances and competencies. For theoretical purposes, this consequence opens up an avenue for identifying universal conditions of rationality; for practical purposes, however, the implication is that truth and practical reason (normative validity) remain unachievable ideals. For this reason, I do not equate a discursive approach with a consensus theory of truth and of normative validity but rather with a discourse theory of critique: while rationally defendable consensus is bound to remain an ideal, inter-subjectively compelling forms of critique are achievable. I believe that such a theory-the attempt to secure at least a critical solution to the problem of rational discourse-is the missing link between CST and reflective professional practice; and that systems thinking itself holds the key to developing such a theory. My approach to CST tries to show how this is possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two strands of CST</head><p>Particularly in Britain, CST is often identified with one particular (British) school of systems thinking only. It seems to me that this use of the term is historically inaccurate and systematically arbitrary. I employ the term CST as a general term for the use of systems thinking in the service of reflective practice.</p><p>CST as I understand emerged in the late 1970s at the University of California, Berkeley, where, inspired by my philosophical teacher and mentor C West Churchman, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> I sought to develop his dialectical 'philosophy of social systems design' into a rigorous, critically tenable yet practicable, framework for reflective practice. Some early publications document the development of the framework during those years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> At UC Berkeley I also met Jurgen Habermas, who early in 1980 spent some time there as a visiting professor and whose thinking about practical philosophy and critical social theory in terms of discourse theory became a second major source of inspiration. Habermas had not yet published his main work <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> at that time, but the rigour and critical spirit of his philosophizing impressed me profoundly. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> There was of course quite a philosophical tension between Churchman's holistic systems thinking and Habermas' critical theory. Yet, they shared some common philosophical roots in the works of Kant <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> and Peirce; 28 thus, there had to be some deep connection. Consequently, the work of Kant and Peirce, too, became important for my effort to marry systems thinking and critique. Eventually, through the study of these two authors, I found a crucial methodological link between systems thinking and critique in the concept of a critical employment of system boundaries (or 'boundary judgements', as I like to call them in order to emphasize their judgemental character). Systems thinking without critique is blind with respect to its underpinning boundary judgements and their normative implications; critique without systems thinking is boundless, and ultimately empty, in that its object and context of valid application remain arbitrary. I thus ended up replacing Churchman's holistic understanding of the systems idea with a new focus on the inevitable lack of comprehensiveness in all our systems maps and designs. This new focus for me became the basic critical message and significance of the systems idea. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> The shift of emphasis from Churchman's holistic to a merely critical understanding of the systems idea-the critical turn of systems thinking-may seem a small and almost obvious step to take with hindsight, but it had (and continues to have) far-reaching implications that make it a continuously difficult step to take for most of my students. It meant the systems idea was a messenger of 'bad news' <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> rather than the guarantor of superior rationality that it had been supposed to be, for instance in the typical title or subtitle of many journal papers and dissertations of the time, 'A Systems Approach to y'. We may laugh about so much epistemological innocence today, but taking the messenger seriously remains a difficult challenge to all applied scientists. Mind you, once you have taken the critical turn, as small as the step may seem, there is no going back. Once you have taken it, using a 'systems approach' will become more meaningful but by no way easier. It will forever demand from you a sustained effort to examine the systemic, normative and empirical underpinnings of your professional claims and propositions. That is what I mean by CST.</p><p>My attempt to develop a framework for this kind of systems thinking, first at Berkeley and then in Bern and elsewhere, resulted in the idea of a critical heuristics of systems thinking or 'CSH'. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> To the best of my knowledge, CSH represented the first systematic attempt at providing both a philosophical foundation and a practical framework for CST.</p><p>Enter the second strand of CST. It goes back to work done mainly in the mid and late 1980s at Hull University by Jackson and Keys, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> who were later joined by Flood. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> The collection Critical Systems Thinking 52 is frequently cited as representative of this strand of CST, although it actually unites contributions from both strands; it stands for early attempts by Jackson, Flood and myself to cooperate in a common project that we jointly called 'CST'. I suspect the circumstance that Flood and Jackson signed as editors has contributed to the widespread confusion of CST with the particular strand of CST coming from Hull.</p><p>The work done at Hull aimed at a critical handling of the growing diversity of systems methodologies. Based on Jackson and Key's <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> 'system of systems methodologies' (SOSM), it sought to develop a 'meta-methodological' framework that should guide the choice and application of systems methodologies according to the kind of problem situation at hand. This ambition found its expression in Flood and Jackson's 51 'total systems intervention' (TSI). Flood and Jackson no longer work together and their ideas have developed in somewhat different directions; but the core ideas of this strand of CST were defined in TSI and I will therefore refer to it as the 'TSI strand' of CST, as distinguished from the 'CSH strand'. In contrast, I will understand 'CST' as a general term that encompasses both strands (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). In this way, I hope to avoid any terminological confusion between CST and TSI. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> characterizes the two strands of CST with respect to some essential differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>From CST to critically systemic discourse (CSD)</head><p>Although the CSH strand has been influential in the development of CST, its implications reach beyond present conceptions of CST as seen through the prevailing lens of the TSI strand. They concern particularly three issues on which I propose to focus in the following sections:</p><p>(1) the meaning of critical discourse;</p><p>(2) the methodological intent of the emancipatory interest; and, related to this, (3) the search for a critically tenable notion of methodological pluralism or 'complementarism'.</p><p>It seems to me that misconceptions of these three issues have impeded a proper understanding of what a discursive systems approach can contribute to reflective practice. In order to clarify these three concepts, I propose that we take present conceptions of CST one decisive step further, towards a truly discursive understanding of CST as Critically Systemic Discourse (CSD). Let us then, in the subsequent main sections of this essay, consider these three basic issues:</p><p>Re (1). Concerning the concept of discourse, I will argue that we need to connect it with an adequate notion of civil society. As I intend to show, the critical significance of a discursive approach risks being lost if we do not embed it within a proper notion of the public sphere. The question is, What is the proper universe of discourse for theorizing about, and practising, critical discourse?</p><p>Re (2). Likewise, the meaning of critique threatens to be lost if we do not link it properly to the emancipatory interest, that is, if we do not give the latter an adequate methodological status and place in CST. This requirement, it will become clear, has little to do with the ideological effusiveness and radical language that can sometimes be observed in publications on CST. Quite the contrary, it frees critical systems practitioners from an alleged need for subscribing to a wholesale 'commitment to emancipation'. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> Such a commitment in practice gives rise to major dilemmas concerning the credibility and practicability of critical systems intervention while contributing nothing to the methodological task of securing critical practice. The question thus is, What is the proper role of the emancipatory interest in CST?</p><p>Re (3). Finally, as I will argue, the methodological place we give to the emancipatory interest is equally fundamental for developing a proper notion of methodological complementarism. Within a framework of CST, such a notion may be expected to support reflective professional practice. Both strands of CST have advanced their own notions of complementarism; however, the literature has thus far equated CST's concept of methodological complementarism with the one advanced by the TSI strand. I do not think that this prevailing notion of complementarism is serving the cause of reflective practice well. The question therefore is, What is a proper notion of methodological complementarism for CST?</p><p>Discourse and the public sphere</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The locus of discourse in CST</head><p>In the discussion on CST, I have observed a tendency to identify the locus of critical discourse (whether in an everyday or professional setting) in too narrow a way. Many systems thinkers seem to conceive of it as a singular, locally and temporally given situation of problem solving and decision-making, for instance in commercial or community organizations. One type of situation that has attracted particular interest is represented by problemsolving and decision-making processes under conditions of structural inequality, where a group of people in charge (those who have the say) face another group who are in some way affected or concerned but who lack power. This is the well-known 'coercive' situation to which critical systems practice is assumed to address itself. Critical practice is then faced with an emancipatory issue. To quote an early but still influential account from the TSI strand of CST, How would existing methodologies fare in dealing with coercive problem-situations? Methodologies suitable for unitary contexts (of the rational or cybernetic versions) take the organization to be like a team. Everybody is perceived as having the same objectives. Inevitably when employed in a coercive situation such methodologies would end up buttressing the status quo and serving the most powerful participants. y Methodologies suitable for pluralist contexts (of the dialectical or soft systems versions) take the organization to be like a coalition in which different groups do possess some different interests. They allow greater recognition of conflicting values and points of view. They attempt to encourage debate and participation in order eventually that different perspectives can be reconciled. In a coercive situation, however, because of unequal access to power, and because of the existence of institutionalized domination, the process of debate and participation will be severely constrained. y The systems person is left in a dilemma in coercive situations. If s/ he is content simply to serve the most powerful, s/he can use an existing methodology, content that the existence of coercion will help guarantee its success. If however s/he wants to bring about 'whole systems improvement', s/he must in some way equalize the balance of power in the system and get rid of the structures of domination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> Such a notion of the situation in which critical discourse should unfold some emancipatory power appears to me only partly adequate, for it is not embedded within a notion of the larger system in which any particular discourse takes place and of which it is a part. It tacitly conceives of emancipation as a one-shot exercise, a singular event that must take place within the given discourse situation, according to the motto: emancipation here and now! This has difficult implications.</p><p>First, as Jackson <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> and some critics <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> have recognized, it puts systems practitioners in an awkward position. They have to choose between an uncritical, merely instrumental application of their expertise, which renders the emancipatory claims of CST redundant, and emancipatory advocacy, which, due to the likely resistance of those in charge, threatens to render systems practitioners themselves redundant. Even if we grant that some practitioners may still choose the difficult option of emancipatory advocacy and get corresponding mandates, what have we won in terms of developing methodological tools and criteria for reflective professional practice? An emancipatory commitment is a personal act of faith rather than a methodological achievement; <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> it provides no basis for compelling argumentation.</p><p>A second problematic implication of the tendency to locate the emancipatory issue in isolated, coercive problem contexts is this: it ultimately renders the critical business of CST entirely illusory-by definition! A coercive context is defined by structural conditions that create an asymmetry of discursive chances, for instance regarding the distribution of influence and decision power, of access to information, of argumentation skills, and so on. It is clear that in real-world discourses, such conditions of structural inequality are the rule rather than the exception. More importantly, it will be difficult ever to establish with certainty that a non-coercive situation obtains, so that from a critical viewpoint we must be extremely cautious about presupposing non-coercive conditions. It is equally clear that under coercive circumstances, not only the chances for meaningful participation are unequally distributed but also the power to close the debate. By definition, then, an emancipatory approach would be one that can preclude any one-sided domination and closure of the discourse by one of the involved parties, a requirement that amounts to nothing less than creating a situation of structural equality (an 'ideal speech situation' in the sense of Habermas' ideal model of rational consensus) within the given discourse situation. The implication is that emancipatory discourse is unachievable exactly when it is needed, that is, when coercive conditions obtain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Toward an adequate notion of emancipatory discourse</head><p>We have concluded that the prevailing understanding of the locus of emancipatory discourse in CST has self-defeating implications. If one expects an emancipatory approach to secure emancipation 'here and now', or in Jackson's abovequoted words to 'equalize the balance of power in the system and get rid of the structures of domination', then clearly no practicable methodology can be expected to be capable of dealing with coercion. Nevertheless, this assumption continuously reappears in his comments as well as in those of other commentators whom he influenced. While conceding that apart from CSH no systems approach has yet been developed that can deal critically with normative and coercive aspects of problem situations, they ultimately find critical heuristics incapable of dealing with situations of coercion, at least in the quoted sense. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> Common to all these commentators is the undeveloped notion of discourse that is at issue here. They all seem to ignore that their definition of the problem of emancipatory discourse is really the problem. This is not how critical heuristics defines its problem. A more careful look shows that things need not look so hopeless. The above conclusion is not only merely tautological (logically necessary because contained in the premises) but also substantially unwarranted, that is, unnecessary. It rests (a) on a lax use of language and (b) on a fallacy.</p><p>Re (a). Discourse situations may break down because those in control close them or refuse to make any meaningful effort to improve mutual understanding. Such circumstances should not, however, be seen as the only kind of 'coercive' situations to which an emancipatory systems approach can meaningfully address itself. Rather, they represent a limiting case that we have to consider but which is hardly a sensible starting point for a discursive approach. In order to capture the critical significance of a discursive approach, we need a terminology that does not conflate a conceptual limiting case with the wide range of discourse situations of interest. I therefore propose to return to critical heuristics' original language in which I did not speak of 'coercion' but of different 'sources of selectivity' that inevitably flow into systems maps or designs, and of their possible origin either in structural 'distortion' or 'asymmetry' of discourse situations or simply in a lack of critical awareness and reflection. This original terminology is in less danger of conflating the discursive situations in question with a single limiting case (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</p><p>Between the two conceptual limiting cases of an ideal speech situation where distortion does not operate at all, and coercive situations that are defined through total closure of debate, there exists a wide range of discourse situations of interest. They are characterized through different kinds of asymmetries and sources of selectivity. In all these situations, a critical discursive approach makes sense and can unfold some emancipatory potential. The opposition of the two limiting cases is too simple-indeed, neither case represents a possible discourse situation! It is in the entire range between the two limiting cases that we must locate the emancipatory significance of discourse and that it makes sense to conceive of critical systems practice.</p><p>Re (b). Apart from the inexact use of language criticized above, it seems to me that a fallacy is hidden in the conclusion in question, according to which situations of actual coercion cannot be dealt with by a discursive approach such as CSH. The fallacy arises because the boundaries of the given discourse situation are presumed and are tacitly equated with the boundaries of the participants' discursive chances in general. This is in fact another unquestioned assumption shared by all those previously mentioned commentators who find CSH incapable of addressing coercion. It is conspicuous that their criticisms are mostly formulated in a curiously unreflecting, almost hurried manner, usually in two or three sentences that are not buttressed by scholarly argumentation but merely refer to the earlier critics (especially Jackson). They tacitly assume that the emancipatory potential of a discursive critical approach such as CSH can be and needs to be located within the given boundaries of a singular discourse situation. This assumption, together with the inadequate notion of 'coercive' situations, leads them to the conclusion summarized by Midgley:</p><p>Coercive situations are usually characterized by closure of debate. Either those with power simply refuse to talk to other people, they use their power to subdue or get rid of people who challenge them, or they have 'reasons' why everything that is being said during debate misses the point. As Willmott, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65</ref> Ivanov, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67</ref> and Romm <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69</ref> have all observed, in any of these circumstances the use of CSH to guide debate becomes redundant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71</ref> My reply to these observers is: 'Are you sure?' What other practicable approaches would they possibly wish to invent in order to redeem the sort of emancipatory claim that they associate with the systems approach? It seems to me that there can be no such approach, be it a discursive approach or whatever type of 'method', since the problem is inadequately defined within the boundaries of a singular given discourse situation. No conceivable model of discourse can prevent those in control of a local discourse situation from closing down the debate whenever they wish, be it only because they have to pass from debate to action; but does this fact imply that any further critical effort is 'redundant'?</p><p>This sort of reasoning begs the question-the conclusion is taken for granted in the premise. The premise is that the boundaries of a given discourse situation represent the boundaries of all discursive chances in general, so that those parties whose concerns are suppressed cannot carry these concerns into multiple other chances for arguing them. This is an unnecessary assumption. What I think is missing in this conception of emancipatory discourse is the role of people as citizens. No discourse participant is a participant in one discourse only. As citizens, we are all part of diverse social systems and fulfil in these different systems various roles of a professional, private and public kind, which together offer a great variety of discursive chances. This holds true even under authoritarian or dictatorial regimes, for no regime controls all these discursive chances; the recent historical changes in Eastern Europe provide a case in point. What matters is whether we can use these many chances to exchange ideas, to learn about issues and voice our concerns effectively. If we disregard this larger environment, our concept of emancipatory systems practice is bound to be too narrow.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> illustrates how I think we should, in principle, conceive of the locus of discourse: Any particular discourse is embedded within spheres of other discursive chances, located at different levels of public exposure and relevance. For the sake of simplicity, the figure shows only two intermediate levels (shown as circles) between the particular local discourse and societyat-large. They stand for a multitude of discursive chances reaching from domain-specific (eg professional) discourses with specific audiences and low public exposure to discourses with larger audiences and a high degree of public exposure At each level, there will be many partly overlapping discourses concerning different object-domains and audiences. The figure shows only three different objectdomains (X, Y and Z), bordering on one another rather than overlapping, to hint at the multiple discursive chances that may arise for articulating a certain issue.</p><p>What happens at one level (its output) may be the subject of discourse (input) at another level; the arrows symbolize the interdependence of the spheres. Although each particular discourse (marked as 'local discourse') is obviously limited in respect to its accessibility for people and will be closed at some point, what matters is that together the different discursive spheres and domains offer multiple chances for the articulation of concerns that may be suppressed in particular discourses. This multiplicity of discursive chances is vital for a functioning public sphere; it makes it accessible (however imperfectly) to normal citizens. The public sphere is that realm of discursive chances which lies between the realms of the entirely private and the state's political-administrative system. To the extent that it is accessible to ordinary people, it offers them an arena for unrestricted articulation and discussion of concerns that have been suppressed elsewhere. It gives them a chance to submit such concerns to the 'public competition of private arguments'. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72</ref> There is no guarantee, of course, that any specific concern will win public approval, but this is not the point. The point is that all concerns, regardless of whose concerns they are, have a realistic chance of being voiced. Thus, discourses that have broken down in the other spheres can always be reopened in the public sphere. This is obviously an ideal, but a powerful one. Although it is true that we can never expect it to become completely real, it is equally true that it is hardly ever completely unreal; for, as we have noted above, no authority, not even a totalitarian regime, can control all discursive chances. The public sphere, then, is the medium that gives a voice to people when all other discursive chances have broken down.</p><p>It is of course an empirical matter, how this entire scenario looks in a concrete case. As a rule, it will look much more complex than the primitive model of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>; that is to say, the multiplicity of discursive chances will be the more pronounced. As an example, we may take the current controversy on genetically modified food and crops, or any other environmental, health-related, social or other issue of our time. It is through individual citizens who at some point have taken their concerns to the public arena that these issues have become a subject of public discussion and thus cannot easily be suppressed in other discursive spheres either. Hajer <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73</ref> offers a comprehensive empirical study of the mechanisms by which environmental concerns have increasingly become topics of discourse at various levels of public exposure and relevance, from the local to the transnational level.</p><p>But then, what does it mean to have a voice if that voice can always be silenced, by disparaging its relevance as compared to those who know more and have more to say? It takes more than giving people a voice; we must also make those voices heard, by making them 'competent' and thus relevant, at least for critical purposes. Fostering such critical competence in both professionals and citizens is one of the basic aims of CST as I understand it. Thus our argument comes full circle: Just as an adequate framework of discursive rationality cannot do without the notion of an accessible public sphere, we cannot expect the public sphere to play its part in a living civil society without a clear and well-founded notion of how ordinary citizens can attain a basic critical competence. This is precisely what the emancipatory concern of critical heuristics is all about. Its societal significance is that ultimately, citizens (whether as professionals or as lay people) are the only conceivable guarantors of a functioning public sphere.</p><p>In conclusion, the boundaries of emancipatory discourse should never be equated with a singular discursive chance. The proper context for conceiving of the emancipatory potential of a discursive, critical systems approach is civil society-a social sphere of multiple discursive chances where citizens, whether as professionals or as lay people, can make their concerns heard and thereby also contribute to a functioning public sphere. CST, understood properly within the context of civil society, might help citizens in assuming this role. The current revival of the idea of civil society is of great interest here and can provide some guidance for the further development of CST. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emancipation and critique</head><p>Much of what has been written in recent years about CST suffers from some basic confusion with respect to the concept of emancipation. On the one hand, CST is often associated with an emancipatory commitment of the professional; on the other hand, the emancipatory quest of CST has frequently been justified by reference to Habermas' theory of knowledge-constitutive cognitive interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> and its emancipatory interest. The relationship between the two kinds of emancipatory orientation has remained unclear.</p><p>A similar lack of clarity can be observed with regard to the relationship between emancipation and critique. What is the precise relationship between the emancipatory interest and CSD? How should we relate the emancipatory interest to the two other knowledge-constitutive interests in Habermas' theory, the 'technical' interest in instrumental control and the 'practical' interest in mutual understanding? In order to gain more clarity, I propose to examine the relation of the emancipatory interest to ideology (first subsection), to critique (second subsection), and to the unity of reason (third subsection). All three issues are important to a proper understanding of the 'emancipatory' orientation of CSD.</p><p>Emancipatory interest versus emancipatory commitment: from ideology to methodology I suspect that the frequent association of CST with a somewhat effusive commitment to human emancipation and liberation springs from a misunderstanding of the meaning of the emancipatory interest. We would probably have done well to distinguish more carefully than until now between the epistemological and methodological importance (and indeed, inescapability) of the Habermasian 'emancipatory interest' on the one hand, and the ideological character (and hence, methodological arbitrariness) of an a priori 'emancipatory commitment' on the other. If we conflate these two readings of the emancipatory quest and more or less equate the emancipatory interest with an ideological commitment, the emancipatory interest seems to imply that critical practitioners are expected to promote the cause of those groups of persons whom they see in need of emancipation and help. They are thus expected to adopt an advocacy stance in favour of some key clients (eg the socially disadvantaged). Understood as a methodological issue, however, the emancipatory interest is rather a means (or more precisely, a theoretically necessary condition) for securing the possibility of discourse. The 'emancipatory interest' in this sense is without regard for persons; its only advocacy is in favour of a situation of undistorted communication in which all concerned parties have as equal a chance of articulating their concerns as possible. It is in the latter sense that Habermas, in his theory of cognitive interests, employs the term. Now, there is admittedly a certain ambiguity in Habermas' concept of the emancipatory interest. As he avows, undistorted, oppression-free communication is not only a means for realizing conditions of rationality but is at the same time also an end in itself, an 'ideal form of life'. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74</ref> In order to justify this ambiguity, Habermas <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75</ref> uses both an empirical and a systematic argument. The empirical argument refers to the historical role that the institutionalization of domain-specific, oppression-free discourses in philosophy, science, and government has played in the development of civil liberties. That is to say, Habermas believes that historically there are gains in rationality that have been made possible by steps toward the emancipatory utopia, and that this process can and ought to continue. I will not consider this argument any further, as it seems neither necessary nor quite convincing to me.</p><p>More important is the systematic argument. It is well known. For Habermas, the normative content of the theory of communicative action is not founded on an arbitrary ideological choice but rests on the very structure of meaningful communication. Communication is meaningless unless we assume the possibility of mutual understanding. When we enter into a discourse, we anticipate the willingness of all participants to substantiate the validity claims contained in their speech acts (if asked to do so) in a truthful and rationally motivated manner. We expect them to rely on argumentation rather than on non-argumentative means such as power or deception. Communication relies on this anticipation of a 'rational motivation', a 'will to reason' that renounces the use of non-argumentative forces. In that sense, the quest for rationality ultimately implies the emancipatory utopia of a society free from unjustified domination. Therein consists for Habermas the inevitable normative (ethical) foundation of all communication and, specifically, of any notion of communicative rationality.</p><p>One might surely doubt whether this is a sufficient selfdeclaration regarding the normative foundation of the emancipatory cognitive interest. Be that as it may, the question that interests us here is only whether this ambiguity requires us to distinguish CST from other approaches by associating it a priori with a radical ideological stance. First, it seems clear enough that Habermas' intent is not to dispense us from the need for questioning the normative content of all our professional practice. Such questioning requires a methodically disciplined effort of identifying the concrete value implications of a particular professional intervention; it is not merely a matter of general a priori 'commitments'. If some critical systems thinkers wish to orientate their systems practice generally toward an ideologically motivated radical commitment, it is their right to do so, and then it is also appropriate that they declare this ideological stance clearly. They should not, however, confuse such a personal stance with a methodologically necessary aim of CST. Personally, I prefer to choose-and questionmy normative commitment in the specific situation at hand rather than fix it in a sweeping axiomatic fashion-there is no methodological need to do so. What matters is that we lay open the normative content of any specific argumentation, whatever that normative content may be. We have to check such content in every single case. A sweeping ideological commitment does not alter this requirement; it only has the effect that many practitioners 'switch off' from CST as soon as its allegedly constitutive emancipatory commitment is mentioned, as for example Gregory <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76</ref> has observed.</p><p>In my understanding, no specific ideological commitment-one that would go beyond the mentioned ethical foundation of discourse-is constitutive of CST in general; quite the contrary, CST must leave room for different ethical positions to be considered in any specific application. Therein lies, in fact, its purpose! Its basic concern is in surfacing alternative positions and in understanding how they conflict from a systemic point of view, for example (as in CSH) by demonstrating how they depend on different boundary judgements with respect to the problem situation in question. This amounts to a systematic effort of dealing critically with both the empirical and the normative content of systems maps or designs, but certainly not to a need for prescribing any predefined ethical stance.</p><p>A second reason speaks against the association of the emancipatory interest in Habermas' sense with an emancipatory commitment in an ideological sense. An ideological commitment is an act of faith, not a methodological achievement. It does not in any way contribute to the methodological task that critical systems thinkers have set themselves: the task of developing frameworks and princi-ples that are apt to secure a critical use of systems ideas and in this way are conducive to reflective professional practice. To this end, we must demonstrate what methodological precautions can secure such practice.</p><p>In conclusion, the methodological intent of the emancipatory interest is critique. That leads us to the next issue in need of clarification, the relation between 'emancipation' and 'critique'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emancipatory interest versus critique: from shallow to deep complementarism</head><p>Since the publication of Jackson and Keys' 41,46-48 SOSM, two different notions of CST appear to coexist in the literature in a rather unreflected manner. The one is embodied in CSH, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> the other in Flood and Jackson's <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> total systems intervention (TSI) and-to a lesser degree-in Flood's <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77</ref> Solving Problem Solving. Quite some confusion seems to have been caused by this coexistence. It concerns particularly the issue of methodological complementarism, that is, the way in which the two approaches deal with the interdependence of the theoretical-instrumental, the practical, and the emancipatory interests of reason.</p><p>To begin with CSH, it aims to promote reflective practice through a critical employment of the systems idea. The idea is that both the meaning and the validity of practical propositions (eg solution proposals or evaluations) depend on assumptions about what 'facts' (observations) and 'norms' (valuations) are to be considered relevant and what others are to be ignored or considered less important. I call these assumptions 'boundary judgements', for they define the boundaries of the reference system to which a proposition refers and for which it is valid. A critical employment of the systems idea requires that we understand and disclose the selectivity of reference systems. We need, on the one hand, to identify the sources of such selectivity (a); on the other hand, we need to assess its practical and ethical implications and to surface options (b). Based on these two critical efforts, it becomes then possible-where necessary-to challenge unqualified claims to knowledge or rationality by means of compelling argumentation (c).</p><p>Re (a). Concerning the selectivity of reference systems, critical heuristics traces them to the sources of human intentionality that condition them. For instance, whose interests are to be served and whose not? Who is to be involved? What is to count as an improvement of the situation? Who is to be considered a legitimate stakeholder? And so on. Each of these questions requires a boundary judgement that in turn will influence a proposal's selectivity. Together, these boundary judgements determine the proposal's reference system. Critical heuristics therefore seeks to provide a conceptual framework for identifying and debating boundary judgements systematically.</p><p>At the heart of the framework is the idea of a systematic process of systemic boundary critique. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> It aims to make visible the ways in which any specific claim is conditioned by boundary judgements and how the facts and values it asserts change when the boundary judgements are modified. A helpful concept to explain this is the 'eternal triangle' <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> of reference system, facts, and values (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</p><p>Boundary judgements, empirical observations (or judgements of fact), and normative evaluations (value judgements) are so strongly interdependent that any claim to knowledge or normative rightness that does not disclose its underpinning boundary judgements, claims too much-it ignores (or conceals) its built-in selectivity. Thinking through the triangle means to consider each of its corners in the light of the other two. Thus, we will examine assertions of fact in the light of alternative boundary judgements and/or value judgements; for instance, what new facts appear relevant if we expand the boundaries of the reference system or modify our value judgements? Likewise, we will examine normative assertions in the light of alternative empirical observations and related boundary judgements; how do our valuations look if we consider new facts that refer to a modified reference system? Finally, we will of course also examine our boundary judgements in the light of different empirical and normative assertions; in what way may our reference system fail to do justice to these different perspectives and needs to be adapted? I call this process of working through the triangle systemic triangulation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78</ref> 'Triangulation' originally means the use of different (at least three) triangulation points for the purpose of surveying land. In the empirical social sciences, by analogy, it means the use of different research approaches (methods, data sources, and perspectives) for the purpose of gaining a more comprehensive and reliable data basis.</p><p>Systemic triangulation, in the sense that I propose here, goes beyond this well-known concept of triangulation by combining different data bases with different value sets and reference systems, so as to gain a better understanding of the inherent selectivity of practical propositions.</p><p>Re (b). Concerning the practical implications of the thusidentified selectivity, systematic boundary critique means unfolding the ways a claim may affect all the parties concerned, regardless of whether or not their concerns have been included in the underpinning reference system. Through a process of systematic alteration of boundary judgements-in other words, conceptual switching between different reference systems-a claim's selectivity becomes visible. Critical heuristics uses to this end a systematic opposition of two basic types of reference systems: the primary system of concern (which stands for a claim's builtin rationality, that is, the concerns that are represented by the reference system) and the context of application (which considers all the effects that the claim may impose on third parties, that is, stakeholders whose concerns are not represented by the primary system of concern). Once the two types of reference systems have been identified at least tentatively-the purpose of boundary critique is not boundary setting but rather boundary testing-switching back and forth between them shows how relevant facts and values depend on, and may change with, boundary assumptions that are specific to the concerns of certain stakeholders but may exclude or not adequately consider the concerns of others. Without such a process, the selectivity of these boundary judgements might remain unrecognized or might be taken for granted in a dogmatic way. A full theoretical discussion of this process of unfolding, as well as a practical operationalization, can be found elsewhere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80</ref> Re (c). Of particular importance for this process is that it must not depend on the willingness of those in control of a discourse to disclose their boundary judgements. This requirement motivated the discussion of the locus of discourse earlier in this paper; it is also behind another central concept of critical heuristics, the emancipatory employment of boundary judgements. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> The concept explains how boundary judgements can be used for compelling argumentation against claims that either do not disclose the underpinning boundary judgements or support them with other than argumentative means. The essential point is that such emancipatory boundary critique does not depend on any special expertise regarding the claim at issue and thus can give a new critical competence to ordinary people. Its understanding of rational criticism draws on Habermas' theory of communicative rationality and accordingly treats the emancipatory interest as an integral part of critical inquiry and practice.</p><p>So much for a brief introduction to critical heuristics' central concept of systemic boundary critique. Let us now return to the issue of methodological complementarism. How does boundary critique deal with this issue? I would argue that boundary critique as it is conceived in critical heuristics, meets the essential critical intent of well-understood methodological complementarism. The intent consists in precluding any one-sided reliance either on a merely technical interest in securing instrumental knowledge and successful action that does not question the value judgements it implies, or on a practical interest in achieving mutual understanding on normative issues that is not informed by sufficient knowledge of relevant facts (eg concerning necessary conditions and possible consequences of action). Both kinds of claims must moreover stand the test of the emancipatory interest in securing conditions of undistorted discourse, which is to say, they must not rely on any boundary judgements that are hidden or imposed by non-argumentative means.</p><p>Since the present state of systems thinking and practice is still dominated by a mainly instrumental, functionalist understanding of the systems idea, the thrust of this critical effort was originally (and still needs to be) directed mainly toward surfacing the normative content of all systems practice. Most systems methodologies, as well as other approaches to problem-solving and reflective practice, <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81</ref> have indeed remained quite incapable of dealing systematically and self-critically with their own normative content. From the previous explanation of the critical employment of the systems idea it should be clear, however, that the underlying concept of critique is not unidirectional. Since boundary judgements are contained in empirical as well as in normative claims, critical heuristics also requires and enables us to challenge the empirical content of propositions, that is, their selectivity with respect to the facts that are considered relevant. On what boundary judgements do asserted facts depend? Could or should they rely on different boundary judgements? Are they still valid and relevant if we redefine the reference system, by modifying one or several boundary judgements? What other facts may then come into the picture? Conversely, does the reference system still look appropriate if we consider additional empirical evidence or value considerations? And so on. In this way, we can unfold the normative content of asserted facts as well as the empirical content of asserted values. The point is of course that all claims either to empirical knowledge or to normative rightness invariably depend on both kinds of assertions. It is the very inseparability of empirical and normative assertions, which is at the heart of the approach.</p><p>Corresponding to this systematic intent, critical heuristics' underlying concept of rationality is explicitly two dimensional. It is inspired by Kant's 82 notion of the twodimensionality of reason, wherein the theoretical-instrumental and the practical-ethical dimensions of rationality are seen to be mutually interdependent and hence, inseparable; only together can they secure rationality. This Kantian concept of rationality implies what I have called 'fundamental' or 'deep' methodological complementarism 1,2,9,78 : no method is complete unless it deals critically with both dimensions at the same time, rather than taking the assertions concerning either dimension for granted. To that precise extent, methodological complementarism is a critical necessity. For this reason, critical heuristics was from the beginning built on this notion of 'deep' methodological complementarism, whatever some commentators such as Jackson <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64</ref> and Midgley <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70</ref> have asserted to the contrary.</p><p>Turning now to TSI, complementarism is also a core concern of this second strand of CST which was developed at the University of Hull and is often wrongly equated with CST in general. Its understanding of complementarism is quite different. It locates the need for complementarism on a (supposedly) meta-methodological level of methodology choice. The idea is that methodologies can be classified according to their assumptions with respect to the problemsolving situation in hand. Provided the classification scheme does justice to the theoretical core assumptions of classified methodologies, it is taken to furnish a theoretical basis for methodological pluralism. Methodological pluralism is expected to ensure a critically tenable application and combination of all kinds of methodologies, regardless of the different research paradigms and/or social theories in which they may be rooted.</p><p>Crucial for TSI's achievement of this goal is, first of all, the classification of approaches that it proposes (a), and second, the way in which it then uses this classification in order to secure a critical application of different methodologies (b).</p><p>Re (a). In the original version of TSI <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> -I will call it 'TSI 1'-the classification scheme is furnished by the SOSM. It is well known and I can therefore be brief. Three ideal-types of problem situations are distinguished, each of which is then subdivided into a 'simple' and 'complex' subcategory (a subdivision that I will ignore in the following, as it does not matter for my argument here). Conventional hard systems approaches are understood to assume that there is no disagreement about the purposes and norms that guide an intervention; the conforming situation is characterized as being 'unitary'. Soft systems approaches are described as assuming that debate on purposes and norms is necessary and possible, in the sense that rational consensus can be reached without being distorted by power or other nonargumentative forces; the corresponding situation is recognized as 'pluralistic'. Finally, emancipatory systems approaches are said to assume that debate on purposes is necessary but not possible, as coercive forces are in operation that either prevent such debate or do not allow us to consider its outcome as rational; the related situation is called 'coercive'.</p><p>In a later version of TSI proposed by Flood <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77</ref> -I will call it 'TSI 2'-the SOSM is replaced by an ad hoc distinction of four 'key dimensions of organization': organizational processes, organizational design, organizational culture, and organizational politics. Three types of organizational activities and issues are said to correspond to these organizational dimensions: rules and practices may be 'technical' (organizational processes and design), 'sociocultural' (organizational culture), or 'sociopolitical' (organizational politics). Three types of problem-solving methods are related to these three types of activities: design ('Howy?'), debate ('Whaty?'), and disimprisoning ('Why and for whomy?'). The original tripartite classification of the SOSM reappears here, although it is no longer used explicitly. Methods for design are conceived in terms of unitary problem situations, methods for debate in terms of pluralist situations, and methods for disimprisoning in terms of coercive situations.</p><p>Re (b). TSI 1 and TSI 2 both seek to locate 'critique' in the choice of methodology. Methods are said to be complementary in the simple sense that different methods are suited to different purposes or problem situations; no one has the monopoly for all situations (except TSI, of course); hence there is room for different types of systems methodologies within a critical systems approach. A critical approach will seek to make sure that methods are used properly, that is, it will respect their intrinsic limitations. These limitations are seen in the underlying assumptions with respect to the problem situation. In particular, it may be asked: To what extent does a method assume that there is no divergence of values (ie, that purposes and evaluation standards are unambiguous) and that non-argumentative forces do not operate (ie, that communication about what is the problem and what constitutes a solution is authentic)? Conventional hard methodologies tend to rely on rather optimistic assumptions; they assume unambiguous purposes and standards as well as authentic communication. Soft methodologies assume less optimal conditions in that they allow for a pluralism of purposes and standards; their optimism regards only the possibility of a consensual understanding on these issues, that is, they do not consider sources of distorted communication. Finally, 'emancipatory' (in CSH terminology: 'critical') systems methodologies drop this last assumption and thus are least optimistic in their presuppositions. Whenever a method is used in a situation for which it is not suitable, the outcome of the intervention will not be critically tenable. It is therefore important to guide practitioners in the task of choosing appropriate methodologies of intervention. Methodology choice is thus the core business of CST from a TSI perspective. The critical and the emancipatory business are no longer the same.</p><p>However, the identification of critique with methodology choice rests on a trivial logical error. While it is correct to say that the intrinsic limitations of any methodology imply the need for a critical choice of methodologies, it does not follow that critical methodology choice is also a sufficient condition for a critical approach. It is obviously not. Critical methodology choice does not preclude a chosen methodology to produce, in each specific application, consequences in need of critical reflection. Whom do these consequences affect and in what way? Who bears the cost? Who gets the benefits? What ethical conflicts are involved? What is the basis of legitimation? What kind of improvement, if any, results? What other definitions of improvement would result if different contexts of application, and hence different facts and values, were considered? And so on. From a criticallyheuristic perspective it appears obvious that critique is more-much more-than informed methodology choice.</p><p>It is true that in TSI 2, Flood <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77</ref> added a 'critical reflection mode' to the basic 'problem-solving mode'. The critical reflection mode is meant to reflect on the outcome of problem solving; but there are no methodological provisions to ensure adequate critique. TSI, because it is merely a metamethodology-that is, a framework for methodology choice rather than a methodology proper-is unable to yield methodological guidelines of its own. The occasional references to CSH as a vehicle for this purpose leave TSI in a logical inconsistency; for it assigns CSH to a subclass of problem situations only, whereas the problem at issue here is of a generic nature.</p><p>Somehow, TSI's attempt to secure critical practice through an ideal-type differentiation of problem-solving contexts and corresponding methodologies is strikingly reminiscent of the positivistic concept of the separability of decisions on ends and choice of means (the so-called meansend schema of positivism). Positivism seeks to keep the choice of means free of value judgements by referring all normative issues to the choice of ends. Once ends have been chosen (an avowedly normative act of faith), it is assumed that means can then be selected 'rationally' in the sense of value-free instrumental rationality (also called purposiverationality ¼ the effectiveness and efficiency of means for achieving given ends). Similarly, TSI appears to refer all normative issues to the choice of the intervention purposes. If emancipatory reflection does not belong to those purposes, a 'soft' methodology such as Checkland's <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84</ref> soft systems methodology is taken to be adequate. If questioning an apparent consensus on purposes does not seem opportune, a conventional 'hard' methodology will do. Consequently, the critical task of surfacing the operation of norms, power, boundary judgements, etc, stands or falls in TSI with the choice of the intervention purpose.</p><p>To be sure, there is nothing wrong with conventional 'hard' or 'soft' methodologies. They do what they propose to do well. What is wrong is TSI's understanding of methodological complementarism, which is not conducive to a critical employment of these methodologies. TSI's framework of 'methodology choice' is not good enough to secure reflective practice. Even where the choice of a hard (design) or soft (debate) approach is complemented by the application of some emancipatory (disimprisoning) reflection along the lines of Flood and Romm's <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref> 'triple-loop learning', the third, emancipatory loop remains a mere appendage, for it is not methodologically integrated with the design and debate methods used. It is not translated into a genuinely critical methodology, much less into methodological safeguards that would make sure that the facts and values that inform design and debate, or the findings and agreements produced by them, are critically tenable. The only way to achieve this is to make emancipatory boundary critique an intrinsic, non-separable part of any use of methods and of any claims to knowledge or rationality. Probably because it conceived of design, debate and disimprisoning in terms of methodology choice, TSI has not taken this ultimate conceptual step. Consequently, its critical claims rest on a voluntaristic solutionan appeal to the goodwill of those in charge that remains methodologically helpless. It cannot take this last step, as this would question the entire framework-its underlying classification of methods, its concept of complementarism, its 'meta-methodological' ambitions.</p><p>The trouble is, TSI's understanding of complementarism focuses on combining methods rather than validity claims. However, critical practice cannot ultimately justify itself by reference to methods. Whatever the methods employed, critical practice needs to deal self-critically with all the validity claims that it invariably raises, including theoreticalempirical claims (concerning the truth of statements of fact), theoretical-instrumental claims (purpose-rationality of means), practical-normative claims (rightness of norms and value judgements), and critical-emancipatory claims (authenticity of discourse and consensus). No methodology whatsoever can justify a neglect of the deep interdependence of these dimensions of rationality. Yet this is exactly what TSI's concept of methodology choice implies (see Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</p><p>In an effort to reconcile its 'emancipatory commitment' with the need for somehow integrating the use of conventional hard and soft methods into its 'critical' framework, TSI tries to restrict the application of emancipatory boundary critique (or other emancipatory methodologies)</p><p>to the subclass of coercive problem situations. As if the two other types of problem situations could in this way be kept free of any need for emancipatory reflection and discourse! In practice, TSI's logic means that the inevitable normative implications of the use of hard or soft methodologies will not be systematically questioned, not any more than the definition of the problem situation that is taken to be relevant. The subclass of coercive problem situations will tend to be an empty class: no methodological safeguards make sure that interventions will actually be based on this type of problem situation whenever the assumptions of an unanimity of goals and of conditions of undistorted discourse might need to be questioned. TSI's practice illustrates this: of the ten case studies reported in Flood, <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77</ref> only one <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">88</ref> led to the use of boundary critique along the lines of CSH.</p><p>We should beware of this kind of shallow methodological complementarism or pluralism. Critical inquiry and practice cannot be secured in this way. Methodology choice along the lines of the positivistic means-end schema simply does not do the trick. The strategy of referring critically-normative issues to previous (or meta-level) decisions concerning the problem situation and/ or the purpose linked to it does not buy as much immunity from value conflicts and coercion as is assumed. Real-world practice cannot be kept free from normative issues, no more than from coercive forces. Why should unitary and pluralist contexts of problem solving not require a critical handling of boundary judgements in terms of emancipatory boundary critique? Boundary judgements are constitutive of any systems map or design, regardless of whether the situation at hand is judged to be of a unitary, pluralistic, or coercive nature. How then can we understand the merits and the validity of a proposal without appreciating the selectivity of asserted facts and norms in terms of underpinning reference systems? And how should we even be able to assess a problem situation with respect to its unitary, pluralist, or coercive character without first defining whatand who-belongs to the relevant problem context? TSI's core problem is then clear: since the emancipatory interest is methodologically constitutive of critical inquiry and design, its importance cannot be restricted to coercive contexts. The conclusion is equally clear: boundary critique must not be subordinated to methodology choice but needs to precede it. The separation of the two methodological concerns of critique and emancipation is not tenable on critical grounds.</p><p>We need not be afraid that without this mistaken separation, there is no place for conventional methods in a critical framework. At issue is not the use of conventional methods in general but only TSI's shallow complementarism. It totally misses the critical intent of what we have described as deep complementarism. Deep complementarism has no difficulties in assigning a legitimate place to conventional methods, for in its framework, the crucial issue is not which type of method(s) we use but rather what Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> The logic of shallow methodological complementarism. Critique is located at the meta-level of methodology choice, while the emancipatory interest is assigned to coercive contexts of methodology implementation only. The emancipatory interest becomes an alternative to, rather than being constitutive of, the technical and the practical interests associated with unitary and pluralist situations, respectively. Unless a situation is assessed coercive, conventional hard and soft approaches only will be employed.</p><p>validity claims we associate with the methods we use and how critically we deal with these claims.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emancipatory interest versus other cognitive interests: from multimethodology to the unity of critical reason</head><p>The essential methodological difference between shallow and deep complementarism lies in the manner in which they handle the different validity claims that are raised by all efforts of design and debate, in particular claims to empirical truth and to normative rightness. Critical heuristics follows Habermas' <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> reconstruction of rational speech in terms of such validity claims and accepts that they are inseparable, for two reasons: (a) they arise simultaneously in any speech situation and (b) they cannot be redeemed independently. The concept of boundary judgements helps us understand how exactly assertions of facts and norms depend on one another. TSI, by contrast, assumes the separability of different types of validity claims, for it associates them with different types of problem situations for which alternative methodologies are taken to be adequate.</p><p>TSI's handling of the emancipatory interest is not compatible with the critical intent of Habermas' discourse theory, and indeed not even with the earlier theory of cognitive interests (to which TSI's authors refer as its theoretical basis). In the systems literature it is often neglected that the three cognitive interests are not really at the same level (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>). The emancipatory interest has only a derivative or auxiliary status; its function is to secure the conditions on which the realization of the other two interests depends. Insofar, however, it is constitutive of all critical inquiry and practice.</p><p>If we now compare this understanding of the cognitive interests with the logic of TSI (see Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>), it becomes apparent that the two logics are in conflict. Neither TSI's location of the three interests as methodological options at the same logical level nor the separation of the emancipatory interest from critique is compatible with the logic of the theory of cognitive interests, much less with its later discourse-theoretic reformulation in terms of unavoidable validity claims. Both aspects of TSI are incompatible with the constitutive role of the emancipatory interest for critical inquiry and practice.</p><p>I suspect the root problem with TSI's understanding of complementarism in terms of methodology choice is a conflation of characteristics of the problem context and characteristics of the argumentation task to be addressed. The relevant characteristics of the problem context are supplied in answer to the question: To what extent is the situation characterized by conflicts of interests and/or asymmetries of power, knowledge and skills? On the other hand, the relevant characteristics of the argumentation task are supplied in answer to the question: What validity claims are to be redeemed, are they claims to empirical truth and instrumental effectiveness, to normative rightness or, related to either kind of claim, to authentic mutual understanding and to rational motivation? The characteristics of problem contexts may differ, but the types of argumentation tasks remain the same.</p><p>The key issue is that of the unity of argumentative reason. The proposition of a complementarity of different spheres of knowledge (cognitive interests) or rationality (validity claims) makes sense only if it is understood to refer to the idea of one unified reason, that is to say, if the different spheres come together in the sense just explained. Although problem contexts vary, argumentation tasks do not: all three issues are raised simultaneously by any professional claim.</p><p>No ideal-type framework of 'methodology choice' can alter this fact. CST, unless it heeds this message, runs the risk of disintegrating once again into separate spheres of rationality, each of which will promote its own methodologies but none of which will be able to secure critical practice-a situation that is all too well known to the field, given that it has for long enough been fragmented into different schools of systems thinking. CSH's early adoption of a Kantian deep complementarism has lost nothing of its critical relevance. Quite the reverse, in view of the currently prevalent misconception of CST in terms of methodology choice, it has even gained additional relevance.</p><p>Conforming to its critical purpose, critical heuristics does not of course pursue the idea of a unity of reason in the sense of a positive claim for comprehensive rationality but uses this idea merely as a standard that can guide (and motivate) critique. What critical heuristics seeks to achieve actively is not the unity of reason-an unachievable but none the less necessary ideal-but the unity of critique. This latter concept means that a critical approach must not one-sidedly focus on The emancipatory interest has a derivative status only, but is of crucial importance for realizing the other two interests; it is constitutive of critical inquiry and practice. That is to say, a critical approach to inquiry stands or falls with the integration of emancipatory self-reflection. a singular sphere of rationality or related cognitive interest but instead must always seek to promote the weaker cognitive interests (or validity claims). In particular, an approach to methodology choice that does not include some guarantee against a merely purposive-rational use of methodologies runs counter to the critical purpose of a properly understood, deep complementarism, for such a guarantee will defend the unity of reason against the everpresent forces of one-dimensional rationalization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89</ref> This applies not only to TSI but also to its successors dubbed 'Creative Design of Methods' <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref> and 'Multimethodology'. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">93,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94</ref> Their orientation toward a pragmatic decomposition and recombination of parts of methodologies from different paradigms does represent a progress in that it overcomes TSI's somewhat arbitrary wholesale assignment of methodologies to different types of problem contexts; but it does not respond to the problem of the unity of reason. Without such a response, however, pragmatism in matters of methodological pluralism risks amounting to a mere 'pick and combine' approach; this threatens to subvert the idea of the unity of reason. Unless we maintain the ideal of a unity of argumentative reason, we risk losing all methodological standards for the proper use of methods.</p><p>But how exactly should the spheres of technical, practical and emancipatory rationality-the two dimensions of purposive-rationality and communicative rationality-be unified through critical discourse? Is it not a fact that for all practical purposes, they tend to conflict rather than harmonize with one another? How is critical reflection to overcome this conflict, rather than merely recognize it? Once again, it seems to me, CSH's concept of boundary critique may offer us some essential insight and help towards adequate discursive practice. As I have explained by means of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, recognition of questions of values can make us change our boundary judgements as to what is the proper system of concern; this in turn may compel us to consider new observations of facts, which again may raise new ethical issues, and so on. The critical systems concept of boundary judgements not only explains the interdependence of knowledge and rightness claims in a generic and precise way, it also provides a secure starting point for the effective integration of emancipatory self-reflection and critique in our concept of rationality. It enables us to trace both the interdependence of knowledge and rightness claims and the operation of nonargumentative forces (power, deception, unchallenged interests behind asserted facts and norms, tacit assumptions, dogmatic and cynical use of boundary judgements, etc) through the one medium in which both problems invariably mirror themselves-the operation of boundary judgements. I propose, in other words, that CSH's notion of systematic boundary discourse-the integration of a generic principle of boundary critique with a proper concept of critical discourse-offers us a critically tenable way forward for achieving the two tasks of a theoretical grounding and a practical fulfilment of the postulate of a unity of critique. This is perhaps the most fundamental concern that motivates the suggested conceptual step from 'CST' to 'critically systemic discourse' (CSD).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion: CSD</head><p>The conclusion from our critical considerations is that we should conceive of critical inquiry and practice as CSD. CSD stands for a concept of reflective professional practice that relies on five basic principles:</p><p>Discourse: Reflective practice depends on the critical force of argumentative, discursive reason. In distinction to prevailing conceptions of CST, critically systemic discourse thus is grounded in a discourse-theoretic framework rather than a framework of critical methodology choice. In distinction to prevailing conceptions of discourse theory, CSD rests on a discourse theory of critique rather than a consensus theory of truth; while rationally defendable consensus remains an unachievable ideal, cogent forms of critique such as systemic boundary critique are achievable.</p><p>The role of civil society: The emancipatory significance of discourse is not properly conceived in terms of a singular local discourse situation but needs to be linked to a notion of civil society that offers all its members (whether as professionals or as citizens) multiple chances for articulating locally suppressed concerns. An adequate concept of reflective professional practice cannot do without civil society. Accordingly, CSD will avoid any one-sided focus on methodology choice in favour of a more fundamental focus on surfacing the validity claims involved in all professional intervention.</p><p>Emancipatory orientation: CSD conceives of the emancipatory interest not as an ideological commitment but as the methodological effort of securing authentic discourse. It thus understands emancipatory reflection and discourse as requirements of all reflective practice. In distinction to prevailing conceptions of CST, it does not treat the emancipatory orientation as a mere option but translates it into a constitutive methodological principle of discoursethe principle of emancipatory, systemic boundary critique.</p><p>Systemic boundary critique: The crucial idea that systemic thinking can contribute to reflective practice consists in the concept of systemic boundary critique, that is, a process of systematic critical revision of the boundary judgements that constitute the reference systems of practical propositions. Both the meaning and the validity of practical propositions depend on these reference systems; hence, systemic boundary critique is an indispensable principle of any applied discipline. Boundary critique is the constitutive methodological principle through which CSD realizes an emancipatory orientation.</p><p>Deep complementarism: Reflective practice requires continuous openness towards all approaches that can shed new light on a problem situation. Methodological pluralism or complementarism is thus indispensable. However, prevailing conceptions of complementarism are deficient in that they rely on a positivistic concept of methodology choice, in which the extent and nature of reflective practice depend on the choice of the intervention purpose. That is to say, systemic boundary critique and other forms of emancipatory reflection and discourse are subordinated to the choice of the intervention purpose (and of a corresponding methodology) rather than being treated as constituents of critical inquiry and practice in general. Deep complementarism distinguishes itself from prevailing, shallow conceptions of methodological complementarism by not subordinating emancipatory reflection and boundary critique to methodology choice. Deep complementarism does not subvert the unity of critical reason.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure2The multiple sphere model of discourse.
