<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Spatial multiplexing is an emerging spatial modulation technique for obtaining high spectral efficiency on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication links <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. It works by dividing the incoming data into multiple substreams and transmitting each substream on a different antenna. The substreams are subsequently separated at the receiver by means of various receiver techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In future wireless systems, mobiles which support spatial multiplexing will be capable of receiving substreams from transmit antennas on one or more base stations. Simultaneous transmission from all available transmit antennas, however, may be difficult due to hardware costs. Further, the substantial cost of multiple RF chains may prevent reception from all available antennas. It is therefore of interest to perform spatial multiplexing on subsets of the available transmit and receive antennas <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper we consider the problem of selecting a subset of transmit and/or receive antennas for spatial multiplexing systems operating in correlated MIMO Rayleigh fading channels. Unlike work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> we base our selection criteria only on the second-order statistics of the channel and not the instantaneous channel realization. This is important because delays in the feedback path (for FDD systems) or large ping-pong times (in TDD systems) cause decision errors in systems which select based on the instantaneous channel realization. The secondorder statistics of the channel, on the other hand, are a function of the local scattering environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and thus vary on much slower time scale. We assume the MIMO channel model introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> in which the channel matrix can be written as a product of a receive correlation matrix, an independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian matrix, and a transmit correlation matrix. This model is appropriate for narrowband systems in which the transmitter and receiver are surrounded by local scatterers (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for more discussion). We assume that perfect estimates of the channel statistics are available (a good assumption in fixed wireless) and perfect channel estimation at the receiver.</p><p>Since performance in practical systems is a function of the error rate we derive selection criteria based on improving the average error probability. For the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) receiver we derive selection criteria which minimizes the union bound on the symbol error rate. The optimal subset is a function of the transmit and receive correlations as well as the desired transmit constellation. Maximum likelihood receivers have superior performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and are useful for lower bounding the symbol error rate of suboptimal receivers. Linear receivers, however, offer a significant computational reduction and are more practical in systems with large numbers of transmit and receive antennas. Therefore, we derive a selection criterion which maximizes a lower bound on the minimum signal to noise ratio. The derived selection criteria for both receivers allows simultaneous (joint) decoupled selection of transmit and receive antennas. Using Monte Carlo simulations, and a GWS-SUS <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> channel model, we show how selection can buy a selection gain on the order of ¡ £¢ ¥¤ §¦ ©¨for the cases considered.</p><p>In certain channel scenarios a diversity gain is also possible.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. In Section II we introduce spatial multiplexing and describe the the channel model with transmit and receive correlations. In Section III we derive selection criteria for both the maximum likelihood receiver and the practical zero-forcing linear receiver. In Section IV we present some simulations and discuss performance improvements. Section V provides our conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL</head><p>In this section we describe the channel model and the spatial multiplexing modulation scheme assumed in this paper.</p><p>Channel model. Consider the point to point wireless link in that there are transmit and ¥ receive an- tenna elements. We assume that the signal bandwidth is much greater than the coherence frequency of the channel and thus it can be modeled as frequency flat. In this case the channel can be described as a ! matrix " 1 . Assuming the pres- ence of local scatters around both the transmitter and receiver, the channel " can be modeled <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">" # %$ '&amp; ( 0) " '1 2$ 3&amp; ( 0) where $ # 54 6$ &amp; ( 0)</formula><p>$ 87 ( 0) @9 is the receive covariance matrix, $ ¥ A# $ 8&amp; ( 0) $ 7 ( 0) is the transmit covariance matrix and " 1 is a matrix with zero mean, i.i.d. complex Gaussian elements with variance one. The transmit and receive covariance matrices are a function of the local scatterers, array geometry, and antenna spacing <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Throughout this paper we assume that $ 3 and $ B are perfectly estimated which is reasonable in fixed wireless and low mobility applications and that " 1 is known perfectly to the receiver but not the transmitter. Since it is only possible to use transmit antennas and receive antennas, it is desirable to choose the best of the possible C ED GF H F I C ED GP H P I submatrices. Let Q be the set of subsets of all possible combinations, C RD SF H F I of columns and T the set of subsets of all possible combinations, C UD SP H P I of rows. The receiver, using a selection algorithm, computes the optimal V XW Q , Y W `T and relays V to the transmitter using a low rate feedback path (in TDD mode, this operation can also be performed at the transmitter). Now define " 4 aY cb 6V 9 as the submatrix corresponding to Y dW eT and V fW Q</p><p>. Then we write " 4 6Y cb aV 9 # $ 8&amp; ( 0) 4 6Y 9 " 1 $ 8&amp; ( 0) 4 gV 9</p><p>" 1 is h i ! , $ ¥ p4 6Y 9 is the submatrix of $ B corresponding to the subset of rows and columns indicated by Y qW T , and like- wise $ ¥ S4 gV 9 is the submatrix of $ B corresponding to the subset of rows and columns indicated by V rW Q</p><p>. The goal of subset selection is to choose V and Y according to some criterion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spatial multiplexing.</head><p>The spatial multiplexing operation works as follows. At one symbol time, A input symbols (from some constellation) are multiplexed to produce the ( A ! ts ) vec- tor symbol, u , for transmission over the A transmit antennas as determined by the selection algorithm. The corresponding v</p><p>We use boldface for vectors and matrices, w 6x y for conjugate transpose, w 6x y a for transpose and w ax y a for pseudo inverse received signal, after matched filtering and sampling, is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2"># " u f (2) # $ &amp; ( 0) 4 6Y 9 " '1 3$ &amp; ( 0) 4 gV 9 u<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where 4 a ! fs 9 is the received signal vector, is the total transmitted signal power, u 4 ! s 9 is the transmitted signal vector, and 4 ! `s 9 is the additive white Gaussian noise vector with noise spectral density, ed .</p><p>To recover the transmitted symbol vector u a spatial receiver is required to remove the linear transformation caused by " <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper we consider two such receivers. The ML receiver estimates f u g# h ji Ek ml en po q sr ut wv yx ¢ f" u {z x</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(4)</formula><p>where | is the set of all possible transmitted vector symbols.</p><p>Although this decoding rule is optimal for equally likely transmitted symbols, the decoding complexity of the ML receiver increases exponentially with the number of transmit antennas ( ).</p><p>An alternative is to consider the linear receiver since it requires only a matrix multiplexing to separate the substreams. It will therefore be of interest in practical systems, particularly those with large numbers of transmit and receive antennas. For simplicity, in this paper, we consider the zero-forcing equalizer which works as follows. The ! matrix equalizer } # ~" 4 6Y cb 6V 9 is applied to to obtain an estimate of u as f u # u S } B</p><p>(5</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>Single symbol detection is performed on each substream. Note that, unlike the ML receiver, the minimum distance of the received constellation is the same as that of the transmit constellation. The equalizer, however, colors the noise thus the noise power can vary according to the inverse of the channel matrix.</p><p>III. SELECTION BASED ON ERROR PROBABILITY In this section we consider selection based on symbol error probability for both the ML and the ZF receivers.</p><p>ML Receiver. To estimate performance of the ML receiver we use the pairwise error probability (PEP) which determines the probability of decoding u z when u is transmitted with ' # r .

Unlike the ML receiver, we do not have a simple expression for the average probability of error. Therefore we develop a selection procedure which is motivated by the instantaneous error probability. As described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, for a given channel, the vector symbol error rate for the zero-forcing linear receiver depends on the post-processing SNR for each í W î s b 0 ßï data stream Therefore optimal selection for the linear receiver depends on the product of the minimum singular values of the transmit and receive covariance matrices. We summarize as follows.</p><p>SC-ZF. Choose V AW Q , Y 3W T such that the product of the sigular values, Õ Ô pð ¾4 6$ 4 gV 9 U9 Õ Ô pð 24 6$ 4 aY 9 U9 , is maximized. Note that the joint selection is decoupled for the linear receiver as well. If either the transmit or the receive correlation is low rank then " 4 aY cb 6V 9 is low rank and the ZF receiver will fail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. SIMULATIONS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>To understand the potential benefits of antenna selection, in this section we provide simulation results obtained using the different selection criteria.

Again, for Scenario I, Y s b 0¡ ca or Y ¿¡ bP2 ca is optimal while for Scenario II, Y s b 2 ca is optimal as given by criterion e gf ¢ ih Xp (see Tab. III). Discussion. In Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>we illustrate the benefits of antenna selection in terms of symbol error rate for different receiver structures. The difference in improvement we term the selection gain which is quantified by the difference in required SNR, at some target symbol error rate, between the best and worst antenna subsets. Essentially, the selection gain characterizes the maximum performance improvement that is possible  by using the selection procedure. Primarily, statistical selection provides a coding gain effect. This is clearly indicated by the analysis for both receivers. For the ML receiver, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> indicates that if the ranks of the receive covariance matrices are the same before and after selection, then we will see a coding gain. From (21), for ZF receivers, the lower bound on the minimum Ì Í Ï improves by the ratio of the minimum singular value of the covariance matrix of the selected optimal antennas to the minimum singular value of the covariance matrix of the antennas in use before optimal selection. This ratio could be one (when the antenna sets before and after the selection rule are the same) in which case there is no gain. On the other hand, if the antenna sets are different, a definite coding gain should be visible. Figs. 2 and 3 illustrate this effect.</p><p>In extreme cases it is possible that some subsets of the antennas will be fully correlated. This can be the case when antenna spacings are small or when there are many antennas. In these cases either the transmit or receive covariance matrices (or both) may be low rank. Since the rank of the covariance matrix plays a roll in the diversity advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, statistical selection may also improve the diversity advantage (if the optimal antenna set has a receive covariance matrix with higher rank). We illustrate this effect in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the best and worst symbol error rates for the ML receiver in scenario III for # r¤ b 0 X# ¡ b i# ~¡ . The receive covariance matrix is r ts B 'B 'B Xu v w w x y F S F S v ' ' P S F 1 c ' S F v ' v ' S F v ' ' P y S S S S v ' ' P 1 F b ' S F ' F S v ' ' P y S S S F v ' ' S F v ' v ' P S F ' P F S v ' ' y d d e</p><p>The receive covariance matrix for the first two receive anten- 0.09 0.30 q nas is highly ill-conditioned and can be treated as a rank one matrix. The covariance matrix for receive antennas 1 and 4 is better conditioned. An improvement in diversity order through a correct choice of antennas (antennas 1 and 4) is predicted by eqn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> and clearly visible in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper we derived criteria for selecting the best subset of transmit and receive antennas in a spatial multiplexing system given only knowledge of the second order statistics of the channel. We derived selection criterion with both ML and zero forcing receivers. We showed that simultaneous selection of transmit and receive antennas can be carried out in a decoupled fashion with transmit antennas selected independently of the receive covariance and vice versa. We quantified the selection gain and showed that both coding gain as well as diversity gain are possible. Finally, we presented simulations illustrating the selection gain provided by the proposed statistical selection criteria.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 Fig. 1 .</head><label>11</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 with transmit and receive RF chains and suppose</figDesc></figure>
