<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Applying reliability methods to a complex structure is often delicate for two main reasons. First, such a structure is fortunately designed with codified rules leading to a large safety margin which means that failure is a small probability event. Such a probability level is difficult to assess efficiently. Second, the structure mechanical behaviour is modelled numerically in an attempt to reproduce the real response and numerical model tends to be more and more time-demanding as its complexity is increased to improve accuracy and to consider particular mechanical behaviour. As a consequence, performing a large number of model computations cannot be considered in order to assess the failure probability. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes an original and easily implementable method called AK-IS for active learning and Kriging-based Importance Sampling. This new method is based on the AK-MCS algorithm previously published by Echard et al. [AK-MCS: an active learning reliability method combining Kriging and Monte Carlo simulation. Structural Safety 2011;33(2):145-54]. It associates the Kriging metamodel and its advantageous stochastic property with the Importance Sampling method to assess small failure probabilities. It enables the correction or validation of the FORM approximation with only a very few mechanical model computations. The efficiency of the method is, first, proved on two academic applications. It is then conducted for assessing the reliability of a challenging aerospace case study submitted to fatigue.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In the frame of this paper, the measure of the structural reliability is the failure probability P f . The response of a structure is characterised by a function GðXÞ depending on the physical random variables X ¼ fX 1 , . . . ,X n g and defining the structural mechanical performance. This function is called the performance function in this paper. The isoprobabilistic transformation T is used to define the standard random variables as U ¼ TðXÞ and the performance function in the standard space as HðUÞ GðT À1 ðUÞÞ. The failure domain F is defined as the space domain where, for any sample x ¼ fx 1 , . . . ,x n g (u ¼ TðxÞ in the standard space), GðxÞ is negative. The safe domain S is defined as the complement of F and the border between both domains is called the limit state GðxÞ ¼ 0. As a result, the failure probability to assess corresponds to the probability of falling into the failure domain F. Two main approaches exist to obtain the failure probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>: the crude simulation techniques such as Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) which sample the random variable space, and the methods such as FORM, SORM which approximate the failure probability based on the knowledge of the most probable failure point (also better named the most central failure point in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>).</p><p>Assessing the reliability of a complex structure presents two main challenges. First, such a structure is fortunately designed with codified rules leading to a large safety margin which means that failure is a small probability event. Assessing small probabilities is difficult using MCS, and variance reduction techniques such as Importance Sampling (IS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> should be preferred. This problem is discussed in Section 2. Second, these simulation methods still require a rather large number of mechanical model computations which leads to the other issue. In fact, the numerical modelling of complex structures is more and more used in an attempt to reproduce the real response of structures and such models tend to be more and more time-demanding as their complexities are increased to improve accuracy and to consider particular mechanical behaviour. Given that the performance function involves the computation of the mechanical model, simulation-based reliability methods cannot be considered in order to assess the failure probability within a short space of time. A first alternative to simulation techniques for timedemanding model is FORM (or its improvement SORM). It requires a significantly smaller number of performance function computations and is, moreover, very convenient in case of small failure probabilities. However, the potential error made with its limit state linearisation assumption is not known and additional simulation techniques are required to validate the probability.</p><p>To minimise the number of performance function computations and to guarantee an accurate estimation of the failure probability, metamodelling seems to be the right alternative. The present paper focuses on Kriging metamodel <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> for its exact interpolation nature and its stochastic property which provides a measure of the prediction uncertainty. Kriging and two efficient reliability methods (EGRA <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and AK-MCS <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>) based on this metamodel are presented in Section 3. They are well adapted to deal with time-demanding functions given that they use Kriging stochastic information to identify iteratively the relevant samples at which the performance function should be computed in order to assess in an accurate way the failure probability with a minimum number of computations. However, the assessment of small failure probability remains an issue for both methods. The present paper proposes to extend the algorithm previously developed by the authors, i.e. AK-MCS which associates Kriging with MCS, to the specific case of small failure probabilities by replacing MCS with IS. The new method is fully detailed in Section 4. This improvement is validated with academic applications in Section 5. Following this, a complex aerospace case study submitted to fatigue is considered in Section 6. It involves a timedemanding mechanical model and assessing structural reliability within a short space of time is a difficult task. For this complex structure, the computational demand of reliability assessment is reduced in two ways. First, the improvement of AK-MCS by using IS is implemented to identify the relevant samples at which the mechanical model should be computed. Second, the time demand of the mechanical model is reduced with the multiparametric strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> which is based on the LArge Time Increment (LATIN) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The LATIN method is used to speed up a single computation. The multiparametric strategy is based on the ''history'' of computations. It reduces the time demand of successive computations by initialising a new one with a previously performed one that has a close set of parameters. More details on these methods are given in Section 6.2.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS)</head><p>In the standard space, the failure probability is the integral <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P f ¼ Z F f n ðuÞ du 1 . . . du n<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where f n is the joint Gaussian probability density function (p.d.f.) of U.</p><p>By introducing the failure counter I F ðuÞ ¼ f0 if HðuÞ 4 0 and 1 ifHðuÞ r0g, the integral becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P f ¼ Z R n I F ðuÞf n ðuÞ du 1 . . . du n ¼ E½I F ð<label>2Þ</label></formula><p>where E½Á is the mathematical expectation. Simulation methods are often used to estimate this integral. The most famous Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) constitutes a numerical integration method which samples the random variables space according to their p.d.f.'s. A large number of samples are simulated and the performance function is computed at each. Let N MCS samples be noted fu ðiÞ , i ¼ 1, . . . ,N MCS g.

However, samples are simulated around the origin of the standard space (i.e. around the median), and a large population is necessary in order to simulate a small probability event. In order to assess a probability of 10 Àp , 10 p þ 2 samples are required for a coefficient of variation d MCS close to 10%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">FORM þ Importance Sampling (IS)</head><p>MCS is used in reliability analysis to classify a population according to the sign of the performance function outcome, but is inapplicable with time-demanding models. One may quote Importance Sampling (IS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and subset simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> as alternatives based on the same classification principle. IS is selected in this paper because it is an efficient sampling method for validating or correcting the failure probability approximation made by FORM <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Moreover, the knowledge of the most probable failure point provides sensitivities which are relevant coefficients for structural design. Note that subset simulation is an alternative which is also currently being examined by the authors.</p><p>FORM replaces the limit state HðuÞ ¼ 0 by an hyperplane at the most probable failure point noted P % with u % ¼ fu % 1 , . . . ,u % n g its coordinates. The method is very convenient in case of small failure probabilities but the potential error made with its limit state linearisation assumption is not known. Additional simulation techniques are thus required to validate the probability approximation Pf ¼ FðÀbÞ where b</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi P k u %:2 k q</formula><p>is the Hasofer-Lind reliability index and F is the standard Gaussian cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.). IS can be used to validate FORM approximation. Assuming that the most probable failure point is well isolated and that no secondary minima exist in other areas of space, IS simulates a population centred on this point rather than on the origin of the standard space. The failure event probability is thus larger and the number of samples to simulate in order to assess its probability remains small. IS requires the definition of a joint p.d.f. j n for the new sampling. The failure probability then reads</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P f ¼ Z R n I F ðuÞ f n ðuÞ j n ðuÞ j n ðuÞ du 1 . . . du n<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>The joint p.d.f. is often taken in the standard space as an n-Gaussian one centred on the most probable failure point.

The samples simulated according to this p.d.f. are denoted f ũðiÞ , i ¼ 1, . . . ,N IS g with N IS 5N MCS for a similar coefficient of variation on the failure probability.

This statement motivates the use of a Kriging metamodel to improve FORMþ IS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Kriging metamodel</head><p>Widespread in computational sciences, metamodels (also known as surrogate models) are employed to predict the outcome of a black-box function at any sample, providing that the outcomes at a few other samples are known. The latter samples are usually called the Design of numerical Experiments (shortened to D.o.E. in this paper). Metamodels are attractive tools because they are fast to compute in comparison with the actual functions. Quadratic Response Surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> or others, are the most popular though they are limited to local interpolation. Polynomial Chaos <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> can be used to avoid this problem. However, the definitions of the D.o.E. and of the polynomial degrees are tricky <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. More recently, Support Vector Machine (SVM) methods have also been considered with their great effectiveness for structural reliability analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. In this paper, the choice is made to focus on Kriging (or Gaussian process) whose efficiency has been proved in domains in relation with structural reliability such as uncertainty propagation and global sensitivity analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Kriging, developed by Krige and then theorised by Matheron <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, considers the black-box function H as a realisation of a Gaussian process whose parameters have to be determined. At a sample u, Kriging defines a Gaussian distribution of the black-box function value characterised by a mean prediction m Ĥ ðuÞ (Kriging mean) and a Kriging variance s 2 Ĥ ðuÞ which is a measure of the prediction uncertainty. At a sample of the D.o.E., i.e. a sample whose value of H is known, the Kriging variance and therefore the uncertainty on the value of H are null: Kriging is an exact interpolation metamodel. Details of the Kriging theory are not presented in this paper as they may be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. However, it is important to be aware that Kriging mean and variance are fast to compute.</p><p>The first applications of Kriging to structural reliability problems are based on progressive D.o.E. Romero et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> compares Kriging with polynomial regression and finite-element interpolation on progressive lattice-samplings with analytical functions. Then, Kaymaz <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> proposes a method based on either Bucher's design or central composite design to perform structural reliability analysis and compares it to classic response surface methods. The major drawback of these precursory methods is that they are strictly based on the Kriging mean-the Kriging variance is not used to detect regions having high prediction uncertainties. Following these works, Kriging is adapted with more efficient sequential D.o.E. to reduce the number of calls to the timedemanding performance function. The metamodel is updated by adding iteratively new samples to the D.o.E., these samples being selected for their predicted improvement on the prediction. Such techniques may also be referred to as active learning methods. Two types of active learning methods seem to be combined with Kriging. Some such as the hierarchical adaptive design <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, partition adaptively space into cells (adaptive gridding) and add new samples to the D.o.E. in the cells which are considered inaccurate according to a predictor error based on the Kriging mean and cross validation. Others like EGRA <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> or AK-MCS <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> prefer to use the stochastic nature of the Kriging prediction. They define a learning function that identifies the best next sample at which H should be computed in order to improve the accuracy of the metamodel in the vicinity of the limit state HðuÞ ¼ 0. This is the case investigated in this paper. The learning functions are obtained for a little computational effort as they are combinations of the Kriging mean and variance. However, finding the optimum of the learning function at each iteration may be rather timedemanding. This search can be based like in EGRA <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> on an optimisation method such as the branch-and-bound discrete technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and the DIRECT algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. It may also be based on a population of candidate samples to predict by Kriging as done in AK-MCS <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Both methods are now described.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">EGRA</head><p>Inspired by EGO <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and the Kriging contour estimation method <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, EGRA <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> (Efficient Global Reliability Analysis) is based on a learning function called the Expected Feasibility Function (EFF) which provides an indication of how well the true value of the performance function in a sample can be expected to satisfy the constraint HðuÞ ¼ 0. EGRA starts with the definition of an initial D.o.E. using Latin Hypercube Sampling over the bounds 7 five standard deviations. The Kriging metamodel is then constructed and the sample in space, at which the learning function EFF is maximised, is searched using the DIRECT global optimisation algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The performance function is then computed at this sample and the observation is added to the D.o.E. This is repeated until a stopping condition is satisfied. The metamodel is then considered accurate enough to calculate the failure probability using multimodal adaptive importance sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. EGRA is parsimonious with regard to the number of calls to the performance function <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. However, it requires the additional implementation of an optimisation algorithm. Furthermore, it approximates the limit state in the whole design space, even in regions where samples are very small probability events and consequently may have negligible effects on the failure probability. Note that EGRA has recently been adapted to systems with multiple failure modes <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> is an active learning and Kriging-based Monte Carlo simulation. The basic idea of AK-MCS is to classify into the safe (positive performance function value) and failure (negative performance function value) groups, a Monte Carlo population P MCS of N MCS samples using a Kriging metamodel in order to avoid computing the performance function at each sample. The D.o.E. is iteratively enriched using the learning function called U. This function is defined so that FðUðuÞÞ is the probability that the sample u is correctly classified according to the sign of m Ĥ ðuÞ. The outcome of the function U is obtained for a little computational effort since it is expressed as a function of the Kriging mean and variance. It is evaluated for the N MCS samples and the one at which FðUÞ is minimised, is identified. The performance function is evaluated at this sample and the D.o.E. is then enriched with this new observation. A new Kriging metamodel is constructed from this updated D.o.E. This is repeated until a stopping condition is satisfied. AK-MCS must be seen as a way to speed up MCS by considering, thanks to Kriging, that close samples may have rather close performance function values. AK-MCS has been shown to be very efficient with numerous tricky cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. AK-MCS differs in two ways with the other Kriging-based reliability methods from the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> which use an optimisation method to search for the best next sample. First, the candidate samples of AK-MCS are generated according to the p.d.f.'s of the random variables. This means that they present sufficiently high probabilities of occurrence to have a significant impact on the failure probability (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> in Example 1). Second, the prediction of the whole population at each iteration provides a prediction of the failure probability by counting the number of samples having negative Kriging means. This feature differs from most uses of metamodels. In fact, metamodels are often first built to approximate the limit state accurately, and reliability methods are then applied on them independently from the real performance function. In AK-MCS, reliability analysis and active learning are performed simultaneously. In addition to that, AK-MCS does not require an optimisation algorithm to identify the best next sample to add to the D.o.E. It is consequently very easily implementable with standard Kriging toolboxes such as DACE toolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AK-MCS</head><p>It is often considered in structural reliability analysis that the performance function computation is the only time-demanding stage. Yet in some cases, the active learning method on its own may require a significant computational effort. This is particularly the case of small failure probabilities. In such a case, the search domain is very wide for EGRA and the number of samples required for AK-MCS is very large. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a method whose originality lies in the combination of the IS variance reduction technique to limit the number of samples to simulate and AK-MCS to minimise the number of performance function computations. The new original method called AK-IS (active learning and Kriging-based Importance Sampling) is detailed in the next section. AK-IS is composed of two distinct steps. AK-IS Step1 is the FORM approximation. The most probable failure point P % is searched using the Hasofer-Lind-Rackwitz-Fiessler algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> or other. This is a rather time-demanding step as it is performed on the real performance function H. However, an accurate most probable failure point is not required and a few iterations are enough to shift the centre of the IS population towards the failure domain. A first approximation of the failure probability is obtained by FðÀbÞ where b is the Hasofer-Lind reliability index. AK-IS Step2 is the classification by Kriging of a population P IS . The population P IS of N IS samples is simulated using the sampling p.d.f. j n mentioned in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>). It is reminded that this p.d.f. is taken as a standard Gaussian one centred at the approximated most probable failure point found in AK-IS Step 1. The classification into the safe and failure groups is performed using the technique developed in AK-MCS. AK-IS Step 2 can be described as follows:</p><p>1. Generation of a population P IS : P IS is generated using j n . The samples of this population are noted ũðiÞ ¼ f ũðiÞ 1 , . . . , ũðiÞ n g for i ¼ 1, . . . ,N IS in the standard space. They represent candidate samples at which the performance function may be computed if the active learning requires it. toolbox is widely used <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, ordinary Kriging is preferred and the correlation model is taken as the anisotropic squared-exponential function. 4. Prediction by Kriging and estimation of the failure probability:</p><p>First, Kriging mean m Ĥ ð ũðiÞ Þ and variance s 2 Ĥ ð ũðiÞ Þ for i ¼ 1, . . . ,N IS are computed with DACE. The failure counter in the predicted failure domain F resulting from the Kriging classification is introduced as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">I F ð ũðiÞ Þ ¼ 1 if m Ĥ ð ũðiÞ Þ r0 0 if m Ĥ ð ũðiÞ Þ 4 0 8 &lt; :<label>ð9Þ</label></formula><p>for i ¼ 1, . . . ,N IS . The failure probability can be predicted by replacing I F ð ũðiÞ Þ with I F ð ũðiÞ Þ in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>).</p><p>5. Identification of the best next sample in P IS to learn: The identification of this sample is done according to the learning function U proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. It indicates the distance in Kriging standard deviations between the Kriging mean and the predicted limit state m Ĥ ðuÞ ¼ 0. For a sample ũðiÞ of the population P IS , it reads</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Uð ũðiÞ Þ ¼ 9m Ĥ ð ũðiÞ Þ9 s Ĥ ð ũðiÞ Þ<label>ð10Þ</label></formula><p>This function is an adaptation to reliability of the lower confidence bounding lcb function developed for optimisation by Cox and John <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Since Kriging makes the assumption of a Gaussian process, FðUð ũðiÞ ÞÞ is the probability that ũðiÞ is classified in the correct group (failure or safe) according to the sign of its Kriging mean m Ĥ ð ũðiÞ Þ. The best next sample to learn among the N IS candidates of the population is thus the sample noted ũ1 at which the function U is minimised. 6. Stopping condition on learning: The accuracy of the Kriging model is now verified. To do so, the value Uð ũ1Þ is checked to be above or below a stopping value. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> If the stopping condition of Stage 6 is satisfied, the learning isstopped and each point of the population is considered to be classified with a sufficient confidence level. The population P IS is then checked to be large enough to provide an accurate failure probability prediction. To do so, the coefficient of variation d AKÀIS of the failure probability prediction (Stage 4) is calculated by replacing I F ð ũðiÞ Þ with I F ð ũðiÞ Þ in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">7</ref>) then (8). d AKÀIS is compared to a limit value seen as acceptable by the user. 9. Update of the population: If the coefficient of variation is too high, P IS is enlarged with new samples and AK-IS goes back to Stage 4 to predict the new population. The active learning method continues until the stopping condition is met again. 10. End of AK-IS: If the failure probability coefficient of variation is small enough, AK-IS stops and the last failure probability prediction is the result of the method.</p><p>AK-IS is an adaption of the general method AK-MCS. In fact, AK-IS relies through FORM on the hypothesis that the weight of the failure probability is well concentrated. AK-IS should be applied when such an hypothesis holds and when small failure probabilities are expected. The choice of the reliability method is thus directed by a trade-off between computational time efficiency (AK-IS) and preserving generality (AK-MCS).</p><p>It is important to point out that AK-IS Step 2 does not require the most probable failure point to be accurately determined. In fact, a few iterations of the FORM approximation at AK-IS Step 1 can be sufficient to shift the centre of the simulated population towards the failure domain. An approximative most probable failure point may lead to an increase of the coefficient of variation on the failure probability. However, this can be reduced with a larger population. To finish, it must be pointed out that AK-IS, like AK-MCS, does not require any optimisation method to find the next sample to learn. The method is compatible with standard Kriging toolboxes and FORM algorithms making it very easily implementable.</p></div>

FORM failure probability is checked using IS which requires a large number of performance function computations. AK-IS is precisely proposed to reduce the computational effort of IS. Crude MCS, crude IS, FORM, and AK-IS are implemented to assess the failure probability. A reference value is defined as the median failure probability and coefficient of variation obtained out of 100 different crude MCS runs with N MCS ¼ 5 Â 10 7 samples each. This number of samples is determined in order to have a coefficient of variation d MCS on the failure probability close to 2.5%. FORM is performed with a starting point at the origin of space. In order to test the robustness of AK-IS, crude IS, and AK-IS are performed with 100 different populations of N IS ¼ 10 4 samples centred on the most probable failure point identified with FORM.</p><p>The median results of the different methods are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. They are compared by their median number of calls N call to the performance function and their median failure probability. First, FORM requires 19 calls to the performance function (six iterations, each made of three performance function computations and a last call for the next point found by the algorithm).</p><p>The corresponding Hasofer-Lind index b is 3.93. FORM failure probability is consequently FðÀbÞ ¼ 4:21 Â 10 À5 . Second, crude IS and AK-IS give similar failure probabilities. AK-IS classification into the safe and failure groups is proved to be very accurate. As reported in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, the classification is exact for 94 populations out of the 100 tested ones. Moreover, AK-IS requires much less performance function computations than crude IS. Indeed, AK-IS Step 2 requires only seven computations of H after the FORM approximation (AK-IS Step 1) to obtain a failure probability very close to the reference value obtained by MCS.    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Academic 2D application-AK-IS classification.</head><p>For this application, AK-IS Step 1 is the step requiring most calls to the performance function due to the gradient calculations. As mentioned in Section 4, an accurate most probable failure point is not required. Consequently, tests have been performed by stopping the search of the most probable point at different iterations. It is reminded that three performance function computations are required at each iteration of the FORM algorithm. AK-IS is performed with 100 different populations of N IS ¼ 10 4 samples. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> reports the median results as failure probability, corresponding coefficient of variation and number of calls. Reducing the number of FORM iterations decreases obviously the number of calls to the performance function. On this example, AK-IS Step 2 number of calls remains rather similar but a slight damage on the coefficient of variation on the failure probability is observed. To keep a similar coefficient of variation, P IS should be enlarged with new samples. This shows that having an accurate most probable failure point is not required with the method. Consequently, when FORM procedure requires a substantial number of time-demanding performance function computations, it is recommended to stop the FORM procedure and simulate a larger population-but still significantly smaller than the one required by crude MCS and AK-MCS for the same coefficient of variation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FORM approximation (AK-IS</head><p>Step 1) requires 16 mechanical model computations. AK-IS Step 2 requires 11 calls in order to classify a population of N IS ¼ 10 4 samples simulated around the most probable failure point. As a result, AK-IS requires 27 <ref type="bibr">(16 þ11</ref>) mechanical model computations to assess the failure probability. The computational gain of AK-IS compared to crude IS is about 370 ð10,016=27Þ. Performing crude IS with the numerical model from ABAQUS would require 139 day. With AK-IS, the computational time would drop to 9 h (27 Â 1200 s, the Kriging prediction representing only a few seconds). Finally, by combining AK-IS with the multiparametric strategy based on the LATIN method to accelerate the computation of the numerical model, the failure probability is assessed in 2.25 h (the gain of the multiparametric strategy is 4 in this case). This case study proves the interest of combining advanced reliability methods such as AK-IS with strategies that reduce the computational cost of numerical models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>This paper proposes an original and easily implementable method to assess the failure probability of complex structures. The method is particularly to deal with small failure probabilities and performance function involving time-demanding numerical models. The method is called AK-IS as it is an active learning method combining Kriging metamodel and Importance Sampling. The proposed strategy associates the advantages of the Kriging metamodel (exact interpolation and its stochastic property) with IS. In direct line with AK-MCS which is based on a Monte Carlo simulation, the AK-IS main idea is to classify with very few performance function computations a population centred on the most probable failure point (or at least a point close to the failure domain) found using FORM approximation. In order to minimise the number of performance function computations, AK-IS uses the learning function U deriving from the Kriging prediction (Kriging mean and Kriging variance). AK-IS, like AK-MCS, is parsimonious with regard to the number of computations and a very accurate classifier. It is also very easy to implement with standard Kriging toolboxes and FORM algorithms. The main advantage of AK-IS over AK-MCS becomes visible when dealing with small failure probabilities. In fact, the computational effort of AK-MCS increases dramatically with large populations required for the assessment of small probabilities. AK-IS solves this problem by shifting the population towards the failure domain. In this paper, academic examples prove that the computation benefit of AK-IS is significant. Furthermore, the method is conducted successfully on an aerospace case study, showing that such a method can be applied in a real engineering context. This paper shows that AK-IS is a relevant method to validate or improve the failure probability approximation made by FORM for only a little additional computational effort. However, AK-IS, like IS, is based on the hypothesis that the weight of the failure probability is located in the vicinity of a unique most probable failure point (which is the case of the case study studied in this paper). If such a hypothesis cannot be formulated, the 2 SMART method <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, which combines subset simulation with Support Vector Machine (SVM) metamodel can be adapted in an approach denoted as AK-SS that associates Kriging with subset simulation. This approach would represent an alternative between the very general AK-MCS and the more specific AK-IS. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Contents lists available at SciVerse ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/ress Reliability Engineering and System Safety 0951-8320/$ -see front matter &amp; 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
