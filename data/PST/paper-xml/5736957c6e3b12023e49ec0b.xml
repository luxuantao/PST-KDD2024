<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>With the advancement of industrial systems, fault monitoring and diagnosis methods based on the datadriven attract much attention in recent years. This kind of methods are widely used in engineering projects, especially in those big and complicated machines, whose conditions are difficult to obtain from straight view. They can provide the administrator with effective fault information in initial phase and therefore reduce the loss caused by faults. This paper reviews the research and development of fault diagnosis and monitoring approach based on support vector machine (SVM). While many other methods, such as expert system and artificial neural network, have been used in fault monitoring and diagnosis, SVM shows its advantage in generalization performance and in case of small sample. Therefore, it should attract more attention.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Fault monitoring and diagnosis methods originated from America and their development satisfied the crying needs in aerospace and military, etc. In 1964, there were a series of serious equipment failures in the Apollo Project of The United States, which urged American Naval Research Laboratory (ONR) to built the Machinery Faults Predict Group (MFPG) from the avocations of NASA in 1967. This created a new field of equipment fault diagnosis and made an important contribution to the fault diagnostic theory and technology.</p><p>Many industrial developed countries, such as Japan and some European countries, spent a large amount of manpower, financial resources and material resources to develop equipment diagnosis technology from the end of the 1960s to the early of 1970s. In United Kingdom, U.K. Mechanical Health Monitoring Center was the first organization to start the research and got decent results in many aspects, such as publicity, training, consulting, planning, fault analysis and the development of diagnostic technology.</p><p>China started the equipment fault diagnosis technology researches in the mid-1980s. In general, China followed the pace of these industrial advanced countries and obtained some decent results in some specific fields. Colleges, research institutions and factories are responsible for research, development and application, respectively.</p><p>The key point to fault diagnosis is not the faults itself, but the diagnosis method. Because of the complexity of fault diagnosis process, it is necessary to use not a single method but a variety of methods to deal with the problem. At present, existing fault diagnosis methods can be roughly divided into three categories, i.e., traditional diagnostic methods, the methods based on the signal and intelligent diagnosis methods. Correspondingly, the development of fault diagnosis technology can also be roughly divided into the following three stages.</p><p>The first stage is dominated the traditional methods which rely heavily on humans' senses to obtain fault information.</p><p>In this stage, experts directly use the information, such as vibration, sound, light, heat, electricity, magnetic and chemical, to diagnose the faults. They combine these information with the fault phenomenon and observe their changing rules and characteristics to dispose the faults directly. This kind of methods are rapid and easy to understand, but only part of faults can be detected with it.</p><p>In the second stage, the majority of efforts are devoted to signal based methods, whose foundations are sensor technology, dynamic testing technology, signal analysis and processing technology.</p><p>Experts have been working on the collection, selection, processing and analysis process of fault signal. Equipment running signals, such as vibration, rotary speed, can be collected by sensors and the equipment conditions or faults can be identified and evaluated though processing in time-domain and frequencydomain. The fault diagnostic technique in this stage obtained a number of applications in practice and generate huge economic Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/neucom benefits, which further promoted the development of this technology.</p><p>The third stage is represented by intelligent diagnosis methods, whose foundation is traditional fault diagnosis methods and the core is artificial intelligence technology.</p><p>The main tools used in methods of this stage are knowledge application, knowledge processing and knowledge reasoning instead of model building and information processing. There are big differences between these methods and the traditional ones in research contents and implement methods. New ideas and methods constantly emerge and fault diagnosis technology develops rapidly in this field.</p><p>The characteristic of intelligent fault diagnosis is that it can effectively obtain, transmit, process and regenerate the diagnosis information and can diagnose and forecast the information accurately. Fault intelligent diagnosis technology is closely related to the development of artificial intelligence technology. A variety of new theories and methods, especially the expert system, provide the possibility for the intelligentialize of fault diagnosis.</p><p>Expert system is proposed to use the experts' domain knowledge to deal with fault diagnosis issues. Its application relies heavily on the experts' domain knowledge which is hard to acquire. Knowledge acquisition is the bottleneck problem in expert system. Besides, expert system has its limitations in the adaptive capacity, learning ability and real-time performance. Machine learning is another important research field in the technology of artificial intelligence and it has been used in the diagnostic techniques since the 1980s.</p><p>With machine learning techniques, diagnosis system does not rely on the experience knowledge and can learn new knowledge from changes of the environment. These abilities make machine learning become a main way to improve the performance of intelligent fault diagnosis. In machine learning, artificial neural network is an efficient approach to dispose the problem of complicated non-linear issues. It has a rapid development over the past decade and has been applied in a range of fields of the fault intelligent diagnosis.</p><p>The neural network algorithm is based on traditional statistics which plays the basis role in machine learning. The content of traditional statistical research is the gradual theory, namely the ultimate properties when the sample tends to infinity. However, this precondition cannot be guaranteed in practical applications, as samples are usually rare.</p><p>In the case of a limited number of samples, the neural network algorithm often shows a poor generalization ability, namely the over-fitting problem. It is based on empirical risk minimization, but not expected risk minimization, and this leads to poor minimization performance. With the development of neural network, people realize the neural network algorithm is lack of quantitative analysis and mechanism of the complex theory and its research encounters difficulties.</p><p>An ideal machine learning approach should have strong generalization ability and be able to find out as much information as possible from the limited samples. Statistical learning theory is good at looking for the optimal solution in small samples and does not need to use the progressive condition when sample tends to infinity. In addition, it has strong promotion value and it is suitable for fault diagnosis of the small sample situation in many practical engineering problems.</p><p>Structural risk minimization principle is an effective tool for practical applications of statistical learning theory, and it is the basis of the SVM. The greatest advantage of SVM in fault diagnosis is that it is suitable for small sample based decision, as it can maximally excavate the implicit classification knowledge in the data.</p><p>This paper is inspired by the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which reviewed the articles from 1996 to 2006 in the field of machine condition monitoring and machine fault diagnosis using SVM. In this paper we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and make a survey of works in the same field from 2007 to 2015.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Support vector machine</head><p>SVM was firstly proposed by Vapnik et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and it has become a popular approach to deal with the problem of classification. SVM is based on Structural Risk Minimization (SRM) principle in the statistical learning theory, and it has outstanding generalization performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Structural Risk Minimization means maximizing the margin between different classes. That is why SVM is not only a useful statistical theory but also a method that can be used to deal with engineering problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Introduction to svm</head><p>The initial idea of SVM is to use a linear separating hyperplane to divide the training samples into two classes. Generally, there are two types of methods suitable to accomplish this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The first one is finding out the optimal decision hyperplane which bisects the two closest samples into two convex hulls. The second one is to research the optimal decision hyperplane which makes the margin between the two parallel supporting planes maximum. Both these two methods can produce the optimal decision hyperplane and the support points (support vectors).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Linear classification</head><p>The linear classification function of SVM is used to separate the training data into two classes with a linear separating hyperplane.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows data of two classes, where the squares belong to the negative class and the circles are of the positive class. The SVM tries to put a linear boundary in the middle of the two classes. The maximum margin is represented as the distance between two imaginary lines. The points, located on the imaginary lines, are called support vectors. Support vectors are the most significant samples as they contain all the information used to design the classifier <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The training data represented by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ðx 1 ; y 1 Þ; …:;ðx l ; y l Þ; x A R n ; y A fþ1; À 1g ð<label>1Þ</label></formula><p>can be divided by a hyperplane equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ðw Á xÞþb ¼ 0<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>If hyperplane can make sure the distance between different classes of samples is maximum, this hyperplane is the optimal hyperplane. We can explain the separating hyperplane using the form below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ðw Á x i Þþb Z 1 if y i ¼ 1<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">ðw Á x i Þþb r 1 if y i ¼ À1<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>Or equivalently</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">y i ½ðw Á x i þ bÞ Z 1 i ¼ 1; 2; …; l<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>Then the problem of searching for the optimal hyperplane could be transferred into the problem of obtaining the minimum of the function below subject to the constraints in Eq.

Based on the theory of functional, as long as a kernel function Kðx i ; y i Þ satisfy the Mercer condition, it is the inner product of one transformation space. Therefore, using an appropriate inner product function Kð x i ; y i Þ in the optimal classification plane can achieve linear classification after a nonlinear transformation, and the computational complexity is not increased.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Fault monitoring and diagnosis</head><p>Fault diagnosis methods based on SVM regard the diagnosis problem as a classification one. They uses the historical data to train the classifiers and divides the data space into various areas, where each area corresponds to a running state. Different areas corresponds to different running states. The test data will be mapped into the data space and the corresponding running status is predicted based on the position of the test data in the data space. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows an example of the SVM classification process with objects of three classes (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(1), data of different running states are firstly selected to form the training set. Then, the training data are then used by SVM to learn a set of dichotomy classifiers as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> (2). Since fault diagnosis is usually a multi-class classification problem, these dichotomy classifiers will be combined into a multi-class classifier, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(3). Finally, we can isolate the fault though mapping the test sample and identify the corresponding area in the data space, showed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(4)</ref>.</p><p>In a broad sense, fault diagnosis is composed of three main aspects. Fault detection determines whether a system is malfunctioned, fault isolation position the fault and fault identification estimates the violence level of the fault. Narrowly speaking, fault diagnosis means fault detection and isolation (FDI).</p><p>Some reviews of the works on FDI can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Rolling element bearings</head><p>Widodo and Kim <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> employed relevance vector machine (RVM) and SVM to diagnose the faults in low speed bearing. A low speed test rig was construed to simulate different kinds of bearing defects. Accelerometer sensors and Acoustic emission (AE) were employed to acquire the data. In order to isolate the unwanted signals, envelope analysis was employed to extract features and process signal. From the perspective of the methods used in SVM and RVM, one-against-one approach and sequential minimal optimization (SMO) approach were employed in SVM and multinomial logistic regression and the Newtons method were employed in RVM. The dimensional of original features could be reduced though component analysis, and the acoustic emission signal generates better classification accuracy than the vibration signal. It was found that RVM performs better than SVM in low speed bearing.</p><p>The combination of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and SVM has become a research focus in recent years.</p><p>Konar and Chattopadhyay introduced a CWT-SVM approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. They employed machinery fault simulator to simulate various types of faults and used computers with four-channel data acquisition (DAQ) system with accelerometer probe to collect data. Continuous wavelet transform was the main approach employed in their paper and the authors pointed the limitations of Fourier analysis, i.e., it is not suitable for non-stationary or transitory signals. Besides, the limitation of short time Fourier transform (STFT) lies in the choice of time window. SVM and artificial neural networks (ANN) were employed in post processing and diagnosis of faults process. Experimental results indicate that SVM performs much better than ANN. Finally, the authors regarded CWT-SVM as a promising approach as it is more efficient than Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)/ANN based fault classification approach. The approach was quite similar to in Abbasion and Rafsanjani's work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Tyagi <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> compared the effectiveness of SVM and ANN though diagnosing the rolling element bearings' faults. In experiments 102,400 samples were collected and divided into 40 bins, and 10 features were then extracted from these 40 bins. From the result the author concluded that SVM outperforms ANN. In addition, DWT was beneficial to both approaches as it could reduce the number of iterations performed in training.</p><p>Sugumaran et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> employed decision tree to select good features which were important in pattern recognition. Moreover, proximal support vector machines (PSVM) and SVM were utilized to classify the faults and the result showed PSVM was better than SVM in classification efficiency.</p><p>Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> found that fractal dimension could be employed to describe non-linear vibration signal. They applied the capacity dimension, information dimension and correlation dimension to classify various types of faults and found that these fractal dimensions describe different kinds of fault information. Therefore, these three fractal dimensions should be combined. Finally, 11 time-domain statistical features and three fractal dimensions were combined to improve the classification performance of the SVM.</p><p>Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> proposed an approach which was based on wavelet support vector machine (WSVM) with empirical model decomposition (EMD), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and distance evaluation technique. This approach was employed to detect the bearing fault of electric locomotives and experimental result indicated that WSVM was better than SVM in accuracy.</p><p>There are many other approaches proposed to detect faults of rolling element bearings, such as physical model training based method <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, pattern spectrum entropy method <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, neighborhood score multi-class SVM <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, ensemble empirical mode decomposition and optimized support vector machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and features extracted from time-domain and multi-class SVM <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p></div>

They employed Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to extract new features from power spectral density (PSD) and found harmonic curve area and harmonic crest angle were suitable for fault detection in induction motors. SVM was employed to classify these features and this method had been used in 1500W three-phase induction motor. The experimental result was good. Kurek and Osowski <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> also researched the broken rotor bar fault in squirrel-cage induction motor. The spectral information of shaft field of one phase registered, motor current and voltage were selected as the features.</p><p>Wavelet SVM is widely used to diagnose faults in induction motors. Keskes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> employed the combination of multi-class wavelet support vector machines (MWSVM) and stationary wavelet packet transform (SWPT) to diagnose the broken rotor bar's faults and found wavelet kernel function had a higher accuracy among the various kernel functions. Das et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> detected faults in stator winding of induction motors. The faults can be detected though minor short circuit by Parks transformation and CWT.

One year later, Widodo and Yang <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> not only employed WSVM but also introduced principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) to decrease the features' dimension.

This method had been tested though vivo experimental data and the experiments showed that this method performs better than the other three existed methods and original SVM in terms of classification accuracy, learning speed, stability and robustness.</p><p>Azadeh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> firstly combined artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector classification and particle swarm optimization (SVC-PSO) based on genetic algorithm to detect faults in a centrifugal pump. Their experimental results showed that the robustness and the efficiency were improved compared with existing algorithms.</p><p>Tian et al. introduced SVM to detect faults of oil pump. It was usually difficult to detect faults in oil pump because it is a complicated and nonlinear system. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> Tian et al. proposed to use SVM to detect faults of oil pump, and they employed the genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize SVM parameters. From the experimental results, they concluded that this algorithm was feasible and effective.</p><p>(2) Compressors: Verma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> proposed an optimized fault diagnosis method based on RBF kernel and adaptive SVM parameters and decision directed acyclic graph (DDAG). They applied this method in the fault diagnosis of reciprocating air compressors and found it performs better than the original SVM.</p><p>The approach based on the wave matching, basis pursuit (BP) and SVM was presented by Qin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, and employed to detect faults in reciprocating compressor valves. Wave matching was adopted as it can extract a small number of features with clear physical meanings. This approach was shown to be accurate and reliable in experiments.</p><p>Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> proposed to use indicator diagram and SVM to detect faults of reciprocating air compressor. The indicator diagram was based on image processing methods and moment theory.</p><p>(3) Valves: Cui et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> employed SVM and information entropy to detect faults in reciprocating compressor valve. The reason for this selection is that information entropy is a decent approach to deal with non-linearity and SVM is good at dealing with small sample issues.</p><p>Moreira et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> found that SVM was an efficient classifier which can be employed to detect aircraft bleed valves faults. This approach was meaningful because it could reduce the high cost of maintenance in aircraft systems.</p><p>(4) Turbines: Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> presented an method based on SVM and ANN, where SVM is used to help ANN overcome its disadvantages, such as low classification accuracy and local minima. This method was employed to defect faults in gas turbine engine and was shown to accurate and efficient.</p><p>SVM with adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was proposed by Salahshoor et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators was utilized to weighting the multi-attribute data, which can be added into the total value. Industrial steam turbines' faults could be diagnosed and detected by this approach.</p><p>Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> detected faults in wind turbine by SVM, diagonal spectrum and cluster binary tree. Diagonal spectrum was employed to extract features in wind turbine and the features were clustered to build the cluster binary tree. This method was shown to be effective by experimental result of gear-box.</p><p>Yin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> overcame the difficulties such as nonlinearity, disturbances and measurement noise in wind turbine diagnosis and proposed a performance index and an optimization criterion to achieve the robustness of the residual signals to disturbances. The simulation on the wind turbine benchmark model valuated the effectiveness of this approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">HAVC machines</head><p>Incremental on-line SVM has been employed in HAVC machines. Guo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> applied on-line incremental SVM to deal with big datasets and proposed on-line soft-margin SVM to measure the misclassification level. Dehestani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref> proposed an on-line fault detection and isolation (FDI) system for HAVC, based on-line incremental SVM. They also presented a novel approach using the previously unknown faults to update the classifier. Dehestani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> proposed a black box ANN model and an on-line SVM classifier to detect the faults of air fan and dampers. Moreover, the robustness of SVM helped to enhance the probability of detection in their research.</p><p>Liang and Du <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> proposed a model-based approach for HAVC. They built a lumped-parameter model for HAVC and employed residual analysis method to detect faults. Finally, they used SVM to classify the faults.</p><p>Beghi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> employed one-class SVM and PCA to deal with the faults of the chiller systems in HAVC system. Unsupervised One-Class SVM was used to detect the unforeseen phenomena and abnormalities and PCA was utilized to reduce feature dimension.</p><p>Tanaka et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> proposed an approach based on SVM and built management system (BMS) data. A physical model of air handling unit (AHU) was built and employed to generate normal and fault data. This approach was validated by the data from artificial faults of a real building.</p><p>Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> presented a method with SVM and rough set theory (RST), based on the observation that SVM has decent generalization performance and RST has the ability to dispose the uncertainty information. This method was shown to reduce the maintain cost and save the energy.</p><p>Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> proposed an integrated method combining SVM and KPCA. As an improvement of PCA, KPCA adopts a nonlinear kernel function which is employed to extract optimal features. This approach was applied to detect faults in fan machinery system of HAVC and experimental result showed that KPCA-SVM generates higher recognition rate than KPCA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Other aspects of the application</head><p>In the following we mainly introduce the application of SVM based fault diagnosis methods in gear and gear box power systems. These methods are also applied in some other systems, e.g., three tank system <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> and industrial hot strip mill <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>.</p><p>Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> proposed an approach, where accurate autoregressive (AR) model, SVM and intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are combined. This approach was employed to detect faults of gears. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> proposed an LWPR based data-driven fault detection approach and applied it to CSTH (continuous stirred tank heater) process. Saravanan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> introduced morel wavelet to extract features and employed PSVM and SVM to classify these features in bevel gear box. Experimental results indicate that PSVM performs better than SVM in classification accuracy. Later, they <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> employed PSVM and ANN to detect fault of spur bevel gear box. They found that PSVM and ANN has almost the same classification capability but ANN is computationally more expensive in training and classification. In addition, Yin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> employed a fuzzy positivistic C-means clustering in vehicle suspension system.</p><p>SVM is also widely employed in power systems. Bacha et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> proposed a method, where dissolved gas analysis (DGA) and SVM were combined. The proposed method was used to classify the faults in power transformer. Yin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> proposed databased techniques focused on modern industry which can be applied to new power systems. Fei and Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> employed GA to select suitable SVM parameters and presented the so-called SVMG algorithm. This algorithm was applied to classify data from Chinese electric power companies and it was shown to perform better than SVM, IEC three ratios and artificial neural network. Ni et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> proposed to combine SVM and an adaptive KPCA method. This method could delete the redundant data and reduce the number of samples. It was employed to detect high-voltage circuit breakers (HVCBs). Dash et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> employed three SVMs to identify and classify faults in an advanced series-compensated transmission line.</p><p>In addition to what we discussed above, there are many fault diagnosis aspects, which could be disposed by SVM, such as an industrial benchmark of Tennessee Eastman process <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>, a mine hoist <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, wireless networked control systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, a thermal power plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> and even passive systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>and TE (Tennessee Eastman) process <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Discussion</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the objects, authors and SVM-combined approaches we reviewed in this paper, where n/a means that the content is not available. From the table, we arrive at the conclusion that SVM and related approaches can be widely employed in many objects. Moreover,the combination of SVM and other approaches usually performs better than SVM alone. Therefore, it is a trend to develop SVM-combined approaches. As there are a large amount of related papers in the literature, this paper only introduces those closely related to the keywords we survey and written in English.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Conclusion</head><p>This paper surveys the papers on SVM-based fault diagnosis and process monitoring in complicated industrial processes from 2007 to 2015. Many approaches based on SVM have been proposed, and they promote the advance of fault diagnosis and monitoring techniques significantly. While the algorithms such as PCA, SMO and ANN has been used in combination with SVM, few knowledge based algorithms have been proposed. It is also necessary to develop new methods to deal with very complicated industrial systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
