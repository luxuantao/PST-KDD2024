<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper contains prompts and model outputs which are offensive in nature.</p><p>When trained on large, unfiltered crawls from the internet, language models pick up and reproduce all kinds of undesirable biases that can be found in the data: they often generate racist, sexist, violent or otherwise toxic language. As large models often require millions of training examples to achieve good performance, it is difficult to completely prevent them from being exposed to such content. In this paper, we investigate whether pretrained language models at least know when they exhibit some undesirable bias or produce toxic content. Based on our findings, we propose a decoding algorithm that reduces the probability of a model producing problematic text given only a textual description of the undesired behavior. This algorithm does not rely on manually curated word lists, nor does it require any training data or changes to the model's parameters. While our approach does by no means eliminate the issue of language models generating biased text, we believe it to be an important step in this direction. 1  </p></div>

However, such large datasets are typically based on crawls from the internet that are only filtered with some basic rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Radford et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Raffel et al., 2020)</ref>.

Unsurprisingly, language models trained on such data pick up, reproduce or even amplify these biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bolukbasi et al., 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sheng et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Basta et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gehman et al., 2020, i.a.)</ref>.</p><p>Simple solutions such as using a list of banned words <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Raffel et al., 2020)</ref> fall short of mitigating this problem: Not only do they not reliably keep language models from generating biased text <ref type="bibr">(Figure 1,</ref><ref type="bibr">top)</ref>, but they also prevent them from gaining knowledge of topics related to the banned words, so it is inherently difficult to decide which words to ban. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> Building training datasets with more care and deliberation, an alternative solution discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bender et al. (2021)</ref>, is important, especially for addressing linguistic and cultural variation in online and other forms of communication. However, for large language models that are available for common global languages, it is desirable to also have other mechanisms to address bias because dataset curation and documentation is extremely resource intensive, given the amount of data required. It can also necessitate building different training sets and, accordingly, training different models for each desired behavior, which can cause high environmental impact <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Strubell et al., 2019)</ref>. We therefore argue that, instead of trusting that a model will implicitly learn desired behaviors from the training data, we should make explicit how we expect it to behave at test time: If a model is told which biases are undesired -and it is able to discern their presence -, it should be able to avoid them even if they are present in some of the texts it has been trained on.</p><p>In this paper, we therefore first explore whether language models are able to detect when their own outputs exhibit some undesirable attributes, based only on their internal knowledge -a process to which we refer as self-diagnosis. We then investigate whether this ability can be used to perform self-debiasing, i.e., whether language models can use their knowledge to discard undesired behaviors in a fully unsupervised fashion: We propose a decoding algorithm that reduces the probability of a model producing biased text, requiring nothing more than a textual description of the undesired behavior, which can be as simple as a single keyword (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). While our results demonstrate that large models in particular are, to some extent, capable of performing self-diagnosis and self-debiasing, we also find that their current capabilities are by no means sufficient to eliminate the issue of corpusbased bias in NLP.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Self-Diagnosis</head><p>We investigate the capability of pretrained language models to detect when their outputs exhibit socially undesirable attributes; we call this process self-diagnosis. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> In particular, we are interested in whether language models are able to do so without any training data or other external resources as large enough datasets do not exist for many relevant biases and behaviors. That is, we only provide a short textual attribute description and rely entirely on the internal knowledge that the model has acquired during pretraining.</p><p>Given a language model M and a sequence of words w 1 . . . , w k , let p M (w | w 1 , . . . , w k ) denote the probability that the language model assigns to w being the next word. For each sentence x generated by M and each attribute description y, we construct a self-diagnosis input sdg(x, y) using the template shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> (top). We estimate the probability of x exhibiting attribute y as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p(y | x) = p M (Yes | sdg(x, y)) w∈{Yes,No} p M (w | sdg(x, y))<label>(1)</label></formula><p>based on the probabilities that the language model assigns to the words "Yes" and "No" given the selfdiagnosis input. The very same idea is also used by <ref type="bibr">Schick and Schütze (2020a,c)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brown et al. (2020)</ref> for few-shot learning.</p><p>Experimental Setup To evaluate the selfdiagnosis capabilities of current language models, we follow Gehman et al. ( <ref type="formula">2020</ref>) and consider all emotional concepts covered by Perspective API<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> as attributes (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, left). Unfortunately, this API covers only a limited set of emotional concepts and does not explicitly measure many relevant biases known to be found in pretrained language models; we discuss this limitation in Section 5. For all six attributes considered, we use Perspective API to assign silver-standard labels to all generated texts. Our attribute descriptions (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, right) are based on those provided by Perspective API,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> except for the attributes "threat" and "sexually explicit", as those terms are frequent enough in the training data that we assume providing a detailed description is not necessary. Note that these descriptions were written with the intent to be understood by humans and have not been explicitly adapted or tuned to be well understood by pretrained language models.</p><p>We restrict our analysis to four different-size versions of GPT2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Radford et al., 2019)</ref> Results Results for the six attributes and the four GPT2 model sizes are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. Importantly, all results shown are only lower bounds on each model's ability to perform self-diagnosis. This is because we only use a single template and description for each attribute, and even seemingly small changes to both templates and descriptions can have a significant effect on performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Jiang et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schick and Schütze, 2020a,c)</ref>. Despite this, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> clearly illustrates that the ability to self-diagnose strongly correlates with model size: While the smallest model's classification accuracy in not above chance for any of the four attributes, predictions by GPT2-XL achieve an average of 72.7% accuracy and a PCC of ρ = 0.51 across all attributes. In interpreting these results, it is important to consider that the labels provided by Perspective API are themselves imperfect and subject to a variety of biases. and Perspective API for the attribute "toxicity" on a small sample of texts to be ρ = 0.65, similar to that between Perspective API and GPT2-XL's selfdiagnosis on our larger dataset (ρ = 0.64).</p><p>While the trend shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> is encouraging -and results reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brown et al. (2020)</ref> suggest that performance further increases with scale -the ability to self-diagnose does not directly provide a solution to the problem of language models generating biased text: self-diagnosis can only be performed when the text has already been generated. A trivial solution would be to first generate a set of sentences in a regular fashion and then perform self-diagnosis to discard all those that exhibit an undesired bias. However, this approach is inefficient and provides no viable alternative if a model constantly produces biased text. We therefore discuss a more efficient algorithm for leveraging a language model's internal knowledge to eliminate undesired behaviors in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Self-Debiasing</head><p>In analogy to self-diagnosis, we define selfdebiasing as a language model using only its internal knowledge to adapt its generation process in order to reduce the probability of generating texts that exhibit undesired biases. As before, let M be a pretrained language model and y be the textual description of an undesired attribute. Further, let x be an input text for which we want M to produce a continuation. Analogous to self-diagnosis, we make use of a self-debiasing input sdb(x, y) using the template shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> (bottom). Using this input, we compute both p M (w | x), the distribution of next words given the original input, and p M (w | sdb(x, y)), the distribution that is obtained using the self-debiasing input. Crucially, adding the attribute description y using the template in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> encourages the language model to produce text that exhibits the undesired attribute. Accordingly, undesirable words will be given a higher probability by p M (w | sdb(x, y)) than by p M (w | x). Put differently, the difference between both distributions</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∆(w, x, y) = p M (w | x) − p M (w | sdb(x, y)) (2)</formula><p>will be less than zero for such undesirable words. We use this fact to obtain a new probability distribution</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">pM (w | x) ∝ α(∆(w, x, y)) • p M (w | x) (3)</formula><p>where α : R → [0, 1] is a scaling function used to alter the probability of biased words based on the difference ∆(w, x, y). A simple choice would be to set α(x) = 1[x ≥ 0] where 1 denotes the indicator function. Through this formulation, changes made to the distribution p M are minimally invasive in that the probability of a word is only altered if this is really deemed necessary; probabilities for words that are not considered biased (i.e., where ∆(w, x, y) ≥ 0) are left exactly as is. However, forcing the probability of some words to be exactly zero makes it impossible to compute perplexity for evaluating the quality of a language model, as assigning a probability of zero to the correct next token just once would result in an infinitely large perplexity. Instead of forcing the probability of biased words to be zero, we thus resort to a soft variant where their probability is reduced based on the magnitude of the difference ∆(w, x, y):</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">α(x) = 1 if x ≥ 0 e λ•x otherwise (4)</formula><p>where the decay constant λ is a hyperparameter of our proposed algorithm. With only a slight modification, this algorithm can also be used to simultaneously perform selfdebiasing for multiple attributes, given a set of descriptions Y = {y 1 , . . . , y n }. To this end, we simply replace ∆(w, x, y) in Eq. 3 with:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">∆(w, x, Y ) = min y∈Y ∆(w, x, y)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>so that using word w as a continuation of x is penalized if it has a higher probability according to at least one self-debiasing input.

On this subset, we generate continuations for each prompt consisting of 20 tokens using beam search with a beam size of 3. We do so using both regular GPT2-XL and its self-debiased variant, where we simultaneously perform debiasing for all attributes listed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p>To investigate how our proposed algorithm affects the overall quality of generated texts, we measure perplexity on the Wikitext-2 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Merity et al., 2017)</ref>. 6 We use a maximum sequence length of |x| = 992 tokens (slightly below GPT2's maximum context window of 1,024) to ensure that sdg(x, y) also fits in the context window for each y. In initial experiments, we found α(∆(w, x, y)) to occasionally be so low that the floating point representation of the resulting probability was 6 An implicit assumption of this evaluation is that the Wikitext-2 dataset does not itself contain biased text as in this case, lower perplexity would not necessarily be desirable. zero, again leading to an infinitely large perplexity. To alleviate this issue, we replace α(•) with max{0.01, α(•)} in Eq. 3 for all our experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We follow Gehman et al. ( <ref type="formula">2020</ref>) and define a text to be exhibiting an attribute if Perspective API assigns a probability of at least 50% to the presence of this attribute. Based on this definition, we measure self-debiasing abilities by computing the empirical probability of a model generating text that exhibits an undesired attribute. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows results for different values of λ. As can be seen, our self-debiasing algorithm with λ = 10 reduces the probability of generating biased text by about 25% for each attribute considered. This is achieved without a negative effect on perplexity. Choosing higher values of λ slightly decreases language modeling performance, but also results in better self-debiasing performance: For λ = 100, the probability of the language model showing undesired behavior is reduced by more than half across all attributes.</p><p>We also experiment with a much more simple set of attribute descriptions, consisting only of keywords that we prepend to the input in parentheses; some examples are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. In reference to the original set of descriptions (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), we use the keywords "rude", "sexually explicit", "sexist", "racist", "hateful", "aggressive", "violent" and "threat". Results for this keyword-based approach are also shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> (bottom). Naturally, those keywords do not measure the attributes considered as precisely as the original descriptions, but we wanted to test whether they are easier to understand for a pretrained language model. Interestingly, we find this not to be the case: using the set of keywords for self-debiasing (with λ = 100) performs worse than the original descriptions (with λ = 50) while obtaining a higher perplexity on Wikitext-2. This indicates that pretrained language models are indeed able to make good use of attribute descriptions that go beyond simple keywords.</p><p>For a qualitative analysis, Table <ref type="table">3</ref> shows five selected prompts from the challenging subset of RealToxicityPrompts as well as continuations generated by GPT2 with regular decoding and with self-debiasing using λ = 10; all texts are generated with greedy decoding and a beam size of 3. As can be seen, even with a low value of λ, self-debiasing is often able to prevent GPT2-XL from producing text showing undesired behavior, but fails to do so in some cases. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> also illustrates the problem of imperfect classifications by Perspective API: the self-debiased output for the second prompt is wrongly classified as being a threat.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>Limitations We discuss limitations of both our evaluation and of the proposed self-diagnosis and self-debiasing algorithms themselves. One major limitation of our evaluation is that it entirely relies on attribute scores assigned by Perspective API; this means not only that we cannot test the effectiveness of our method for many relevant biases (e.g., gender bias) that are not measured by the API, but also that our labels are error-prone. In particular, Perspective API may fail to detect more subtle forms of bias and be over reliant on lexical cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gehman et al., 2020)</ref>. In future work, we thus plan to extend our analysis to other datasets that more directly measure the extent to which pretrained language models exhibit certain kinds of bias. Towards this goal, we plan to move beyond corporate definitions and fine-tune attribute descriptions through people-centric processes involving critical intermediaries such as fact checkers and anti-hate groups who possess cultural knowledge of particular linguistic-political contexts and dynamic ways in which toxic expressions keep evolving. This is critical for ensuring that attribute descriptions and labels acquire sufficient cultural and dynamic knowledge to remove bias. However, the advantage of what we have proposed here lies in the scalability it provides to different processes of attribute description and labeling, including the option for critical intermediaries to explicitly set the desired behavior. This means, the contextually rooted process of involving community intermediaries to develop textual descriptions of undesired attributes and assign priorities for bias detection has a real benefit to scale up using our proposed solutions. Our evaluation is also limited to one particular family of language models; future work should look into other classes of models.</p><p>Both our self-diagnosis and self-debiasing algorithms use simple templates and attribute descriptions; using different templates and descriptions may lead to vastly different results <ref type="bibr">(Schick and Schütze, 2020a,c</ref>) and should further be investigated. This is of course also a limitation of our algorithm, as finding descriptions that are well understood by current generations of language models may be inherently difficult for some forms of bias. We also find that the proposed self-debiasing algorithm is often overly aggressive in that it frequently filters out harmless words that do not really contribute to the generated sentence exhibiting an undesired bias, as illustrated by the increase in perplexity for large values of λ (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). We believe that an important direction for future work is to come up with self-debiasing algorithms that perform at least as well with regards to dropping undesired behaviors while maintaining perplexity comparable to regular decoding. We also note that our self-debiasing algorithm is inherently greedy in that decisions for or against a particular word must always be made while only considering its already generated (i.e., left) context. A word that may seem undesirable when only considering its left context may very well be unproblematic once its entire context is taken into account. To some extent, this problem can be alleviated through beam search.</p><p>Ethical Considerations Not least because of the limitations discussed in the previous paragraph, the presented self-debiasing algorithm in its current form is not able to reliably prevent current genera-tions of language models from exhibiting undesired biases or showing toxic behavior -it can merely reduce the probability of this happening for the selected models and on the selected dataset. It should therefore by no means be used as the sole measure to reduce bias or eliminate undesired behavior in real-world applications.</p><p>It would be well beyond the scope of this paper to attempt to make decisions on which behaviors and social biases should be avoided by language models. However, we consider it an advantage of our approach that the responsibility for a model's behavior no longer lies exclusively with its initial developer: Self-debiasing provides an interface to users of a language model that allows them to explicitly set the desired behavior for concrete use cases. For example, there may well be text genres that contain violent language for legitimate purposes and in that case, our method allows the user to specify a policy that does not affect violent language, but reduces the other five attributes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have shown that large language models are capable of performing self-diagnosis, i.e., of investigating their own outputs with regards to the presence of undesirable attributes using only their internal knowledge and textual descriptions. Based on this finding, we have proposed a decoding algorithm that reduces the probability of a model generating biased text by comparing the original probability of a token with its probability if undesired behavior is explicitly encouraged.</p><p>As our evaluation is limited to one particular dataset measuring only a small set of undesired behaviors in an imperfect fashion, it is important to extend our analysis to other kinds of behaviors and biases, benchmarks and models.</p><p>It is clear that self-diagnosis and self-correction only reduce and do not eliminate corpus-based bias. For this reason, they are not a viable path towards bias-free models if used in isolation. However, we hope that future work can leverage our proposals, e.g., by combining them with complementary models or by extending them to build stronger debiasing solutions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Two guys in a bar start a __ GPT2: fight.GPT2+SD( violent ): conversation.Input: Naturally, the nurse is a __ GPT2: woman.
