<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Knowledge graphs enable a wide variety of applications, including question answering and information retrieval. Despite the great effort invested in their creation and maintenance, even the largest (e.g., Yago, DBPedia or Wikidata) remain incomplete. We introduce Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs) and apply them to two standard knowledge base completion tasks: Link prediction (recovery of missing facts, i.e. subject-predicate-object triples) and entity classification (recovery of missing entity attributes). R-GCNs are related to a recent class of neural networks operating on graphs, and are developed specifically to deal with the highly multi-relational data characteristic of realistic knowledge bases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of R-GCNs as a stand-alone model for entity classification. We further show that factorization models for link prediction such as DistMult can be significantly improved by enriching them with an encoder model to accumulate evidence over multiple inference steps in the relational graph, demonstrating a large improvement of 29.8% on FB15k-237 over a decoder-only baseline. * Equal contribution.</p></div>

Even the largest knowledge bases (e.g. DBPedia, Wikidata or Yago), despite enormous effort invested in their maintenance, are incomplete, and the lack of coverage harms downstream applications. Predicting missing information in knowledge bases is the main focus of statistical relational learning (SRL).</p><p>Following previous work on SRL, we assume that knowledge bases store collections of triples of the form (subject, predicate, object). Consider, for example, the triple <ref type="bibr">(Mikhail Baryshnikov, educated at, Vaganova Academy)</ref>, where we will refer to Baryshnikov and Vaganova Academy as entities and to educated at as a relation. Additionally, we assume that entities are labeled with types (e.g., Vaganova The nodes are entities, the edges are relations labeled with their types, the nodes are labeled with entity types (e.g., university). The edge and the node label shown in red are the missing information to be inferred.</p><p>Academy is marked as a university). It is convenient to represent knowledge bases as directed labeled multigraphs with entities corresponding to nodes and triples encoded by labeled edges (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). We consider two fundamental SRL tasks: link prediction (recovery of missing triples) and entity classification (assigning types or categorical properties to entities). In both cases, many missing pieces of information can be expected to reside within the graph encoded through the neighborhood structure -i.e. knowing that Mikhail Baryshnikov was educated at the Vaganova Academy implies both that Mikhail Baryshnikov should have the label person, and that the triple (Mikhail Baryshnikov, lived in, Russia) must belong to the knowledge graph. Following this intuition, we develop an encoder model for entities in the relational graph and apply it to both tasks.</p><p>Our entity classification model, similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kipf and Welling (2017)</ref>, uses softmax classifiers at each node in the graph. The classifiers take node representations supplied by a relational graph convolutional network (R-GCN) and predict the labels. The model, including R-GCN parameters, is learned by optimizing the cross-entropy loss.</p><p>Our link prediction model can be regarded as an autoencoder consisting of (1) an encoder: an R-GCN producing latent feature representations of entities, and (2) a decoder: a tensor factorization model exploiting these representations to predict labeled edges. Though in principle the decoder can rely on any type of factorization (or generally any scoring function), we use one of the simplest and most effective factorization methods: DistMult <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Yang et al. 2014)</ref>. We observe that our method achieves competitive results on standard benchmarks, outperforming, among other baselines, direct optimization of the factorization (i.e. vanilla DistMult). This improvement is especially large when we consider the more challenging FB15k-237 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Toutanova and Chen 2015)</ref>. This result demonstrates that explicit modeling of neighborhoods in R-GCNs is beneficial for recovering missing facts in knowledge bases.</p><p>Our main contributions are as follows. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show that the GCN framework can be applied to modeling relational data, specifically to link prediction and entity classification tasks. Secondly, we introduce techniques for parameter sharing and to enforce sparsity constraints, and use them to apply R-GCNs to multigraphs with large numbers of relations. Lastly, we show that the performance of factorization models, at the example of DistMult, can be significantly improved by enriching them with an encoder model that performs multiple steps of information propagation in the relational graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Neural relational modeling</head><p>We introduce the following notation: we denote directed and labeled multi-graphs as G = (V, E, R) with nodes (entities) v i ∈ V and labeled edges (relations) (v i , r, v j ) ∈ E, where r ∈ R is a relation type.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Relational graph convolutional networks</head><p>Our model is primarily motivated as an extension of GCNs that operate on local graph neighborhoods <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Duvenaud et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kipf and Welling 2017)</ref> to large-scale relational data. These and related methods such as graph neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Scarselli et al. 2009</ref>) can be understood as special cases of a simple differentiable message-passing framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gilmer et al. 2017</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">h (l+1) i = σ m∈Mi g m (h (l) i , h (l) j ) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where h</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(l) i ∈ R d (l)</formula><p>is the hidden state of node v i in the l-th layer of the neural network, with d (l) being the dimensionality of this layer's representations. Incoming messages of the form g m (•, •) are accumulated and passed through an element-wise activation function σ(•), such as the ReLU(•) = max(0, •).<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> M i denotes the set of incoming messages for node v i and is often chosen to be identical to the set of incoming edges. g m (•, •) is typically chosen to be a (message-specific) neural network-like function or simply a linear transformation g m (h i , h j ) = W h j with a weight matrix W such as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kipf and Welling (2017)</ref>. This type of transformation has been shown to be very effective at accumulating and encoding features from local, structured neighborhoods, and has led to significant improvements in areas such as graph classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Duvenaud et al. 2015)</ref> and graph-based semi-supervised learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kipf and Welling 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Motivated by these architectures, we define the following simple propagation model for calculating the forward-pass update of an entity or node denoted by v i in a relational (directed and labeled) multi-graph:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">h (l+1) i = σ   r∈R j∈N r i 1 c i,r W (l) r h (l) j + W (l) 0 h (l) i   ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where N r i denotes the set of neighbor indices of node i under relation r ∈ R. c i,r is a problem-specific normalization constant that can either be learned or chosen in advance (such as c i,r = |N r i |). Intuitively, (2) accumulates transformed feature vectors of neighboring nodes through a normalized sum. Different from regular GCNs, we introduce relation-specific transformations, i.e. depending on the type and direction of an edge. To ensure that the representation of a node at layer l + 1 can also be informed by the corresponding representation at layer l, we add a single self-connection of a special relation type to each node in the data. Note that instead of simple linear message transformations, one could choose more flexible functions such as multi-layer neural networks (at the expense of computational efficiency). We leave this for future work.</p><p>A neural network layer update consists of evaluating (2) in parallel for every node in the graph. In practice, (2) can be implemented efficiently using sparse matrix multiplications to avoid explicit summation over neighborhoods. Multiple layers can be stacked to allow for dependencies across several relational steps. We refer to this graph encoder model as a relational graph convolutional network (R-GCN). The computation graph for a single node update in the R-GCN model is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Regularization</head><p>A central issue with applying (2) to highly multi-relational data is the rapid growth in number of parameters with the number of relations in the graph. In practice this can easily lead to overfitting on rare relations and to models of very large size.</p><p>To address this issue, we introduce two separate methods for regularizing the weights of R-GCN-layers: basisand block-diagonal-decomposition. With the basis decomposition, each W (l) r is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">W (l) r = B b=1 a (l) rb V (l) b ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>i.e. as a linear combination of basis transformations</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">V (l) b ∈ R d (l+1) ×d (l) with coefficients a (l)</formula><p>rb such that only the coefficients depend on r. In the block-diagonal decomposition, we r be defined through the direct sum over a set of low-dimensional matrices:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">W (l) r = B b=1 Q (l) br .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Thereby,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">W (l) r are block-diagonal matrices: diag(Q (l) 1r , . . . , Q (l) Br ) with Q (l) br ∈ R (d (l+1) /B)×(d (l) /B) .</formula><p>The basis function decomposition (3) can be seen as a form of effective weight sharing between different relation types, while the block decomposition (4) can be seen as a sparsity constraint on the weight matrices for each relation type. The block decomposition structure encodes an intuition that latent features can be grouped into sets of variables which are more tightly coupled within groups than across groups. Both decompositions reduce the number of parameters needed to learn for highly multi-relational data (such as realistic knowledge bases). At the same time, we expect that the basis parameterization can alleviate overfitting on rare relations, as parameter updates are shared between both rare and more frequent relations.</p><p>The overall R-GCN model then takes the following form: We stack L layers as defined in (2) -the output of the previous layer being the input to the next layer. The input to the first layer can be chosen as a unique one-hot vector for each node in the graph if no other features are present. For the block representation, we map this one-hot vector to a dense representation through a single linear transformation. While we only consider such a featureless approach in this work, we note that it was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kipf and Welling (2017)</ref> that it is possible for this class of models to make use of predefined feature vectors (e.g. a bag-of-words description of a document associated with a specific node).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Entity classification</head><p>For (semi-)supervised classification of nodes (entities), we simply stack R-GCN layers of the form (2), with a softmax(•) activation (per node) on the output of the last layer. We minimize the following cross-entropy loss on all labeled nodes (while ignoring unlabeled nodes):</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">L = − i∈Y K k=1 t ik ln h (L) ik , (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>where Y is the set of node indices that have labels and h</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">(L) ik</formula><p>is the k-th entry of the network output for the i-th labeled node. t ik denotes its respective ground truth label. In practice, we train the model using (full-batch) gradient descent techniques. A schematic depiction of our entity classification model is given in Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Link prediction</head><p>Link prediction deals with prediction of new facts (i.e. triples (subject, relation, object)). Formally, the knowledge base is represented by a directed, labeled graph G = (V, E, R). Rather than the full set of edges E, we are given only an incomplete subset Ê. The task is to assign scores f (s, r, o) to possible edges (s, r, o) in order to determine how likely those edges are to belong to E.</p><p>In order to tackle this problem, we introduce a graph auto-encoder model, comprised of an entity encoder and a scoring function (decoder). The encoder maps each entity v i ∈ V to a real-valued vector e i ∈ R d . The decoder reconstructs edges of the graph relying on the vertex representations; in other words, it scores (subject, relation, object)-triples through a function s :</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">R d × R × R d → R.</formula><p>Most existing approaches to link prediction (for example, tensor and neural factorization methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Socher et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lin et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Toutanova et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yang et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Trouillon et al. 2016</ref>)) can be interpreted under this framework. The crucial distinguishing characteristic of our work is the reliance on an encoder. Whereas most previous approaches use a single, real-valued vector e i for every v i ∈ V optimized directly in training, we compute representations through an R-GCN encoder with e i = h (L) i , similar to the graph auto-encoder model introduced in <ref type="bibr">Kipf and</ref> Welling (2016) for unlabeled undirected graphs. Our full link prediction model is schematically depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">3b</ref>.</p><p>In our experiments, we use the DistMult factorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Yang et al. 2014</ref>) as the scoring function, which is known to perform well on standard link prediction benchmarks when used on its own. In DistMult, every relation r is associated with a diagonal matrix R r ∈ R d×d and a triple (s, r, o) is scored as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">f (s, r, o) = e T s R r e o .</formula><p>(6) As in previous work on factorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Yang et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Trouillon et al. 2016)</ref>, we train the model with negative sampling. For each observed example we sample ω negative ones. We sample by randomly corrupting either the subject or the object of each positive example. We optimize for cross-entropy loss to push the model to score observable triples higher than the negative ones:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">L = − 1 (1 + ω)| Ê| (s,r,o,y)∈T y log l f (s, r, o) + (1 − y) log 1 − l f (s, r, o) ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where T is the total set of real and corrupted triples, l is the logistic sigmoid function, and y is an indicator set to y = 1 for positive triples and y = 0 for negative ones.</p><p>5 Empirical evaluation</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Entity classification experiments</head><p>Here, we consider the task of classifying entities in a knowledge base. In order to infer, for example, the type of an entity (e.g. person or company), a successful model needs to reason about the relations with other entities that this entity is involved in.</p><p>Datasets We evaluate our model on four datasets<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format (Ristoski, de Vries, and Paulheim 2016): AIFB, MUTAG, BGS, and AM. Relations in these need not necessarily encode directed subject-object relations, but are also used to encode the presence, or absence, of a specific feature for a given entity. In each dataset, the targets to be classified are properties of a group of entities represented as nodes. The exact statistics of the datasets can be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. For a more detailed description of the datasets the reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ristoski, de Vries, and Paulheim (2016)</ref>. We remove relations that were used to create entity labels: employs and affiliation for AIFB, isMutagenic for MUTAG, hasLithogenesis for BGS, and objectCategory and material for AM. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on AIFB and AM. To explain the gap in performance on MUTAG and BGS it is important to understand the nature of these datasets. MUTAG is a dataset of molecular graphs, which was later converted to RDF format, where relations either indicate atomic bonds or merely the presence of a certain feature. BGS is a dataset of rock types with hierarchical feature descriptions which was similarly converted to RDF format, where relations encode the presence of a certain feature or feature hierarchy. Labeled entities in MUTAG and BGS are only connected via high-degree hub nodes that encode a certain feature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dataset</head><p>We conjecture that the fixed choice of normalization constant for the aggregation of messages from neighboring nodes is partly to blame for this behavior, which can be particularly problematic for nodes of high degree. A potential way to overcome this limitation is to introduce an attention mechanism, i.e. to replace the normalization constant 1/c i,r with data-dependent attention weights a ij,r , where j,r a ij,r = 1. We expect this to be a promising avenue for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Link prediction experiments</head><p>As shown in the previous section, R-GCNs serve as an effective encoder for relational data. We now combine our encoder model with a scoring function (which we will refer to as a decoder, see Figure <ref type="figure">3b</ref>) to score candidate triples for link prediction in knowledge bases.</p><p>Datasets Link prediction algorithms are commonly evaluated on FB15k, a subset of the relational database Freebase, and WN18, a subset of WordNet containing lexical relations between words. In Toutanova and Chen ( <ref type="formula">2015</ref>), a serious flaw was observed in both datasets: The presence of inverse triplet pairs t = (e 1 , r, e 2 ) and t = (e 2 , r −1 , e 1 ) with t in the training set and t in the test set. This reduces a large part of the prediction task to memorization of affected triplet pairs. A simple baseline LinkFeat employing a linear classifier on top of sparse feature vectors of observed training relations was shown to outperform existing systems by a large margin. To address this issue, Toutanova and Chen proposed a reduced dataset FB15k-237 with all such inverse triplet pairs removed. We therefore choose FB15k-237 as our primary evaluation dataset. Since FB15k and WN18 are still widely used, we also include results on these datasets using the splits introduced by <ref type="bibr">Bordes et</ref>   datasets, and furthermore corresponds to a version of our model with fixed entity embeddings in place of the R-GCN encoder as described in Section 4. As a second baseline, we add the simple neighbor-based LinkFeat algorithm proposed in Toutanova and Chen <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(2015)</ref>.</p><p>We further compare to <ref type="bibr">ComplEx (Trouillon et al. 2016) and</ref><ref type="bibr">HolE (Nickel, Rosasco, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Poggio 2015)</ref>, two state-ofthe-art link prediction models for FB15k and WN18. Com-plEx facilitates modeling of asymmetric relations by generalizing DistMult to the complex domain, while HolE replaces the vector-matrix product with circular correlation. Finally, we include comparisons with two classic algorithms -CP <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hitchcock 1927)</ref> and TransE <ref type="bibr">(Bordes et al. 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We provide results using two commonly used evaluation metrics: mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and Hits at n (H@n). Following <ref type="bibr">Bordes et al. (2013)</ref>, both metrics can be computed in a raw and a filtered setting. We report both filtered and raw MRR (with filtered MRR typically considered more reliable), and filtered Hits at 1, 3, and 10.</p><p>We evaluate hyperparameter choices on the respective validation splits. We found a normalization constant defined as c i,r = c i = r |N r i | -in other words, applied across relation types -to work best. For FB15k and WN18, we report results using basis decomposition (Eq. 3) with two basis functions, and a single encoding layer with 200-dimensional embeddings. For FB15k-237, we found block decomposition (Eq. 4) to perform best, using two layers with block dimension 5 × 5 and 500-dimensional embeddings. We regularize the encoder through edge dropout applied before normalization, with dropout rate 0.2 for self-loops and 0.4 for other edges. Using edge droupout makes our training objective similar to that of denoising autoencoders <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Vincent et al. 2008)</ref>. We apply l2 regularization to the decoder with a penalty of 0.01.</p><p>We use the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba 2014) with a learning rate of 0.01. For the baseline and the other factorizations, we found the parameters from Trouillon et al. ( <ref type="formula">2016</ref>) -apart from the dimensionality on FB15k-237to work best, though to make the systems comparable we maintain the same number of negative samples (i.e. ω = 1). We use full-batch optimization for both the baselines and our model.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(2015)</ref>. R-GCN+ denotes an ensemble between R-GCN and DistMult -see main text for details.</p><p>is expected to dominate the performance of the factorizations, contrasting with the design of the R-GCN model. To better understand the difference, we plot in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> the FB15k performance of the best R-GCN model and the baseline (DistMult) as functions of degree of nodes corresponding to entities in the considered triple (namely, the average of degrees for the subject and object entities). can be seen that our model performs better for nodes with high degree where contextual information is abundant. The observation that the two models are complementary suggests combining the strengths of both into a single model, which we refer to as R-GCN+. On FB15k and WN18 where local and longdistance information can both provide strong solutions, we expect R-GCN+ to outperform each individual model. On FB15k-237 where local information is less salient, we do not expect the combination model to outperform a pure R-GCN model significantly. To test this, we evaluate an ensemble (R-GCN+) with a trained R-GCN model and a separately trained DistMult factorization model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">f (s, r, t) R-GCN+ = αf (s, r, t) R-GCN + (1 − α)f (s, r, t) DistMult , with α = 0.4 se- lected on FB15k development data.</formula><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, we evaluate the R-GCN model and the combination model (R-GCN+) on FB15k and WN18.</p><p>On the FB15k and WN18 datasets, R-GCN and R-GCN+ both outperform the DistMult baseline, but like all other systems underperform on these two datasets compared to the LinkFeat algorithm. The strong result from this baseline highlights the contribution of inverse relation pairs to highperformance solutions on these datasets. Interestingly, R-GCN+ yields better performance than ComplEx for FB15k, even though the R-GCN decoder (DistMult) does not explicitly model asymmetry in relations, as opposed to ComplEx.</p><p>This suggests that combining the R-GCN encoder with the ComplEx scoring function (decoder) may be a promising direction for future work. The choice of scoring function is orthogonal to the choice of encoder; in principle, any scoring function or factorization model could be incorporated as a decoder in our auto-encoder framework.</p><p>In  <ref type="formula">2016</ref>), while HolE was evaluated using the code published for Nickel, Rosasco, and Poggio <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(2015)</ref>.</p><p>previously discussed) inverse relation pairs have been removed and the LinkFeat baseline fails to generalize 4 . Here, our R-GCN model outperforms the DistMult baseline by a large margin of 29.8%, highlighting the importance of a separate encoder model. As expected from our earlier analysis, R-GCN and R-GCN+ show similar performance on this dataset. The R-GCN model further compares favorably against other factorization methods, despite relying on a DistMult decoder which shows comparatively weak performance when used without an encoder.</p><p>4 Our numbers are not directly comparable to those reported in Toutanova and Chen <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(2015)</ref>, as they use pruning both for training and testing (see their sections 3.3.1 and 4.2). Since their pruning schema is not fully specified (e.g., values of the relation-specific parameter t are not given) and the code is not available, it is not possible to replicate their set-up.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Relational modeling</head><p>Our encoder-decoder approach to link prediction relies on DistMult <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Yang et al. 2014)</ref> in the decoder, a special and simpler case of the RESCAL factorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Nickel, Tresp, and Kriegel 2011)</ref>, more effective than the original RESCAL in the context of multi-relational knowledge bases. Numerous alternative factorizations have been proposed and studied in the context of SRL, including both (bi-)linear and nonlinear ones (e.g., <ref type="bibr">(Bordes et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Socher et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chang et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Nickel, Rosasco, and Poggio 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Trouillon et al. 2016)</ref>). Many of these approaches can be regarded as modifications or special cases of classic tensor decomposition methods such as CP or Tucker; for a comprehensive overview of tensor decomposition literature we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr">Kolda and Bader (2009)</ref>.</p><p>Incorporation of paths between entities in knowledge bases has recently received considerable attention. We can roughly classify previous work into (1) methods creating auxiliary triples, which are then added to the learning objective of a factorization model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Guu, Miller, and Liang 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Garcia-Duran, Bordes, and Usunier 2015)</ref>; (2) approaches using paths (or walks) as features when predicting edges <ref type="bibr">(Lin et al. 2015)</ref>; or (3) doing both at the same time (Neelakantan, Roth, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">McCallum 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Toutanova et al. 2016)</ref>. The first direction is largely orthogonal to ours, as we would also expect improvements from adding similar terms to our loss (in other words, extending our decoder). The second research line is more comparable; R-GCNs provide a computationally cheaper alternative to these path-based models. Direct comparison is somewhat complicated as path-based methods used different datasets (e.g., sub-sampled sets of walks from a knowledge base).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Neural networks on graphs</head><p>Our R-GCN encoder model is closely related to a number of works in the area of neural networks on graphs. It is primarily motivated as an adaption of previous work on GCNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bruna et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Duvenaud et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Defferrard, Bresson, and Vandergheynst 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kipf and Welling 2017)</ref> for large-scale and highly multi-relational data, characteristic of realistic knowledge bases.</p><p>Early work in this area includes the graph neural network by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Scarselli et al. (2009)</ref>. A number of extensions to the original graph neural network have been proposed, most notably <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Li et al. 2016) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Pham et al. 2017)</ref>, both of which utilize gating mechanisms to facilitate optimization. R-GCNs can further be seen as a sub-class of message passing neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gilmer et al. 2017)</ref>, which encompass a number of previous neural models for graphs, including GCNs, under a differentiable message passing interpretation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>We have introduced relational graph convolutional networks (R-GCNs) and demonstrated their effectiveness in the context of two standard statistical relation modeling problems: link prediction and entity classification. For the entity classification problem, we have demonstrated that the R-GCN model can act as a competitive, end-to-end trainable graphbased encoder. For link prediction, the R-GCN model with DistMult factorization as the decoding component outperformed direct optimization of the factorization model, and achieved competitive results on standard link prediction benchmarks. Enriching the factorization model with an R-GCN encoder proved especially valuable for the challenging FB15k-237 dataset, yielding a 29.8% improvement over the decoder-only baseline.</p><p>There are several ways in which our work could be extended. For example, the graph autoencoder model could be considered in combination with other factorization models, such as ComplEx <ref type="bibr">(Trouillon et al. 2016)</ref>, which can be better suited for modeling asymmetric relations. It is also straightforward to integrate entity features in R-GCNs, which would be beneficial both for link prediction and entity classification problems. To address the scalability of our method, it would be worthwhile to explore subsampling techniques, such as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hamilton, Ying, and Leskovec (2017)</ref>. Lastly, it would be promising to replace the current form of summation over neighboring nodes and relation types with a data-dependent attention mechanism. Beyond modeling knowledge bases, R-GCNs can be generalized to other applications where relation factorization models have been shown effective (e.g. relation extraction).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further experimental details on entity classification</head><p>For the entity classification benchmarks described in our paper, the evaluation process differs subtly between publications. To eliminate these differences, we repeated the baselines in a uniform manner, using the canonical test/train split from <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ristoski, de Vries, and Paulheim 2016)</ref>. We performed hyperparameter optimization on only the training set, running a single evaluation on the test set after hyperparameters were chosen for each baseline. This explains why the numbers we report differ slightly from those in the original publications (where cross-validation accuracy was reported).</p><p>For WL, we use the tree variant of the Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel from the Mustard library.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">5</ref> For RDF2Vec, we use an implementation provided by the authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ristoski and Paulheim 2016)</ref> which builds on Mustard. In both cases, we extract explicit feature vectors for the instance nodes, which are classified by a linear SVM.</p><p>For the MUTAG task, our preprocessing differs from that used in (de Vries and de <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Rooij 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ristoski and Paulheim 2016)</ref> where for a given target relation (s, r, o) all triples connecting s to o are removed. Since o is a boolean value in the MUTAG data, one can infer the label after processing from other boolean relations that are still present. This issue is now mentioned in the Mustard documentation. In our preprocessing, we remove only the specific triples encoding the target relation.</p><p>Hyperparameters for baselines are chosen according to the best model performance in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ristoski and Paulheim 2016)</ref>, i.e. WL: 2 (tree depth), 3 (number of iterations); RDF2Vec: 2 (WL tree depth), 4 (WL iterations), 500 (embedding size), 5 (window size), 10 (SkipGram iterations), 25 (number of negative samples). We optimize the SVM regularization constant C ∈ {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000} based on performance on a 80/20 train/validation split (of the original training set).</p><p>For R-GCN, we choose an l2 penalty on first layer weights C l2 ∈ {0, 5 • 10 −4 } and the number of basis functions B ∈ {0, 10, 20, 30, 40} based on validation set performance, where B = 0 refers to using no basis function decomposition. Using the block decomposition did not improve results. Otherwise, hyperparameters are chosen as follows: 50 (number of epochs), 16 (number of hidden units), and c i,r = |N r i | (normalization constant). We do not use dropout. For AM, we use a reduced number of 10 hidden units for R-GCN to reduce the memory footprint.</p><p>Results with standard error (omitted in main paper due to spatial constraints) are summarized in  <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Rooij 2015)</ref>, RDF2Vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ristoski and Paulheim 2016)</ref>, and R-GCN (this work).
