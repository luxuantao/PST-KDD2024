<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The concept of retraction occurs first in general topology (cf. [5]). Motivated by the topological setting, Pavol Hell <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> investigated retractions in graphs. The definition of "retract" is as one would expect: first, given two (undirected) graphs G and H (without loops), a mapping g : V ( G ) + V ( H ) between their vertex sets is called edge-preserving if it maps adjacent vertices to adjacent vertices. Now, an edge-preserving map f: V ( H ) + V ( G ) is a retraction if there exists an edge-preserving map g : V ( G ) + V ( H ) such that f o g is the identity map of G ; then G is a retract of H. It is convenient to identify G with the subgraph of H induced by the image of G under g.</p><p>The retract construction has become a flourishing topic in graph theory (cf. [7,9-12,19-221, etc.). This is mainly because retracts and products constitute the basic ingredients of any reasonable structure theory for relational systems such as graphs or reflexive graphs (Lee, graphs with loops). This point is made precise in the papers (61 and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Retractions preserve much of the structure of a given graph H. Unfortunately, it is in general hard to decide whether a certain subgraph G is obtained as a retract of H. For bipartite graphs H and special subgraphs G this is, however, readily done: if G is a tree isometrically embedded in H , then G is a retract of H <ref type="bibr">(Hell [9]</ref>); or, if G is a circuit of minimal length in H, then G is a retract of H <ref type="bibr">(Sabidussi,</ref><ref type="bibr">cf. [9]</ref>). The analogous results for arbitrary reflexive graphs H were obtained by Nowakowski and <ref type="bibr">Rival [191.</ref> The following theorem of Duffus and Rival <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> intrigued me: The covering graph ( = undirected Hasse diagram) of a finite distributive lattice of length n is a retract of the n-dimensional hypercube en. Now, trees also are retracts of hypercubes. So, how are these two facts related? Well, trees and covering graphs of discrete distributive lattices are instances of median graphs (here "discrete" refers to the condition that all intervals be finite). A connected graph G is a median graph if every triple u,u,w admits a unique median x, that is, a vertex x which lies simultaneously on shortest paths joining u and u, u and w , w and u, respectively. Median graphs have been considered by several authors; [1-4,13-181 is a sample of papers on this subject. I will assume that the reader is somewhat familiar with the order-theoretic interpretation of median graphs (anyway, he is referred to the papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16]</ref>). This is just a brief outline: every vertex u of a median graph G gives rise to a certain semilattice order sU on V(G) defined by x 6, y if and only if x is on a shortest path joining u and y. Notice that every order-theoretic interval with respect to su is a (finite) distributive lattice. Since any median graph is bipartite, G is the covering graph of the semilattice ( V ( G ) , S , ) . Conversely, given any so-called discrete median semilattice S, the covering graph of S is a median graph. In particular, hypercubes are the covering graphs of discrete generalized Boolean lattices (also known as lattices of all finite subsets of sets). It is important to note that median graphs are embedded in hypercubes. The interplay between median graphs and hypercubes is manifold, see papers [4,14,15,16] of Henry Martyn Mulder and his coworkers. I shall add one more aspect to the theory, viz.: "median graphs are the retracts of hypercubes."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RETRACTIONS</head><p>Every retract of a graph is an induced subgraph by definition (or, at least, can be identified with such a subgraph). Necessarily, retracts are isometric in the following sense: a subgraph G of a graph H is called isometric if every shortest path in G is also a shortest path in H. In other words, G is an isometric subgraph of H if the distance function dG of G is a restriction of the distance function dH of H. A subgraph G of H is called a convex subgraph of H if every shortest path in H joining two vertices of G belongs to G. Trivially, every convex subgraph is isometric. A connected induced subgraph G of a median graph H is called a median subgraph if for any three vertices u,u,w of G the median x of u,u,w in H belongs to G. Note that a subgraph of a median graph H is a median subgraph if and only if it is isometric in H and is a median graph in its own right. Every convex subgraph of a median graph is a median subgraph. Moreover, retracts are median subgraphs as the next lemma shows. Lemma 1. Every retract G of a median graph H is a median subgraph.</p><p>Proof. Since a retraction does not increase distances, any retraction onto G maps a shortest path in H joining two vertices of G onto a shortest path in G. Let f be a retraction of H onto G, and let u,u,w E V ( G ) . The median x of u,u,w in H lies on shortest <ref type="figure">(u,u)-, (u,w)-,</ref> and<ref type="figure">(w,u</ref>)-paths, whence so does f ( x ) . By uniqueness of medians, x and f ( x ) are equal. Therefore G is a median subgraph of H. I</p><p>In view of the preceding lemma every retract of a hypercube is a median graph. Figures <ref type="figure">1</ref> and<ref type="figure">3</ref> exhibit two retracts of the cube Q 3 , namely, the 4-circuit Q2 and the 3-star. As Figures <ref type="figure">1</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> show, a retraction is not uniquely determined by its image. Arbitrary isometric subgraphs need not be retracts: the shaded vertices in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> induce an isometric subgraph G of Q3; G is not a retract of Q3 since the median x of u,u,w in Q3 does not belong to G.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">/ I I / I FIGURE 1 FIGURE 2 / U / I I I I I I I I , , \ ' \ , \ \ \ \ \ ', \ , w FIGURE 3 FIGURE 4</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MAXIMAL MEDIAN SUBGRAPHS</head><p>What do maximal proper median subgraphs of a given median graph look like? The answer to this question constitutes the key ingredient of the proof that median graphs are the retracts of hypercubes. First start off with an arbitrary median subgraph G of a median graph H. Assume that x is a vertex of H not in G which has exactly two neighbors a and b in G . Then there exists a unique vertex u of G adjacent to a and h.</p><p>The following five sets of vertices of G are relevant:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A = (u E V ( G ) I d(a,u) &lt; d(u,u)}, B = {u E V ( G ) I d(h,u) &lt; d(u,u)}, U = {u E V ( G ) -A -B I u is adjacent to some vertex in A Y = {u E A I u is adjacent to some vertex in U}, Z = {u E B 1 u is adjacent to some vertex in U } .</formula><p>and some vertex in B},</p><p>Finally put Proof. First notice that the sets A and B are disjoint. Indeed, for any vertex w of H such that d(a,w) and d ( b , w ) are less than d(u,w). the median of u,h, and MI equals x. Hence as x $Z V ( G ) and G is a median subgraph such a vertex IV cannot belong to G. A vertex u of G is in U if and only if it is the median of id, some vertex in A , and some vertex in B . This fact is evident in the order-theoretic setting. Actually, all of Lemma 2 is easily seen in this light. One is free to choose any semilattice order 6" of H . So, why not use 6,, (as is already indicated in Figures <ref type="figure">5</ref> and<ref type="figure">6</ref>). Then A and B are just the principal filters of the semilattice ( V ( G ) , s,,) generated by a and h , respectively. Further, U is the ideal consisting of all infima y A z of elements y E A and z E B . Hence U is the set of all elements u E V ( G ) such that the suprema a v u and b u exist in ( V ( G ) , s,,). Then, of course, Y and 2 can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">X = {w E V ( H ) 1 w is the median of x,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">U FIGURE 6 and Y = ( a v u z = { b v u u E U ) u E U } .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recall that the median of vertices w , , w 2 , w 3 can be written as ( w I A w 2 )</head><p>If u E U , then the median w of x, a v u , and b v u equals a v b v u = x v u since ( a v u ) A x = a, ( b v u ) A x = 6, and ( a v u ) A ( b v u) = u. For arbitrary y E A and z E B, one has x A y = a and x A z = 6, whence x v (y A z ) is the median of x , y , and z.</p><p>Consequently,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">v (w1 A w d v (w2 A w3). x = { U V X I U E U } ,</formula><p>and L : u v x u gives the required isomorphism between the subgraphs induced by X and U . Moreover, the semilattice ( U U X U Y U 2, S , , ) is isomorphic to the direct product of ( U , S,,) and the four-element Boolean lattice ( { a , b , u , x } , s,,). Therefore U U X U Y U 2 induces a median subgraph of H. Hence the median of a vertex w of G[xI2 and</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">w I , w 2 E X lies in U U X U Y U 2 and thus is a vertex of G[x],. If u E I/ and, say, uI,u2 E V ( G ) -B , then (u v x) A u, = (u v a) A u, (i = l,2)</formula><p>, whence the median of uI,u2, and u v x belongs to G. Now, if u E U , uI E A, and u2 E B, then ( u v x) A uI = ( u V a) A u I and (u v x ) A u2 = (u v 6) A u 2 , whence the median of ulru2, Still, there is another way to produce a minimal median extension of G. Now assume that x is a vertex of H not in G which is adjacent to exactly one vertex of G. Then the subgraph G[x], of H induced by V ( G ) U { x } is a median subgraph of H . On the other hand, if H properly contains G, then there must be some vertex x E V ( H ) -V ( G ) adjacent to at least one vertex of G. Three neighbors of x in G would be too many: x would be their median, which is absurd since G is a median subgraph. Therefore the number of neighbors is either 2 or I , whence either G[xI2 or G[x], is a median subgraph of H. This proves the following result.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">and u v x is in U U X U Y U 2.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposition. Let G be an induced subgraph of a median graph H. Then G is a maximal proper median subgraph of H if and only if either H = G[x], or H = G[xI2 for a suitable vertex x of H not in G .</head><p>A glance at Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>  The preceding fact is analogous to a result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[23]</ref> for distributive lattices. Also, the construction of G[xI2 parallels that of a minimal extension of a finite distributive lattice as performed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[24]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Note that if H = G[x],, then H is the convex closure of G in H .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MEDIAN GRAPHS AS RETRACTS</head><p>In view of the preceding section it is easy to see that every maximal proper median subgraph of a median graph H can be obtained as a retract of the latter. Now, for an arbitrary median subgraph G there exists a well-ordered maximal chain of median subgraphs which connects G and H . The desired retraction of H onto G is then defined recursively.</p><p>Theorem 1. Let G be an induced subgraph of a median graph H such that JV(G)J a 2 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof.</head><p>If G is a retract of H , then, by Lemma 1, G is a median subgraph of H . Conversely, assume that G is a median subgraph of H . Put Go = G and let fo be the identity map of V(Go). For an ordinal a suppose that G, is a proper median subgraph of H and f, is a retraction of G, onto G . Choose a vertex x of H not in G, which is adjacent to at least one vertex of G,.

Further put fA = U , , , fa. As is seen by induction fA is well-defined because for any (Y &lt; p &lt; A the map fa is a restriction of the map fa. Thus, fA is a retraction of G, onto G .</p><p>At some ordinal a the above iteration terminates in G, = H . Then f = f, is the required retraction of H onto G . I</p><p>It seems unlikely that one can define retractions onto given median subgraphs G nonrecursively in some straightforward manner. This is, however, possible in particular instances, e.g., trees (cf. [9,19]) or hypercubes.</p><p>Combining Theorem 1 with the embedding theorem for median graphs yields the main result.</p><p>Theorem 2. Median graphs are precisely the retracts of hypercubes.</p><p>Proof. Every median graph G can be embedded in some hypercube H a s an isometric subgraph (i.e., as a median subgraph). This fact essentially follows from results in Theorem 2 and Corollary 2 correspond to the classical result that distributive lattices are precisely the subdirect products of the two-element chain 2. Indeed, a hypercube can be regarded as a weak Cartesian power of the two-element complete graph K 2 . Thus the graph-theoretic analogue of "subdirect product" is "retract of a weak Cartesian product." Recall the definition of a weak Cartesian product G of a family (Gi)iE, of graphs (cf. for some j and xi = yi for all i f j. It is a routine matter to verify that a weak Cartesian product of median graphs is median. In fact, any weak Cartesian product of retracts of graphs Hi ( i E l) is a retract of some weak cartesian product of the Hi's. Hence from Theorem 2 one gets the next result. Corollary 3. The class of median graphs is the smallest class which contains K 2 and is closed under the formation of retracts and weak Cartesian products.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REFLEXIVE MEDIAN GRAPHS</head><p>As was indicated before there is yet another concept of retraction, viz. retracts of reflexive graphs. "Reflexive" means that the graph in question has a loop at each vertex. Now since there is no distinction between loops and other edges, a retraction of a reflexive graph may send an edge between distinct vertices to a loop at some vertex. Every retraction of a graph is, a fortiori, also a retraction of the corresponding reflexive graph. The converse does not hold-even for median graphs: given any (nonempty) convex subgraph G of a median graph H, the map f sending each vertex x of H to the unique vertex of G closest to x is a retraction of the corresponding reflexive graph. Nevertheless, every retract of a reflexive median graph is a reflexive median subgraph. To see this just look at the proof of Lemma 1. Hence the results for retracts of median graphs carry over to the reflexive case as is summarized in the concluding result.</p><p>Corollary 4. The retracts of a reflexive median graph are the reflexive median subgraphs. Reflexive median graphs are the retracts of reflexive hypercubes. The class of reflexive median graphs is the smallest class containing the reflexive K 2 and closed with respect to retracts and weak Cartesian products.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Lemma 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>FIGURE 5</figDesc></figure>

Therefore G[x12 is the least median subgraph of H containing G together with the vertex x .</figDesc></figure>

The finite case is also established in [14,16]. Now, Theorem 1 completes the proof. I Every finite distributive lattice L of length n can be embedded in the power set lattice 2". Consequently, the covering graph of L is a median subgraph of Qn and hence is a diameter-preserving retract of Q,,. Here a retract G of a graph H is called diameter-preserving if the diameters of G and H are the same. Now if f i s a diameter-preserving retraction of Qn onto a subgraph G, then there are vertices u,u in G with d(u,u) = n. Each vertex x of Q,, lies on some shortest path joining u = f ( u ) and u = f(u), whence so does f ( x ) . Therefore (V(G), su) is a finite distributive lattice with greatest element u. This provides another proof of the following result of<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The covering graphs of finite distributive lattices are precisely the diameter-preserving retracts of finite hypercubes.</figDesc></figure>
