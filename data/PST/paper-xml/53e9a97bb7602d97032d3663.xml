Among the many observable user attributes, approximate user location is particularly simple for search engines to obtain and allows personalization even for a first-time Web search user.

Following this, we describe the data and algorithm used to estimate the locationinterest distribution for each Web document. We characterize particularly location-sensitive Web documents and demonstrate that different documents exhibit vastly different location-interest properties. Next, we describe how the document density estimates can be used to infer the likely relevance of documents in response to a query, presenting a learning approach to re-rank documents in a location sensitive manner. Finally, our results show that this approach leads to substantially improved retrieval quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">RELATED WORK</head><p>Related work can be grouped into three general areas: (i) research on personalization of search results, (ii) geographic information retrieval, and (iii) inference of Web page locations from various sources such as page content and search engine logs.</p><p>Personalized search leverages information about an individual to identify the most relevant search results for that person. A large number of personalization techniques have been proposed in IR research. Some of these methods reside on the server <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and some on the client <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, some leverage long-term query histories <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and some use short-term implicit feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. A challenge for personalization, especially at Web scale, is in collecting user profiles that are sufficiently rich to be useful in settings such as result ranking, while balancing privacy concerns.</p><p>One way that an individual's personalized profile can be augmented is by using data from other people. To better understand whether groups of people can be used to benefit personalized search, Teevan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> explored the similarity of query selection, desktop information, and explicit relevance judgments across people grouped in different ways. They found that some groupings provide valuable insight into what members consider relevant to queries related to the group focus, but that it can be difficult to identify valuable groups implicitly. Building on their findings, Teevan and colleagues show that ranking Web search results based on group leads to a significant relevance gains for grouprelevant queries. Along similar lines, Mei and Church <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> proposed a new way to personalize search through back-off based on searcher IP address. They suggest that if there are no relevant data for a particular user, then we should back off to increasingly larger classes of similar users. As a proof of concept, they used the first few bytes of the IP address to define classes and estimated the coefficients of each back-off. In their analysis, Mei and Church examined the effects of backing off based on day-of-week and time-of-day. Our work differs from these personalization methods in that we explicitly use location (rather than implicitly via IP address) and personalize based on the location of the search results, estimated based on usage patterns. Using our approach we can infer that proximal users may have similar information needs. Similar functionality can only be obtained via IP address if they back-off to similar values, but IP addresses can be widely varying, even for proximal users, depending on network connection setup, service provider, and similar factors.</p><p>Geographic information retrieval (GIR) addresses the retrieval of documents according to geographic criteria of relevance. Previous GIR research has addressed problems such as the recognition and disambiguation of place references in a text <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the assignment of documents to encompassing geographic scopes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, or the retrieval of documents considering geographic relevance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Van Kreveld et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> retrieved documents by creating a linear combination of textual and geographic similarity. Purves et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> extracted location information from documents and linearly interpolated geographic and text-based retrieval scores in the context of free text ranking. GeoCLEF research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>) has used geographic term expansion on the queries and documents and then conventional term matching algorithms on the resulting expanded texts. Jones et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> examined the effectiveness of geographic features of the document, the query, and the document-query combined, and trained a ranker to learn to combine textual and geographic similarity features. They trained a relevance model with both a content-based ranking algorithm and geo-spatial features as inputs, and used the learned weights to predict relevance and perform ranking. For queries with explicit place names which they could extract and use as the basis for matching to document mentions, they found that the minimum distance between the document locations and query location is the strongest geographical predictor of document relevance, and that combining geographic features with text features yields a 5% improvement in relevance over using text features alone. Yu and Cai <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> proposed a dynamic document ranking scheme to combine the thematic and geographic relevance measures on a per-query basis. They used query specificity to determine how best to combine different sources of ranking evidence for each query, and demonstrated relevance gains. Research on spatial diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> provides search results that are not only relevant but also spatially diversified so that they are from many different locations. The work presented in this paper differs from previous work in that we do not mine locations from Web page or query content, and do not compute distances based on distance estimates between locations in the query and the content. Rather, we build location-interest models, That is, models of the locations from which users view individual Web documents. We then personalize based on properties of these models and how typical the user's location is for each search result.</p><p>There has also been work on detecting and using locations in nonretrieval settings. Mehler et al. used locations mentioned in online news articles to detect regional biases toward entities such as players in local sports teams and local politicians <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Mei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> use the geography of Weblog authors to model spatial patterns of news topics. Zhuang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> use click information in order to determine whether a search query is geo-sensitive, model and detect, disambiguate, and visualize the associated geographical locations. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> present a method to automatically determine the dominant locations of search queries by mining the top search results and/or query logs. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> tackle the problem of detecting provider, content, and serving location based on content features of Web pages, hyperlinks and queries. In our work, rather than modeling locations based on explicit mentions of location names in logs, we use implicit location information inferred from aggregated locations of users accessing pages.</p><p>It is clear from this section that there is a substantial amount of related work in areas similar to that covered by our research. However, our work extends previous research in three key ways. First, we perform personalization based on location metadata, showing how to efficiently and compactly maintain this metadata. Second, we use that personalization metadata for the purpose of re-ranking search engine results. Finally, we infer our locationinterest models from log data, estimating the location meta-data to associate with results based on the aggregated location information of those who access the pages, rather than based on content of the results or the query itself. It is worth noting that alt-hough the framework of inferring metadata to improve rankings that we present in this paper is focused on the use of locations, it generalizes to other problem scenarios where metadata is available for documents (e.g., readability levels).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">ESTIMATING WEBSITE LOCATION SENSITIVITY</head><p>In this section, we present the first stage of our approach, namely efficiently estimating a geographic distribution for each website. In particular, our approach creates a compact model of the locations in which each website is likely of interest. In the following sections, we will then show how this model can be used for information retrieval in particular.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data Collection</head><p>The primary source of data for this study is a proprietary data set consisting of the anonymized logs of URLs visited by users who consented to provide interaction data through a widely-distributed Web browser add-on. The data set consists of browsing logs (with both Web search and general browsing episodes) consisting of tuples including a random user identifier, the time and date, and the Web page visited. These data provide us with examples of real-world searching behavior that may be useful in understanding and modeling location-based search. Further, each user's IP address is resolved into geographic location information for the user (i.e., city, state, latitude, and longitude) and this geographic location is recorded. All log entries resolving to the same town or city were assigned the same latitude and longitude coordinates. To remove variability caused by cultural and linguistic variation in search behavior, we only include log entries generated by users in the English-speaking United States locale.</p><p>The models we construct are based on URL visits during three months from July through September 2010. The evaluation results described in this paper are based on URL visits during the first week of October 2010, representing millions of Web page visits from hundreds of thousands of unique users. From these data we extracted search sessions on a commercial Web search engine, using a session extraction methodology similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Search sessions begin with a query, occur within the same browser and tab instance (to lessen the effect of any multi-tasking that users may perform), and terminate following 30 minutes of inactivity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Location-Interest Models</head><p>For each URL with more than 50 visits during the three month period used to collect model data, we infer a location-interest model (referred to as location model or distribution for brevity). This model estimates the probability of the location of the user given they view this particular URL. For compactness, instead of representing each URL by the particular locations from which it was visited, we learn a mixture of Gaussians 1 that can be written:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( | ∑ ( ∑ ( | | ( (</formula><p>where and are inferred from the data. 1 For simplicity, capital "P" is used for (continuous) probability density functions and (discrete) probability mass functions. Specifically, for a given URL we start with a set of locations {(latitude, longitude)} from which this URL was viewed. To avoid any one user having a large impact on the model, only one location data point is allowed for each user for each day for each URL. Moreover, if a URL has more than 50,000 (user, day) pairs, we uniformly subsample 50,000 location samples.</p><p>Using these location data, we learn a density estimate consisting of between 5 and 25 Gaussians (depending on the amount of location data available for each URL) using Expectation Maximization (EM). The EM algorithm specifically adapted to estimating general two-dimensional Gaussians is presented in Algorithm 1, where ( is the inner term of ( | and . Intuitively, the algorithm iterates between estimating the probability that each point belongs to each Gaussian ( , and estimating the most likely mean, covariance and weight of each Gaussian (</p><p>). The Gaussian locations are initialized at a random observed location, with a high initial variance of 50 degrees in each direction (about 5,500km). As the algorithm progresses, each Gaussian tends to narrow and migrate to a high density area, or broaden to cover a background probability over large geographic areas. Examples of the output of the algorithm can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>In addition, when working at Web scale it is essential to minimize the size of metadata used for ranking. As such, Algorithm 1 merges Gaussians that are too similar (i.e., those with means that are within one degree of each other and with covariance matrices which are also very similar), modifying the EM algorithm (by setting instead of the standard value of 1) to encourage Gaussians to be nearby in the E step.</p><p>EM exhibits many additional useful properties making it particularly suitable for this setting -such as being efficient at finding a reliable density estimate that dynamically adapts the complexity of the model to the data. The precise mathematical properties of the algorithm are beyond the scope of this paper. We refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for further details of Gaussian EM and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> for details about the modification used.</p><p>In addition to learning a density estimate per URL, we also learn a general background model describing the density of all users who have opted to provide these interaction data. Aggregating the location information for all URLs yields the background model ( (</p><p>). The background model obtained in this way is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>. From the figure, it can be clearly seen that this model is reasonably representative of the population distribution in the United States.</p><p>Finally, we also learn a location-interest model for each query. For each distinct query observed in our data, we take the locations of the users who issued this query, and use Algorithm 1 in exactly the same way as for URLs. This provides an estimate of ( | .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">LOCATION SENSITIVE FEATURES</head><p>Given the location model generated for each URL, as well as for each query and the background model for the entire population, we can now leverage these models for personalized search. We now describe the features we use to represent geographic locality of search results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Non-Contextual Features</head><p>The first class of features we investigate involve characterizing the query and results without considering the specific user. For example: Is the query issued location sensitive? Are these URLs location sensitive? These are likely to act as indicators as to when location should be taken into account by a ranker.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Features of the URL alone and the query alone</head><p>Let be the location model for a given URL u, and be our background model. Our URL features include the aggregate popularity of the URL ( , the number of distinct (user, day) pairs observed), as well as the overall entropy of the location distribution and its KL divergence from the background.</p><p>As computing the entropy of a mixture of Gaussians exactly is intractable, we computed the entropy by sampling from the location distribution of the URL:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">( [ ( ( | )] 〈 ( ( | 〉</formula><p>where is a location drawn from and 〈 〉 represents an empirical mean of f across many samples. The KL divergence between the location model for u and the background location model is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">( ( || ) ∫ ( | [ ( | ( | ) ]</formula><p>We computed the KL divergence both using sampling for the entropy (KLScore-Sam), and using a simple variational upper bound (KLScore-Var) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we also compute the mean width of each URL model, ( , by sampling from the distribution and computing the mean distance from the sampled mean of the distribution. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> shows an example of a low width model, and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> shows an example of a high width model.</p><p>The same features were also computed for each query. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Features of (URL, query) pair</head><p>We also compute the KL divergence between the URL and query location distribution, ( || , again both using sampling and the variational upper bound. Intuitively, if a query and URL have a very similar distribution, with low KL divergence, we would expect the URL to more likely be relevant to users who issue this query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Contextual Features</head><p>Contextual features take into account the user's particular location, and we expect them to be particularly important in personalizing search results. We used the following contextual features:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Features of the user</head><p>The user's location (latitude, longitude) is included as a feature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Features of the (user, URL) pair</head><p>The simplest interesting contextual feature is the probability of the user's location given the URL u, ( | , estimated by evaluating the URL location model at the user's location. We call this feature LocUrl. If this user is in a location where this URL is popular, the feature would be high.</p><p>If the personalization model were a perfect estimator of the location distribution of the URL, and location was the only determining feature (i.e., there were no query), the best we could do would be to rank by ( | , the probability of the URL u given the user's location. Using Bayes rule, we can estimate this quantity as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">( | ( | ( (</formula><p>Given that the ranking task involves ranking URLs for a user in a particular location, we can ignore the ( term. ( can be estimated from the frequency with which this URL was viewed overall. Hence, we use:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">( ( |</formula><p>However, relying on ( | for our features suffers from every large population center having a higher probability of location for all URLs. As such, when training a ranker, this feature will always be large when the user is in a high population region, and always small otherwise. To obtain more useful ranking scores, we also use a normalized probability of location given URL, subtracting the background model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">( ( (</formula><p>As an illustration of this feature, consider Error! Reference source not found.. It shows the NormLocUrl as a function of location for two universities both returned for the query UW, namely the University of Wyoming, and the University of Wisconsin. We see that the popularity of the University of Wyoming relative to the background frequency is higher over a larger geographic area than that of the University of Wisconsin. Note that higher popularity relative to the background over a large region does not necessarily imply greater popularity in terms of number of users: the University of Wyoming is popular in less populated areas than the University of Wisconsin.</p><p>In addition, we implemented two variants of this feature. The first (NormLocUrl-Thresh) thresholds the normalized feature, setting it to 1 whenever the above ratio is less than 1, i.e., whenever the user location is less likely under the URL model than under the background model. This has the effect of emphasizing URLs that are more likely for this query. The second variant (NormLocUrl-Renorm) renormalizes the background model so that it sums to 1 over the area where ( | , for a small This in effect allows the background normalization to only take into account the population distribution where this URL has ever been clicked, avoiding URLs that are of limited geographical interest having feature values much larger than URLs that are of broad geographical interest.</p><p>Finally, we compute general properties of the URL distribution in the context of the user: (1) TotalVolume(u,loc,d), the percent of the URL u probability mass within a particular distance d of the user location; (2) DistMean(u,loc), the distance from the user's location to the mean of the URL model; (3) PeakDist(u,loc), the distance from the user's location to the nearest individual Gaussian component of the URL model as well as the weight of this Gaussian in the model (PeakWeight). These features attempt to capture features of the neighborhood of the URL location model close to the user.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Features of the (user, query) pair</head><p>We also computed exactly the same features taking the query location model instead of the URL location model, naming them equivalently (e.g., LocQuery instead of LocUrl). These represent how typical the user location is of this query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Standard Ranking Features</head><p>As our experiments will involve learning a re-ranking of Web results that take user location into account, we also incorporate relevance of the URL to the user's query in the form of two simple features:</p><p>1. The rank of the URL in the non-personalized results returned by an underlying ranking function of the Bing search engine. 2. The score of this (query, URL) pair as produced by Bing (monotonically decreasing with the rank of the URL). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">EXPERIMENTAL METHOD</head><p>Having described our data and features in the preceding sections, we now detail the evaluation of our method. We start with an analysis of the properties of our dataset, followed by quantitative experimentation on learning to rank.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Evaluation Dataset Construction</head><p>From the week-long sample of search sessions described in Section 3.1, we generate a dataset for our re-ranking experiments. The dataset comprises a set of approximately one million queries selected uniformly at random from the search sessions. For each query, the top ten search results retrieved by the Bing Web search engine were included, along with the latitude and longitude of the user, any location models available for each of the top ten search results, and the location model built for the query, if available.</p><p>For evaluation, we need a personalized relevance judgment for each result. Obtaining many relevance judgments from real users in a wide range of geographic locations is impractical, and there is no known approach to train expert judges to provide reliable location-sensitive judgments that reflect real user preferences. Hence we obtained these judgments using a log-based methodology inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Specifically, we assign a positive judgment to one of the top 10 URLs if it is the last satisfied result click in the session. We define a satisfied result click in a similar way to previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>[29], as either a click followed by no further clicks for 30 seconds or more, or the last result click in the session. The remaining top-ranked URLs receive a negative judgment. This gives us one positive judgment and nine negative judgments for each of the top-10 URLs for each session.</p><p>The rank position of this single positive judgment is used to evaluate retrieval performance before and after re-ranking. Specifically, we will measure our performance using the inverse of the rank of the relevant document, otherwise known as the mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Queries for which we cannot assign a positive judgment to any top-10 URL are excluded from the evaluation dataset. We also exclude queries for which we cannot assign a location model to at least one of the top-10 results (approximately 16% of queries were removed in this way), or where one of several high precision rich graphical results is shown (for example detailing information about a celebrity, corresponding to approximately 2% of remaining queries). Note that this means that up to nine of the URLs may not have a location model, and thus may have zero values for all location features. Additionally, the query may or may not have a location model depending on the query frequency during the previous three months.</p><p>As the correctness of our evaluation relies on the assumption that promoting satisfied click documents improves overall relevance, we consider these labels further. Previous work on inferring relevance from clicks has shown that assuming clicks to indicate relevance does provide reliable evaluation metrics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>). Further, similar models have also been used to infer relevance directly from clicks (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[6][34]</ref>). Moreover, even if the assumption that results lacking satisfied clicks are non-relevant does not hold, promoting the satisfied clicked results is still likely to improve relevance by displacing higher ranked skipped results, with skipping followed by clicking having been reliably shown to indicate that the skipped result is less relevant <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. More generally our labeling method can be considered studying the task of predicting only the most relevant item. Furthermore, when we consider all satisfied clicks, 97% of the queries in our evaluation set have two or fewer satisfied clicks. Thus, considering all satisfied clicks does not change a large proportion of the data. Finally, it is also worth noting that our approach does not require training data to come from documents labeled in this way. If personalized relevance judgments were available, our model could be trained from such judgments without any modifications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Labeling Location-Centric Pages</head><p>We next studied our dataset to understand which of the visited pages in our sessions are most location centric, and to better understand the nature of these pages.</p><p>We first ranked all URLs observed in our week-long evaluation dataset in descending order based on average log-likelihood of the user's actual location given the URL. After we removed pages consisting of search engine result lists and a small number of obviously non-local other URLs (e.g., online gaming sites), the top 750 remaining URLs were manually labeled by one of the authors of this paper, who created a taxonomy to categorize the most location-focused URLs based on their subject matter. This process involved visiting each URL and assigning it to an existing category or creating a new category as appropriate. We iterated and refined the taxonomy, ending up with 56 distinct labels on a broad range of location-centric topics ranging from classifieds to education. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, we show the distribution across the 15 most popular categories, capturing 85% of the URLs in the labeled set. Remaining URLs were grouped in the category Other.</p><p>The Interestingly, URLs classified as Retail were usually associated with items that shoppers would typically be expected to purchase in person -such as furnishings, groceries, and medication. Stores selling electronics or other items that could easily be obtained online did not emerge in our analysis as strongly location centric.</p><p>Also, we observe that knowing the address associated with the URL does not always equate to knowing the locations from which people would want to access that URL. One solution to identifying locations from URLs would be to simply extract addresses directly from Web page content, and use these to build the location model for the page. For example, from parsing Web pages, we would establish that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is located in Boston, MA. However, that does not tell us whether or not only people located in the Boston area would want to access the MIT page. The website of the university Boston College, which is less than five miles from MIT, has a much different location-interest profile with a much higher proportion of visits being from local users rather than distant users. This demonstrates the value of our method for inferring location metadata for URLs from usage patterns (rather than page content).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Learning to Rank</head><p>We next turn to the motivating task of personalizing Web search results based on the user location. For all the labeled rankings observed during the week of training, we compute all the features described in Section 4. From this dataset we then subsampled approximately half a million queries by uniformly randomly choosing one query per session. This was done to avoid giving extra importance to long sessions where the same user location would be seen repeatedly. The queries were then partitioned into ten parts in order to conduct ten-fold cross validation. For each appropriate result for Louisiana, with the location model shown in Figure <ref type="figure">5b</ref>. The original ranking for this query, as well as the reranked results produced by our learned model are shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. For each of the original top ten results, we see the URL, our estimate of the most relevant location (through manual inspection of the page), the approximate location of the largest Gaussian peak in the URL model, as well as the distance between the model peak and the manually determined URL location. We see that overall the URL models reflect the true page location reasonably well. In the case of the user in New Orleans, we also see that the correct result was moved from position 8 to position 2, resulting in a large improvement in the quality of the results for this particular user.</p><p>Returning to the summary results in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, we show the results for navigational and other queries broken down further. In particular, we study improvements as a function of query click entropy (CE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>  Considering the click entropy in more detail, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref> shows the MRR improvement of the learned model for the same query types as a function of click entropy. Overall, the performance numbers are higher than for all queries due to this analysis being limited to queries with known click entropy. We see that the small fraction of navigational queries improve more at all click entropy levels, but that click entropy is a good indicator of potential for personalization (as also noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>). However, we also see that even queries with little or no variation in the URL clicked (CE ≈ 0) benefit from our approach.</p><p>As a further analysis, we measure how often location based personalization hurts or helps on a per query basis, across all queries. Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> shows the number of queries for which the satisfied clicked result moved up, or down, by the given number of positions. We see that ranking changes are most often of one or two positions, with improvements substantially more frequent than degradation of performance. We also note that results are sometimes promoted by more than 5 positions, moving search results to substantially more prominent positions. Such high impact changes have a more substantial effect on user satisfaction.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Feature Analysis</head><p>Next we turn to analysis of the features contributing to the results in the previous section.</p><p>In our ranking model, we found that the most important feature is the initial rank determined by the original ranking function. This may be because the location features do not depend on the match between the query and the URL. The second most important feature is UrlLoc, which estimates the probability of the URL given the user's location. This suggests that the feature is indeed providing a reasonable estimate of the utility of each URL at each user location. We also saw that URL popularity plays a strong role, followed by the KL divergence of the URL model from the background model. This indicates that URLs whose popularity merely mirrors the background distribution are less likely to be good candidates for promotion or demotion based on user location.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper, we presented an approach for inferring the locations of interest for URLs based on user browsing behavior. We showed that these models are more informative than content alone. We showed how locations can be efficiently encoded as a Gaussian model describing the probability of the location given a URL, and further how this basic model can be transformed into a number of informative features. We demonstrated that these features allow location based personalization of search results, leading to significant gains in offline evaluation, changing the position of the relevant item in 16.8% of the queries, improving it for 10.4% of queries, and improving overall MRR by 1.9%.</p><p>Natural next steps include a comparison with content-based methods, and further validation of our approach in an online setting by dynamically re-ranking search results, and evaluating with an appropriate online metric. Additionally, although 84% of queries return results where at least one in the top-10 has a location model, smoothing approaches could allow location information to be shared between related URLs and allow this approach to be extended to URLs which are visited less frequently or are entirely new. However, this work also suggests broader applications. Location-based personalization is applicable beyond standard Web search, also encompassing advertising, product recommendation, and social networking. Similar models can also be constructed of locations of interest to individual user or specific user cohorts.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
