Boorstyn, Fellow, IEEE, Almut Burchard, Jörg Liebeherr, Member, IEEE, and Chaiwat Oottamakorn Abstract-Network services for the most demanding advanced networked applications which require absolute, per-flow service assurances can be deterministic or statistical. By exploiting statistical properties of traffic, statistical assurances can extract more capacity from a network than deterministic assurances. In this paper we consider statistical service assurances for traffic scheduling algorithms. We present functions, so-called effective envelopes, which are, with high certainty, upper bounds of multiplexed traffic. Effective envelopes can be used to obtain bounds on the amount of traffic on a link that can be provisioned with statistical service assurances. We show that our bounds can be applied to a variety of traffic scheduling algorithms. In fact, one can reuse existing admission control functions for scheduling algorithms with deterministic assurances. We present numerical examples which compare the number of flows with statistical assurances that can be admitted with our effective envelope approach to those achieved with existing methods. Index Terms-Internet, packet switching, quality-of-service, scheduling, statistical multiplexing, statistical service, traffic control (communication).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HE MOST demanding networked applications require ab- solute, per-flow service assurances. Such assurances can be either deterministic or statistical. A deterministic service <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> guarantees that all packets from a flow satisfy given worst-case end-to-end delay bounds and no packets are dropped in the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. A deterministic service provides the highest level of QoS assurance, however, it leaves a significant portion of network resources on the average unused <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. A statistical service <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> makes probabilistic service assurances, for example, of the form or where is generally small, e.g.,</p><p>. By allowing a fraction of traffic to violate its QoS, one can significantly increase the achievable link utilization. A statistical service can improve upon a deterministic service by 1) taking advantage of knowl-edge about the statistics of traffic sources, and 2) by taking advantage of the statistical independence of flows.</p><p>Since it is often not feasible to obtain a reliable statistical characterization of traffic sources, recent research on statistical QoS has attempted to define statistical services without making assumptions on properties of traffic sources. Starting with the seminal work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, researchers have investigated the statistical multiplexing gain by only assuming that flows are statistically independent, and that traffic from each flow is constrained by a deterministic regulator, e.g., by a leaky bucket <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper we attempt to provide new insights into the problem of determining the multiplexing gain of statistically independent, regulated, but otherwise adversarial traffic flows at a network link. We introduce the notion of effective envelopes, which are, with high certainty, upper bounds on the aggregate traffic of regulated flows. We use effective envelopes to devise admission control tests for a statistical service for a large class of scheduling algorithms. We show that with effective envelopes, admission control for a statistical service can be done in a similar fashion as with deterministic envelopes for a deterministic service <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In fact, we show that one can reuse admission control conditions derived for various scheduling algorithms in the context of a deterministic service, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. This is encouraging since only few results are available on statistical multiplexing of adversarial traffic which can consider nontrivial scheduling algorithms, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Let us make a few remarks on the scope of this paper. The scheduling algorithms considered here are first-come-firstserved (FCFS), static priority (SP), and earliest-deadline-first (EDF) (see footnotes 2 and 3 in Section V). The first two scheduling algorithms were selected because of their (relative) simplicity, and because previous work exists on these algorithms to which our results can be compared. The EDF algorithm was selected since it is known to be optimal for a deterministic service, in the sense that it can provide, among all scheduling algorithms, the highest level of delay assurances <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Even though optimality of EDF scheduling has not been proven for statistical QoS assurances, the results for EDF in a statistical environment may still serve as a benchmark for other scheduling algorithms. The results in this paper can also be applied to rate-based scheduling algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. If such algorithms are rate-proportional, the derivations of statistical bounds with effective envelopes are quite simple <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>The discussions in this paper only consider a single node. Since, in a network with multiple nodes, traffic from different flows may become correlated, the assumption of statistical independence of flows may not hold. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, a multi-node anal-ysis is presented which uses the effective envelope approach in networks, where additional mechanisms, e.g., delay jitter control, restore the statistical independence of flows at downstream nodes.</p><p>The remaining sections of this paper are structured as follows. In Section II we discuss related work. In Section III we specify our traffic assumptions and define effective envelopes. In Section IV we use large deviations results to derive bounds for effective envelopes. In Section V we derive sufficient schedulability conditions for a general class of scheduling algorithms, which can be used for deterministic and two types of statistical QoS assurances. In Section VI we compare the statistical multiplexing gain attainable with the effective envelopes approach to those obtained with other methods. In Section VII we present conclusions of our work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RELATED WORK</head><p>The literature on statistical services and statistical multiplexing in quality of service networks is extensive, and so a full discussion is beyond the scope of this paper. Excellent reviews of the state of the art of statistical multiplexing can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Here, we discuss only two groups of prior work on statistical multiplexing which we regard as particularly relevant to this paper. The first group studies the statistical multiplexing gain of statistically independent, regulated, adversarial traffic at a buffered multiplexer with fluid flow service. The second group extends deterministic QoS results to a probabilistic framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Regulated, Adversarial Traffic at a Multiplexer</head><p>Several researchers have studied the multiplexing gain of statistically independent, regulated, adversarial traffic at a buffered multiplexer, where each flow is allocated a fixed amount of link bandwidth and buffer capacity. In these studies, it is assumed that traffic is served in a fluid flow fashion, without consideration of scheduling at the multiplexer. The allocated rate, sometimes called effective bandwidth, and the buffer capacity for a flow are selected such that the probability of losses due to buffer overflows is smaller than some small number .</p><p>Elwalid, Mitra, and Wentworth <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> consider a multiplexer which sees arrivals from regulated peak-rate constrained leaky buckets. The adversarial traffic pattern used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> is a periodic on-off source, which is known to maximize the overflow probability in a bufferless multiplexer. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the solution approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> is applied to the GPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> scheduling algorithm. The work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> has been extended by LoPresti, Zhang, Towsley, and Kurose <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and by Rajagopal, Reisslein, and Ross <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>The question of the adversarial traffic pattern at a buffered multiplexer with regulators has received much interest. Even though specific definitions of an adversarial traffic pattern may vary, in general, it is defined as a feasible arrival scenario which maximizes QoS violations. As suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and by others, and supported by numerical data presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, on-off traffic sources are adversarial for bufferless multiplexers, but not for buffered multiplexers. Kesidis and Konstantopoulos <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> address the problem of finding explicit expressions for the adversarial traffic patterns at a buffered multiplexer, and show that the adversarial traffic pattern is periodic, with multiple on-phases and different rates in each "on" phase.</p><p>Reisslein, Ross, and Rajagopal <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> analyze the multiplexing gain of regulated adversarial traffic for a particular switch architecture, called bufferless multiplexer, where arriving traffic on a flow is shaped at a dedicated buffer for this flow. The output rate of each buffer is set to a fixed rate, such that no traffic experiences a violation of its delay bound in the buffer. The output from the per-flow buffers is multiplexed at a bufferless multiplexer.</p><p>Our work has similar goals as the studies cited above, in that we investigate statistical multiplexing for statistically independent, regulated, and adversarial traffic. On the other hand, our approach deviates from the above papers in several ways. We do not use a particular adversarial traffic pattern in our analysis. In fact, for the scheduling algorithms and for the general class of traffic regulators with subadditive deterministic envelope functions considered in this paper, an explicit derivation of an adversarial pattern may be a formidable task. Furthermore, we do not assume a fluid flow service, and, instead, explicitly consider scheduling at the multiplexer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Probabilistic Extensions of Deterministic Calculus</head><p>Inspired by Cruz's deterministic network calculus <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, several researchers have made probabilistic extensions to deterministic service models.</p><p>Chang <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> derives probabilistic bounds for the delay and loss in a multiplexer with a shared buffer, where each flow is served in a fluid-flow fashion at an allocated rate. A key difference to our work is an assumption that there exists an a priori bound on the moment generating function of the arrivals.</p><p>Yaron and Sidi <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> prove that if the incoming flows to a multiplexer satisfy exponentially bounded burstiness constraints, then the output of the multiplexer has exponentially bounded burstiness. The work was recently extended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> to more general bounding functions.</p><p>Cruz <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> computes probabilistic bounds on the delay and backlog at a scheduler, assuming that probabilistic bounds on traffic arrivals and service curves <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> are available. Qiu and Knightly <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> extend this approach and develop a framework for statistical service envelopes.</p><p>Andrews <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> provides probabilistic bounds for delay violations at an EDF scheduler, assuming that the arrival distribution of traffic is known. Specific results are derived for on-off traffic as assumed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Kurose <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> explores bounds on the distribution of the delay and buffer occupancy of a flow in a network environment by characterizing the traffic on a flow by a family of random variables, which describe the traffic over time intervals. For FIFO scheduling, Kurose also provides bounds on the output of a node, and, thus, can obtain bounds for networks with multiple nodes. Zhang and Knightly <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> extend this work for specific arrival distributions and scheduling algorithms. Both <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> calculate the arrival distribution of aggregate sources directly, without resorting to large deviations results.</p><p>Knightly <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> characterizes flow arrivals using first and second moment information on the sources. The notion of a rate-variance envelope is introduced to describe the variance of the arrivals of a flow over a time interval. Appealing to the central limit theorem, a bound for the probability of a delay bound violation is derived for an SP scheduler. In Section IV-B-1, we relate the rate-variance envelope from <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> to our framework.</p><p>Our work can be viewed as extending the approach pursued in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The most significant generalization of our work is the presentation of a formal framework which allows us to consider different scheduling algorithms, traffic characterizations, and probabilistic bounds. Moreover, our approach enables us to derive schedulability conditions for deterministic and statistical QoS assurances in a uniform fashion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. TRAFFIC ARRIVALS AND ENVELOPE FUNCTIONS</head><p>We consider traffic arrivals to a single link with transmission rate . As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the arrivals from each flow are policed by a regulator, and then inserted into a buffer.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Traffic Arrivals</head><p>Traffic arrivals to the link come from a set of flows which is partitioned into classes.

Remarks:</p><p>• We point out that the above assumptions on the shape of the traffic envelopes and on the randomness of flows are quite general. Note that we do not require ergodicity. • The type of traffic regulators most commonly used in practice are leaky buckets with a peak rate enforcer <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Here, traffic from flow is characterized by three parameters with a deterministic envelope given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where is the peak traffic rate, is the average traffic rate, and is a burst size parameter. We will use this type of regulator in our numerical examples in Section VI.</p><p>• A consequence of subadditivity of the is that the limit exists, and that it provides an upper bound for the long-term arrival rate for .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Definition of Effective Envelopes</head><p>We next define local effective envelopes and global effective envelopes which are, with high certainty, upper bounds on aggregate traffic from a given class . The envelopes are defined for a set of flows with arrival functions and aggregate traffic . Definition 1: A local effective envelope for is a function that satisfies for all and all (4)</p><p>In other words, a local effective envelope provides a bound for the aggregate arrivals for any specific ("local") time interval of length .</p><p>Under the stationarity assumption (A3), ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) holds for all times , provided that it only holds for one value . It is easy to see that there exists a smallest local effective envelope, since the minimum of two local effective envelopes is again such an envelope. Note, however, that local effective envelopes need not be subadditive in , but satisfy the weaker property . A local effective envelope is a bound for the traffic arrivals in an arbitrary but fixed interval of length . Global effective envelopes, to be defined next, are bounds for the arrivals in all subintervals of a larger interval.</p><p>For the definition of global effective envelopes, we take advantage of the notion of empirical envelopes, as used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Consider a time interval of length .

When applied to scheduling, we will select to exceed the longest busy period. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>Assuming that one has obtained local or global effective envelopes separately for each traffic class, the following lemma yields bounds for the traffic from all classes. Fix and . Assume . If the event that occurs, then . This implies that there exists a such that . Using the defining property of the local effective envelope, we can bound the probability that this happens by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> Our derivations in the next section will make it clear that for small enough, both and are not very sensitive with respect to , so that the bounds for and are comparable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONSTRUCTION OF EFFECTIVE ENVELOPES</head><p>In this section we will construct the local and global effective envelopes for the aggregate traffic from a set of flows satisfying (A1)-(A5). Throughout this section, we will work only</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= inf f &gt; 0j A ( ) g.</formula><p>with flows from a single class. So, we will drop the index , and denote by and , respectively, the set of flows and the number of flows. We denote by the common deterministic envelope for the flows in , that is, for all . We denote by the aggregate traffic. The empirical envelope of the aggregate traffic will be denoted by , and the local and global effective envelopes by and . Our derivations proceed in the following steps.</p><p>Step 1: We compute bounds for the moments of the individual flows . Since the flows are independent, this directly leads to bounds for the moments of .</p><p>Step 2: We use the Chernoff bound to determine a local effective envelope directly from our bounds on the moments.</p><p>Step 3: We use a geometric argument to construct from any local effective envelope . Specifically, we will provide bounds of the following nature: <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> where and depend on . We claim that for sufficiently small and not too large, , the resulting global effective envelope is reasonably close to the local effective envelope.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Moment Bounds</head><p>The moment generating functions of the distributions of and the are defined as follows:</p><p>(9) The moments are related with the moment generating functions by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> (15)</p><p>The following lemma will be used to provide bounds on the moment generation function and the moments of the arrivals on a flow</p><p>. A proof of the lemma is given in Appendix I. Lemma 2: Assume that satisfies assumptions (A1)-(A3). Then, for every convex increasing function , <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> With Lemma 2, we can easily obtain bounds for the moment generating function and the th moments . These bounds are formulated in Theorems <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref>. Proof: Equation ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) is obtained by setting in Lemma 2. Combining ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) with ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) yields <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</p><p>The bound in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> can be strengthened to bounds for individual moments.</p><p>Theorem 2: Under the assumptions of Theorem 1, for ,</p><p>coeff. of in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> Proof: Lemma 2 with yields <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.

The inequality in the last line follows from the bounds in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">19</ref>) and the positivity of the moments .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Local Effective Envelopes</head><p>1) Using the Central Limit Theorem: Equations ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) and (3) imply that . Combining this with the bound for the second moment from Theorem 2 yields the bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> for the variance of the individual flows. As indicated, we define <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> By the independence and homogeneity of the flows, it follows that (27) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> Using first the central limit theorem (CLT) and then the bound on the variance in (28), we see that for (29) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> where is the cumulative normal distribution. To find so that <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> we set in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> and solve for . This produces an (approximate) local effective envelope of the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> where is defined by and has the approximate value . We remark that our bound in ( <ref type="formula">25</ref>) is equivalent to Knightly's bound on the rate variance in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The rate variance in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> is defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> Knightly's bound states that <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> which is <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> with both sides multiplied by . 2) Using the Chernoff Bound: While the estimate in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> is asymptotically correct, for finite values of it is only an approximation. To obtain a rigorous upper bound on , recall the Chernoff bound for a random variable (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref> In particular, for , this gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(36)<label>(37)</label></formula><p>Here, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref> simply uses the Chernoff bound, and (37) uses <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. We want to find the value of which makes the bound in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref> as tight as possible. For , the right-hand side of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">37</ref>) is minimal when is chosen so that <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref> Substituting this value of into (37) yields <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref> Again, our goal is to find satisfying <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>.

In other words, the arrivals satisfy, with probability at least , again a rate constraint. The new rate differs from the mean rate by an error of order (for fixed values of , , and ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. From Local to Global Effective Envelopes</head><p>We use the results from the previous subsection to construct a global effective envelope for . The first step is a geometric estimate for the empirical envelope for a particular value of in terms of a given local effective envelope . The second step fixes the value of the global effective envelope for a finite collection of values .

The event occurs if the arrivals in the specific time interval exceed , where the values are given by (46). Since the empirical envelope increases with and cannot exceed by assumption (A2), we see that (50) Since is subadditive, we may take to be the largest subadditive function which does not exceed , in formulas (51) Heuristic Optimization: Since there exists no universal "best" global effective envelope, it is clearly impossible to make an optimal choice for the values of and in ( <ref type="formula">46</ref>) and (47).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. DETERMINISTIC AND STATISTICAL SCHEDULABILITY CONDITIONS</head><p>In this section, we present three schedulability conditions for a general class of work-conserving scheduling algorithms. The first condition, which is expressed in terms of deterministic envelopes, provides deterministic assurances. The second and third conditions, which use the local and global effective envelopes, respectively, give statistical assurances. All three schedulability conditions will be derived from the same expression for the delay of a traffic arrival in an arbitrary work-conserving scheduler [(61) in Subsection A].</p><p>In our discussions we neglect that packet transmissions on a link cannot be preempted. This is reasonable when packet transmission times are short. For the specific scheduling algorithms considered in this paper, accounting for nonpreemptiveness of packets does not introduce principal difficulties, however, it requires additional notation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>). Also, to keep notation minimal, we assume that the transmission rate of the link is normalized, that is, .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Schedulability</head><p>Suppose a (tagged) arrival from a flow in class ( ) arrives to a work-conserving scheduler at time . Without loss of generality, we assume that the scheduler is empty at time 0. We will derive a condition that must hold so that the arrival does not violate its delay bound .</p><p>Let us use to denote the traffic arrivals in the time interval which will be served before a class arrival at time . Let denote the traffic arrivals from flows in which contribute to . Suppose that is the last time before when the scheduler does not contain traffic that will be transmitted before the tagged arrival from class . That is, (56) So, in the time interval , the scheduler is continuously transmitting traffic which will be served before the tagged arrival. (Note that is a function of and . To keep notation simple, we do not make the dependence explicit.)</p><p>Given Remark: For most work-conserving schedulers, one can easily find such that equality holds in (60). For example, for FIFO, SP, 3 and EDF schedulers, we have FIFO: SP: EDF: 2 A FIFO scheduler transmits traffic in the order of arrival times. An EDF (earliest-deadline-first) scheduler tags traffic with a deadline which is set to the arrival time plus the delay bound d , and transmits traffic in the order of deadlines. 3 An SP (static priority) scheduler assigns each class a priority level (we assume that a lower class index indicates a higher priority), and has one FIFO queue for traffic arrivals from each class. SP always transmits traffic from the highest priority FIFO queue which has a backlog. By (60), the arrival from class at time does not have a violation if is selected such that (61)</p><p>Next, we show how (61) can be used to derive schedulability conditions for deterministic and statistical services, using deterministic envelopes, local effective envelopes, and global effective envelopes. For a deterministic service, the delay bound is chosen such that (61) is never violated. For a statistical service, is chosen such that a violation of (61) is a rare event.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remark:</head><p>The assumption in (64) does not hold in general, since the right-hand side is an upper bound for the left-hand side.

Schedulability with Global Effective Envelopes</head><p>We next use global effective envelopes to express the probability of a deadline violation in a time interval.

Local effective envelopes are [under the assumption in (64)] concerned with the probability that a deadline violation occurs at a certain time.</p><p>Global effective envelopes address the probability that a deadline violation occurs in a certain time interval. Clearly, a service which guarantees the latter is more stringent, and will lead to more conservative admission control. Last, we want to point to the structural similarities of the conditions in (62), (66), and (69). Thus, schedulability conditions which have been derived for a deterministic service can be reused, without modification, for a statistical service if effective envelopes are available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. EVALUATION</head><p>In this section, we evaluate the effective envelope approach, using the bounds derived in Section IV and the schedulability conditions from Section V. The key criterion for evaluation is the amount of traffic which can be provisioned on a link with QoS assurances.</p><p>As benchmarks for statistical QoS provisioning we consider the following nonstatistical methods.</p><p>• Peak Rate Allocation: The number of connections that can be supported with a peak rate allocation serves as a lower bound for any method for provisioning QoS. • Deterministic Allocation: We use admission control tests for deterministic QoS from (62). The admissible traffic depends on the scheduling algorithm. • Average Rate Allocation: Since it only guarantees finiteness of delays and average throughput, an average rate allocation provides an upper bound for the number of connections that can be admitted on a link. We will evaluate the methods for provisioning statistical QoS which are presented in this paper.</p><p>• Local Effective Envelope: We use (65) to determine admissibility. We evaluate the quality of the following two bounds, derived in Section IV.</p></div>

The first two examples only include results for Class 1 traffic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Example 1: Comparison of Envelope Functions</head><p>In the first example, we study the shape of local and global effective envelopes for homogeneous sets of flows as functions of the lengths of time intervals. The envelopes are compared to the deterministic envelope , to the peak rate function , and to the average rate function . In our graphs, we plot the amount of traffic per flow for the various envelopes.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref> shows the results for multiplexed flows from Class 1. We set for all types of effective envelopes. By depicting the amount of traffic per flow for different values of ,  we can observe how the statistical multiplexing gain increases with the number of flows. Observe that local and global effective envelopes are much smaller than the deterministic envelope and the peak rate. For a fixed number of flows , the global effective envelope is larger than the local effective envelopes, and the local effective envelope bound is smaller when using the central limit theorem, as compared to the Chernoff bound. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref> also shows that the difference between local and global effective envelopes narrows as the number of flows is increased.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref> we depict the sensitivity of the effective envelopes to the selection of the parameter . We use the same traffic parameters as before. We fix the value for the number of flows to , and we show the envelopes for , and . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref> shows that the effective envelopes are not very sensitive to variations of the parameter .</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref> we show how the effective envelopes vary if the number of flows is increased.

For this value of , Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref> shows the values of the rates and , as the number of flows is varied. For comparison, we include the peak and average rates into the graph. There are three noteworthy observations to be made. First, as the number of flows is increased, the effective envelopes, both local and global, approach the average traffic rate. Second, the difference between the two local effective envelopes diminishes when is large. Third, for large values of the difference between the local and global effective envelopes is quite small.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Example 2: Admissible Region for Homogeneous Flows</head><p>In this example, we investigate the number of flows admitted by various admission control methods at a link with an FIFO scheduler. Here, flows are homogeneous, that is, all flows belong to a single class. We compare the admissible regions, that is, the range of parameters which results in a positive admission control decision, of the local and global effective envelopes, to those of the effective bandwidth techniques (both EB-EMW and EB-RRR), the bufferless Multiplexer (bufferless MUX) and to deterministic QoS assurances.</p><p>We compare the results to those obtained from a discrete event simulation. For the simulation, we take a pattern which we expect, based on the simulations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, to be close to an adversarial traffic pattern for peak-rate controlled leaky buckets. However, we do not claim that the results from the simulation scenario are the worst possible.</p><p>In the simulations, the traffic for a flow with parameters given by , is periodic with a pattern as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref>. A flow transmits at the average rate for a duration , where is the delay bound. Then, the flow transmits at the peak rate for a duration , followed by another phase of length during which the flow transmits at rate . Then, the source shuts off, waits for a duration and then repeats the pattern. The starting times of a pattern of the flows are uniformly and independently chosen over the length of its period. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7</ref> depicts the number of admitted flows as a function of the delay bound. Here, the probability of a violation of QoS assurances is set to . The figure shows that all methods for statistical QoS admit many more connections than a deterministic admission control test. The local effective envelopes (both CLT and CB) are closest to the simulation results. Note, however, that results obtained with local effective envelopes are approximate and are not guaranteed to be upper bounds on the admissible regions.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">8</ref> we show the results for the same experiment with .

We fix the delay bound of traffic to ms and we use . The average achievable link utilization is the sum of the average rates   of flows which can be accepted according to a chosen schedulability conditions. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9</ref> illustrates that all statistical methods have a high statistical multiplexing gain at high link capacities. In contrast, the achievable utilization for deterministic QoS is (almost) constant when the link capacity is increased. Note that the difference between the admissible regions of the local and the global effective envelopes is small at high link capacities. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Example 3: Admissible Region for Heterogeneous Flows</head><p>In this example, we consider different scheduling algorithms and heterogeneous traffic arrivals. As scheduling algorithms, we consider static priority (SP) and earliest-deadline-first (EDF).</p><p>In this example, we multiplex a number of flows from Class 1 and from Class 2 on 45 Mb/s. The delay bound for Class 1 flows is selected relatively long, ms, and the delay bound for Class 2 flows is selected relatively short, ms. For any particular method, we determine the maximum number of Class 1 and Class 2 flows that can be supported simultaneously on the 45 Mb/s link.</p><p>The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10</ref>. The plot depicts the admissible region for SP and EDF schedulers using the results from the local effective envelope, global effective envelope, and deterministic envelope approaches, respectively. We also include the admissible regions using the effective bandwidth approaches (EB-EMW and EB-RRR). The results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10</ref> show that the difference between SP and EDF schedulers is small in all cases. The global effective envelope is, again, more conservative than the local effective envelope method. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10</ref> indicates that methods which consider scheduling algorithms may have advantages over effective bandwidth methods when dealing with heterogeneous traffic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. DISCUSSION</head><p>We have presented new results on evaluating the statistical multiplexing gain for traffic scheduling algorithms. We have introduced the notions of local and global effective envelopes, which are, with high probability, bounds on aggregated traffic flows, and we have derived admission control tests for these bounds. We conclude with the following remarks.</p><p>• We have presented two schedulability conditions for a statistical service at a single node. The first condition, which uses local effective envelopes (Subsection V-C), provides a guarantee for the probability of a QoS violation for an arbitrary arrival. The second condition, which uses global effective envelopes (Subsection V-D), provides a guarantee for the probability of a QoS violation in an arbitrary time interval. Our motivation to introduce a second, more conservative, and possibly less intuitive, condition is the as-sumption in (64). Without a verification of this assumption, admission control conditions may be too optimistic. • We believe that our approach which separates consideration of service models (deterministic, statistical), scheduling algorithms (FIFO, SP, EDF), and large deviations tools (central limit theorem, Chernoff bound) may prove to be useful, as it simplifies the task of testing new scheduling algorithms or large deviations results. • Our work does not attempt to derive an adversarial traffic pattern. Even though results on adversarial patterns have been obtained recently for buffered multiplexers <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, it may not be feasible to derive adversarial traffic patterns for more complex scheduling algorithms.</p><p>On the other hand, our results show that good bounds on the admissible regions are attainable even without knowledge of adversarial traffic patterns. • A few years ago, a study addressed the question of the fundamental limits of a deterministic service <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, and found that a) deterministic QoS drastically increases the admissible region over a peak-rate allocation, and b) the choice of the scheduling algorithm has a noticeable impact on the size of the admissible region. With the results from this paper, we can now provide some insights into the fundamental limits of a statistical service, at least in the context of regulated, adversarial traffic arrivals.</p><p>1) The examples in this paper show that the difference between the admissible regions of statistical and deterministic QoS is significant, even if is selected very small, e.g., .</p><p>2) The results from Example 3 suggest that the selection of the scheduling algorithm (SP versus EDF in our case) has a noticeable but, in relative terms, small impact on the size of the admissible region. Additional numerical data are required to make more conclusive statements on the significance of scheduling algorithms for a statistical service.</p><p>3) The examples in this paper show that, for high data rates, the admissible region for a statistical service is sometimes close to that of an average rate allocation.</p><p>In such a regime, the additional gain achievable by improving currently available methods appears small.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

So, the maximum of (73), up to a rounding error of , is where the first step follows from monotonicity, the second step uses Lemma 3, and the third step invokes the central limit theorem and a simple estimate for the geometric series.

Our goal is to choose and so that the right hand side of (89) is as small as possible. The difficulty is that depends on the choice of and . We can achieve our goal by minimizing instead the right side of (86). It is easy to see that the minimum value is achieved for some finite positive value of and . Using the approximation , where is the density of standard normal distribution, differentiating with respect to and , and solving approximately for the critical values, we see that the minimum is attained at a point satisfying (54) and <ref type="bibr">(90)</ref> where is defined by . Approximating by , we arrive at the conditions in (54) and (55).</p><p>We turn to the basic choice made in (53). The fact that the right hand side of (86), and hence and determined by (54) and either (55) or (90), does not depend on and indicates that optimal choices of and do not depend on the size of , provided that is small enough to lie in the region where .
