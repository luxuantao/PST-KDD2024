<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">The MOBIlearn Project</head><p>MOBIlearn is a worldwide European-led research and development project exploring context-sensitive approaches to informal, problem-based and workplace learning by using key advances in mobile technologies. The goals of the MOBIlearn project are stated as:</p><p>'…the creation of a virtual network for the diffusion of knowledge and learning via a mobile environment where, through common themes, it is possible to demonstrate the convergence and merging of learning supported by new technology, knowledge management, and new forms of mobile communication … A subsidiary goal is to develop deeper understandings of the social processes and interactions that arise when connectivity reaches a critical point, so that we are alert to the possible emergence of 'ambient intelligence' equivalents of the widespread take-up by users of SMS.' <ref type="bibr">[4, p 7]</ref> To accomplish these goals, we must develop a thorough understanding of:</p><p>• the opportunities presented by the new mobile technology</p><p>• its (potential) impact on the way people perform tasks</p><p>• its (potential) impact on human social processes and interactions</p><p>• how these in turn are changed or modified by the technology To fully explore these areas of understanding, the project has adopted a human-centered perspective on system design, which will provide tools, methods and techniques to enable such an in-depth analysis of work practices and human perceptions of the technology's value. MOBIlearn uses ISO 13407 as an overarching model for the project, but at a more detailed level we have adopted socio-cognitive engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> as our guiding approach. Neither of these specifies the techniques to be used at different stages, so we have been free to adopt whichever ones suit our circumstances most closely.</p><p>There are three strands of investigation in the project: health (being investigated by The Open University, UK), MBA students (being investigated by Zurich University, Switzerland), and museums (being investigated by Universita Cattolica, Italy). For all three strands we began by producing scenarios. These scenarios contain a narrative, describing the situation where a user is engaged in a task. Their purpose is to set the scope of user goals, to explain to others about activities in the mobile learning domain, and for other stakeholders to explain to the project what they want. The scenarios fulfill a dual function. The first is to assist in the process of envisionment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The second was to begin considering basic requirements, and they have formed the basis of a set of general requirements which are common to all three strands. For example, the need for the system to be able to establish context (e.g. where am I?), the need for multimodal input, the need to be aware of others (for collaboration) and user-controlled interaction so that learners feel empowered.</p><p>In the next section we introduce the two main techniques we use to establish user requirements: the Volere shell and Volere template, and UML use cases. Then we introduce the three strands of the project: museum, MBA and health. Due to space limitations we consider only the health and the MBA strands in any detail. Finally, we present some conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Volere shell and template</head><p>We have decided to use the Volere shell <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> as a common mechanism for capturing requirements as they emerge from requirements gathering activities. Doing this will maintain consistent and compatible requirements across the three scenario strands. A description of the shell entries is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>Using this shell encourages the originator to clarify the requirement and to consider a number of issues associated with it which might otherwise be overlooked. Using the Volere shell has a number of advantages:</p><p>1. If all requirements are documented using this format then we will have consistent information for each requirement together with traceability information to track where the requirement originates, and where it appears in later documentation such as UML diagrams.</p><p>2. Having requirements documented in a consistent manner will facilitate the identification of common requirements across scenario strands.</p><p>3. The format is clear and simple to follow.</p><p>4. The format encourages the originator of a requirement to study the detail of the requirement (description), to justify it (rationale) and to consider how it relates to other requirements (dependencies/conflicts).</p><p>5. Completing the 'Fit Criterion' field requires the originator to think about how the requirement can be tested or evaluated. This will feed directly into our evaluation activities and support the work there.</p><p>6. Volere shells can be stored in a database for easy search and retrieval. As the number of requirements grows, this database will be updated.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> The Volere shell for capturing requirements</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">UML Notation</head><p>The UML (Unified Modelling Language) is a powerful, widely-used notation for capturing objectoriented models of code, business processes, relationships in the real world, and many more [see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. UML may therefore be used across a variety of abstractions, from early requirements to implementation. The MOBIlearn team have agreed to use UML as a common notation across work packages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">The Three Strands of MOBIlearn</head><p>The project is focusing on three strands: Museums, Health and MBA students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Museum strand requirements activities</head><p>Two types of questionnaire have been created: one to capture user requirements from the point of view of the tourists, and one from the point of view of the museum's director. The first questionnaire can be seen online at www.mobilearn.org in the Public Result or directly at the address http://www.mobilearn.org/results/questionnaire/questionnaire.htm.</p><p>To date, 600 people have been interviewed directly at the Florence Museums and around the Castles of the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza, and some have completed the questionnaire on-line. The second questionnaire has been created for the museums' directors. Many of the world's most important museums have been interviewed to find out which type of mobile technology would like to implement inside their museums to offer a new type of service to tourists</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Health Strand Requirements Activities</head><p>The MOBIlearn health strand is focused on eliciting requirement specifications for the design of mobile tools suitable for managing and accessing knowledge about basic and non-specialised medical situations <ref type="bibr">[4, p6]</ref>. Central to this remit is the need to produce mobile tools that facilitate learning or the acquisition of basic knowledge about health related situations. In turn, the MOBIlearn health strand strives to achieve this by applying pedagogical insights about learning to understand and interpret knowledge acquisition and sharing mechanisms in health related application areas. This entails accounting for contextual and social-cultural perspectives of user interactions and operational behaviour of focused health practising groups. Towards this end, the MOBIlearn health strand examined work practices of Operational Health Practitioners (OHP) or First Aiders at The Open University (OU). Here we will describe the method used to conceptualise current and future artefacts and work practices of the OU firstaiders when carrying out occupational health or first aid duties.</p><p>In order to specify appropriate requirements for designing mobile health tools to form part of the MOBIlearn learning environment, we employed the Future Technology Workshops <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> method to capture user requirements from OU first-aiders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Future Technology Workshops</head><p>The Future Technology Workshops (FTWs) approach to capturing system requirements focuses on analysing current user activities and tools whilst at the same time envisioning the future integration of technology and activities. In practice, the FTW method involves the organisation of practical workshops in which targeted users or representative user groups are encouraged to explore and explicate both current and future activities and tools involved in their operational context.</p><p>When gathering requirements for the MOBIlearn health strand, two FTW workshops involving OU firstaiders were organised during which users were encouraged to interact with various types of "low-tech" and "hi-tech" artefacts to produce models of an envisioned future system for use in first-aid activities. Following this modelling, participants (OU first-aiders) gave presentations of produced models so as to comment on their operational functions and interface features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Data Capture</head><p>The method used to capture data from these two workshops included the following:-</p><p>• Video recording of practical modelling activities. This included the audio capture of pre-modelling discussions, and audio presentations of produced models involving role-play.</p><p>• Audio recording of group discussions whilst modelling. Audio recording using tapes and minidisks was used to capture verbal discussions of participants whilst they produced models and gave presentations.</p><p>• Handwritten notes. Personal observations were made by assistants monitoring user interactions during workshop activities. Assistants prepared handwritten notes on various aspects of their observation and interpretation of user behaviour and comments whilst producing models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3.">Data Analysis</head><p>The data gathered was transcribed in a word document. In order to elicit systems requirements for the MOBIlearn health strand, a colour coding mechanism was used to identify operational functions and interface features of envisioned tools and future activities. The definition and use of the term 'tool' in this analytical process was informed and grounded in MOBIlearn about human activities and pedagogy i.e. activity theory. In this respect, the activity theoretical notion of 'tools' embodies both physical tools used to perform human activities, for example a pencil for writing, a fork for eating or a bandage for stopping bleeding on an injury. In addition to this, activity theory recognises the conceptual aspects of tools through their mental mediating capacities, therefore a tool can also be defined as a plan, a formula or operational steps e.g. the first-aid ABC routine for assessing an injured person and context of the incident.</p><p>During data analysis, the transcribed raw (unprocessed or un-analysed) data from OU FTWs was then colour coded according to the above criteria and organised into a table that identified tools or artefacts, operational functions and interface features, indication of the source from which that data is abstracted, finally, the elicitation of anticipated systems design requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.4.">Example requirement and its documentation</head><p>From this data, we were able to extract an initial set of 64 requirements which we documented in Volere shells. For example, one set of requirements related to providing diagnostic tools for first aiders. This was broken down into other requirements, as shown below.</p><p>The diagnostic toolkit needs to be: R2.14 Portable, and therefore lightweight R2.15 Applicable on victim's body to take readings R2.16 Automatically activated (e.g. when lifted up) R2.17 Taking continuous readings to assess patient as situation progresses R2.18 Location aware</p><p>The overall requirement was documented in a Volere shell as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The requirements listed above were each also captured in a shell. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mobilearn Health Strand OU First-Aiders -Requirements in Volere Shell</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scenarios and user tests</head><p>The first set of requirement activities were based on two initial and very broad scenarios. For both of them we have produced initial detailed context of use descriptions. These include stakeholder analysis and more detail about the environment. Furthermore we developed initial UML use case diagrams based on the scenarios. These requirements are currently being refined.</p><p>Future gathering requirements will augment the work done. New scenarios will describe more specific learning episodes like "doing collaborative minutes during a lecture" or "coordinated literature research". Those scenarios should reasonably cover a) synchronous vs. asynchronous learning, b) collocal vs. distributed learning, c) formal vs. informal learning, d) learning isolated, in pairs, in small, groups, in large groups and in communities, and e) self-paced learning vs. mentored learning vs. instructed learning.</p><p>Each learning episode can be cut into pieces of single learning events like "on-site discussion with the lecturer", "brainstorming", or "annotate slides from a lecture". A framework of about ten general elementary modules 1 will ensure learning events are well structured, and thus enable us to compare scenarios with each other. One aim of this activity will be to find some core requirements.</p><p>Furthermore we will redefine our scenarios and resulting requirements by a series of small or large scale user tests. Considering limited resources we will use existing and available technology, MOBIlearn prototypes as well as existing tools (e.g. group systems) to convert scenarios into possible usage scenarios. In many cases we will not have any support of mobile technology and might be forced to simulate the technical parts of a scenario. Test participants will be recruited among undergraduate students who will be presented with our user tests during their normal courses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">Data Capture</head><p>In the first place we will describe the scenarios step-by-step and then augment the discussion with the resulting requirements.</p><p>In user tests we will mainly gather qualitative data by personal interviews, direct observation, workshops 2 , achieved content 3 and questionnaires. On a smaller scale we will also gather quantitative data resulting from system log files and questionnaires. Direct data collection from executive MBAs might be challenging due to their time-limiting professional commitments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3.">Processing Data Gathered</head><p>Data will be text based or converted into text. It will be necessary to filter out relevant data by criteria which have to be defined. A next step will be to structure data (see footnote) and condense it into an amount which can be overseen. The processing of data will lead to creation, addition or changes in the context of use, in Volere shells and in the UML use case diagrams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.4.">Data Analysis</head><p>Data analysis will have two intentions. One is to check significance of old requirements, the other will be to gather new requirements. From user tests we expect basic insights in non-functional requirements. Quantitative data will be analysed by formative statistical methods.</p><p>One challenge will be to keep an overview over the requirements themselves, the history of requirements, the context of how the requirements were coming up and in what context they are relevant etc. Using a database of Volere shells will help us meet this challenge, but it is difficult to know how many requirements we will eventually identify.  The modelling of user requirements for this informal learning scenario was further complicated by the vague nature of the learning process involved. Therefore we decided to approach the problem from different points of view. We kept refining the initial scenarios and used them as a base for creating the context of use documentation and Volere templates. The scenarios were also converted into UML Use Cases by transforming their activities and actors into the UML language. This process helped us to recognize missing information in our scenarios where implicit assumptions lay hidden in the text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example requirement and its documentation</head><p>We also started to build a prototypical program for this special scenario which enables us to conduct field tests with the software. This will help us identify previously unknown requirements and define the relevance of the existing requirements in a real world application.</p><p>By merging the models generated by the theoretical approach with the engineering experiences of the software prototype we are able to identify the relevant points of discussion, where our design choices will have critical consequences. After the conclusion of this process we will have the final requirements which have a sound theoretical foundation and also valuable input from real world tests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and lessons learned</head><p>Establishing requirements in a mobile environment presents challenges because the context of use is very varied and quite difficult to pin down. We have used a variety of techniques to establish user requirements for our mobile learning environment. These have been used by different partners in the project, depending on their own circumstances. For example, the Health strand has used workshops, and the Museum strand has used questionnaires. To provide consistency and comparability we have chosen to document the requirements using Volere shells and UML diagrams. Using the Volere shells has forced us to look at requirements in a rigorous fashion, and to investigate them more thoroughly at an early stage.</p><p>Using UML has helped us to model Use Cases along the lines of the initial usage scenarios. This process helped us identify new requirements by structuring the text of the scenario in a model. Also it helps as a common language by reducing the ambiguity of the written text to a standardized representation, which can be also used for further software engineering processes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 A completed Volere shell for the health strand 4</head><label>24</label><figDesc>Figure 2 A completed Volere shell for the health strand</figDesc></figure>
