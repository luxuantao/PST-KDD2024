<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Optimum Design of Chamfer Distance Transforms</head><p>Muhammad Akmal Butt, Student Member, IEEE, and Petros Maragos, Fellow, IEEE Abstract-The distance transform has found many applications in image analysis. Chamfer distance transforms are a class of discrete algorithms that offer a good approximation to the desired Euclidean distance transform at a lower computational cost. They can also give integer-valued distances that are more suitable for several digital image processing tasks. The local distances used to compute a chamfer distance transform are selected to minimize an approximation error. In this paper, a new geometric approach is developed to find optimal local distances. This new approach is easier to visualize than the approaches found in previous work, and can be easily extended to chamfer metrics that use large neighborhoods. A new concept of critical local distances is presented which reduces the computational complexity of the chamfer distance transform without increasing the maximum approximation error.</p><p>Index Terms-Chamfer metrics, critical local distances, distance transforms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HE DISTANCE transform has been applied in many image analysis tasks including shape description, feature detection, skeletonization, segmentation, and multiscale morphological filtering <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Since the computational cost of the exact Euclidean distance transform is relatively high, several fast algorithms have been developed to approximate it. Some of these algorithms also yield integer-valued distances, which have the additional advantage of making various image analysis tasks more efficient, e.g., skeletonization. A major class of such algorithms is based on chamfer metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The term chamfer (introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>) originally referred to a sequential two-pass distance transform algorithm developed by Rosenfeld and Pfaltz <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and later improved and generalized by Borgefors <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Even though this class of algorithms can also be implemented using parallel or queue-based algorithms, the word "chamfer" is retained for compatibility with previous work. Sometimes the word "weighted" is also used to refer to this class of distance transforms.</p><p>The chamfer distance transform approximates the global distance computation with repeated propagation of local distances within a small neighborhood mask. The approximation error depends upon the size of the neighborhood and the selection of the local distances. Borgefors <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> analyzed this problem by finding local distances that minimize the maximum absolute error (MAE) around the boundary of a square of general size</p><p>The error was normalized by , which gives unequal scale weighting to errors at different points on the boundary of the square and hence different angles. Others [9]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> followed this approach and extended the analysis to find the optimal local distances for mean squared error (MSE). A related problem of estimating discrete lines was analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Verwer <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> found optimal distances under both the MAE and MSE by minimizing the error along the boundary of a unit circle thus giving equal emphasis to the errors at different angles.</p><p>In this paper, we develop a geometric approach to find optimal local distances that has certain new viewpoints and novel aspects compared with previous approaches. These new viewpoints are motivated by the major application of multiscale morphological filtering. Since the distance transform is a compact representation of multiscale morphological dilations and erosions, our objective is to find local distances for chamfer distance transform that give the best approximations of multiscale dilations/erosions by disk structuring elements. In contrast to a previous approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, which compared the chamfer distance and the Euclidean distance at the same points along a unit circle, we compare the distances along the boundaries of the two balls induced by the two metrics at the same scale. (The ball induced by the chamfer metric is a polygon, whereas the Euclidean ball is a disk.) Our approach is easier to visualize geometrically, shows clearly the dependence of the approximation error on individual local distances, yields simpler error expressions used to find optimal local distances under various error minimization criteria, and leads to a new concept of critical local distances that offers reduced computation without increasing the maximum error.</p></div>

A faster but approximate computation of the Euclidean distance transform can be achieved via chamfer distance transforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, which may also use integer arithmetic. These algorithms start from the background set and propagate local distances in At each step, distance is propagated in a small, usually 3 3 or 5 5-pixel, neighborhood. The distance to any pixel of is the sum of local distances of the shortest path starting from and ending at that pixel. This propagation of the local distances can be achieved with parallel, sequential, or queue-based algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. If a 3 3 pixel neighborhood is used at each step of distance propagation, local distances of and are used for distances between axially and diagonally neighboring pixels, respectively; see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.

The optimal local distances and the corresponding values of the MAE derived via our approach above are different from the values obtained by Verwer <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.

One can arbitrarily choose the value of e.g., 100, and set the integer distances equal to round and round This may result in a suboptimum selection because the roundoff error may be large and may not be very close to</p><p>We are proposing a new approach where we first select from a desired integer range, say such that the roundoff error is minimum. Then we set and For example, given the optimal real local distances for minimum MAE (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>) where the search for an optimum integer yields (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>), which in turn gives and MAE 3.958%. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> we also provide an integer approximation to the real local distances that minimize the MSE.</p><p>IV. OPTIMAL LOCAL DISTANCES FOR 5 5 NEIGHBORHOOD For a 5 5 neighborhood three local distances are used: the distance to the horizontal and vertical neighbors, the distance to the diagonal neighbors, and the distance to the off-diagonal knight's move neighbors (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The other local distances in 5 5 neighborhood are redundant because they can be expressed in terms of and The chamfer polygon of size generated with these local distances has 16 sides. Since it is symmetric with respect to the axes and the diagonals, the error analysis can be limited to the octant shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. From the geometry of Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> it can be found that the angles and are given by ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(9)</formula><p>By using the law of sines in the triangles of Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, we find that lengths of the vectors tracing the two edges and of the chamfer polygon are <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> These expressions are then used to minimize the normalized error under various error criteria. If exact Euclidean distances are used as local distances, the corners of the unit chamfer polygon will be on the unit circle. The error plots for this chamfer metric are given in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> occurs at the peak of the bigger lobe corresponding to the edge which is controlled by the local distances and These local distances should be selected so that both corners of the edge are pushed out of the unit circle by the same amount making the triangle isosceles, i.e., In this case, This yields the optimal value of which in turn gives the optimal value of and an MAE of 1.36%. For minimizing the MAE, the value of is not critical because it is associated with the smaller error lobe. Once and are selected to optimally place the longer edge across the unit circle, can be selected in such a way that the MAE is smaller than 1.36%. A possible This procedure of finding the value of is similar to that used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure">8(b)</ref> and<ref type="figure">(d)</ref> shows the error plots for the optimal chamfer metric To find optimal under the MSE criterion subject to a zero area difference constraint we need to perform a numerical minimization (using MATLAB) of the expression where is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. The constraint that the areas of the chamfer polygon and disk parts in the octant region of Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> are equal leads to</p><p>The resulting local distances are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>. These local distance satisfy the regularity conditions, found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, for the metric corresponding the 5 5 chamfer mask. As mentioned before, practical implementations use integervalued local distances and divide the final distance by a constant</p><p>We denote such a chamfer metric by The best combination of integer local distances for any set of real local distances can be found by varying one of the local distances over a desired integer range and finding other integer local distances with ratios close to the ratios of the real local distances. For a 5</p><p>5 neighborhood, such optimal combinations of integer local distances and normalizing constant are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>.</p><p>V. OPTIMAL LOCAL DISTANCES FOR <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> 7 AND LARGER NEIGHBORHOODS</p><p>In the rest of this paper, chamfer metrics based on larger neighborhoods will be analyzed. Some results concerning the geometry of large chamfer masks have been obtained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In this paper, we optimize such large chamfer masks by minimizing the maximum absolute error. The optimal local distances under other error criteria can be easily found by following the analysis presented in earlier sections. An MAE of 1.29% occurs at The error plot consists of a dominant lobe and three smaller lobes. The two middle lobes are not significant and can be combined into one without affecting the maximum error. This fusion of the lobes is achieved by eliminating the local distance corresponding to the corner between them; this should be the local distance Note that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> elimination of the local distance was proposed. Local distances and control the first major error lobe. Following the analysis given in the previous sections, the optimal value of is which gives a maximum absolute error of 0.65%. The optimal value of is</p><p>The values of and are not critical and can be selected so that the maximum error remains within bounds dictated by and One such choice could be the exact Euclidean local distances   In general, a smaller approximation error can be achieved by using a larger neighborhood but at the cost of a slower implementation. For a neighborhood, the nonredundant local distances correspond to the vectors connecting origin with the following pixels: and where "gcd" stands for "greatest common divisor." As pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, These local distances form the Farey sequence. If all of these local distances are used, the error plot consists of a major lobe and some minor lobes. The first lobe, associated with the edge of the chamfer polygon joining the positiveaxis and the corner in the direction of is the major lobe because this edge is the largest of all the polygon edges. It can be proved that because is a decreasing function for</p><p>The optimal selection of local distances, which control the vertices in the directions of positiveaxis and gives the following minimum value of normalized MAE: <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> Table III gives these lower error bounds for different neighborhood sizes. Thus, one can get a good approximation of the Euclidean distance transform by using a suitably large neighborhood for local distance calculations, but at the expense of more computations. However, there is another possibility to increase the speed of chamfer distance transform based on large neighborhoods. As seen in the case of 7 7 neighborhood, some of the nonredundant local distances can be excluded from local distance computations without increasing the maximum absolute error. This requires fewer computations at each step of the distance propagation and hence faster implementation. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>(a) and (b) shows the error plots for two large neighborhoods when all of the nonredundant local distances are used. These plots show that there are many insignificant small error lobes which can be combined without increasing the MAE. We propose that, for a neighborhood of size only the local distances corresponding to the following set of direction vectors should be used: and These local distances are critical because excluding one of these can increase the maximum absolute error. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10(c</ref>) and (d) shows the error plots with critical local distances only. Using these critical local distances, only distance evaluations are required for each pixel. The computational reduction offered by our approach over any other approach that uses all nonredundant local distances is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">IV</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
