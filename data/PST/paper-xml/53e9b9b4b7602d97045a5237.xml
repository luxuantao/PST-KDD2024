<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This article surveys the recent developments in computational methods for second order fully nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), a relatively new subarea within numerical PDEs. Due to their ever increasing importance in mathematics itself (e.g., differential geometry and PDEs) and in many scientific and engineering fields (e.g., astrophysics, geostrophic fluid dynamics, grid generation, image processing, optimal transport, meteorology, mathematical finance, and optimal control), numerical solutions to fully nonlinear second order PDEs have garnered a great deal of interest from the numerical PDE and scientific communities. Significant progress has been made for this class of problems in the past few years, but many problems still remain open.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>solutions to the underlying application problems depend on the solutions to their governing PDEs, analyzing and solving these PDEs has been critically important for the resolutions of many scientific and engineering application problems. To quote the renowned physicist and Nobel laureate Werner Heisenberg, "the progress of physics will to a large extent depend on the progress of nonlinear mathematics, of methods to solve nonlinear equations. . . and therefore we can learn by comparing different nonlinear problems."</p><p>Using nonlinearity as a criterion, PDEs can be divided into two categories: linear PDEs and nonlinear PDEs (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">166,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">167,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">168]</ref>). In the nonlinear category, PDEs are further classified as semilinear PDEs, quasi-linear PDEs, and fully nonlinear PDEs based on the degree of the nonlinearity. A semilinear PDE is a differential equation that is nonlinear in the unknown function but linear in all its partial derivatives. The nonlinear Poisson equation -Δu = f (u) is a well-known example of this class of PDEs. A quasi-linear PDE is one that is nonlinear in (at least) one of the lower order derivatives but linear in the highest order derivative(s) of the unknown function. A prototypical example of a quasi-linear PDE is the p-Laplace equation -div (|∇u| p-2 ∇u) = f (p = 2). Fully nonlinear PDEs are referred to as the class of nonlinear PDEs which are nonlinear in the highest order derivatives of the unknown function. General fully nonlinear first order PDEs have the form H[u](x) := H(∇u(x), u(x), x) = 0. The best-known examples include the Eikonal equation |∇u| = f and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation H(∇u) = 0. General fully nonlinear second order PDEs take the form F [u](x) := F (D 2 u(x), ∇u(x), u(x), x) = 0, <ref type="bibr">(1.1)</ref> where D 2 u(x) denotes the Hessian matrix of u at x. Some well-known examples of this class include the Monge-Ampère equation F [u] := fdet(D 2 u) = 0, where det(D 2 u) denotes the determinant of D 2 u, and the Bellman equation F [u] := sup ν∈V (L ν uf ν ) = 0, where {L ν } ν is a family of second order linear differential operators (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[93]</ref>).</p><p>Fully nonlinear second order PDEs arise from many fields in science and engineering such as astrophysics, antenna design, differential geometry, geostrophic fluid dynamics, image processing, materials science, mathematical finance, mesh generation, meteorology, optimal transport, and stochastic control (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">93,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">103,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">110,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">137,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">176]</ref> and the references therein). Besides the need for developing deep and sophisticated analytical methods for analyzing this class of PDEs, there is an ever increasing demand for efficient and reliable numerical methods for computing their solutions. This is due in part to the wide range of abovementioned applications, which indeed has recently attracted much attention from the numerical PDE and scientific communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">96,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">137,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">133,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">142,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">147]</ref>. Significant progress has been made due to these collective efforts, but many issues still remain open. We believe that these advancements and new results are sufficient both in quality and in quantity to warrant a survey article on the subject, which should provide a timely and valuable contribution and service to the community. We hope that this article will generate more interest in numerical methods for fully nonlinear PDEs. We also hope that increasing awareness of this class of problems will bring fresh ideas and produce novel methods and algorithms for solving problems from one of the last frontiers in numerical PDEs. nonlinear second order PDEs over the last forty years. These are the classical and weak solution concepts and theories. We recall that a classical solution of a second order PDE must possess second order continuous derivatives and satisfy the given PDE at every point in the domain where the PDE is considered (and fulfills the prescribed boundary condition). Classical solution theory tackles issues such as the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions. The uniqueness is often inferred by some comparison principle which in turn is a consequence of some maximum principle (e.g., the Hopf maximum principle or the Aleksandrov-Bakelman-Pucci maximum principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[93,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">105]</ref>). In order to guarantee a maximum principle, the underlying fully nonlinear differential operator must fulfill some kind of monotonicity property. Among the PDEs associated with such a fully nonlinear differential operator, the so-called elliptic are of particular interest. We recall that a fully nonlinear second order operator</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F : R d×d × R d × R × Ω → R is (degenerate) elliptic if F (A, p, z, x) ≤ F (B, p, z, x) for all x ∈ Ω, z ∈ R, p ∈ R d ,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>and A, B ∈ R d×d</head><p>sym with A ≥ B <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">56]</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> In addition, the operator F is proper if it is degenerate elliptic and satisfies F (A, p, u, x) ≤ F (A, p, v, x) whenever u ≤ v. For example, the Monge-Ampère equation det(D 2 u) = f is elliptic only for strictly convex function u (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">93,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">105]</ref>) (and if f &gt; 0). Hence, the Monge-Ampère operator v →det(D 2 v) is not elliptic in full generality, but it is when restricted to the set of strictly convex functions. Notice that unless stated otherwise, Ω ⊂ R d is used to denote a bounded domain.</p><p>The existence of classical solutions is a more difficult issue for fully nonlinear second order elliptic PDEs compared to linear or mildly nonlinear problems. The most often used techniques for proving existence are the method of continuity and the fixed point theorem, which are based on topological arguments and require some crucial a priori estimates of the solutions. In the case of second order quasi-linear PDEs, the fixed point argument is carried out in the Hölder space C 1,α (0 &lt; α &lt; 1), so C 1,α a priori solution estimates must be obtained. However, in the case of second order fully nonlinear PDEs, due to the full nonlinearity, the method of continuity must be carried out in the Hölder space C 2,α . As a result, C 2,α a priori estimates need to be derived, which is a considerably more difficult task. It is now well known that for a large class of fully nonlinear second order PDEs, the required C 2,α a priori estimates are provided by the celebrated Evans-Krylov theorem, which was proved independently by L. C. Evans and N. Krylov in 1982 (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">120]</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>). We also note that the celebrated De Giorgi-Nash Hölder estimate in the high-dimensional quasi-linear theory (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[93]</ref>) is substituted by the Krylov-Safonov Hölder estimate (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>) in the high-dimensional fully nonlinear theory. By the mid-1980s, the classical theory for fully nonlinear PDEs had been well developed (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[93,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 17]</ref>).</p><p>It should be pointed out that the existence of classical solutions depends strongly on the regularity of both the data and the boundary ∂Ω as well as structure conditions on both the data and the domain. For example, the Dirichlet problem for the Monge-Ampère equation det(D 2 u) = f does not in general have a classical solution unless Ω is a uniformly convex domain in the sense that Ω = {x ∈ R d ; ϕ(x) &lt; 0} for some ϕ ∈ C 2 such that D 2 ϕ ≥ λI d×d (λ &gt; 0), where I d×d denotes the d × d identity matrix. The following are two illustrating examples:  Geometrically, u is a viscosity solution if, for every C 2 function ϕ that "touches" the graph of u from above at x 0 , there holds F [ϕ](x 0 ) ≤ 0, and if ϕ "touches" the graph of u from below at x 0 , there holds F [ϕ](x 0 ) ≥ 0 (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.1). We also remark that the above definition can be generalized to the case when both F and u are only bounded functions, which can be easily done using the lower and upper semicontinuous envelopes of F and u (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>).</p><p>A powerful tool in viscosity solution theory for second order fully nonlinear equations is the comparison principle. Generally speaking, the comparison principle asserts that if F is elliptic, u, v are, respectively, a viscosity subsolution and a viscosity supersolution to (1.1), i.e., if F [u] ≤ 0 and F [v] ≥ 0 and u ≤ v on ∂Ω, then u ≤ v in all of Ω. Clearly such a result leads to uniqueness of viscosity solutions, namely, if F [u] = F <ref type="bibr">[v]</ref> in Ω (in the viscosity sense) and u = v on ∂Ω, then u = v. Indeed, if u, v ∈ A are two viscosity solutions of (1.1) with u = v on ∂Ω, then F [u] ≤ 0, F[v] ≥ 0, and u ≤ v, implying u ≤ v in Ω. Switching the roles of u and v we obtain u ≥ v and so u = v.</p><p>From the above viscosity solution definition, it is clear that the concept of viscosity solutions is nonvariational: no integration by parts is involved. Instead, the "hard-tocontrol" derivatives on the solution is thrown to a fixed test function at certain points via a maximum principle. Borrowing some terminology from <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">76]</ref>, we shall refer to the weak solution concept and theory based on the maximum principles as "the differentiation by parts approach," which is significantly different from the integration by parts approach discussed earlier. As we shall see, this is the primary source of difficulties in developing reliable and efficient numerical methods and algorithms for computing viscosity solutions (see sections 2-4 for details).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Classification of Numerical Methods for PDEs.</head><p>Except in some very simple situations, closed form solutions do not exist even for linear PDEs, and therefore numerical techniques become the only viable way to find (and visualize) the solution(s) of a given PDE problem. The field of numerical PDEs is concerned with the design, analysis, and computer implementation of numerical methods and algorithms for solving PDE problems. This field has blossomed in the past forty years, and especially in the last twenty years. This phenomenal development has largely been driven by the ever increasing demands for the solution of important and complicated scientific, engineering, and industrial application problems such as flow and transport, weather prediction, wave propagation, composite and nano materials design and analysis, and genetic network identification and prediction. It has also been facilitated by the rapid advances in computer hardware and the emergence of parallel computing technology in recent years.

Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php Numerical discretization methods for PDEs are very diverse, and there are too many to enumerate. However, conceptually all the major methods can be roughly categorized into the following four classes: (1) Methods based on directly approximating derivatives by difference quotients; (2) methods based on variational principles and approximating infinite-dimensional spaces by finite-dimensional spaces; (3) methods based on finite basis expansions and approximating PDEs at sampling points; (4) none of the above. Obviously, the first class consists of finite differences methods. The second class consists of Galerkin-type methods such as finite element methods, least squares methods, spectral Galerkin methods, discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, finite volume methods, and boundary element methods. The third class consists of collocation methods and meshless methods. Finally, the fourth class mainly contains specialized methods, such as lattice Boltzmann methods, which are often designed for specialized PDEs and their applications. It also contains the composite methods that involve more than one type of discretization technique. We remark that, although there is no guarantee that any of the above methods listed in classes ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)-(3) will work, they can at least be formulated for linear and quasi-linear PDEs without too much difficulty. The methodologies for such methods for linear and quasi-linear PDEs have been well documented in the past forty years <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">128,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">138,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">156,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">157,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">159,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">170,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b182">179]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">Challenges for Solving Fully Nonlinear Second Order PDEs.</head><p>To discretize a given fully nonlinear PDE, it is natural to first try to apply and adapt the successful discretization methods developed for linear and quasi-linear PDEs. Indeed, such a strategy works pretty well in the case of fully nonlinear first order PDEs; we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">131,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">149,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">150,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">160,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">154,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">161,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b184">181,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b185">182]</ref> and the references therein for more details in this direction. On the other hand, the situation for fully nonlinear second order PDEs is strikingly different. None of the three classes of numerical PDE methods listed in section 1.3 works right away for fully nonlinear second order PDEs. In fact, the second class of methods cannot even be formulated because, in general, there is no variational principle to start with for fully nonlinear PDEs. For the first and third classes of methods, a naive application of those methods to fully nonlinear second order PDEs can lead to disastrous results.</p><p>To illustrate this last point, we solve the Monge-Ampère equation det(D<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> u) = f in Ω = (0, 1) 2 using a finite difference method and chose the Dirichlet data g and the source function f such that the exact solution is u = e (x 2 1 +x 2 2 )/2 ∈ C ∞ (Ω). It follows from, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref>, that the Dirichlet Monge-Ampère problem has at most two solutions. We discretize the PDE using the standard nine-point stencil and use Newton's method to solve the resulting nonlinear algebraic system. One would hope, as in the continuous case, there exist at most two discrete solutions. However, as shown by Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.2 for a 4 × 4 grid, sixteen numerical solutions are obtained by varying the initial guess in the Newton method! 2  As this example demonstrates, an additional challenge in constructing usable discretization schemes is caused by the conditional uniqueness of fully nonlinear second order PDEs; that is, solutions are unique only when restricted to a certain function class. Nonuniqueness and conditional uniqueness of solutions are common for fully nonlinear second order PDEs; and Monge-Ampère-type equations are notorious in this regard. This presents a great challenge from a numerical viewpoint since a numerical method must be designed so that it has the ability to select the correct desired solution. In addition, no matter which discretization scheme is used, the resulting algebraic systems are expected to be highly nonlinear because of the full nonlinearity of the PDEs. Solving nonlinear systems is another primary numerical challenge associated with fully nonlinear second order PDEs. Newton's method is often the method of choice. However, providing a good initial guess for Newton's method can be as difficult as solving the nonlinear algebraic system itself. Finally, in addition to numerical experiment validation, in order to give a solid footing to any numerical method, convergence analysis and rates of convergence (if possible) of the numerical method are indispensable and critically important issues which need to be addressed. Such tasks have proved to be very difficult to accomplish and are often left untouched in the literature.</p></div>

The remainder of the article is organized as follows.</head><p>In section 2, we provide a detailed survey of all the numerical methods (of which we are aware) for fully nonlinear second order PDEs with a particular emphasis on Monge-Ampère-type equations. We divide these methods into two groups depending on whether a method uses a finite difference discretization technique or a Galerkin discretization technique. Inside each group, the methods are further divided based on some main characteristics of the methods.

The first numerical method to compute the solution of a fully nonlinear second order PDE was introduced by Oliker and Prussner <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[148]</ref> in 1988 for the two-dimensional Monge-Ampère equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. To explain their method and the motivation behind it, we must first give a geometric interpretation of the Monge-Ampère problem, that is, how the problem arises in the context of differential geometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[152,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">153]</ref>.

As a result, u is the solution to (2.1) and (2.2b), that is, u is an Aleksandrov solution to the Monge-Ampère equation (2.2). Since problem (2.3) is defined in a finite-dimensional setting, the left-hand side of (2.3) can be computed explicitly using standard difference quotients leading to a nonlinear algebraic problem. In order to solve the resulting system, Oliker and Prussner proposed and implemented an iterative sweeping procedure that produces a sequence {u</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">(i) N } i that converges linearly in C(Ω) to the solution u N , i.e., u (i) N -u N L ∞ (Ω) ≤ τ u (i-1) N -u N L ∞ (Ω)</formula><p>for some τ ∈ (0, 1). In addition, a Newton method is implemented once the computed solution is close to the true solution in order to speed up convergence.</p><p>Since the numerical method is based on the geometric interpretation of the Monge-Ampère equation, the scheme is very robust, being able to compute very singular solutions. Moreover, no special information about an initial guess is required to ensure convergence. That being said, there are some drawbacks of this particular method. The most obvious one is that it is problem specific; the method is designed solely for the two-dimensional Monge-Ampère equation, and therefore is difficult to generalize to other fully nonlinear PDEs that do not have geometric interpretations. Furthermore, the iterative procedure converges only linearly and therefore requires many sweeps to obtain a reasonable solution, making the efficiency of the scheme less than desirable. Finally, we mention that a detailed convergence analysis, (e.g., determining the rate of convergence of the error uu N ) remains an open problem. Still, this method opened the door to numerical methods for the Monge-Ampère equation and motivated the numerical community to develop faster and more general methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Monotone Finite Difference Methods of Kuo and Trudinger.</head><p>The first type of monotone scheme that we discuss is that of finite difference methods of positive type introduced by Kuo and Trudinger in <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[124]</ref>. This type of methods is an extension of the schemes of the same name introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[139]</ref> for linear elliptic problems, and they share similar characteristics such as the discrete maximum principle. To describe and motivate these methods, we first recall that if a nonlinear second order differential operator F [u](x) = F (D 2 u(x), ∇u(x), u(x), x) is differentiable, then it is elliptic at û if its linearization at û is elliptic as a linear PDE. In particular, if we denote points in R d×d × R d × R × Ω by (r, p, z, x) and use their subscripts to denote partial differentiation, then F is elliptic at û if there exist positive constants λ, Λ such that </p><formula xml:id="formula_9">λI d×d ≤ F r [û] ≤ ΛI d×d .

As explained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[124]</ref>, a consistent difference scheme of positive type can be constructed for any operator satisfying the structure conditions (2.4) by taking N large enough; that is, by increasing the number of directions on the finite difference grid. Moreover, schemes can be constructed with stronger monotonicity conditions with 0 replaced by λ 0 in (2.6a) and 0 replaced by c 0 in (2.6b) for some positive constants λ 0 , c 0 . The authors provided a couple of arguments to prove that there exists a unique solution to (2.5), one of which is a fixed point argument based on the Brouwer fixed point theorem and a priori estimates of the numerical solutions. The other argument is an iterative method which mimics the method of continuity. In addition to proving the existence of a solution to (2.5), this iterative procedure provides a practical way to compute the solution. As a byproduct of their convergence analysis, Kuo and Trudinger also deduced the existence of a Hölder continuous solution to (1.1) under the structure conditions (2.4). To the best of our knowledge, the practical implementation of these finite difference methods have not yet been investigated.</p></div>

The reason that the right-hand side of the two inequalities in (iii) above are the same is that we have assumed F is continuous in all of its arguments (see Definition 1.1). If the continuity assumption is dropped, then F in the first and second inequalities has to be replaced by its upper and and lower semicontinuous envelopes F * and F * , respectively.</p><p>One of the main results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> is the following convergence theorem. Theorem 2.1 (cf. Theorem 2.1 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>). Suppose that the elliptic problem F [u](x) = 0 in Ω satisfies the comparison principle (hence, it has a unique viscosity solution u ∈ C 0 (Ω)). Assume that the (approximation) operator S satisfies conditions (i)-(iii) above. Then the solution u ρ of (2.7) converges locally uniformly to the unique viscosity of F [u](x) = 0 in Ω.</p><p>Clearly, the above result provides a guideline (i.e., a set of sufficient conditions) for constructing convergent approximation schemes, although it does not say how to construct such schemes (i.e., how to construct the approximation operator S). In this direction, we mention two finite difference schemes which fall into the framework of Barles and Souganidis. The first one is a monotone finite difference method recently proposed by Caffarelli and Souganidis in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>, for which they were also able to establish a convergence rate (in the maximum norm) of order O(h α ) for some α &gt; 0.

Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php Similar to finite difference methods of positive type, the definition and construction of degenerate elliptic schemes are motivated by the definition and properties of viscosity solutions. In particular, it was shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[146]</ref> that if F h is a degenerate elliptic finite difference scheme, then a discrete version of the comparison principle holds. Namely, if</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">F h [u] ≤ F h [v]</formula><p>, then u ≤ v at all mesh points. As a byproduct of this result, the uniqueness of solutions easily follows. To prove existence of the scheme, Oberman constructed the explicit Euler map S ρ [u] = u -ρF h [u] and showed that the mapping is a contraction provided F is a Lipschitz continuous degenerate elliptic scheme and ρ is taken small enough (specifically, if ρ is taken less than the inverse of the Lipschitz constant of F h ). This result also suggests a practical iterative solution procedure to compute solutions of the schemes, although this procedure can be computationally expensive if F h has a large Lipschitz constant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4.">Finite Difference Schemes for Bellman-Type Equations.</head><p>Recall that the (time-independent) Bellman equation reads</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">sup ν∈V L ν u -f ν = 0. (2.9)</formula><p>Here, {L ν } ν is a family of possibly degenerate second order linear equations, and V is a set of admissible controls. Problem (2.9) arises from the dynamic programming principle for a controlled Markov diffusion process, u being the value function (see section 5.10 for more details). Unlike other fully nonlinear second order PDEs (such as Monge-Ampère-type PDEs), there is a large amount of literature on numerical methods (mainly of the finite difference type), going back nearly forty years, for the approximate solution of Bellman-type equations. The reasons for these successful analytical and numerical developments are due to (i) the linear structure appearing in (2.9) and (ii) its probabilistic interpretation. Because of the vast literature on numerical methods for Bellman-type equations, and due to page limitations, we can only give a brief and somewhat incomplete review of the subject. We refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">127,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">126,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">125]</ref> and references therein for a detailed account of numerical methods for these problems as well as their implementation.</p><p>As previously stated, all numerical methods for Bellman equations in the literature are finite difference approximations. Broadly speaking, there are two approaches to constructing and analyzing difference schemes for the Bellman equation: probabilistic methods and viscosity solution methods. In the first case, a controlled Markov diffusion process is approximated by a controlled Markov chain on a lattice with nearest neighbor transitions. The dynamic programming equation then leads to a discretized Bellman equation, where the first and second order partial derivatives in (2.9) are replaced by appropriate finite difference quotients. It should be noted that in using this methodology, one automatically ends up with monotone finite difference schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[88]</ref>. The proof of convergence of these methods then reduces to showing that the chains converge (weakly) to the underlying controlled diffusion process. As pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[122]</ref>, this is not an easy task, as the set of weak limit points of the controlled Markov chains can be larger than the set of processes that can be obtained by controlling the diffusion process. Therefore, when proving convergence, some tricks need to be employed. In contrast, the viscosity solution approach does not assume an underlying Markov chain approximation, but rather only assumes that the difference schemes are consistent, stable, and monotone. As such, they are more general than the probabilistic methods, although the construction of such general schemes is less clear. Under the viscosity solution framework, the convergence theory of such schemes is much simpler due to the abstract theory of Barles and Souganidis <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.

Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php Although numerical methods have been around for quite some time, rates of convergence of these difference schemes have only recently been obtained. The breakthrough occurred in <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[121,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">122]</ref>, where Krylov obtained rates of convergence by combining both analytic (PDE) and probabilistic methods. Combining the novel technique called "shaking the coefficients" with a mollification argument, Krylov obtained smooth subsolutions of the PDE (2.9).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.5.">Wide-Stencil Finite Difference Schemes.</head><p>As is now well known <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[139]</ref>, even for linear elliptic equations, it is generally not possible to build monotone finite difference schemes using a narrow stencil. Therefore, in light of the framework set by Barles and Souganidis <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, wide-stencil schemes seem to be the most feasible option to solve fully nonlinear second order PDEs using finite difference methods. In this direction, Oberman <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[147]</ref> constructed some wide-stencil finite difference schemes for fully nonlinear PDEs which can be written as functions of the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix in two dimensions, i.e., problem (1.1) takes the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">F [u](x) = G λ -[u](x), λ + [u](x) -f (x), (2.10)</formula><p>where λ -[u] (resp., λ + [u]) represents the smallest (resp., largest) eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix D 2 u. Examples of problems such as (2.10) include the Monge-Ampère equation G(λ -, λ + ) = λ -λ + , Pucci's equation G(λ -, λ + ) = αλ + + λ -, and the equation for the convex envelope G(λ -, λ + ) = λ -.</p><p>Oberman's methods are based on the classical Rayleigh-Ritz characterization of the eigenvalues, i.e., <ref type="bibr">(2.11)</ref> where v θ = (cos θ, sin θ) is the unit vector in the direction of the angle θ. The schemes in <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[147]</ref> were based on the simple idea of replacing the characterization of the eigenvalues (2.11) by the standard centered difference approximation</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">λ -[u](x) = min θ∈[0,2π] d 2 u dv 2 θ (x), λ + [u](x) = max θ∈[0,2π] d 2 u ∂v 2 θ (x),</formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">λ - h,dθ [u](x) = min i u(x + v i ) -2u(x) + u(x -v i ) |v i | 2 , (2.12a) λ + h,dθ [u](x) = max i u(x + v i ) -2u(x) + u(x -v i ) |v i | 2 .

However, no rate of convergence was given even for classical solutions. To solve the nonlinear algebraic problem F h,dθ [u] = 0, Oberman proposed the iterative method u n+1 = u n + ρF h,dθ [u n ]. Similar to the Euler map introduced for degenerate elliptic schemes described in section 2.1.3, this iterative procedure was shown to converge if a certain CFL (Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy) condition, which depends upon the Lipschitz constant of F h,dθ , is respected (e.g., ρ ≤ h 2 ).</p><p>Improving on these results in the case of the Monge-Ampère equation (2.2), Oberman and Froese recently extended the wide-stencil finite difference schemes to any dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">91]</ref>. There are two main principles behind extending the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[147]</ref> to the higher-dimensional case. First, in order to compute the (correct) convex solution of the Monge-Ampère equation, they imposed the convexity criterion on the PDE by considering the equivalent problem det + (D 2 u) = f, where det + (D 2 u) = d j=1 max{λ j [u], 0}. Second, to generalize the wide-stencil finite difference schemes to the higher-dimensional case, instead of using the Rayleigh-Ritz characterization <ref type="bibr">(2.11)</ref>, the authors used a variational characterization of the modified determinant</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">det + (D 2 u) = min (ν1,...,ν d )∈V d j=1 max ∂ 2 u ∂ν 2 j , 0 . (2.14)</formula><p>Here, V denotes the set of all orthonormal bases of R d . Similar to the two-dimensional case, the authors replace the complete set of orthonormal vectors {ν j } d j=1 in their numerical schemes by a subset which is determined by the computational grid and stencil. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[147]</ref>, they showed that their methods are consistent, stable, and monotone, and thus converge to the unique convex viscosity solution of the underlying PDE problem as the discretization parameter and directional resolution parameter tend to zero. To solve the underlying nonlinear algebraic system, the authors used Newton's method, which was shown to converge if a good initial guess is provided. Several twoand three-dimensional examples were provided, that showed the robustness of their methods and indicated that the CPU time used is much less than for the iterative method used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[147]</ref>.</p><p>As expected, these wide-stencil finite difference methods have both advantages and disadvantages. Due to the convergence criterion set by Barles and Souganidis <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the convergence analysis reduces to showing that the methods are consistent Downloaded 05/21/13 to 146.201.208.22. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php and monotone. Thus, once such schemes are constructed, their convergence analysis becomes trivial. Furthermore, due to this general framework and theory, the methods proposed are robust for a variety of challenging problems. On the other hand, they have some (inherited) disadvantages as well. First, due to their design, it is not clear (or at least very difficult) how to generalize them to other fully nonlinear PDEs that cannot be written in the form (2.10) or <ref type="bibr">(2.14)</ref>. Second, these methods produce two different sources of error: the spatial resolution h and the directional resolution dθ. Therefore, in order to obtain highly accurate numerical solutions, not only does one have to refine the grid, one must at the same time increase the size of the stencil, which can be very impractical. The numerical experiment results reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[147,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">91]</ref> seem to confirm this observation.</p><p>We remark that, in order to overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages of the wide-stencil finite difference methods, very recently Feng, Kao, and Lewis <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[80]</ref> proposed a new and different (from the framework of Barles and Souganidis <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>) framework for constructing practical finite difference methods for fully nonlinear second order PDEs (including the Monge-Ampère equation). The proposed new framework is a natural extension of the well-known finite difference framework for the first order fully nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">117,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">162]</ref>), and the key concepts of the numerical Hamiltonian and numerical viscosity for the first order equations are replaced by the new concepts of numerical operator, generalized monotonicity, and numerical moment (the last one being inspired by the vanishing moment method; see section 4) for the second order equations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[80]</ref>.</p><p>2.1.6. Some Other Finite Difference Schemes. Baginski and Whitaker <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> proposed a finite difference method to compute surfaces embedded in R 3 with constant Gaussian curvature K &gt; 0 with prescribed boundary data. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the authors considered the case in which the surface is given as the graph of a scalar function u. This then leads to the following Monge-Ampère-type problem called the equation of prescribed Gauss curvature:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">det(D 2 u) = K(1 + |Du| 2 ) 2 in Ω ⊂ R 2 , (2.15a) u = g on ∂Ω. (2.15b)</formula><p>To each boundary value problem (2.15) there corresponds a one-parameter family of surfaces with constant Gaussian curvature: (K, u, g) for K ∈ (0, K max ), where K max (which depends on both g and Ω) denotes the largest Gaussian curvature for which the surfaces exist (see section 5.2 for more details). In general, there are no theoretical estimates on K max , which motivates the need for numerical methods to solve <ref type="bibr">(2.15)</ref>. The design and implementation of Baginski and Whitaker's method parallel the analytic technique used to prove the solvability of (2.15). In particular, the proposed scheme was motivated by the method of continuity, which, as mentioned in section 1.2, is a standard technique to prove the existence of classical solutions for fully nonlinear equations. In the case of the prescribed Gauss curvature equation (2.15), the method of continuity considers a one-parameter family of solutions {u (t) } satisfying the Dirichlet boundary condition (2.15b) and</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">det(D 2 u (t) ) = tK 1 + |Du (t) | 2 2 + (1 -t) det(D 2 u (0) ), 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. (2.16)</formula><p>In a similar manner, Baginski and Whitaker proposed a discrete version of (2.16) using a nine-point stencil finite difference scheme, namely, </p><formula xml:id="formula_28">det(D 2 h u (t) h ) = tK 1 + |D h u (t) h | 2 2 + (1 -t) det(D 2 h u (0) h ) (2.</formula><formula xml:id="formula_29">= t 0 &lt; t 1 &lt; t 2 &lt; • • • &lt; t n = 1.</formula><p>The desired solution then corresponds to t n = 1. The authors used a discrete subsolution as an initial guess and a modified Newton method at each t-value to compute the nonlinear system resulting from (2.17). A continuation method was also employed to numerically determine an approximation for K max . No convergence results were provided, but several two-dimensional numerical experiments were described.</p><p>Loeper and Rapetti <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[133]</ref> considered the problem of finding a periodic function u such that u + |x| 2 /2 is convex and a solution of the shifted Monge-Ampère equation det(I d×d + D 2 u) = f (with periodic boundary conditions). To solve this problem, they introduced the following (nondiscrete) Newton iteration:</p><p>Given u 0 , for n = 1, 2, . . . ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">(i) compute f n = det(I d×d + D 2 u n ); (ii) assemble cof(I d×d + D 2 u n ), the cofactor matrix of I d×d + D 2 u n ;</formula><p>(iii) compute the solution of the linearized Monge-Ampère equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">cof(I d×d + D 2 u n ) : D 2 θ n = 1 τ (f -f n ); (2.18) (iv) update iteration, u n+1 = u n + θ n .</formula><p>Here, A : B denotes the Frobenius inner product between matrices A and B, i.e., A : B = i,j A ij B ij . Loeper and Rapetti proved that if f ∈ C α (Ω) and the damping parameter τ is taken large enough, the above algorithm converges in C 2,α (Ω) to the (unique up to a constant) solution u for every 0 &lt; α &lt; α. The strategy of their proof is to first show that the sequence {f n } converges monotonically to f in C α (Ω) using an induction argument. With this fact established, the authors resort to some a priori estimates due to Caffarelli <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref> and then employ the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem to conclude that the sequence {u n } is precompact in C 2,α (Ω). From this result, it follows that the whole sequence must converge to the solution of the periodic Monge-Ampère equation. Based upon the above nondiscrete algorithm, Loeper and Rapetti proposed a discrete version using a second order centered finite difference scheme to assemble the two matrices D 2 u n and cof(I d×d +D 2 u n ) and used a BiCG (bi-conjugate gradient) method to solve <ref type="bibr">(2.18)</ref>. Although no convergence analysis was provided for the discrete algorithm, the authors demonstrated that the iterative method converges if a good initial guess is provided.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, Benamou, Froese, and Oberman proposed a simple finite difference method for the two-dimensional Monge-Ampère equation (2.2) based on the standard ninepoint stencil on a uniform Cartesian grid.

The key difference is that in the fully nonlinear case we cannot throw the "hard-to-control" derivatives onto the test function using integration by parts to obtain a variational formulation in a weaker Sobolev space. The L 2 projection method of (1.1) is based upon posing (2.22) in a finite-dimensional setting, using piecewise polynomials as trial and test functions (i.e., finite element functions).

As such, the use of C 1 finite element spaces (i.e., V h ⊂ C 1 ) is required. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, Böhmer considered two cases in parallel: the case where Ω is a convex, polyhedral domain, and the case where ∂Ω ∈ C 2 . In both cases it was shown, using intricate consistency and stability arguments, that there exists a unique solution to (2.23) provided that (i) F has an isolated solution u, and (ii) the Gâteaux derivative of F is invertible and bounded at u. In the case where Ω is a polyhedral domain, optimal order error estimates were also derived provided u is sufficiently smooth. In the second case, that is, ∂Ω ∈ C 2 , due to the variational crimes (i.e., approximation of the boundary), the order of convergence is reduced to at most two.</p><p>Recently, Brenner et al. expanded on these results by proposing and studying an L 2 projection method using C 0 finite element methods as well as discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for the Monge-Ampère equation (2.2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">140]</ref>. As explained in these papers, the guiding principle to deriving convergent finite element methods is to produce schemes such that the discrete linearization (at u) is consistent with the linear and elliptic PDE L u (w) := -∇ • cof(D 2 u)∇(w) , i.e., the linearization of the nonlinear PDE (2.2a). Here, cof(D 2 u) denotes the cofactor matrix of the Hessian D 2 u. In other words, it is desirable that the diagram in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.2 commutes. Note that for C 1 elements, the L 2 projection methods already inherit this commuting property. However, for finite element spaces with less regularity, the resulting methods are less intuitive. For example, the most natural C 0 method for the Monge-Ampère equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">(2.2) is to find a function u h ∈ V h such that T ∈T h T f -det(D 2 u h ) v h dx = 0 ∀v h ∈ V h ∩ H 1 0 (Ω), (2.24)</formula><p>where T h denotes the set of simplexes in the mesh.

With this in hand, they then "delinearize," to obtain finite element approximations of the Monge-Ampère equation.</p><p>We illustrate this idea with an example using C 0 finite elements. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref> In this case, the discretization of the linear operator L u is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">L u,h (w h ), v h = Ω cof(D 2 u)∇w h • ∇v h dx.</formula><p>Integrating by parts and using the divergence-free row property of cofactor matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[76]</ref>, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">L u,h (w h ), v h = - T ∈T h T cof(D 2 u) : D 2 w h v h dx + e∈E i h e cof(D 2 u) ∇w h • n e v h ds,</formula><p>where E i h denotes the set of interior edges in the mesh, w denotes the "jump" of a function w, and B denotes the "average" of a matrix-valued function B.

As such, the authors were able to obtain quasi-optimal energy norm error estimates and L 2 error estimates.</p><p>One of the advantages of the L 2 projection methods is that they can handle curved boundaries and complicated geometries easily in comparison to finite difference methods. Furthermore, due to their polynomial degree flexibility, they have the ability to achieve greater accuracy if the exact solution is sufficiently smooth. That being said, the L 2 projection methods discussed here can be formulated and analyzed only in the case of classical solutions. Although numerical experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> indicate that these methods are convergent for solutions as weak as H 2 (Ω), viscosity solutions in general do not inherit such regularity, and, therefore, the methods fail to converge in the most general setting. Furthermore, there is no uniqueness for the numerical solutions. Therefore, in order to compute the "correct" convex solution of the Monge-Ampère equation, a sufficiently good initial guess has to be given in Newton's method, and such a guess is in general difficult to find.</p></div>

To the best of our knowledge, ALG2 was introduced in the mid-1970s for the numerical solution of nonlinear (possibly nonsmooth and/or nonconvex) variational problems. Recently, ALG2 and closely related algorithms have seen a surge in their popularity under the name of ADMM (for alternating direction methods of multipliers), the main reason being (from our point of view) the applicability of these methods to a large variety of problems from image and data processing, and statistical learning, as shown in, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">129,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">74]</ref> (see also the many references therein). Two important (related) properties of the family of primal-dual algorithms above are their ability to take advantage of the special structure of a problem (decomposition properties in particular) and their modularity.

Similar conclusions can be drawn from the numerical results for problems (3.18) and (3.20) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[69]</ref> for details). A remarkable property of the least squares/operator-splitting methodology is its robustness with respect to the choice of τ , as soon as τ 1. The augmented Lagrangian methodology discussed in section 3.1 does not have this robustness property concerning the choice of the augmentation parameter r. Indeed, unlike some other applications of the augmented Lagrangian methodology (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[97,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">89]</ref>), the choice of r is critical for algorithm (3.9) to achieve good convergence.</p><p>Next, we apply the least squares methodology discussed in sections 3.2.1 to 3.2.3 to the (ill-posed) Monge-Ampère problem (3.21), using the same uniform triangulation T h as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.1 and the criterion u n+1 h u n h 0,h ≤ 10 -7 to stop the iterations.

For all the values of h in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.2, we have u AL,c h u LS,c h 0,h of the order of 10 -5 . This suggests that both functions u AL,c h and u LS,c h are approximations of the same function, namely, the generalized solution u * as mentioned above.</p><p>(ii) To examine the mesh effect, three different triangulations as shown in Figures 3.3 (a), (b), and (c) are considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>. The numerical experiments reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref> lead to the following observations. For the test problems (3.18), <ref type="bibr">(3.19)</ref>, and (3.20) (and other test problems with known exact convex solutions having H 2 (Ω)-regularity), the computed solutions with triangulations of type (a) satisfy uu h 0,h = O(h 2 ) and ∇(uu h ) 0,h = O(h), which are optimal for piecewise linear finite element approximations. On the other hand, the convergence goes from poor, with triangulations of type (c), to very bad, with triangulations of type (b) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref> for details).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Formulation of the Vanishing Moment</head><p>Method. Unlike all the other numerical methods reviewed earlier that are aimed at constructing numerical schemes for computing the solutions of fully nonlinear second order PDEs, the vanishing moment method, which was first introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[84]</ref>, aims to (constructively) approximate any given fully nonlinear second order PDE by a sequence of well-chosen higher order quasi-linear PDEs. Of course, when that is done, the consequence, which is clear and was indeed the motivation for proposing the vanishing moment method, is that the solutions of the higher order PDEs will converge to the weak solution of the underlying fully nonlinear second order PDE. As a result, the latter can be computed via the former by any numerical PDE method mentioned in section 1.3. In other words, the vanishing moment method focuses on approximating a "hard-to-handle" fully nonlinear PDE by an "easier-to-handle" quasi-linear PDE. It does not attach or relate to any particular numerical discretization technique. However, we have already mentioned in section 2.1.5 that the vanishing moment method provides an inspiration (in terms of designing numerical operators) for constructing convergent finite difference and DG methods (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">81]</ref>). In this section, we show that the vanishing moment method also provides much needed capability and an effective way for computing viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear second order PDEs using Galerkin-type numerical methods.</p><p>Let F [u](x) := F (D 2 u(x), ∇u(x), u(x), x) and suppose that -F is an elliptic differential operator in Ω in the sense of <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[93,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 17]</ref>.

On the other hand, physically and mathematically, any extra boundary condition will introduce a so-called boundary layer. A good choice would be one which gives-after space discretization-a boundary layer whose thickness is at most the order of the space discretization mesh size. Based on some heuristic arguments and evidence of numerical experiments (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">142]</ref>), it was concluded that second or higher order boundary conditions are better candidates for the job, and the following additional boundary conditions were recommended:</p><formula xml:id="formula_98">(4.4c) Δu ε = ε or ∂Δu ε ∂n = ε or D 2 u ε n • n = ε on ∂Ω,</formula><p>where n denotes the outward unit normal to ∂Ω. Remark 4.1. We note that the boundary value ε is chosen for convenience to ensure that Δu ε is strictly positive in Ω. The value ε can be replaced by any c ε &gt; 0 satisfying c ε → 0 as ε → 0 + (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83]</ref>). Moreover, our numerical experiments show that the vanishing method works equally well if all boundary conditions in (4.4c) are replaced by the homogeneous boundary conditions (i.e., set c ε = 0).</p><p>To summarize, (one version of) the vanishing moment method consists of approximating the (given) fully nonlinear second order Dirichlet problem (4.1) by the quasilinear fourth order boundary value problem (4.4).

We also remark that when d = 2, if u ε is interpreted as the vertical displacement of a bended plate, then D 2 u ε becomes the moment tensor of the plate. One of the commonly used weak forms of εΔ 2 u ε is ε(D 2 u ε , D 2 v), which is expected to vanish as ε → 0 + .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Theoretical Foundation of the Vanishing Moment Method.</head><p>As we have explained above, conceptually, the vanishing moment method is based on a very simple idea, that is, to approximate a "hard-to-handle" fully nonlinear lower order PDE by a family of "easier-to-handle" quasi-linear higher order PDEs. Clearly, such a limiting process is constructive and consequently, if it works, then it immediately can be utilized to develop all kinds of numerical methods for solving the original "hardto-handle" fully nonlinear PDE. To a large extent, this is the primary motivation for us to introduce the vanishing moment methodology in the first place <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[84]</ref>. We emphasize again that the vanishing moment method is neither attached to nor limited to any numerical discretization technique, although being able to use Galerkin-type numerical methods to solve the "regularized" problem (hence, to solve the original fully nonlinear problem indirectly) was another motivation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[84]</ref>).</p><p>A natural and critical question is whether the vanishing moment method works. Specifically, the following questions need to be answered: (i) Does the limit lim ε→0 + u ε exist and in what sense? (ii) What are the rates of convergence? (iii) Do moment solutions relate to viscosity solutions and how? Clearly all these questions are theoretical PDE questions, and none of them seem easy to answer (especially in general). It should be emphasized that, unlike the vanishing viscosity method <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref>, the higher order vanishing moment approximation (4.4a) does not in general retain the maximum principle enjoyed by the original fully nonlinear second order PDE (4.1a). The loss of the maximum principle makes it much more difficult to derive a priori estimates for u ε . The situation is even worse for the Monge-Ampère-type equations because one would lose the sign control on the fully nonlinear term det D 2 u ε unless, miraculously, u ε itself is a convex function (which turns out to be the case). There are two ways to address the questions above. The first is the scientific computing approach, which means performing many numerical experiments to see if the methodology works in practice, which is indeed the case so far. The other is the traditional theoretical analysis approach, which is necessary in order to give a definitive answer to each of the above question.</p><p>The known theoretical PDE results so far have only been obtained for the Dirichlet Monge-Ampère-type problems, and all the results are uniformly positive in supporting the vanishing moment method as an efficient methodology for approximating the unique (convex) viscosity solution to Monge-Ampère-type problems.

It also reveals the meaning of lim ε→0 + u ε , that is, it should be understood in the pointwise sense with uniform convergence on compact subsets and weak convergence in H 1 . Part (iii) implies that moment solutions are unique and the (convex) moment solution must coincide with the (convex) viscosity solution whenever the latter exists and is unique.</p><p>Once the convergence of u ε has been established, the final theoretical issue concerns the rate(s) of convergence. Before addressing this issue, it should be noted that obtaining rates of convergence is possible only when a function or solution to be approximated has some minimum regularities. This regularity requirement applies not only to discrete or numerical approximations, but also to nondiscrete approximations. It is easy to see that one would not expect any rate of convergence for the vanishing moment method if the viscosity solution u of (4.5) had no regularity beyond C 0 ∩ H 1 , because u itself does not satisfy the PDE in any tangible sense. However, for more regular u, the following rates of convergence were derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83]</ref>.</p><p>Theorem 4.4 (see Theorem 3.19 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83]</ref>).

As expected, radially symmetric counterparts of the above three estimates were also derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83]</ref>.</p><p>In that case all the assumptions on u and u ε stated in the theorem were verified. It is also interesting to note that (4.7c) was obtained using a duality argument in the PDE setting, which is similar to the well-known Aubin-Nitsche duality argument used in the finite element context (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53]</ref>).</p><p>Another interesting feature of the vanishing moment method, which was first discovered accidentally by numerical experiments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[84]</ref> and later proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83]</ref>, is its ability to "pick up" the unique concave solution of the Monge-Ampère problem (4.5) in the case of even dimension (i.e., d is a positive even integer). This can easily be achieved by substituting ε (&gt; 0) with -ε (&lt; 0) in (4.6a). In other words, the penalty parameter ε is driven to zero from the negative side in (4.6a) in order to approximate the concave solution.</p><p>Finally, we note that one of the near-term goals and the focus of current research on the theory of the vanishing moment method is to extend the a priori estimates and the convergence results of Theorems 4.1-4.3 for the radially symmetric case to the general domain case for problem <ref type="bibr">(4.6)</ref>.

The method allows one to approximate a "hardto-handle" fully nonlinear (lower order) PDE by a family of "easy-to-handle" quasilinear (higher order) PDEs. The numerical consequence of this approach is important because it frees up all the well-known numerical PDE methods summarized in section 1.3. In particular, the Galerkin-type methods can be used to solve fully nonlinear second order PDEs. It should be noted that because the vanishing moment method has the built-in capability to select the "right" solution, there is no need to use special grids or special techniques and schemes to discretize the vanishing moment equations. Standard grids and straightforward formulations of these well-known numerical PDE methods are all that is required. Moreover, the vanishing moment method approach allows one to use the wealth of existing computer codes developed for biharmonictype problems to compute viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear second order PDEs. As such, it is relatively easy to implement on computers.</p></div>

We emphasize that this term is independent of the numerical method in question. On the other hand, the second term on the right-hand side of (4.10), which measures the error due to the numerical method, is solely determined by the numerical method in question.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">Mixed Finite Element Methods.</head><p>Since the natural energy space for the vanishing moment equation (4.4a) is H 2 (Ω) (as it was for the augmented Lagrangian and least squares methods discussed in section 3), it is well known <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref> that a conforming finite element subspace of H 2 (Ω) must be a subspace of C 1 (Ω). Constructing such a finite element space has proved to be very delicate and difficult, and only a handful of two-dimensional C 1 finite element spaces are known in the literature (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 6]</ref>). Although it is doable, no three-dimensional C 1 finite element approximations are used in practice because of the large number of degrees of freedom required by the corresponding finite element spaces. Alternatively, mixed finite element methods have been extensively developed and used for solving biharmonic type (and general fourth order) PDEs in two dimensions (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">98]</ref>). Recall that the mixed formulation of (4.4) is based on rewriting this fourth order PDE as a system of two second order PDEs. By decoupling (4.4a) as a system, one is able to approximate (4.4a)-(4.4c) 3 8 using only C 0 finite elements, as opposed to computationally expensive and complicated C 1 finite elements. Another advantage of mixed finite element methods is that although they were originally developed for two-dimensional biharmonic problems, they can be easily extended to the three-dimensional case (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[85]</ref>).</p><p>Several popular mixed formulations for fourth order problems have been described in the literature (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">79]</ref>). However, since the Hessian matrix appears in (4.4a) and (4.6a) in a nonlinear fashion, Δu ε cannot be used as an additional unknown in a mixed formulation. This observation then rules out the popular family of Ciarlet-Raviart mixed finite element methods. On the other hand, it suggests the introduction of σ ε := D 2 u ε as an additional unknown, which then leads to the adoption of either the Hermann-Miyoshi mixed finite element method or the Hermann-Johnson mixed finite element method for solving problem (4.4a)-(4.4c) 3 .</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">83]</ref>, we rewrite (4.4a) as a system of two second order equations</p><formula xml:id="formula_111">σ ε -D 2 u ε = 0, εΔtr(σ ε ) -F [σ ε , u ε ] = 0,</formula><p>where tr(σ ε ) denotes the trace of σ ε and F</p><formula xml:id="formula_112">[σ ε , u ε ](x) := F (σ ε (x), ∇u ε (x), u ε (x), x).</formula><p>Then the Hermann-Miyoshi mixed formulation for (4.4a)-(4.4c) 3 reads as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_113">Find (σ ε , u ε ) ∈ W ε × V g such that Ω σ ε : μ dx + Ω div (μ) • ∇u ε dx = d-1 i=1 ∂Ω ∂g ∂τ i μn • τ i ds ∀μ ∈ W 0 , (4.14a) ε Ω div (σ ε ) • ∇v dx + Ω F [σ ε , u ε ]v dx = 0 ∀v ∈ V 0 , (4.14b)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_114">W ε = μ ∈ W ; μn • n ∂Ω = ε , W 0 = μ ∈ W ; μn • n ∂Ω = 0 , W = μ ∈ H 1 (Ω)] d×d ; μ ij = μ ji , V g = {v ∈ H 1 (Ω); v| ∂Ω = g}, V 0 = H 1 0 (Ω), and {τ i } d-1 i=1</formula><p>denotes an orthogonal (tangent) coordinate frame on ∂Ω.</p><p>Let T h be a quasi-uniform mesh over Ω and denote by V h ⊂ H 1 (Ω) the space of continuous, piecewise polynomials of degree k ≥ 2 over Ω.

(a) Similar to the proof of Theorem 4.5, a nonstandard error analysis technique, which combines the linearization of the nonlinear mixed formulation with a fixed point argument, was utilized. However, the fixed point argument is a lot more complicated than the one used for conforming finite element methods due to a difficulty caused by the discrepancy between σ ε h and D 2 u ε h . Note that D 2 u ε h is not globally defined (in general, it is a measure but not a function).</p><p>(b) Similar to the conforming finite element case, the results of the above theorem have been extended to the general fully nonlinear second order (elliptic) PDE (4.1a) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 4]</ref> under some structure assumptions on the nonlinear function F including the degenerate case. The general framework developed there covers the Monge-Ampère equation, the prescribed Gauss curvature equation, and the infinity-Laplace equation as three special examples.</p><p>(c) As a final comment, we note that since the Hermann-Miyoshi mixed finite element method computes both u ε h and σ ε h , the general perception being that the mixed method is computationally more expensive than conforming finite element methods because it needs to compute an additional unknown σ ε h . However, the numerical experiments reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">83]</ref> all show that the opposite is true. In fact, the Hermann-Miyoshi mixed finite element method is much faster than the Argyris conforming finite element method. For some test problems, the former is 20 times faster than the latter in terms of CPU times. The superiority of the mixed method is most likely due to the simpler structure of its finite element spaces.</p></div>

We observe from Figures 4.1 and 4.3 that u ε r &gt; 0 and Δu ε &gt; 0, which is in accordance with Theorem 4.1. We also see from Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.2 that u ε rr is positive except for an ε-neighborhood of the boundary.

Some Practical Issues. In this final subsection we discuss some practical implementation issues related to the vanishing moment methodology. The first issue is how to solve the discretized equations such as (4.9) and <ref type="bibr">(4.14)</ref>. As these are highly nonlinear algebraic systems, Newton's method would be a natural choice. However, a good initial guess is often required to guarantee the convergence of Newton's method, which is also the case for (4.9) and (4.14). One effective strategy which was developed and used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">83]</ref> is a "multiresolution" or "homotopy" strategy: first compute a numerical solution using a relatively large ε, and then use the computed solution as a starting value for Newton's method at a finer resolution ε. The process may need to be iterated in ε for more than one step. Our experiences show that (i) Newton's method is not sensitive to the initial guess for large values of ε (e.g., ε = 10 -1 ) and (ii) 1-3 steps are sufficient to generate a good starting value for the Newton method at the finest resolution ε at which one wants to compute a solution. Clearly, being able to design such an effective "homotopy" strategy is another advantage of the vanishing moment method. Downloaded 05/21/13 to <ref type="bibr">146.201.208.22</ref>. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php    Another issue which needs to be addressed is the "boundary layer" issue due to the introduction of the extra boundary condition (4.4c) (or its homogeneous variants) As Theorem 4.2 shows, the "boundary layer" is well behaved and contained in an εneighborhood of the physical boundary. Moreover, numerical experiments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">83]</ref> show that the numerical errors in the "boundary layer" are often larger than those Downloaded 05/21/13 to <ref type="bibr">146.201.208.22</ref>. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php in the remaining part of the domain, which is expected. To take advantage of this information, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83]</ref> we proposed an iterative surgical strategy. Roughly speaking, the strategy, which is based on the predictor-corrector idea, involves a three-step surgical procedure: First, cut off the initially computed solution in an ε-neighborhood of the physical boundary; second, extrapolate the computed solution from the inner boundary of the ε-neighborhood to the outer boundary of the ε-neighborhood; third, compute the solution again using the new boundary condition (of the same type) in place of the boundary condition (4.4c). The procedure can be repeated. The second step involves an extrapolating process which projects the discontinuous piecewise polynomial function Δu ε h onto the continuous piecewise linear finite element space. To explain this process in further detail, we let Ω ε ⊂ Ω with dist(Ω ε , Ω) ≈ and denote by {x i } the vertices of the mesh. Let u pre h := u ε h denote a computed solution with the boundary condition (4.4c) (i.e., a "predicted" value), namely, u pre h satisfies for any</p><formula xml:id="formula_127">v h ∈ V h 0 ε Ω Δu pre h Δv h dx - Ω det(D 2 u pre h )v h dx = -f v h dx + ε 2 ∂Ω ∂v h ∂n ds.</formula><p>Using u pre h we construct a piecewise linear function q h ∈ C 0 (Ω) such that for a vertex x i ∈ Ω ε , q h (x i ) equals {Δu pre h }(x i ), the average of Δu h at x i . For x i ∈ Ω\Ω ε , q h (x i ) is set to be {Δu pre h } evaluated at the closest grid point in Ω ε from x i . The third step in the iterative surgical strategy described above is to solve the problem again after replacing ε by q h in (4.4c), that is, we compute a "corrected" solution u cor h by</p><formula xml:id="formula_128">ε Ω Δu cor h Δv h dx - Ω det(D 2 u cor h )v h dx = -f v h dx + ε ∂Ω q h ∂v h ∂n ds</formula><p>for any v h ∈ V h 0 . The numerical tests in <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83]</ref> show that the global error in every norm (i.e., H k -norm for k = 0, 1, 2) is reduced by nearly a factor of 10 just by performing one iteration of the iterative surgical strategy.</p></div>

Monge-Amp ère Problem and Monge-Amp ère Equation. The Monge-Ampère problem, which was described in section 2.1.1, seeks to find a continuous convex function u such that the Monge-Ampère measure M u of u equals a given Radon measure μ. In the case that the Radon measure has a density f (with respect to the Lebesgue measure), the Monge-Ampère problem then reduces to the Monge-Ampère equation det(D 2 u) = f . The Monge-Ampère equation is without question the best-known fully nonlinear second order PDE. It is to fully nonlinear second order PDEs what the Poisson equation is to linear second order PDEs. What we shall see in the remainder of this section is that the Monge-Ampère equation and its variations arise from various applications including astrophysics, computer science, differential geometry, image processing, finance, optimal transportation, and geophysics. From the discussions in sections 2-4, we also see that most numerical methods and algorithms for fully nonlinear second order PDEs have either been specifically designed for the Monge-Ampère equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">147,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">148]</ref> or are applicable to the Monge-Ampère equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">85]</ref>.

Brenier and Benamou <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> proposed a continuum mechanics reformulation for the MK problem with the quadratic cost density function (i.e., p = 2); their method is based on minimizing the kinetic energy subject to the usual mass conservation law and the initial and final conditions for the density ρ. The reformulation was rigorously justified. The problem was then rewritten as a saddle point problem for some Lagrangian after the introduction of an (x, t)-dependent multiplier. The usual augmented Lagrangian method and solvers were used to solve the saddle point problem. At each gradient step, the main tasks consist of solving a Neumann problem for the Laplace equation and solving a convex minimization problem at each space-time grid point. Four numerical experiments concerning various mass transfer problems were presented and all numerical simulations seem satisfactory. In particular, it was shown numerically that the proposed numerical approach was able to find the optimal mass-preserving mapping from a periodic array of Gaussian densities to another one. Barrett and Prigozhin <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed and analyzed a mixed formulation of the MK problem with L 1 cost density function (i.e., p = 1) based on the characterization of the optimality condition of <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[77]</ref>. A finite element approximation using the lowest order Raviart-Thomas element was then constructed and analyzed based on this mixed formulation. The proposed numerical method computes both the optimal transport density and the associated Kantorovich potential. Other computational algorithms Downloaded 05/21/13 to 146.201.208.22.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.">Optimal Transport and Image Registration.</head><p>Image registration is the process of establishing a common geometric frame of reference from two or more data sets from the same or different imaging modalities taken at different times. Multimodal registration proceeds in several steps. First, each image or data set to be matched should be individually calibrated, corrected from imaging distortions, and cleaned of noise and imaging artifacts. Next, a measure of dissimilarity between the data sets must be established, so the closeness of one image to another can be quantified after transformations are applied to them. Similarity measures proposed in the literature include the proximity of redefined landmarks, the distance between contours, and the difference between pixel intensity values. One can extract individual features that have to be matched in each data set. Once features have been extracted from each image, they must be paired with each other, then the similarity measure between the paired features can be formulated as an optimization problem (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[185]</ref> and the references therein).</p><p>During the past few decades, image acquisition devices have undergone rapid development and the huge number of images and their diverse types have attracted intensive research on methods and algorithms for automatic image registration. One such approach, which is closely related to the topic of this article, is based on the MK theory of optimal transport <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[107,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">108,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b187">184]</ref>. In this approach, each image frame is treated as a snapshot of some deformable "elastic body." The goal then becomes to determine the deformation using the properties of the "elastic material." One commonly used property is that of mass-preserving. Minimizing a cost functional, which quantifies the similarity measure between the paired features, among all mass-preserving mappings is exactly the MK optimal (mass) transport problem. As mentioned in section 5.4, for the L 2 cost functional the optimal mass-preserving mapping has a convex potential which satisfies a Monge-Ampère-type fully nonlinear PDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[175]</ref>. After having established this connection between image registration and the MK optimal transport, all the numerical methods and algorithms discussed in section 5.4 can be used to solve image registration problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7.">Optimal</head><p>Transport and Mesh Adaptation. Mesh deformation has been the topic of mathematical research for many years and has gained extreme popularity lately as evidenced by the flux of publications <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">99,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">111,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">165,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37]</ref>. The idea of mesh deformation is simple: redistribute a fixed number of mesh points, while preserving the mesh topology. A driving motivation for mesh deformation arises in the context of adaptive numerical methods, that is, r-adaptivity. In this approach, a fixed number of nodes are positioned to capture salient features of the computed Downloaded 05/21/13 to 146.201.208.22. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php solutions such as shocks, moving interfaces, or other types of sharp variations of the solution and its derivatives. The construction of a deformed mesh can be determined by an invertible transformation, v, which maps a fixed computational domain X into a physical domain Y . A natural strategy for determining v is based on the concept of optimal transport described in section 5.4. The idea is natural, that is, to construct a mass-preserving mapping v such that the resulting mesh is nearest to a uniform mesh. Intuitively, the use of optimal transport to construct meshes is proper, as meshes close to uniform are less likely to have thin and tangled grids, a crucial property in numerical computations. Furthermore, meshes obtained by the optimal transport criteria are irrotational (since curlv = curl∇ϕ = 0 for some convex scalar ϕ), an often desired property of mesh deformation mappings. As explained in section 5.4, the computation of v reduces to solving a Monge-Ampère-type PDE f 2 (∇ϕ) det(D 2 ϕ) = f 1 , where f 1 , f 2 : R d → R are given. As a result, all of the numerical methods designed for the MK problem can be used for mesh adaptation.</p></div>

Moreover, the vanishing moment method is applied to the Monge-Ampère equation (5.11a) to overcome the difficulty caused by the full nonlinearity.

It is proved that the proposed fully discrete finite element method converges with an optimal order rate of convergence.</p></div>

The difficulty with (5.13) is that the equation may lose ellipticity for some pressure fields, which occurs when the right-hand side of the converted Monge-Ampère equation becomes negative or changes sign. In that case, there is no PDE theory to guarantee the existence of solutions. The practice adopted in the meteorology literature for overcoming the difficulty is to preprocess the pressure data such that the processed data makes (5.13) elliptic (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[109,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">155]</ref> and the references therein). Clearly, the practice is very ad hoc and the processed data may produce large errors in the computed velocity field. A few numerical works have been proposed and used in the meteorological community. Due to the difficulty associated with numerically solving the Monge-Ampère equation, most of these methods are ad hoc (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[169]</ref> and the references therein). On the other hand, we note that the vanishing moment method and finite element methods have recently been developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[141]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Concluding Remarks.</head><p>In this article we have presented a review of recent developments in numerical methods for fully nonlinear second order PDEs. Various aspects of this class of PDEs have been discussed in the article, which range from the solution concepts, the main numerical challenges, and successful and unsuccessful approaches to their applications in science and engineering. Our focus is to present different discretization techniques in the literature for this difficult class of PDEs in a concise and easy-to-follow fashion, while related references are given for further reading for the interested reader. Another message we hope we have conveyed in this review is that there is a very strong interplay between PDE analysis and numerical analysis for fully nonlinear second order PDEs. As is the case for linear and quasilinear PDEs, the PDE analysis and theory provide the guidelines and theoretical foundation for developing reliable and efficient numerical methods. On the other hand, numerical solutions and techniques as well as the power of numerical computations provide evidence and hints for discovering and proving better analytical results. This interplay is enhanced for fully nonlinear second order PDEs. The search for reliable and efficient numerical methods not only leads to many difficult and interesting PDE problems, but also expands the boundaries of PDE solution concepts.</p><p>From the relatively large number of works reviewed in this article and from the fact that most of them have appeared very recently, it is clear that research on numerical methods for fully nonlinear second order PDEs has garnered a lot of attention and interest in recent years. Significant progress in both developing new discretization methods and solving real world application problems has been made for this class of difficult problems due to these collective efforts. On the other hand, as a new subarea within numerical PDEs, there are many issues and problems which remain to be addressed and solved, of which we mention the following few.</p><p>As pointed out in section 1.2, the viscosity (weak) solution concept is nonvariational. Instead, it is based on a "differentiation by parts approach." Such a weak solution does not satisfy the underlying PDE in a tangible sense unless the solution is sufficiently regular. An interesting and difficult question is whether it is possible to develop a constructive discrete analogue of the viscosity solution concept and theory (we may call it "a discrete differentiation by parts approach"). If such a discrete analogue could be developed, it might lead to the construction of more efficient numerical methods for fully nonlinear second order PDEs, as the construction is closely guided by and faithfully follows the PDE theory.</p><p>It was emphasized in section 1.4 that no matter which discretization method is used, the resulting algebraic systems are expected to be highly nonlinear due to the full nonlinearity of the underlying PDEs. Solving such a highly nonlinear algebraic system is a challenging problem. In particular, since nonuniqueness and conditional Downloaded 05/21/13 to 146.201.208.22. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php uniqueness are common for fully nonlinear PDEs, the resulting algebraic systems are expected to inherit that nonuniqueness. A successful application of the Newton method requires the availability of a sufficiently good initial guess. How to obtain such a good initial guess is often left unaddressed in the literature, but in many cases providing it can be as difficult as solving the nonlinear algebraic system itself. Consequently, developing robust and efficient fast solvers (such as multigrid and domain decomposition algorithms) becomes a vitally important issue for the solution of fully nonlinear second order PDEs.</p><p>The vanishing moment method discussed in section 4 provides and promises a general systematic approach for numerically solving general fully nonlinear second order PDEs. While its application domain has continued to expand <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">141]</ref>, rigorous proofs of its convergence in most applications still lag behind, and important issues such as "boundary layers" and rates of convergence in a general setting remain to be addressed.</p><p>As it is seen in sections 2-4, some numerical methods reviewed in this article are heuristic. Although numerical experiments show the good performance and promise of the methods, rigorous convergence analysis of these methods remains an open problem. Obviously, such a convergence analysis is not only important but also necessary. Without a doubt, the anticipated convergence analysis is expected to be difficult (at least not easy) because the standard techniques used for analyzing the convergence of numerical methods for linear and quasi-linear PDEs either do not work or do not directly carry over to the fully nonlinear case. Nonstandard and new techniques must be developed to do the job, as exhibited in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">122,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">147]</ref>. It would be extremely desirable to develop a general convergence analysis framework (and a set of new techniques) to serve as a blueprint for carrying out the convergence analysis when a numerical method is constructed.</p><p>Finally, there are many fully nonlinear second order PDE problems that have been either untouched or lightly studied from a numerical viewpoint. Among them, we mention parabolic Monge-Ampère equations and general fully nonlinear second order parabolic PDEs [130, Chapters XIV and XV], k-surface equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[174]</ref>, systems of fully nonlinear second order PDEs, and degenerate and nonelliptic fully nonlinear PDEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">155,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">169]</ref>. As expected, all these problems are very difficult to solve numerically. Their complicated and peculiar structures make them difficult to discretize, and the lack of a well-developed PDE (weak) solution theory makes matters even worse.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>u 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>(x) := (1 + x d )|x | 2(d-1) d , u 2 (x) := |x | + (1 + x d )|x |8 d , where x = (x , x d ) := (x 1 , . . . , x d-1 , x d ) and |x | denotes the Euclidean length of the</figDesc></figure>

Here, Ω 1 = (1/8, 7/8) × (1/8, 7/8) and Ω 2 = (1/4, 3/4) × (1/4, 3/4). These results show that the relation det(D 2 u) = 1 is "almost" satisfied in Ω 2 . Since u c h does not vary much with h, one might wonder what kind of generalized solution is captured by algorithm (3.9). It was discovered in [67, section 4]that algorithm (3.9) (and more generally ALG2) is in fact related to the Uzawa-type algorithms discussed in<ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[89,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">97]</ref>. The numerical results obtained from solving the Monge-Ampère problem (3.21) by algorithm (3.9) suggest that this algorithm solves the Monge-Ampère problem (3.21) in a least squares sense. A plain least squares solution method for the solution of problem (2.2) will be discussed next.</figDesc></figure>

Let Ω = B R (0) ⊂ R d (d ≥ 2), the ball centered at the origin with radius R. Suppose g| ∂Ω = const and f = f (r) with r = |x| satisfying f ∈ C 0 ((0, R)) and f ≥ 0 a.e. in (0, R). Then (4.6) has a unique monotone increasing classical radial solution u ε = u ε (r). Moreover, Δu ε := u ε rr + d-1 r u ε r &gt; 0 in (0, R) for all ε &gt; 0. Furthermore, for any r 0 ∈ (0, R), there exists an ε 0 &gt; 0 such that Δu ε (r) &gt; ε for all r ∈ (r 0 , R) and ε ∈ (0, ε 0 ). Theorem 4.1 contains the main results of Theorems 3.8 and 3.9 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83]</ref>. We remark that the positivity of Δu ε plays a vital role in the whole convergence analysis of u ε . First, it enables us to obtain crucial uniform (in ε) and sharp a priori estimates for u ε ; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 3.11]</ref>. Second, it suggests that u ε may be a convex function itself, which was hoped for but not expected initially. That is indeed the case as described in the following theorem.</p><p>Theorem 4.2 (cf. Theorem 3.12 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83]</ref>). In addition to the assumptions of Theorem 4.1, suppose there exists a positive constant</p><p>then there exist a monotone decreasing sequence {s j } j≥0 ⊂ (0, R) and two corresponding sequences, namely, {ε j } j≥0 ⊂ (0, 1), which is also monotone deceasing, and {r * j } j≥0 ⊂ (0, R) satisfying s j 0 + as j → ∞, and u ε rr (s j ) ≥ 0 and Rr * j = O(ε) such that for each j ≥ 0, u ε is strictly convex in (s j , r * j ) for all ε ∈ (0, ε j ). Part (i) of the above theorem says that in the two-and three-dimensional cases, u ε is either strictly convex in the whole domain Ω or it is "almost" strictly convex in the sense that it is strictly convex in Ω minus an ε-neighborhood of ∂Ω. This possible ε-neighborhood of ∂Ω is exactly the boundary layer which was mentioned in section 4.1. The (surprising) convexity property of u ε shows one of the advantages of the vanishing moment method and explains why the method works efficiently in practice, as it has a built-in mechanism for selecting the "right" solution (i.e., the convex solution). Since the limit of a sequence of convergent convex functions is also a convex function, the vanishing moment method is able to find an inside track for approximating the unique convex viscosity solution of the Monge-Ampère problem and eliminates the daunting challenge of handling the conditional uniqueness of the problem at the discrete level. Moreover, the precise information about the boundary layer has a significant (numerical) consequence because it can be exploited to design an iterative surgical strategy to improve the accuracy of the computed solutions (see below and <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 7]</ref> for more discussions in this direction). Part (ii) of the theorem essentially states that the results of part (i) still hold in four and higher dimensions provided that ε is sufficiently small.</p><p>The above two theorems and the a priori estimates proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 3.11</ref>] then lead to the following convergence results.</p><p>Theorem 4.3 (cf. Theorem 3.13 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[83]</ref>). Suppose the assumptions of Theorem 4.2 still hold. Let u denote the unique convex (classical or viscosity) solution to problem (4.5) and u ε be the monotone increasing classical solution to problem (4.6) proved in Theorem 4.1. Then the following hold:</p><p>(i) u 0 = lim ε→0 + u ε exists pointwise and u ε converges to u 0 uniformly in every compact subset of (0, R) as ε → 0 + . Moreover, u 0 is strictly convex in every compact subset, in particular, in every subinterval of [0, R]. Downloaded 05/21/13 to 146.201.208.22.
