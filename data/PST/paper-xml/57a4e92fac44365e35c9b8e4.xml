<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a very promising encryption technique for secure data sharing in the context of cloud computing. Data owner is allowed to fully control the access policy associated with his data which to be shared. However, CP-ABE is limited to a potential security risk that is known as key escrow problem whereby the secret keys of users have to be issued by a trusted key authority. Besides, most of the existing CP-ABE schemes cannot support attribute with arbitrary state. In this paper, we revisit attribute-based data sharing scheme in order to solve the key escrow issue but also improve the expressiveness of attribute, so that the resulting scheme is more friendly to cloud computing applications. We propose an improved two-party key issuing protocol that can guarantee that neither key authority nor cloud service provider can compromise the whole secret key of a user individually. Moreover, we introduce the concept of attribute with weight, being provided to enhance the expression of attribute, which can not only extend the expression from binary to arbitrary state, but also lighten the complexity of access policy. Therefore, both storage cost and encryption complexity for a ciphertext are relieved. The performance analysis and security proof show that the proposed scheme is able to achieve efficient and secure data sharing in cloud computing.</p></div>

In a CP-ABE, user's secret key is described by an attribute set, and ciphertext is associated with an access structure. DO is allowed to define access structure over the universe of attributes. A user can decrypt a given ciphertext only if his/her attribute set matches the access structure over the ciphertext.</p><p>Employing a CP-ABE system directly into a cloud application that may yield some open problems. Firstly, all users' secret keys need to be issued by a fully trusted key authority (KA). This brings a security risk that is known as key escrow problem. By knowing the secret key of a system user, the KA can decrypt all the user's ciphertexts, which stands in total against to the will of the user. Secondly, the expressiveness of attribute set is another concern. As far as we know, most of the existing CP-ABE schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> can only describe binary state over attribute, for example, "1 -satisfying" and "0 -not-satisfying", but not dealing with arbitrary-state attribute.</p><p>In this paper, the weighted attribute is introduced to not only extend attribute expression from binary to arbitrary state, but also to simplify access policy. Thus, the storage cost and encryption cost for a ciphertext can be relieved. We use the following example to further illustrate our approach.</p><p>Suppose there is a formal structure in university, in which teachers are classified into teaching assistant, lecturer, associated professor and full professor. We distribute the weight of the attribute for each type of the teachers as 1, 2, 3, and 4. Therefore, these attributes can be denoted as "Teacher: 1", "Teacher: 2", "Teacher: 3" and "Teacher: 4", respectively. In this case, they can be denoted by one attribute which has just different weights. In particular, it can be arbitrarystate attributes, such as "Teacher: teaching assistant, lecturer, associate professor, full professor". We here assume that an access policy is represented as: T {("Lecturer" OR "Associate Professor" OR "Full Professor") AND "Male"}, and the existing CP-ABE schemes are executed on the form of access policy T . If our proposed scheme is deployed, the T can be simplified as T ′ {"Teacher: 2" AND "Male"}, since the attribute "Teacher: 2" denotes the minimum level in the access policy and includes {"Teacher: 2", "Teacher: 3" "Teacher: 4"} by default. Therefore, the storage overhead of the corresponding ciphertext and the computational cost used in encryption can be reduced. These two structures are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In addition, our method can be used to express larger attribute space than ever under the same number of attributes. For example, if both the attribute space and weighted set include n elements, the proposed scheme can describe n 2 different possibilities. In contrast, the existing CP-ABE schemes only show 2n possibilities. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Related Work</head><p>In 2005, Sahai and Waters <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> introduced fuzzy identitybased encryption (IBE), which is the seminal work of attributebased encryption (ABE). After that, two variants of ABE were proposed: key-policy ABE (KP-ABE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and CP-ABE <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, depending on if a given policy is associated with either a ciphertext and a key. Later, many CP-ABE schemes with specific features have been presented in the literature. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> presented a novel access control scheme in cloud computing with efficient attribute and user revocation. The computational overhead is significantly eliminated from O(2N ) to O(N ) in user key generation by improving CP-ABE scheme, where N is the number of attributes. The size of ciphertext is approximately reduced to half of original size. However, the security proof of the scheme is not fully given.</p><p>Most of the existing CP-ABE schemes require a full trusted authority with its own master secret key as input to generate and issue the secret keys of users <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Thus, the key escrow issue is inherent, such that the authority has the "power" to decrypt all the ciphertexts of system users. Chase et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> presented a distributed KP-ABE scheme to solve the key escrow problem in a multi-authority system. In this approach, all authorities, which are not colluded with each other, are participating in the key generation protocol in a distributed way, such that they cannot pool their data and link multiple attribute sets belonging to the same user. Because there is no centralized authority with master secret information, all attribute authorities should communicate with others in the system to create a user's secret key. But, a major concern of this approach is the performance degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. It results in O(N 2 ) communication overhead on both the system setup phase and any rekeying phase. It also requires each user to store O(N 2 ) additional auxiliary key components in addition to the attribute keys, where N is the number of authorities in the system. Chow <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> later proposed an anonymous private key generation protocol for IBE where a KA can issue private key to an authenticated user without knowing the list of the user's identities. It seems that this approach can properly be used in the context of ABE if attributes are treated as identities. However, this scheme cannot be adopted for CP-ABE, since the identity of user is a set of attributes which is not publicly unknown.</p><p>In 2013, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> provided an improved security data sharing scheme based on the classic CP-ABE <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The key escrow issue is addressed by using an escrow-free key issuing protocol where the key generation center and the data storage center work together to generate secret key for user. Therefore, the computational cost in generating user's secret key increases because the protocol requires interactive computation between the both parties.</p><p>Besides, Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> presented a fine-grained access control scheme with attribute hierarchy, where <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> are built on top of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, respectively. In the schemes, the attributes are divided into multiple levels to achieve fine-grained access control for hierarchical attributes, but the attributes can only express binary state. Later, Fan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed an arbitrary-state ABE to solve the issue of the dynamic membership management. In this paper, a traditional attribute is divided to two parts: attribute and its value. For example, the traditional attributes can be denoted as {"Doctor","Professor","Engineer"}. The improved attributes are denoted as: {Career: "Doctor","Professor","Engineer"}, where "Career" represents an attribute and "Doctor","Professor" and "Engineer" denote the values of the attribute "Career". Accordingly, the computation cost for attributes is more expensive than that of the traditional schemes under the same number of attributes.</p><p>We note that there are some other research works on CP-ABE, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Nevertheless, they leverage different techniques to achieve data sharing. We will not compare them with our present system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Our Contributions</head><p>Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, we propose an attribute-based data sharing scheme for cloud computing applications, which is denoted as ciphertext-policy weighted ABE scheme with removing escrow (CP-WABE-RE). It successfully resolves two types of problems: key escrow and arbitrary-sate attribute expression. The contributions of our work are as follows:</p><p>• we propose an improved key issuing protocol to resolve the key escrow problem of CP-ABE in cloud computing.</p><p>The protocol can prevent KA and CSP from knowing each other's master secret key so that none of them can create the whole secret keys of users individually. Thus, the fully trusted KA can be semi-trusted. Data confidentiality and privacy can be ensured. • we present weighted attribute to improve the expression of attribute. The weighted attribute can not only express arbitrary-state attribute (instead of the traditional binary state), but also reduce the complexity of access policy. Thus the storage cost of ciphertext and computation complexity in encryption can be reduced. Besides, it can express larger attribute space than ever under the same condition. Note that the efficiency analysis will be presented in Section V.</p><p>• we conduct and implement comprehensive experiment for the proposed scheme. The simulation shows that CP-WABE-RE scheme is efficient both in terms of computation complexity and storage cost. In addition, the security of CP-WABE-RE scheme is also proved under the generic group model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Access Structure</head><p>Let {P 1 , . . . , P n } be a set of parties. A collection A ⊆ 2 {P1,...,Pn} is monotone if ∀B, C: if B ∈ A and B ⊆ C then C ∈ A. An access structure (respectively, monotone access structure) is a collection (respectively, monotone collection) A of non-empty subsets of {P 1 , . . . , P n }, i.e., A ⊆ 2 {P1,...,Pn} \{∅}. The sets in A are called authorization sets. Otherwise, the sets are called unauthorization sets.</p><p>In our scheme, the role of the parties is taken by the attributes. Thus, A is going to include the authorized sets of attributes. Generally, unless stated in another way, the scheme uses an access structure which is a monotone access structure.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Weighted Access Tree</head><p>Let T be a weighted access tree, where root node of the tree is R. To facilitate description of the access tree, several functions and terms are defined as follows. ,QGH[ N % \ Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. An example of weighted access tree structure.</p><p>• x denotes a node of tree T . If x is a leaf node, it denotes an attribute with weight. If x is a non-leaf node, it denotes a threshold gate, such as "AND", "OR" and "nof-m (n&lt;m)". For example, the nodes C and A denote a threshold gate and an attribute respectively in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. • num x denotes the number of x's children in T . For example, num R = 2 in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p><p>• k x denotes threshold value of node x, where 0 &lt; k x ≤ num x . When k x = 1 and x is a non-leaf node, it is an OR gate. When k x = num x and x is a non-leaf node, it is an AND gate. In particular, if x is a leaf node, k x = 1. For example, k R = 1 and k C = 2 denote an OR gate and an AND gate respectively in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. • parent(x) represents the parent of the node x in T . For example, parent(A) = C in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. • att(x) denotes an attribute associated with the leaf node x in T . • index(x) returns an unique value associated with the node x, where the value is assigned to x for a given key in an arbitrary manner. • T x denotes the sub-tree of T rooted at the node x. If a set of weighted attribute S satisfies the access tree T x , we denote it as T x (S) = 1. T x (S) is recursively computed as follows. If x is a non-leaf node, T x (S) returns 1 if and only if at least k x children return 1. If x is a leaf node, then T x (S) returns 1 if and only if the weight of attribute ω x from S must be greater than or equal to the weight of the leaf node. That is weight(ω x ) ≥ weight(att(x)). In addition, Morillo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> proved that every weighted value of the threshold access structure can be defined as a natural number. Unless stated otherwise, the value of weight is a natural number in this paper. In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the access policy is denoted as: {("Teacher:1" And "Seniority:2") OR "Teacher:3"}. If one possesses attributes ("Teacher", "Seniority") with weight ("1", "2"), he can satisfy the tree in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>; If the other one who possesses attribute ("Teacher") with weight ("4"), he can also satisfy the access tree.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. THE PROPOSED CP-WABE-RE SCHEME</head><p>In this section, we present the construction of CP-WABE-RE system, including five procedures: system initialization, new file creation (data encryption), new user authorization (user key generation), data file access (data decryption), and data file deletion. In addition, the revocation scheme of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> can be directly used in our proposed scheme. The reason is described as below. The revocation scheme is performed in the phase of data encryption. And the removing escrow is operated in the phase of user key generation. Therefore, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the modification of removing escrow does not affect the use of revocation scheme since they are run in different phases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. System Initialization</head><p>Let G 0 be a bilinear group of prime order p, and g be a generator of G 0 . Let ê : G 0 × G 0 → G T denote the bilinear map. Let H : {0, 1} * → G 0 be a hash function. For any i ∈ Z p and a set S = {s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s m ∈ Z p }, the Lagrange coefficient ∆ i,S = ∏ l∈S,l̸ =i (x -l)/(i -l). In addition, an universe of attribute set A = {a 1 , . . . , a n } and a set of weights W = {ω 1 , . . . , ω n }(ω 1 ≤ . . . ≤ ω n ) are defined. Thus the system contains n 2 weighted attributes which are Ã = {a 1 : ω 1 , . . . , a 1 : ω n , . . . , a n : ω 1 , . . . , a n : ω n }, where the higher hierarchy of attributes is used, the bigger weighted value is distributed.</p><p>(1) KA.Setup(1 κ ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS</head><p>In this section, we analyze and compare the efficiency of the proposed scheme with the schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> in theoretical and experimental aspects. <ref type="table">I</ref> shows the problem of key escrow, feature of weighted attribute and application in cloud computing for each scheme. The key escrow in CP-WABE-RE scheme can be removed by using an improved key issuing protocol for cloud computing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> uses escrow-free key issuing protocol to solve the issue. On the contrary, both <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> don't solve the problem of key escrow. In addition, the weighted attribute in CP-WABE-RE scheme can not only support arbitrary-state attribute instead of the traditional binary state, but also simplify access policy associated with a ciphertext as opposed to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Unfortunately, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> can only express arbitrary-state attribute, and cannot simplify the access structure. In Table <ref type="table">I</ref>, we can find that only CP-WABE-RE scheme can simultaneously support all the three functions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> solves the problem of key escrow so it can satisfy environment of cloud system as ours. However, both <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> cannot remove key escrow. Thus the both schemes cannot be directly applied in cloud computing. 2) Efficiency: In Table <ref type="table">II</ref> and Table <ref type="table">III</ref>, we compare efficiency of the above four schemes on storage overhead and computation cost in theory, where the used symbols are defined in Table <ref type="table">IV</ref>.</p></div>

In addition, the cost of transmission isn't involved when implementing the interactive protocols in both <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and our proposed scheme. In Table <ref type="table">II</ref>, the schemes are compared in terms of CT size, SK size, PP size and MSK size. CT size represents the storage overhead in cloud computing and also implies the communication cost from DO to CSP, or from CSP to users. SK size denotes the required storage cost for each user. PP and MSK sizes represent the storage overhead of KA and CSP in terms of public parameter and master secret key.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>, when ω i = ω i1 , all attributes possess equal weights in CP-WABE-RE scheme. Thus our scheme is equivalent to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Meanwhile, CT size is reduced as (|A C | + 1)L G0 + L GT in CP-WABE-RE scheme, which is equal to <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>'s. Comparing with <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the CT size in our proposed scheme and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> is reduced by nearly half. When ω i ̸ = ω i1 , CP-WABE-RE scheme can use an attribute to express (ω i -ω i1 + 1) attributes which have different weights. Therefore, it requires smaller storage cost in CT than the others. Moreover, we can find that the SK size in CP-WABE-RE scheme is equal to <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>'s, which is smaller than <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>'s and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>'s. Furthermore, when |A u | → ∞, the storage overhead in our scheme is reduced by nearly half comparing to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>'s. And the storage cost in our scheme is decreased nearly by 66.67% comparing to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>'s in theory. In addition, we can also observe that the PP size is equal among <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and CP-WABE-RE scheme. And the size of PP in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is the longest since it is related to the number of system attributes n and the number of system users k. About the size of MSK, we can find that the parameter in CP-WABE-RE scheme doesn't appear to be much different from the others.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table">III</ref>, we evaluate the computation cost of encryption, decryption and user key generation.

In the phase of file access (data decryption), the length of parameter is equal among <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and CP-WABE-RE scheme. And the computation cost on decryption in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is larger than the others. In addition, in the phase of new user authorization (user key generation), our proposed scheme only consumes additional 6G 0 of computation cost in solving key escrow issue, comparing with that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Meanwhile, the computation cost on key generation in CP-WABE-RE scheme is smaller than <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>'s and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>'s. Furthermore, when |A u | → ∞, the computation cost in ours is decreased nearly by 50% in theory than <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>'s, where the cost for transmission isn't involved in both the two schemes. At the same time, the cost in ours is reduced by nearly 75% comparing to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>'s in theory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.

The following experiments are conducted using Java on the system with Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4590 CPU at 3.30 GHz and 8.00GB RAM running Windows 7. To achieve a 80-bit security level, the experiments use a 160-bit elliptic curve group based on the supersingular curve y 2 = x 3 + x over a 512-bit finite field.

We find that the storage overhead of user secret key in ours is the same as <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>'s, and it is smaller than <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>'s and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>'s under the same number of attributes. About the computation cost of secret key, the value of our scheme is larger than <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>'s, where the difference is 6G 0 according to the Table <ref type="table">III</ref>. At the same time, the parameter in CP-WABE-RE scheme is smaller than <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>'s and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>'s at the same condition. We also observe that all experimental results are gradually increasing and approximately follow a linear relationship with the number of weighted attributes. Therefore, with a small error tolerance, we estimate their limit values, where the mathematical expressions are computed by using the mean algorithm. When N → ∞, the limit value of space saving in CP-WABE-RE scheme is approximately equal to 48.39% comparing to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>'s.

Comparing with both our scheme and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the saved storage cost is approximately 64.47% which matches the corresponding limit value in theory. In addition, when N → ∞, comparing with CP-WABE-RE scheme and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the maximum of improved efficiency in computation cost approaches to 23.04%. Comparing with our scheme and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the reduced computation cost is approximate to 64.88% in Fig.  Remarkably, the cost comes from the difference between theoretical value and experimental result.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6(b). However, in</head><p>2) Simulation Analysis of Weighted Attribute: Next, we measure and analyze the storage overhead and computation cost for encrypting (by a DO) data, where the number of attributes in access policy is N = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}. It should be noted that the CP-WABE-RE scheme is equivalent to the schemes in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> when all attributes possess equal weights (ω i = ω i1 ), where it has been analyzed in Table <ref type="table">II</ref> and Table <ref type="table">III</ref>. For simplicity, we have omitted the simulation when ω i = ω i1 .

Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>(a) plots the relationship between the storage overhead of ciphertext and the number of weighted attributes in access policy. Fig. <ref type="figure">7(b)</ref> shows encryption time of ciphertext versus the number of weighted attributes. When ω i ̸ = ω i1 (here we assume that an attribute can be represented 5 attributes which possess different weights), we find that CP-WABE-RE scheme requires less storage cost and encryption time than the others.</p><p>We also observe that all results approximately follow a linear relationship with the number of weighted attributes in access tree. Similar as the analysis of Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, we estimate the limit values with a small error tolerance, where the mathematical expressions are computed by using the mean algorithm. For example, in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>(a), when N → ∞, comparing with CP-WABE-RE scheme and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the limit value of space saving is approximately equal to 52.60%. Similarly, the reduced storage cost in ciphertext is 11.77% comparing our scheme to <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. And comparing with <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, our proposed scheme can save storage cost approximate to 51.71%. In addition, the reduced storage cost in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> approaches to 46.28% comparing to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>(b), when N → ∞, CP-WABE-RE scheme can save computation cost approximate to 61.68% comparing with <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, where the computation cost associated with a ciphertext in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> is approximately equal to <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>'s and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>'s. It indicates that the results are consistent with the theoretical analysis presented in previous subsection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. SECURITY PROOF</head><p>We first present the chosen plaintext attacks (CPA) security proof of our CP-WABE-RE scheme. The security game is identical to those of traditional (fully) CP-ABE systems. We state here the definition of an adaptive CP-ABE security game for the completeness of the security analysis. We use the generic bilinear group model and the random oracle model to prove that no adversary can break the CPA security of our scheme with non-negligible probability. In other words, our security is reduced to mathematical properties of elliptic curve groups as well as security of target collision resistance hash function. We note that our security proof technique follows that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Consider two random encodings ξ 0 , ξ 1 of an additive group F p , which is injective maps ξ 0 , ξ 1 : F p → {0, 1} m , where m &gt; 3log(p). We set G 0 = {ξ 0 (x) : x ∈ F p } and G T = {ξ 1 (x) : x ∈ F p }. In the security game, the simulator is given a random oracle for simulating hash function, and oracles in groups G 0 , G T and bilinear map ê : G 0 × G 0 → G T for computation queries. We are also given a random oracle to represent the hash function H. And we refer to G 0 as a generic bilinear group. Below, we give a lower bound on the advantage of a generic adversary in breaking the security of our scheme.</p><p>Theorem 1. For any adversary A, let q be a bound on the total number of group elements which A receives from queries to the oracles for the hash function, groups G 0 , G T , the bilinear map ê and from its interaction with the security game, in which G 0 is bilinear group of prime order p with generator g. We have that the advantage of A in the game is O(q 2 /p).</p><p>Proof. In the challenge phase of a CP-ABE game, the simulator will construct either M 0 ê(g, g) αs or M 1 ê(g, g) αs as the component C. Here, we consider a modified game where C is either ê(g, g) αs or ê(g, g) θ , and θ ∈ R F p . Now, the adversary is required to tell if C = ê(g, g) αs or ê(g, g) θ . It is not difficult to see that the modified game can be regarded as a hybrid argument in which the adversary is asked to tell ê(g, g) θ from M 0 ê(g, g) αs , and ê(g, g) θ from M 1 ê(g, g) αs . Accordingly, an adversary in the CP-ABE game with advantage ϵ is transformed into an adversary A in the modified game with advantage at least ϵ 2 . Below we let g = ξ 0 (1), g x = ξ 0 (x) and ê(g, g) x = ξ 1 (x).</p><p>1) System Initi. The simulator chooses α 1 α 2 , β ∈ R F p , and next sets h = g β , u 1 = ê(g, g) α1 , v 1 = g α1 , u 2 = ê(g, g) α2 , v 2 = g α2 and α = α 1 + α 2 . It further sends the PP = {g, h, u = u 1 u 2 } to A. 2) Hash Queries. If A issues a hash query on an attribute att(y), the simulator returns g ti and stores (t i , att(y)) into List H , where t i ∈ R F p . 3) Key Queries. Here we combine the simulations of the algorithms CSP.KeyGen and KA.KeyGen as one key query. We note that it will not bring additional advantage for A in winning the game. When A queries a user i's secret key for an attribute set S, the simulator works as follows. It chooses r i , w j ∈ R F p , and computes D = g α g βri , L = g ri , ∀ j ∈ S : D j = H(j) riwj . The simulator finally sends the secret key to A and stores (SK, i, S) into List SK . 4) Challenge. A outputs two equal length messages M 0 , M 1 ∈ G T and an access tree A to the simulator, where there should not be any secret key issued to A such that the key satisfies A. The simulator chooses a s ∈ R F p , and next uses linear secret sharing technique to construct shares λ y of s for all attributes y in A as in the algorithm DO.Encrypt, where λ y is uniformly and independently random in F p , and λ y can be seen as a linear combination of independent random variables (in F p ) and s. The simulator then chooses θ ∈ R F p , and sets C = ê(g, g) θ , C = g s , ∀ y ∈ Y, i ∈ [1, n], C y = g βλi H(att(y)) -wis , and ∀j ∈ (1, n], C y,j = H(att(y)) -(wj -wi)s , where w i , w j ∈ R F p . The simulator sends the challenge ciphertext to A.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>5) Key Queries. Same as the previous key queries phase but with the restriction that the querying key cannot satisfy A. 6) Guess. A outputs a guess bit. Below we consider unexpected collision. An oracle query can be seen as a rational function ϑ = η/ψ in the variables θ, α, β, t i , w i , r i , λ i and s. Suppose there are two distinct rational functions ϑ = η/ψ and ϑ ′ = η ′ /ψ ′ . An unexpected collision event indicates that taking two different queries corresponding to the two functions, we have the same output due to random choice of variables. If the event happens, it means that ϑ = ϑ ′ , and further ηψ ′ -η ′ = 0. By the Schwartz-Zippel Lemma in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, the probability of the event is O(1/p). Therefore, the probability of a collision event is at most O(q 2 /p). Accordingly, the unexpected collision will not occur in the simulations with probability 1 -O(q 2 /p).</p><p>Remember that each group element is uniformly and dependently chosen in the above simulations. A can tell the difference between θ and αs elements in G T if there are two distinct queries ϑ and ϑ ′ leading to the same output. Assume ϑ ′ = γ ′ θ and ϑ = γαs, we have ϑ -ϑ ′ = γαs -γ ′ θ such that γ ′ θ + ϑ -ϑ ′ = γαs, where γ and γ ′ are non-zero constant. We will show that A cannot construct a query for γαs in G T .</p><p>We here observe all possible rational function queries in G T by means of bilinear map and the group elements given to A. It can be seen that A can obtain a transcript {g, g β , g s , g βλi g -tiwis , g -(wj -wi)sti , g α g βr , g r , g rwiti } from one query. For another transcript, we set it as {g, g β , g s ,</p><p>We first ignore g β since the elements with α will be tagged with β which is irrelevant to αs. To output a factor αs, we should focus on elements with factors α and s. It is not difficult to see that there are three types of outputs with αs in G T from two transcripts. One is αs + βrs (resp. αs + βr ′ s). To output γαs, we need an element βrs. However the element does not exist. The second format with αs is (-w j + w i )t i αs + (-w j + w i )st i βr ′ (resp. (-w j ′ + w i ′ )t i ′ αs + (-w j ′ + w i ′ )st i ′ βr). To eliminate the part right after +, we need to concentrate on the elements with t i . The elements with βλ i -t i w i s, and rw i t i fail to construct a cancel-out part as they are lack of a factor w j . For the element -(w j -w i )st i , we need an element with βr ′ (resp. βr). But none of other elements satisfy our requirement. The last format with αs is</p><p>If we cannot find elements to cancel out all of terms except for that of αs, it indicates that A fails to construct γαs. For simplicity, we only check with the last term αβλ i . It can be seen that α+βr is the only element with α. Thus, we need a βλ i term. Nevertheless, the term does not exist.</p><p>From the above observation, we can therefore state that A fails to construct the query form γαs.</p><p>In addition, an improved key issuing protocol is proposed to resolve the key escrow problem of CP-ABE in cloud computing. In this paper, we assume that they do not collude with each other to share their master secret keys. We say that our proposed key issuing protocol is secure when the following two aspects are satisfied. The first one is that the KA cannot derive the user secret key if the CSP is honest. The other is that the CSP cannot derive the user secret key while the KA is honest. Security analysis about the protocol is described as below.</p><p>Theorem 2. The proposed key issuing protocol in section IV-C is a secure protocol for computing g α h r by KA and CSP. Assume that the underlying arithmetic 2PC and zero knowledge proofs are secure, and (for security against corrupt CSP) that DDH is hard.</p><p>To show the security we consider the cases of corrupting KA and corrupting CSP respectively.</p><p>(1) For a corrupted KA, our simulator proceeds as follows: Sim C : First, it will run the arithmetic 2PC simulator for computation of (α 1 + α 2 )β. In the process, it will extract α 1 . Next, the simulator will choose random values X 1 ∈ G 0 , and send it to KA. It will receive Y 1 and Y 2 from the adversary KA, and two corresponding zero knowledge proofs. We will extract β and r from the corresponding proofs. Then, it will send α 1 , β and r to the trusted party, and receive g α2 •g α1+βr = g α+βr , which will be CSP's secret key output.</p><p>Consider a hybrid simulator Hyb C that takes as input of CSP's secret α 2 . It first runs the arithmetic 2PC simulator for the computation of x with the correct output value according to α 2 . Then the simulator completes the protocol as the honest CSP would do. This is clearly indistinguishable from the real CSP's protocol by the security of the arithmetic 2PC. Now, assuming that the proof of knowledge scheme is secure, Hyb C should be indistinguishable from the above simulator Sim C . This is because the value X 1 used by Sim C will be distributed identically to those in Hyb C . (Since ρ 1 is chosen at random in the real protocol, X 1 will be distributed uniformly over G 0 in the real protocol as in the simulated protocol.) Thus, interaction with our simulation is indistinguishable from interaction with an honest CSP.</p><p>(2) For a corrupted CSP, our simulator proceeds as follows: Sim K : it will run the arithmetic 2PC simulator for computation of (α 1 + α 2 )β. This 2PC will extract α 2 from CSP and output x = (α 2 + α 1 )β mod p. We will choose a random value x ∈ Z p , and give it to the arithmetic 2PC simulator. Note that this is correctly distributed, since there is some β such that x = (α 2 + α 1 )β mod p for any x, α 1 , α 2 . Next, our simulator will receive X 1 from the adversary, and the corresponding zero knowledge proof. ρ 1 is extracted by the proof system. We will select random values Y 1 , Y 2 ∈ G 0 , and send them to CSP. (Again, this will be distributed exactly as in a real execution.) We will receive X 2 from the adversary, and use the corresponding proof to extract ρ 2 . Then, it will send α 2 to the trusted party, and receive D = g α2 • g α1+βr = g α+βr . Finally, it will compute Y 3 = D ρ2 and send it to CSP.</p><p>Consider a hybrid simulator Hyb K that takes as input of KA's secrets α 1 , β and r. It will compute x = (α 2 + α 1 )β using the arithmetic 2PC simulator. When the 2PC simulator provides α 2 and asks for output, it will correctly compute (α 2 + α 1 )β. Then it will complete the execution as in the real protocol. This protocol is clearly indistinguishable from the real KA's protocol by security of the arithmetic 2PC.</p><p>1556-6013 (c) 2015 IEEE.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>12</head><p>In addition, we consider a second hybrid Hyb ′ K which is the same as the Hyb K to proceed the above protocol, but which uses the zero-knowledge simulator for all proofs of knowledge. This must be indistinguishable by the zeroknowledge property of the proof system. Here we only need show that the Hyb ′ K is indistinguishable from the interaction with the above simulator.</p><p>Consider the reduction from DDH assumption: Given g, A = g a , B = g b , C = g c , and we must decide whether c = ab or c ∈ R Z p . Here we define X 1 = A = g a and h = g σ for σ ∈ R Z p . As the Sim K , we run the arithmetic 2PC simulator for computation of (α 1 + α 2 )β and extraction α 2 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we redesigned an attribute-based data sharing scheme in cloud computing. The improved key issuing protocol was presented to resolve the key escrow problem. It enhances data confidentiality and privacy in cloud system against the managers of KA and CSP as well as malicious system outsiders, where KA and CSP are semi-trusted. In addition, the weighted attribute was proposed to improve the expression of attribute, which can not only describe arbitrarystate attributes, but also reduce the complexity of access policy, so that the storage cost of ciphertext and time cost in encryption can be saved. Finally, we presented the performance and security analyses for the proposed scheme, in which the results demonstrate high efficiency and security of our scheme.</p></div>			</div>
