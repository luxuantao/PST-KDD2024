<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) is a promising solution to energy-and spectrum-efficient Internet of Things (IoT) with stringent power and cost constraints. In an AmBC system, recovering the tag information at the reader however is a challenging task due to the difficulty in acquiring the relevant channel state information (CSI). To eliminate the need to estimate the CSI, in this paper, we propose a label-assisted transmission (LAT) framework, in which two known labels are transmitted from the tag before data transmission. By exploring the received signal constellation information, we propose modulation constrained (MC) expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, based on which two detection methods are developed. One method, referred to as constellation learning with labeled signals (CL-LS), learns the parameters by clustering the labeled signals and recovers the unlabeled signals by the learnt parameters. The other method, referred to as constellation learning with labeled and unlabeled signals (CL-LUS), uses all received signals in clustering. Efficient initialization techniques are provided for the two clustering algorithms. Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed constellation learning methods achieve comparable performance as the optimal detector with perfect CSI.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Connecting massive devices through Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the critical applications for the 5th generation (5G) and future wireless communication systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Three aspects need to be considered when designing IoT: energy efficiency, spectrum efficiency, and cost efficiency. Backscatter communication (BackCom), in which the transmitter uses passive radio technology without requiring active radio-frequency (RF) components such as digital-to-analog converter, up-converter and power amplifier, has emerged as a promising solution to green IoT due to its low power consumption and low implementation cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>The existing BackCom systems can be categorized into three types: monostatic backscatter communication (MoBC) system, bistatic backscatter communication (BiBC) system, and ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) system <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. A MoBC system consists of two components: a reader and a tag. The reader generates sinusoidal RF carrier to activate the tag, and then the tag modulates its information bits over the carrier by intentionally varying its reflection coefficients. Finally, the reader recovers the tag information from the signal backscattered from the tag. Due to the round-trip path loss, the MoBC system is only suitable for short-range applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. To extend the communication range between the tag and the reader, a BiBC system adds on a carrier emitter component which is deployed close to the tag. The communication range for BiBC can be up to 130 meters with 20 milliwatts of carrier power <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> studied noncoherent short-packet detection with frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulated tag. AmBC is a new-born technology in which the tag harvests energy and modulates its information bits over ambient RF signals emitted from, e.g., TV towers, cellular base stations, and Wi-Fi access points (APs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Since the AmBC system shares spectrum with legacy systems, and does not require dedicated RF emitter, it has recently attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry for its power efficiency, spectrum saving, and low implementation cost.</p><p>In an AmBC system, the reader receives two types of signals: a direct-link signal from the RF source and a backscatter-link signal from the tag. Due to the round-trip path loss, the backscatter link signal is much weaker than the direct-link signal. In addition, the ambient RF source signal is modulated and the pilot information is generally unknown to the reader. Therefore, it is a critical challenge for the AmBC system to recover the tag symbols. The transceiver design for AmBC systems has been actively studied in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. There are two models considered for AmBC systems, namely, cooperative AmBC and non-cooperative AmBC. The main idea of cooperative AmBC is that the reader is able to acquire the knowledge of the direct-link signal so that the directlink signal can be cancelled prior to the detection of the tag symbols <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the reader is integrated in the legacy transmitter, and the direct-link signal is cancelled by using self-interference cancellation techniques. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the reader recovers both the RF source symbols and the tag symbols using successive interference cancellation (SIC). Yet, cooperative AmBC is not always doable, especially when the reader is geographically separated from the legacy transceiver.</p><p>In non-cooperative AmBC, the reader has very limited knowledge of the RF source signal, and the CSI is difficult to acquire due to the non-cooperation between the reader and the legacy transceiver. As such, noncoherent detection such as energy detection is commonly used to recover the tag symbols <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. For example, the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> employed an energy detector with differential coding to recover the tag symbols. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> analyzed the BER performance of the energy detector with differential coding. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> adopt joint energy detection, in which the authors exploit the differential coding characteristics for better performance. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, tag pilots are transmitted to assist tag-symbol recovery based on energy detection.</p><p>The energy detection, however, generally suffers from performance loss since it loses all the phase information in the received signals. As inspired by the successful applications of clustering techniques in conventional BackCom <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, we rethink the AmBC transceiver design by taking a data-driven approach to extract useful features from the received signals of the reader. These features can then be used to effectively classify the tag symbols. As an exemplary work following this idea, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> extracted the energy features from the received signals at the singleantenna reader for tag-symbol classification.</p><p>In this paper, we generalize the single-antenna model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> to accommodate multiple antennas equipped at the reader for diversity harvesting. More importantly, we propose to explore the modulation information of the RF source in the AmBC receiver design, rather than simply rely on the energy levels of the received signals for tagsymbol recovery. With signal modulation at the RF source and at the tag, the received signals of the reader naturally fall into clusters, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. This inspires us to employ clustering algorithms in machine learning for tag symbol identification. Specifically, we propose a label assisted transmission (LAT) framework for packet transmission, where the tag embeds two known labels in each data packet prior to data transmission. We show that the received signals follow a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and can be clustered by using the standard GMMbased expectation maximization (EM) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>The standard EM algorithm treats the centroids of the clusters as independent variables. However, it can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> that the centroids of the clusters are related to each other based on the modulation constellations used at the RF source and the tag. Such information can be utilized in the EM algorithm for performance enhancement. Therefore, we assume a minimal amount of cooperation between the RF source and the reader, i.e., the modulation technique used at the RF source is a priori known by the reader. Based on that, we develop parameterized constellation representation to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated in the EM algorithm, with the resulting algorithm termed modulation constrained (MC) EM. We propose two MC-EM based detection schemes, namely, the constellation learning scheme with labelled signal (CL-LS) and the constellation learning scheme with both labelled and unlabelled signals (CL-LUS). The CL-LS scheme performs clustering only based on the labelled signals, and then recovers the unlabelled signals using the learnt parameters. The CL-LUS scheme performs clustering based on labelled and unlabelled signals together, and hence generally achieves a better performance than the CL-LS scheme (nonetheless, at the cost of a slightly higher computational complexity). Furthermore, we discuss how to efficiently initialize the two schemes, so as to avoid the undesirable local minima of the MC-EM algorithms.</p><p>In a nutshell, the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:</p><p>• We extend the AmBC system model from the singlereceive-antenna scenario to the multiple-receiveantenna scenario, and propose two MC-EM based schemes, namely, CL-LS and CL-LUS, for tag symbol detection without requiring any knowledge of the CSI. • We show that, with the knowledge of the modulation constellation of the RF source, the number of parameters to be estimated in the MC-EM based schemes can be significantly reduced, which consequently leads to a considerable performance improvement compared to the standard EM algorithm. • We further show that the MC-EM based schemes are prone to be trapped in local optima, which is a common problem for EM algorithms. In this regard, we propose efficient initialization techniques for the proposed MC-EM based schemes to avoid undesirable local optima.</p><p>• Finally, we show that with appropriate initialization, the proposed CL-LUS scheme can achieve a performance close to that of the optimal detection with perfect CSI. Related Works: As aforementioned, clustering techniques have been previously used in the conventional Backcom system <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> to separate coded signals from multiple tags, where the RF source signal is a continuous single-carrier wave. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, the received signals are first clustered by using the density based clustering algorithm, and then bipartite grouping is performed to extract the signals from different tags. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the received signals are first clustered based on edge detection, and then the Vitebi algorithm is employed to decode the tag symbols. Our approach is fundamentally different from the works in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> in the following aspects. The RF source signal in AmBC is a modulated signal by using a discrete constellation, rather than a simple sinusoidal wave. This results in a more complicated signal model in which the discrete constellation information of the RF source needs to be appropriately handled in tag symbol detection. Unfortunately, conventional clustering algorithms, such as density based clustering, K-means, and EM algorithms, do not work well in this new model, which motivates the work in this paper.</p><p>Organization: The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we establish the AmBC system model, describe the probability model of received signals, introduce the optimal detection with perfect CSI, and provide the energy detection with perfect CSI. In Section III, we explore the constellation information and develop a parameterized constellation representation scheme. The CL-LS and CL-LUS schemes are respectively described in Sections IV and V. Initialization for the clustering algorithms is provided in Section VI. In Section VII, we analyze the computational complexity of our proposed schemes. Section VIII presents simulation results for performance comparison. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section IX.</p><p>Notation: The lowercase, boldface lowercase, and boldface uppercase letters t, t, and T denote a scalar variable (or constant), vector, and matrix, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PRELIMINARIES</head><p>In this section, we first describe the system model for AmBC. Then, we present the probability model of the received signals at the reader, based on which the optimal detector with perfect CSI is introduced as a performance benchmark. In addition, we provide the energy detection with perfect CSI as a benchmark.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. System Model</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> illustrates the AmBC system model studied in this paper, consisting of an RF source, a tag, and a reader. Specifically, the tag is a passive device while the RF source and the reader are active devices. This means that the reader has the ability to support complicated signal processing. The RF source and the tag are both equipped with a single antenna, while there are M antennas at the reader. The tag modulates the reflected ambient signals emitted from the RF source by switching the impedance to vary the amplitude/phase of the reflected signals.</p><p>1) Signal Model: Assume that the tag varies its reflection coefficient at a rate N times lower than the sampling rate of the RF source signal. That is, each tag symbol period covers N RF source symbol periods. One tag frame consists of T tag symbols. Denote by c (t) the t-th tag symbol, and by s (t) n , n = 1, • • • , N , the RF source signals within tag symbol c (t) . Assumed that s (t) n is a unit-power Q-ary modulated symbol chosen from a constellation S = {S 1 , S 2 , ..., S Q } known by both the RF source and the reader. Moreover, the signal power of the RF source is normalized such that E[|s</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(t) n | 2 ] = 1.</formula><p>We assume that the tag transmits its binary symbols by on-off keying modulation, i.e. c (t) ∈ C = {C 1 , C 2 } with C 1 = 1 and C 2 = 0. When c (t) = 0, there is only structural mode reflection; while when c (t) = 1, there are both structural mode reflection and antenna mode reflection <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Note that the structural mode reflection is generated due to the fact that any conducting object will scatter electromagnetic waves, while the antenna mode reflection is associated with the mismatch between the load impedance and antenna impedance. The effect of structural mode reflection can be absorbed into the direct link channel in channel modeling. Denote by α = |α|e jφ the reflection coefficient of the tag, which indicates the effect of antenna mode reflection. The frame structure is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>, where the first two tag symbols c (1) = 1 and c (2) = 0 are known by the reader and the other tag symbols are for data transmission. The signals correspond to the first two tag symbols are referred to as labeled signals, and the others are referred to as unlabeled signals, which carry the tag information..</p></div>

Denote by f m (or g m ) as the small-scale fading coefficient from the RF source (or the tag) to the m-th receive antenna at the reader, and by l the small-scale fading coefficient from the RF source to the tag. Without loss of generality, let</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">E[|f m | 2 ] = E[|l| 2 ] = E[|g m | 2 ] = 1.</formula><p>Denote the average received power from the direct link at the reader by P s and the RF source transmitted power by P t .

This implies that, with the knowledge of the RF source modulation constellation at the reader, the cluster centroids can be represented by a small number of parameters rather than treated as independent variables, thereby improving the estimation accuracy of clustering. This motivates the parameterized constellation representation presented below.</p></div>

Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> can express the constellation reconstruction process. Assume that the constellation points "1" and "5" in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> represent µ 1 and µ 2 , respectively. We use the given reconstruction matrix B to multiply the two constellation points "1" and "5", and then we will obtain all constellation points "1" -"8".

Throughout this paper, we assume that B is known by the reader with the values of its associated s 1 and s 2 predetermined, while µ 1 and µ 2 are initialized by using certain received labeled signals with the associated RF source symbols unknown to the clustering algorithms. This will cause a mismatch problem in algorithm initialization since the value of s 1 and s 2 used in B may differ from the RF source symbols used in initializing µ 1 and µ 2 . We defer detailed discussions on this problem to Section VI.</p></div>

Suppose that we choose an observation vector y L1 hs L1 + u L1 from the received labeled signals {y <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> n } N n=1 as the initial value of μ1 , i.e., μini 1 = y L1 , where s L1 is the symbol of the RF source associated with y L1 , and u L1 is the corresponding noise. We hope s L1 = s 1 so that µ ini 1 is reasonably close to hs 1 , where the value of s 1 is predetermined by the algorithm in setting the reconstruction matrix B. However, in practice, due to lack of cooperation between the RF source and the reader, the reader does not exactly know whether the constellation point hs L1 is equal to hs 1 or not, which gives rise to the mismatch problem as aforementioned. Therefore, how to choose a suitable observation vector y L1 without sufficient knowledge of the corresponding RF source symbol s L1 is of crucial importance.</p><p>We now show that the requirement of s L1 = s 1 can be relaxed to some extent without compromising the performance of the clustering algorithms.

Choice of Observation Vector y L1</head><p>We take M -PSK modulated and M -QAM modulated ambient RF source as examples to elaborate how to choose y L1 .</p><p>1) M -PSK: The constellations set S can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_94">S = {1, e j2π Q , • • • , e j2π(Q-1) Q } [31]</formula><p>. It is can be readily verified that S = Sφ 1 for arbitrary s 1 and s L1 in S. For example, S = {1, j, -1, -j} for QPSK modulation. Suppose s 1 = 1 and s L1 = j. Then, Sφ 1 = {j, -1, -j, 1} = S. Furthermore, S = Sφ 1 implies that Λ 1 and Λ 1 φ 1 give the same constellation. Therefore, for M -PSK, we can choose y L1 arbitrarily from {y <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> n } N n=1 for a good initialization. 2) M -QAM: For M -QAM modulation, the signal constellation of the RF source is given by S</p><formula xml:id="formula_95">= 1 ρ {r a + jr b |r a , r b ∈ {±1, ±3, • • • , ±( √ Q -1)</formula><p>}}, where ρ ensures that the RF source transmitted symbols are normalized to meet the transmission power constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. For M -QAM, it can be seen that if we choose an arbitrary y L1 , there is no guarantee of S = Sφ 1 . For example, S = 1 ∥ y (1)  n ∥ .</p><p>(49)</p><p>When N ≫ Q, the corresponding RF source symbol for such a y L1 is given by s</p><formula xml:id="formula_96">L1 = 1 ρ [±( √ Q -1) ± j( √ Q -1)] with high probability. Then, to ensure {S} = {Sφ 1 }, it suffices to choose s 1 ∈ 1 ρ {±( √ Q -1) ± j( √ Q -1)}.</formula><p>Likewise, we can also choose y L1 with the minimum amplitude from {y <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> n } N n=1 . In such a case, we choose s 1 ∈ 1 ρ {±1 ± j}. However, this alternative approach may lead to performance degradation, since the initialization error of choosing y L1 with the maximum amplitude is lower than that with the minimum amplitude. To see this, define the average square error of initialization as</p><formula xml:id="formula_97">e E [ || Ỹ1 -Λ 1 φ 1 || 2 F ] , (<label>50</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_98">)</formula><p>where the expectation is taken over the noise. From (48), we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_99">e =E [ ||U L1 || 2 F ] (51) =E [ Tr[U H L1 U L1 ] ] =E [ Tr ( (u L1 b T 1 ) H (u L1 b T 1 ) )] = σ 2 Q |s 1 | 2 . (<label>52</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_100">)</formula><p>As discussed above, choosing y L1 based on (49) yields a larger |s 1 | 2 . Together with (51), we see that choosing y L1 based on (49) yields a better initialization.</p></div>

For comparison, we also analyze the computational complexity of the optimal detection with perfect CSI. Here, we analyze the computational complexity using big-O notation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Optimal Detection with Perfect CSI</head><p>For each received signal y (t) n , the optimal detection LLRT computes the conditional probabilities in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_24">13</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> with O(M Q) multiplications. The total computational complexity for N T received signals is O(N T M Q).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. CL-LS Scheme</head><p>The CL-LS scheme consists of two phases, one for clustering labeled signals and the other for decoding unlabeled signals. For the decoding phase, the computation complexity (mainly for computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>) is O(N T M Q), following the discussion of Subsection A. In the following, we analyze the computational complexity of Algorithm 1 for the clustering phase. This algorithm contains three steps: initialization, E-step, and M-step.</p><p>• Initialization: For initialization, the computational complexity is dominated by the calculation of (45), with complexity O(N M Q). • E-step: The E-step is to calculate <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_101">, for n = 1, • • • , N and q = 1, • • • , Q.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. CL-LUS Scheme</head><p>Similarly, we analyze the computational complexity of the CL-LUS scheme from initialization, E-step, and Mstep.</p><p>• Initialization: We initialize the means and variance by using the output of Algorithm n | Ψold b a,q , Σold ), we compute the posterior probabilities of each received signal in (40), with complexity O(N T Q).

Thus, the total computational complexity of E-step for one iteration is O(N T M Q).</p><p>• M-step: The M-step is to calculate (42) and (43) with complexity O(N T M Q). Therefore, the total computational complexity of the CL-LUS scheme is O(JN T M Q), by assuming that the number of required iterations for the CL-LUS scheme is O(J).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. SIMULATION RESULTS</head><p>In this section, simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed signal detection schemes. The channel l, each component of channel f , and that of channel g follow an independent CSCG distribution with zero mean and unit variance. We set ϵ = 10 -3 , and ξ = 10 -2 . All results are obtained by averaging over 10 7 Monte Carlo realizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. BER Performance</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5</ref> shows the curves of bit error rate (BER) versus direct link SNR β d for different relative SNR ∆β and different M under the assumption of QPSK ambient RF source signal. We set the spreading gain N = 200 and the length of the frame N T = 5000. For Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5 (b)</ref>, we set M = 2 and ∆β = -40 dB. We compare the performance of CL-LUS, CL-LS, the optimal detection (OD) with perfect CSI, the standard GMM-based EM algorithm, and the energy detection (ED) with perfect CSI. We see that both CL-LUS and CL-LS outperform ED with perfect CSI at relatively high β d . The main reason is that the constellation learning schemes exploit the knowledge of the RF source signal constellation, while the energy detection does not utilize such knowledge in detection. Furthermore, the performance of CL-LUS is better than that of CL-LS. At BER 10 -2 , the optimal detection with perfect CSI achieves an SNR gain of   Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">6</ref> shows the effect of the spreading gain N on the BER performance under the assumption of QPSK modulated ambient RF source. We set β d = 16 dB, M = 2, ∆β = -30 dB, and T = 20. We see that the BERs of these four detection methods decrease monotonically, as the increase of spreading gain N . This is straightforward, since a larger N implies more samples for clustering. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">7</ref> presents the results for BER versus direct link SNR β d for relative SNR ∆β = -30 dB with M = 4, when the ambient RF source adopts 16QAM modulation. The spreading gain is set to N = 200, and the length of the frame is set to N T = 5000. For comparison, we also include the performance of ED with perfect CSI, the standard GMM-based EM algorithm with random initialization and labeled signals for clustering, CL-LS with random initialization, and the optimal detection with perfect CSI. The performance of CL-LS with random initialization is better than standard EM since the former utilizes the parameterized constellation representation in Section III-B. We further see that with the initialization technique in 0733-8716 (c) 2018 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission. See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information. (49), the performance of CL-LS is significantly improved. Moreover, we see that CL-LUS outperforms CL-LS by 2.7 dB, and performs away from the perfect-CSI curve by only 1 dB at BER = 10 -2 .  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">8</ref>, the convergence rate is higher as SNR increases for both CL-LS and CL-LUS. For example, for CL-LS with M = 4, N = 200 and ∆β = -40 dB, when β d is greater than 20 dB, 3 iterations are sufficient for convergence; for CL-LUS with M = 2, N = 200, and ∆β = -30 dB, 3 iterations are sufficient for convergence when β d ≥ 24 dB. The main reason is that a higher SNR means a more accurate initialization, and so a higher convergence rate. Moreover, from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">8</ref>, we observe that increasing M decreases the required number of iterations. This is because the clusters are easier to be classified in a higher dimensional data space. Meanwhile, when the spreading gain N increases, CL-LUS needs a smaller number of iterations. The main reason is that a higher N means more labeled signals.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This paper has studied the signal detection problem in AmBC using machine learning approaches. With the constellation information of the RF source, the signal detection problem is converted to a clustering problem. The benefit of using the RF source constellation information at the reader is two-fold: First, such information can be used to mitigate the direct link interference; second, such information enables parameterized constellation representation to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated in clustering.</p><p>We have proposed two MC-EM based schemes, namely, the CL-LS scheme and the CL-LUS scheme. CL-LS involves only labeled signals in clustering while CL-LUS uses both labeled and unlabeled signals to achieve a better performance at the lost of a sightly higher computational complexity. Also, initialization techniques for clustering algorithms are provided to effectively enhance the performance of the two detection schemes. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the two proposed schemes can perform close to the optimal detection with perfect CSI.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Illustrations of the received signals at the reader: (a) QPSK modulation for the RF source and on-off modulation for the tag; (b) 16QAM for the RF source and on-off modulation for the tag.</figDesc></figure>

Besides, by comparing Fig. 5 (a) and (b), we observe that when the relative SNR ∆β decreases, the BER performance is greatly reduced and however the multiple receiving antennas can make up for this loss. From Fig. 5 (a) and (b), at BER = 10 -2 , CL-LUS with ∆β = -30 dB achieves an SNR gain of 10 dB over CL-LUS with ∆β = -40 dB when M = 2. In addition, from Fig. 5 (b) the standard GMM-based EM algorithm performs worse than ED with perfect CSI. The main reason is that the standard EM algorithm estimates the cluster centroids without exploring the constellation information of the RF source.</figDesc></figure>
