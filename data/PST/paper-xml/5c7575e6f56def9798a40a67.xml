<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs) is the fast growing network of interconnected things that collect and exchange data using embedded sensors planted everywhere. It is an interconnection of several things through a diverse communication system capable of monitoring, collecting, exchanging, analysing, and delivering valuable and challenging amount of information. Given their ability to be operated autonomously, their high mobility, and their communication and processing power, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be involved in numerous IIoT-related applications, where multimedia and video streaming plays a key role. Our main interest is the multimedia routing in IIoT and its facilities during and/or after operational hours. For recovering, constructing and selecting k-disjoint paths, capable of putting up with failure of the parameters but satisfying the quality of service, we introduce an industry-oriented Canonical Particle Swarm (CPS) optimization data delivery framework. During communication with the UAV, multi-swarm strategy is used to determine the optimal direction while performing a multipath routing. Authenticity of the proposed approach has been tested and results show that, compared to the ordinary Canonical Particle Multi-path Swarm (CPMS) optimization and Fully Multi-path Particle Swarm (FMPS) optimization, the proposed method is better.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and some new emerging ICT technologies such as the 5G devices/sensors are converging with a variety of application fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. Its integration with the industry is envisaged to revolutionize the current industry by applying smarter machines, building connectivity between them, allowing them to communicate with and control one another for collaborative automation and intelligent optimization. 5G is expected to be more than a new generation of mobile communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Instead, it is already considered as the unifying fabric that will connect billions of devices in some of the fastest, most reliable and most efficient ways possible. Of course, the impact of such an enabling technology is expected to be revolutionary. The new infrastructure for communication is expected to transform the world of connected sensors and reshape industries. Such a revolution would of course require research and development for the co-existence and device inter-operability for sensors with 5G networks.</p><p>Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have been used mainly in military applications for many years. However, there has been a recent increase in the use of UAVs in non-military fields, which is inspired by the 5G revolution. Such fields include precision agriculture, security and surveillance, delivery of goods, and provisioned services <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. For example, Amazon and Walmart have been working on a new system to deliver goods to customers over the air. Additionally, China's largest mailing company DHL, has started delivering around 500 parcels daily using UAVs. Moreover, we can use some 5G-supported UAVs to monitor and send feedback from incidents that happen along the road, hence, eliminating road support teams. Moreover, a traffic policeman can be re placed or assisted by a UAV, by hovering over fast moving vehicles and report back traffic violations. Consequently, the use of UAVs for industry-oriented services can become a reality very soon, especially after the revolution of communication systems towards realizing the 5G-inspired Internet of Things (5G/IoT) paradigm. Where a key field of interest for IoT, and sensor networks is the development of wearables that can connect to these UAVs for various application areas.</p><p>Having an infrastructure such as 5G which is developed considering IoT applications in details causes significant needs for further contributions in terms of data and especially multimedia delivery. 5G is targeting 10 Gbps data rates in real-time networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The recent tests in 5G Innovation Centre <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref> have shown that it is even possible to exceed 1 Tbps in laboratory environment. This would mean being able to transmit 33 HD films each up to 2.5-3 h in a single second. It is typically desirable to have these infrastructures seamlessly integrated with IoT industrial solutions and there are recommended prototype sensors for similar applications with the energy and marginal cost for each added sensor <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are very critical in the aforementioned architype. The integrated 5G and IoT is termed as an extraordinary complex model, where devices are deployed as consumer elements forming a complex interconnected system. Conversely, these elements operate with very strict energy constraints, and hence making the energy left over for fault-tolerance procedure very limited. Moreover, the emergence of the variety of multimedia IoT applications such as video streaming from smart homes in smart cities will certainly increase the need for a fault-tolerant data routing <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Nowadays, WSNs function in an autonomous manner with a very limited human control in a UAV-enabled system, where sensors and cameras are attached/distributed not only in smart environments, but also to flying UAVs in the industry. Moreover, most of these sensors are positioned in wild outdoor environment and sometimes even harsh environment. Hence, it is quite difficult to determine and design a fault-tolerant routing protocol. Because the communication energy is considerably lower than that used in computations, it is very important to come up with a fault-tolerant algorithm which is able to recover from path failures no matter the added computational energy is. Or else, any random event may cause the UAV failure in delivering their exchanged information and interrupt the network functionality.</p><p>Accordingly, this necessitates a multi-path routing approach that can recover the failed path. Multi-path routing protocols form a good candidate for more reliable 5G/ IoT paradigm, in which fault-tolerance routing problems are considered as optimization problems. These optimization problems formulate a k disjoined paths to encounter up to k-1 path failure. Exceptional fault-tolerance routing in UAV-enabled networks needs a huge computational power, which as the problem increases, brings about large control message overhead without scalability <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Coming up with a solution to these problems on each sensor may require significant capacities in terms of memory and computational resources, and still produce ordinary results.</p><p>To offer quick recovery from failures, we design a bio-inspired routing algorithm called particle swarm optimization (PSO). Authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> note that the use of PSO has produced positive results, due to its simple concept and high efficiency. Nonetheless, despite the competitive performance, there still remain a huge challenge of solving the fault-routing problem because of the convergence issue. However, many of the impulsive convergence traps occur due to fast convergence features and a diverse loss of particle swarm, and hence, result into different solutions. In addition, the ability to differentiate between exploration and exploitation search is another significant challenge that we face today. Exploration contains the swarm convergence, while exploitation usually tend to make the swarm particle convergence without leaving the viable area that eventually leads to premature convergence, hence it is never proper to overemphasize exploitation or exploration <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>. Due to these faced challenges, and especially the connectivity issues, we propose a new approach that is more efficient in recovering failures via multipath routing capable of attaining quality of service (QoS) in terms of energy consumption, lifetime, delay and throughput. The proposed multipath routing algorithm is compared against existing optimization algorithm namely canonical particle swarm (CPS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, fully multi swarm (FMPS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and multi-swarm particle swarm optimization (CPMS) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref> to offer a different learning technique for the swarm particles. The aforementioned algorithms are only different from each other in that they have different learning contrivances and the likes, otherwise, they are similar to each other. Additionally, increasing the number of paths requires more messages exchange and communication overhead <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Therefore, we adopt the use of intricate network connection so as to denote layout of the swarm and use the multipath routing algorithm to stabilise the trade-off between fault tolerance and communication overheard by taking advantage of a mixed proactive and reactive routing mechanism that maintains the best objective function value for the designated paths per particle. After which, the particles are increased or decreased then, given a velocity that suits them, the augmented objective function must be used in order to make a fitting assortment.</p><p>In view of IIoT solutions for manufacturing industry from system and network perspective, this study endeavors to provide novel data delivery solutions to gain machine/sensors interoperability and manufacturing flexibility through production line level machine collaborations focusing on: (1) sensor/machine functionality and decentralized structure for communication intensive applications; (2) ubiquitous message trading and learning techniques for collaborative automations; (3) Swarm-based management for application level flexibility and adaptation. Due to the aforementioned issues in WSN technology, and especially the connectivity ones, we propose a new routing algorithm that is more efficient in considering multipath failures which contain reconstructive procedures capable of attaining quality of service (QoS) in terms of network lifetime, energy consumption, delay and throughput.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>Industrial internet of things (IIoT), also known as industrial internet, brings together smart machines, innovative analytics, and people at work. It is an interconnection of many devices through a diverse communication system to bring forth a top notch system capable of monitoring, collecting, exchanging, analysing, and delivering valuable information. These systems can then help manage smarter and faster business resolutions for industrial companies. This futuristic concept is marked with some new coined terms by industrial professionals and communities, such as Industrial 4.0, Industrial IoT (IIoT), Smart Manufacturing, Digital Manufacturing, Manufacturing 2.0, and Industrial Internet.</p><p>IIoT is more advanced than commercial IoT, simply due to the dominance of the connected sensors in the industrial platform. Sensor interface is a key factor in industrial data collection, and the present connected number, the rate of sampling and the type of signals emitted by sensors, are determined by the sensing device <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Additionally, every sensor connected to a device needs to write long and complex codes. Hence, the author in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> proposes a different system to design a programmable sensor interface for IIoT Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), which is able to collect data and at the same time read it in real time from multiple sensors in high speed. There are many motivations associated with the IIoT; such as connecting sensors to analytics and other data processing systems to automatically improve the industrial system performance, safety, reliability, and energy efficiency while collecting data using sensors, which have proved to be effective in terms of cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. The performance of machines and their connectivity, communication, and data throughput are all expected to be more flexible or powerful in manufacturing industry compared to traditional scenarios, such as smart home, health monitoring and elderly care. The specificities of IIoT manufacturing industrial networks can be briefed as follows: 1) Powerful machines connected to sensors with reliable connectivity, 2) Real-time communication for collaborative automation, 3) Heterogeneous networked machines topology, 4) Arbitrary P2P or broadcast for ubiquitous messaging, 5) High data throughput with varying sized messages using next generation paradigms (e.g., 5G), and 6) Machine collaboration based intelligent automation. These features have raised challenges and become the major concerns in the development of data routing in IIoT industrial systems.</p><p>In general, providing reliable services for applications which demand low-latency within the 5G and the IoT context is a challenging issue. It is well known that some WSN industrial applications require deterministic systems with a reliable and low latency aggregation service guarantees. Since the IEEE 802.15.4e standard is considered as the backbone of the IoT regarding WSN, the existing low latency deterministic network (LLDN) model used to fulfil the major requirements these applications require further contributions. In turn, research groups for this standard have studies on improvement of quality of service related concerns including energy efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Apart from the fact that fault tolerant routing makes the network system more reliable, it is also very important when it comes to 5G or IoT since WSNs heavily depend on surrounding environments and interact with, and hence, the need to provide QoS is a must. There are different ways to determine a fault tolerant route in WSNs, one of the leading ways is the multipath-routing <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> claim that recent optimization methods including meta-heuristic ones, are more effective in multipath routing. Moreover, the author in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> comes up with a solution to the disjoined multipath problem, by proposing a new energy efficient multipath routing system based on using particle swarm optimization (PSO). The author in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> introduces PSO which is used to selecting routes for load delivery. On the other hand, the author in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> recommends an Enhanced PSO based Clustering Energy Optimization (EPSO-CEO) system that minimizes the use of power in each node by centralized clusters and optimized cluster heads. Nevertheless, none of these studies address jointly the lifetime and faulttolerance aspects in their routing algorithms with a convergent model.</p><p>Authors in both <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> present a model to prevent the unnecessary convergence of crowd by setting upper and lower search space bounds so as to enable the crowd to find solutions for diverse applications. Furthermore, the author in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> demonstrates the performance of a load distribution system so as to address the optimization problem and facilitate prime network selection. Moreover, the authors account for the network bandwidth and the errors in the ideal data delivery system in different networks with reduced cost. To improve the lifetime and increase the bandwidth of the energy proficient distributed clusters of sensors, authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> employ the use of energy-aware, delay-tolerant and centralized approach. However, traditional sensor-networks spend energy in almost all processes. They spend energy while making data transmission and data sensing as well as data processing. There have been a few attempts towards achieving more energy efficiency in such networks via wireless multi-hop networking such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. However, such schemes are mostly applicable in static environments and can struggle with random topologies. For example, a routing scheme for energy harvesting was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The routing scheme assumes a hierarchical cluster-based architecture. Packet transmission from the source to the cluster-head can be direct or multihop based on the probability of saving energy through careful transmissions, optimized throughput and minimized work load.</p><p>In this work, we propose a new routing algorithm that is more efficient in considering multipath failures which contain reconstructive procedures capable of attaining quality of service (QoS) in terms of network lifetime, energy consumption, delay and throughput, while taking into consideration the advantageous powerful machines in IIoT industrial systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">System model</head><p>The routing method that has been projected in this research uses fault-tolerant system in two-tiered heterogeneous WSNs which comprise of supper/smart nodes that has plenty of resources and simple/light sensor nodes with limited battery capacity and absolute QoS limitations. Nevertheless, to get a more resilient fault-tolerant network model, we look for a K-disjoined multipath routing approach. Furthermore, we look at a many to one traffic system, where super nodes and common nodes connect with the proper degree. Below, we list some important explanations of some terms before introducing the system model.</p><p>For every disjoined/isolated node, we have to use it to build a k-disjoint multipath route, and increase the number of marginal paths, and hence, rendering a fault tolerant network. Our model is based on the assumption that a given node can connect or disconnect with some nodes that are not among those that are on the k-disjoint multipath between the node and a super node. In this study, node-disjointness relations are modelled as a directed graph G(V,E), where |V | = {v 1 ,v 2 ,...,v N ,v N + 1 ,...,v N + M } is the fixed number of nodes or particles, N indicate sensor node while M signifies super/smart nodes, G represents the set of paths and the relationship between a pair of super nodes and a pair of particles is the number of edges E in G. E = {(v i ,v j ) | Hop(v i ,v j ) ≤ τ}, where Hop(v i ,v j ) is the distance between v i and v j . P(v i ,v j ) is a path that runs from v i to v j in graph G. it is a sequence of edges we get when we go from v i to v j where i = j = 1,2,...,N + M. Hence, we can describe G as a set of unconventional routes p i (v i ,v j ). e ∈ p i (v i ,v j ),(v N ,v N + M ) denotes a connection between any two Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> The swarm optimization routing in terms of energy consumption </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E(v i ,v j ∈ p i (v i ,v j )) is the node disjoint between p i (v i ,v j ),(v N ,v N + M</formula><p>) and e. Hence, we can obtain k-disjoined paths in G. We use the amount of energy consumed by a multipath, delay and throughput to evaluate how best a multipath performs, we use the roots on <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> to come up with a solution of the objective function that minimizes the energy consumption and average delay, and maximizes the system throughput and network lifetime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Problem formulation</head><p>For our problem statement, we are looking to design a k-disjoined multipath for a fault tolerant system, which uses a UAV to transmit multimedia to a super node located in a two-tiered WSN. The model is constructed in such a way that each sensor node in the network is within the transmission range of each other. This helps in minimizing the QoS parameters such as the transmission power level and latency while maintaining a k-disjoint multipath route. In this system, every sensor node is Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> The swarm optimization routing versions vs. average delay Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> The swarm optimization routing versions vs. throughput connected to at least one super node with k-disjoint multipath. Accordingly, a kdisjoint multipath constructed by linking a cluster of super nodes (or UAVs) with a bunch of sensors which can modify their transmission range to a prime value. The transmission range of each sensor should be such that the minimum amount of energy is used while still maintaining a k-disjoined multipath and all the parameters for QoS are still upheld.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Energy model</head><p>For proper energy limitations, we need to consider the number of hops and the distance between two UAVs along the predefined path. The neighborhood topology mentioned in section III is used. Each sensor node is within the transmission range of (a) Energy consumption for 30 deployed sensors.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">4</ref> Total energy consumption with varying number of deployed nodes with different transmission range its neighbour sensor node. Given that the transmission range is equal to t u (&gt; 0), then the neighborhood is formulated by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ℵ u;v ¼ v; u≠vj ‖n u -n v ‖ ≤t u n o<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>It is worth recognising that there is a chance that this might change during the dynamic network lifetime. Moreover, unless all constraints are met, there will be a division in the multipath and neighborhood will be reconstructed. We can use the constraints to change the topology of the system which will eventually lead to solving the optimal power problem. Authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> uses the method of cut-off value to determine the lower and upper bound of the number of hops and transmission range. E elec represents the energy depraved when using the transmitter and receiver circuitry. The energy used by the receiver to obtain a proper signal to noise ratio is represented by ε mp . The amount of energy loss during transmission is α, and τ n(nu,nv) is the (b) Energy consumption of 40 deployed nodes. transmission range. To conclude, the function used to get the minimum amount of energy used in one node to transport data of length L p for a distant of τ is formulated by: min Z S:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">t hop ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi τ n n u ; n v ð Þ 3ε mp 2E elec n nu ;nv ð Þ ! α v u u t ≤τ n n u ; n v ð Þ<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">Z ! ¼ Energy n sd ¼ L p ∑ n d n n 2 E elecnsd þ ε mp n sd ð Þ α Â Ã n o<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>The above energy value for the selected path can change according the selected upper/lower bounds, E min , and E max , respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Delay model</head><p>In this research, we consider the delay definition which depends on the hop count, denoted as φ(ξ i ,ξ j ). φ represents the delay between two nodes, its definition is determined by the ideal number of hops. Given the optimal number of hops in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>), which represents the minimum delay between two nodes, we can formulae and optimize the route selection while considering delay and network resources constraints. This optimization problem, shall consider both source and intermediate nodes periodically in immediate neighborhood. Additionally, if one sensor node gratifies one QoS, the problem converges and all QoS requirements will be achieved. Consequently, the end to end delay for a given path P between is ξ Source and ξ Sink is described as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">φ sourcessink L p À Á ¼ min ∑ ξi φ ξ i ; ξ j À Á n o ;<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>where φ SourcesSink denotes the minimum delay that we can achieve when we send data through paths between ξ Source and ξ Sink . This time consist of the time for transmission, retransmission, staying idle, queuing, propagation, and processing. And thus, considering</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">∑ v¼1 φ ξ i ; ξ j À Á ≤X v Δ φ<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>the average delay per sensor node is equal to ξ. Assuming the hop count on a path between ξ Source and ξ Sink is given by η ij and the delay along this path is L φ e . The hop delay constraint can be signified by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L φ e ¼ Δ φ -φ e η ij</formula><p>. Accordingly, we can rewrite the constraint in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">∑ u¼1 φ ξ i ; ξ j À Á ≤X u L φ e<label>ð6Þ</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Throughput model</head><p>According to reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> a definition of throughput can be used to represent the number of data packets successfully transmitted. This can help in calculating the optimal hop count while maximizing the network throughput. This Throughput (Th) is computed via the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Th ¼ L φ e ξ *TR<label>ð7Þ</label></formula><p>where TR is the transmission rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">PSO in IIoT</head><p>In view of the technical solutions for IIoT systems, it is necessary to describe the components and their interrelationship, namely the roles of machines, how they generate, exchange, and consume data to fulfil the interactive operations. From a Swarm system perspective, industrial machines/sensors can be considered as particles with unique associated characteristics/events.</p><p>Every sensor/particle is allocated to a k-disjoint multipath according to the sensor transmission level and required separation distance per hop as alluded in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>). This is performed while considering numerous swarm particles' attributes. In this approach, sensor nodes have the capacity to enhance agreeable learning conduct by trading pathrelated messages with their neighbors. After trading/exchanging these messages, every node/particle figures the disjoint ways and expand the neighborhood set as alluded in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>). As indicated by Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>), another potential set of paths will be formed and prioritized, and thus, hops per the k-disjoint multipath will be adaptively changed according to the particle speed v (i,j) that is refreshed after each iteration to fulfil the desired QoS requirements.</p><p>Given that a k-disjoined multipath can have m descriptive QoS attributes, the position and velocity of the particle v is given by an m dimensional vector |V| = {v 1 , v 2 ,...,v N ,v N + 1 ,...,v N + M }. The proposed Swarm algorithm in this paper contains p best and g best which are the personal and (a) Average delay for 30 deployed nodes.  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>) in terms the average consumed energy and average delay, we find the nodes that connect the entire searching space in every iteration. Trading control messages between the nodes can further trigger them, which are then defined as extreme value and global extreme value. Consequently, this leads to the extreme value within the feasible search space towards which we progress upon after every iteration. Hence, the nodes tend to diverge are excluded. The personal best position of the swarm is brought about by the dissemination of good objective functions as denoted in Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>). These equations are concerned with the information exchange, while satisfying the constraints which are used to get the velocity and then find the ideal multipath route as stated before. In every path, the personal best position of a particle v (i,j) , is given by p best,v(i,j) = ( p (best,v1),(best,v2),...,(best,vN),(best,vN + M)</p><p>), similarly, the global-best position of a particle is given by g best,v(i,j) = (g (best,v1),(best,v2),...,(best,vN),(best,vN + M)</p><p>). The extent to which the p best,v(i,j) affects the equation is given by the coefficient of constraints φ 1 , similarly, the effects of the global are denoted by the coefficient (b) Average delay for 40 deployed nodes. </p><formula xml:id="formula_9">¼ 2 Kþ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi K 2 -4K p ; where K ¼ K 1 þ K 2 &gt; 1.</formula><p>Equation (6a) is defined as the velocity update function and regarded as the momentum function, which gives the particle's/node's present direction. Equation (6b) is called social component, it has the ability of being drawn towards the best solutions as assessed by the neighbors. Equation (6c) represents the cognitive module, with the ability of being drawn towards earlier results which symbolise the node behavior. The only difference between CPS and the Fully Particle Multi-path Swarm Optimization (FMPS) algorithm is the function used to update the particle velocity. This means that we not only take into account the best position of the node, but also all its neighbors.</p><p>(c) Average delay for 50 deployed nodes. We can ignore some of the node fault tolerance messages which can lead trapping in local optimal solutions, by eliminating the exchanged information about personal-best p best,v(i,j) . Consequently, this can lead to the increase of the node's ability to learn from the experience of other nodes. Hence, the performance of the algorithm highly rests on influence of the nodes while satisfying the objective function. Algorithm 1 denotes the pseudo code of the proposed CPS algorithm. It finds the p best 's objective function given by Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>) first in terms of the consumed energy and average delay, then finds the least value of objective function in the p best 's objective function for k-disjoined multipath. Then, it assists in avoiding velocity fit and computes the constriction value x, as shown in v ! v . It updates the velocity value, and finally, establishes better fault-tolerant multipath route on which the optimal nodes are chosen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Performance evaluation</head><p>Keeping in mind the end goal to evaluate the execution of the proposed Swarm method, we perform broad re-enactments. We have implemented the aforementioned algorithms; the Particle Multi-path Swarm Optimization (CPMS), the Canonical Particle Swarm Optimization (CPS), and the Fully Particle Multi-path Swarm Optimization (FMPS), using Matlab in order to evaluate their objective functions and visualize their outputs. We use 100 sensors and 50 UAVs dispersed uniformly in 1000 × 1000 × 100 m 3 deployment space. The path loss exponent for the wireless communication model is chosen to be 2. The underlying estimation of sensors' transmission range is set to be 100 m in order to assure the association among UAVs and sensors nodes while fulfilling the focused on QoS requirements. Further simulation parameters are compacted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Simulation results</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> presents the total energy consumption in the assumed topology with a maximum of 5hops path length. We remark that the aggregate energy utilization in the k-disjoint multipath created by the proposed PMSO approach is superior to CPS. Since settling the objective function used by CPS experiences issues in finding k-disjoint multipath after recouping from operational failures in the immense search space. Furthermore, since this outcome in being not (a) Total throughput for 30 deployed nodes. Another critical comment that is identified by traded messages for adaptation to failure between the super nodes (UAVs) and sensors is that CPS performs essentially more terrible than FMPS and CPMS. That is on account of CPS necessitates fundamentally more control packets to trade among the neighbors. In this way, CPS needs to discover k-disjoint multipath in its nearby neighborhood though the FMPS and CPMS can straightforwardly scan for routes utilizing the less control packets among the nearby hops. Subsequently, the k-disjoint multipath for FMPS and CPMS can bring down the aggregate energy usage when contrasted with the CPS approach.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> demonstrates the average deferral of the chose ideal k-disjoint multipath from sender to the destination. We can watch that the assessed approaches; FMPS and CPMS, have exhibited a lower delay for every hop contrasted with CPS. This can be come back to the (b) Total throughput for 40 deployed nodes. determination and upkeep of k-disjoint multipath for adaptation to failure which can fulfil the hop necessities by choosing the following bounce in the area of every hop. Therefore, it necessitates fundamentally less control messages for adaptation to non-critical failure contrasted with CPS for choosing and keeping up 1-hop neighborhood. Hence, we can say that both CPMS and FMPS are more practical than CPS.</p><p>Throughput might vary because of high-BER and other surrounding changing conditions in outdoors. Accordingly, we show in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> the impact of tackling the objective function alluded in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>). We notice that while expanding the ideal number of hops and trying to minimize the average delay, throughput degrades essentially. This is a normal influence for the assumed limited latency under the previously mentioned requirements while reducing the number of traded control messages. Therefore, the most practical hops on the route can be acquired effectively. Moreover, we presumed that the experienced algorithms behavior relies upon the IIoT network topology. Despite the fact that CPS accomplish completely connected topology, it has shown an exceptional degraded (c) Total throughput for 50 deployed nodes. performance in contrast to other approaches. This is due to an irregular conduct from every node while determining and limiting the multipath route hop-count. At the same time, this conduct could bolster ideal execution in FMPS and CPMS with completely associated topologies.</p><p>We additionally explore the targeted performance when led with changing sensors/ machines counts in the considered IIoT network topology. Results that have been created for every approach while expanding the quantity of sensor counts are shown in Figs. 4, 5 and 6. It is worth pointing out that for multi-objective functions, the examined algorithms show better results at the beginning. Beside that the low connectivity degree (i.e., k = 4) could cause the algorithm to make mistakes in generating optimal approximations for the objective function. However, the behavior of particles while experiencing lower sensors counts can be utilized in estimating the objective function robustness, which could cause the algorithm to move towards more favourable regions in the feasible search space. It is observed that the performance for each approach is not good at the beginning and performs better towards the end while 40 sensors or more coexist as depicted in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b, 5b,</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6b</ref> as well as for the 50 nodes as shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c, 5c,</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6c</ref>.</p><p>According to these figures, FMPS and CPMS algorithms achieve the best performance when 30 coexisting nodes are assumed. Meanwhile, CPS performance is shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4a,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>, and 6a in terms of energy consumption, delay, and throughput, respectively, and has the worst performance when number of nodes deployed is more than 30 at the beginning and becomes better over time. This is because the CPS can construct and select optimal paths from unfavourable area in the search space. Specifically, the low number of generation of paths for the objective functions can be a reason why the CPS's convergence is a little bit off from the global optimal solution for 30 node deployment than other algorithms.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> compares the lifetimes of different counts of partitioning nodes, where a partitioning node is a node that can cause isolation/separation for a set of nodes in the network. In this figure, we consider a single data source (or UAV) and the network lifetime definition in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Accordingly, lifetime should be proportional to the ratio of the total deployed nodes' count N.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> illustrates the network lifetime for multiple data sources (or UAVs) and same setups in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. The only difference is that continuous multimedia traffic is transmitted by multiple sources Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> Node lifetime vs, the nodes' count to the partitioning nodes. This assumption makes the performance of the proposed Swarm-based algorithm easier to assess. Obviously, the network lifetime must be longer than that in the singlesource scenario. This is because the network lifetime is relatively proportional to the ratio of the partitioning nodes to UAVs' count per region in the network. It is worth pointing out here that with the same count of partitioning nodes, the network lifetime decreases when more than one source (UAV) is transmitting as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. When more UAVs are involved in covering a region, more energy is consumed by the network per time unit. Therefore, the lifetime is expected to decrease when the number of sources increases. Similarly, in the single source scenario (see Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>), the lifetime decreases when the partitioning nodes count increases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>IIoT is emerging as a dominant communication paradigm nowadays in order to satisfy the industrial revolution worldwide. In this research, we offer a bio-inspired swarm algorithm that constructs, recovers and finds k-disjoint multipath routes in a network of machines (or UAVs). Two position information, namely the personal-best position and the global position, are considered in the form of velocity update to enhance the performance the IIoT network. In order to validate this algorithm, we assessed the multiple objective functions which consider throughput, average energy consumption and average end-to-end delay. Our results show that using the characteristics of all personal-best information is a valid strategy for the purposes of improving the CPMS performance. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has also been compared with similar algorithms, which optimize the energy consumption and average delay on the explored paths towards the destination. For the future, we see a great potential and need to study various aspects of 5G/IoT integration with the existing sensor network architectures in different levels for more successful industrial applications. The popularity of 5G, the problem of slicing the Internet traffic and the fact that a significant slice is expected to be reserved for sensory applications encourages further attempts in this domain.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 4</head><label>4</label><figDesc>Fig. 4 (continued)</figDesc><graphic coords="9,46.77,53.09,345.85,347.56" type="bitmap" /></figure>
