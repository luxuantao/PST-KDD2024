<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we deal with the problem of modeling railway networks with Petri nets so as to apply the theory of supervisory control for discrete event systems to automatically design the system controller. We provide a modular representation of railway networks in terms of stations and tracks including sensors and semaphores. We first ensure safeness and local liveness imposing both generalized mutual exclusion constraints and constraints also involving the firing vector. The detailed model used in this first step can be abstracted, considering a higher level description of a railway network that belongs to the class of ES 2 PR (extended simple sequential process with resources) nets and show that global liveness may be enforced by adding appropriate monitor places designed using siphon analysis. In our approach, this can be done without an exhaustive computation of all siphons and we can characterize the cases in which the procedure can be recursively applied, giving a simple test for closed-loop net to remain an ES 2 PR net.</p><p>Note to Practitioners-The automation of railway systems (and, in general, of large-scale distributed discrete event systems) is a complex problem that can be decomposed in several subproblems. It is necessary to be able to build a model of the plant, to simulate it, to design appropriate control logic to ensure that abnormal situations, such as collisions or deadlocks, never occur. In this paper, we present an approach based on a graphical model that is familiar to the automation community: Petri nets. Our approach presents two main advantages. First, we are able to address all these subproblems within a single formalism, thus making it worthwhile for the practitioner the effort of investing some valuable time to learn more about Petri nets. Second, the mathematical approaches used to determine the solution in all these steps are based on simple matrix computation and standard operation research tools, that are easily accessible to practitioners with a background in computer and systems engineering. Another interesting problem that we also plan to solve using Petri nets-but that is not addressed in this paper-is that of scheduling the railway system so as to optimize its efficiency.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>hence greater demands are placed on the control logic of these systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Consider, to mention just one example, the case of the European Union. As the EU is opening to counties of Eastern Europe, it is also making substantial investments to revitalize the railways and plans to achieve the following objectives by 2020 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>:</p><p>• for rail to increase its market share of passenger traffic from 6% to 10% and of goods traffic from 8% to 15%; • a trebling of manpower productivity on the railways; • a 50% gain in energy efficiency; • a 50% reduction in emissions of pollutants; • an increase in infrastructure capacity commensurate with traffic targets. The specification, analysis and implementation of railway control logic is an important activity because its failure can lead to railway accidents and loss of human life <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. At present time, this activity is even more important because railway networks are often large, the speed of trains and traffic density is increasing, and activities within networks are taking place concurrently and at geographically different locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Note that the control of a railway network can be divided into two parts: logical control and performance control. The first one deals with structural problems, and imposes the satisfaction of a series of safeness constraints (collision avoidance) and liveness constraints (deadlock freeness). The second one, is related to the operation of the network and is concerned with problems such as scheduling both the departures and the stops, so as to optimize the efficiency of the net. In this paper, the attention is uniquely devoted to the design of control logic for logical control.</p><p>Very different approaches have been used to design efficient controllers for railway networks. For a detailed treatment of the subject, the interested reader may consult the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and follow links provided on Internet sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we focus our attention on the modeling and control of railway networks with Petri nets <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, that provide a powerful framework for the analysis and control of distributed and concurrent systems. Some of the advantages of Petri nets as models for discrete event control include <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>: graphical representation, solid foundations based in mathematics, the existence of simulation and formal analysis techniques, and the existence of computer tools for simulation, analysis and control.</p><p>The literature on modeling and analyzing railway systems using Petri nets is not extensive and a good survey is given by Janczura in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The idea of applying Petri nets theory goes back to Genrich <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, then it was revisited in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, where colored Petri nets have been used. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, Ren and Zhou presented Petri net models for the tactical scheduling of railroad operation. In particular, they provide a criterion to establish whether a given target schedule is feasible or not. Other significant contributions in this field are due to Decknatel and Schnieder <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, to Di Febbraro et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> who used hybrid Petri nets to model transportation systems, and to Moen Hagalisletto and Yu <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The control approach proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, even if it uses Petri nets, is essentially based on graphical specification language, and appropriate composition rules that require a certain amount of algebra. The notions of controllable and observable transitions, as well as that of monitor places, are not used here.</p><p>In a recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, we have also discussed the control of train networks using colored Petri nets. Unlike the approach presented in this paper, however, we only considered the case of systems with controllable and observable transitions which makes the control problem much simpler.</p><p>In this paper, the use of Petri nets as a modeling formalism allows us to use within a single framework several different approaches such as supervisory control, monitor design, siphon, and deadlock analysis that are necessary at different stages of the control logic design. The original contribution of our paper concerns three aspects described in the following.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Modeling</head><p>We first provide a modular representation of railway networks in terms of stations and tracks including sensors and semaphores. The overall model is a place/transition (P/T) net whose transitions may be (un)controllable and/or (un)observable, following the paradigm of supervisory control <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. As an example, a controllable and observable transition is associated to the crossing of a section controlled by a semaphore, where a traffic signal that may stop a train and a sensor that detects the passing of the train is placed. The possibility offered by supervisory control to handle such primitives as uncontrollable and unobservable events leads to a very simple model that can be directly exploited in the subsequent phase of control synthesis. The use of Petri nets allows a modular representation of railway networks where each of the composed subnets corresponds to a station or a track.</p><p>It is also important to mention that at different levels of the control logic design, different models may be suitable. In this paper, we use two main models: at a lower level, we use a detailed model to solve the safeness problem; at a higher level, we use an abstracted one, that we call skeleton net, to solve the liveness problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Control</head><p>There exist several techniques for automatically designing controllers for P/T nets with uncontrollable and/or unobservable transitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In particular, we show how collision avoidance constraints can be expressed as generalized mutual exclusion constraints (GMECs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and how the corresponding controller takes the form of a set of monitor places that can be computed using Moody's parametrization <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>However, it is well known that, in general, a monitor-based solution to a GMEC may not be maximally permissive. We show that this is the case for constraints related to the arrival and departure of a train from a station, where the designed monitor controller is too restrictive and leads to a blocking condition when two trains going in opposite directions meet at a station. We call such a situation a local deadlock because it does not depend on the global state of the network (i.e., on the presence of other trains) but only on the local configuration of the two trains. The maximally permissive control policy for this configuration corresponds to a set of legal markings that is not convex, and thus cannot be enforced by a monitor place. However, we are able to solve this problem designing a control structure that is still very simple and takes the form of a "monitor with self-loops."</p><p>A nice feature of the overall approach is that the whole control problem can be divided into a certain number of local subproblems, thus making the proposed control procedure suitable even for large dimensions cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Deadlock Avoidance</head><p>Although the controller designed in the previous phase is locally deadlock free, as the number of trains admitted into the network increases different blocking conditions may occur depending on the exact trains distribution. This is what we call a global deadlock.</p><p>There exists a rich literature on the design of deadlock avoidance controllers for discrete event systems in general and for Petri nets in particular (see for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and the references therein), and we are well aware that some of the approaches already presented in the literature may also be applied to the case at hand.</p><p>Most of the results on deadlock control have been proposed within the framework of automated guided vehicles (AGV) systems. As an example, a significant contribution in this area is due to Wu and Zhou <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> who presented a colored resource-oriented Petri net (CROPN) modeling method to deal with conflict and deadlock arising in AGV systems. A control policy suitable for real-time implementation is also presented here.</p><p>Other important procedures of deadlock prevention have been proposed within the framework of flexible manufacturing systems. Among these we mention, in particular, the work by Li and Zhou <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. This paper is based on siphon analysis, and its main contribution consists in exploring ways to minimize the addition of new places to prevent siphons to be empty, while achieving the same control purpose.</p><p>In this paper, however, we adopt a simple approach that is computationally viable and is tailored to the problem at hand. These are the main features of the procedure we propose.</p><p>• We simplify the model of railway system considering an abstracted net (that we call skeleton net) and we show that it belongs to the class of ES PR (extended simple sequential process with resources) nets. In simple words, an ES PR net is obtained by a strongly connected state machine where all circuits contain a common place , adding a set of places representing shared resources (see Definitions 2 and 3 for a formal statement). • For the class of ES PR nets deadlock-freeness ensures liveness and can thus be characterized by siphon analysis. In particular, it is well known that for ordinary nets deadlock freeness may sometimes be enforced adding new monitors that control the net siphons to prevent them from becoming empty: see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> as an example of recent development in this area. One original feature of our approach, which was first presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and that is also used in this paper, consists in the fact that to compute the liveness enforcing monitors, we use a very efficient linear algebraic technique that does not require the exhaustive enumeration of all siphons, whose number may be too large even for small nets such as the one we consider. In fact, we are able to compute a liveness enforcing monitor solving an integer programming problem (IPP). Siphon-based techniques were also used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and other approaches based on IPP can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. • We propose to add monitors to the net following an iterative procedure as the number of trains that are admitted into the network increases. We initially assume that only trains may enter the net, i.e., the skeleton net contains only two tokens. We determine if from the initial marking there exists a reachable marking such that a siphon is empty: if such is the case, we add a monitor place to prevent it from becoming empty. If a live net has been obtained for tokens, we consider an initial marking with tokens. We continue until we reach a value with sufficiently large to cover all cases of practical interest (the number of trains that can be admitted within a train network is upper bounded by the number of available vehicles).</p><p>In general, the addition of such a monitor may give rise to some problems, as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Problem 1: The closed-loop net may not be an ES PR net, and we cannot carry on with our iterative procedure. One of the main contributions of this paper is the derivation of a necessary and sufficient condition to verify if the addition of a monitor to an ES PR net still produces an ES PR net. Note that this result is also useful to characterize the class of ES PR nets.</p><p>Problem 2: The monitor may create new siphons that require to be controlled as well, i.e., new deadlocks involving the newly added monitors may occur and the procedure needs to be reapplied. We cannot always ensure that the procedure will eventually converge to a live net. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>This means that we may be obliged to halt this iterative procedure at a lower level of because either at a given step the addition of a monitor generates a net that is not an ES PR anymore (Problem 1), or because it does not converge to a live net (Problem 2).</p><p>A general solution to Problem 1 was given by Park and Reveliotis. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, they defined a class broader than ES PR and showed that for these nets it is possible to compute the liveness enforcing monitors solving, as we do in this paper, an IPP. The class of nets they consider is closed under the addition of a monitor, and thus Problem 1 may never occur.</p><p>A general solution to Problem 2 requires different deadlock avoidance policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> that are not monitor based.</p><p>However, the approach we propose here is practically useful in many cases because the linear characterization we derive requires the solution of an IPP with a reduced computational complexity (in terms of integer variables) with respect to the more general approaches just mentioned. Thus, we suggest that our procedure should be initially used and only if it stops at a level of that is deemed too small, should these more general procedures be invoked during the successive steps.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. A Short Introduction to Petri Nets</head><p>In this section, we recall the formalism used in the paper. For more details on Petri nets, we address to <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>A place/transition net (P/T net) is a structure , where is a set of places; is a set of transitions;</p><p>, and are the pre-incidence and post-incidence functions that specify the arcs;</p><p>is the incidence matrix. A marking is a vector that assigns to each place of a net a non-negative integer number of tokens, represented by black dots. In the following, we denote as the marking of place . A system or net system is a net with an initial marking and its set of reachable markings is denoted . We denote the potentially reachable set, i.e., the set of all markings for which there exists a vector that satisfies the state equation , i.e., . A non-null vector such that is called a P-semiflow (or P-invariant) of the net . The support of a P-semiflow is the set of places such that . Let be a matrix where each column is a P-semiflow of , and denote the set of invariant markings . The following result holds:</p><p>, i.e., the potentially reachable set and the invariant set are outer approximations of the reachability set.</p><p>A P/T net is called ordinary when all of its arc weights are 1's. A state machine is an ordinary Petri net such that each transition has exactly one input place and exactly one output place. A net is strongly connected if there exists a directed path from any node in to every other node. A siphon of an ordinary net is a set of places such that . A siphon is minimal if it is not the superset of any other siphon. The number of tokens assigned to the siphon by a marking is . A siphon can also be described by its characteristic vector such that if , else ; thus .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. GMECs, Monitors, and Controllability</head><p>The development of this section is kept very concise for sake of brevity. Please, refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> for a more complete discussion of this topic.</p><p>Assume that we are given a set of legal markings , and consider the basic control problem of designing a supervisor that restricts the reachability set of the plant in closed-loop to . Of particular interest are those PN state-based control problems where the set of legal markings is expressed by a set of linear inequality constraints called GMECs. Each GMEC is a couple , where is a weight vector and . Given the net system , a GMEC defines a set of markings that will be called legal markings:</p><p>. The markings that are not legal are called forbidden markings. A controlling agent, called supervisor, must ensure that the forbidden markings will be not reached. So, the set of legal markings under control is . In the presence of multiple constraints, all constraints can be grouped and written in matrix form as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where and . The set of legal markings is . A GMEC may be enforced adding to the net a single control structure consisting in a new place called monitor place. In the case of constraints, we have monitors and to each of them it corresponds an additional row in the incidence matrix of the closed-loop system. In particular, let be the matrix that contains the arcs connecting the monitor places to the transitions of the plant, and the (initial) marking of the monitors. The incidence matrix of the closed-loop system is <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> and the marking vector and initial marking are</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(3)</formula><p>where the subscript has been used to denote the variables of the plant.</p><p>In the case of controllable and observable transitions, Giua et al. provided the following theorem.</p><p>Theorem 1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>): If , then a Petri net controller with incidence matrix and initial marking enforces constraint (1) when included in the closed-loop system (2) with marking (3).</p><p>The controller so constructed is maximally permissive, i.e., it prevents only transitions firings that yield forbidden markings. The controller net has monitor places and no transition is added.</p><p>It often occurs that certain transitions can not be disabled by any control action (uncontrollable transitions) or their firing can not be directly detected or measured (unobservable transitions). We adopt the convention reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> to distinguish among controllable and/or uncontrollable, observable and/or unobservable transitions.</p><p>An admissible monitor must satisfy two structural conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> when uncontrollable or unobservable transitions exist. No arcs is allowed from a monitor to an uncontrollable transition , so that can never be disabled by the controller. An unobservable transition must have the same number of input and output arcs to/from a monitor-i.e., its only admissible connection to a  monitor is given by self-loops-so that its firing does not change the state of the controller, and thus can never be detected.</p><p>If the monitor constructed applying the previous theorem does not satisfy these structural conditions, an appropriate set of transformed constraints (more restrictive than the original ones) needs to be determined so as to construct a Petri net controller. A general technique to do this with a simple procedure that requires little more than the integer triangularization of a suitable matrix was presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. An example of constraint transformation is given in Section IV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Constraints Involving the Firing Vector</head><p>Certain control goals may involve the firing vector of a Petri net, as well as the tokens content of places <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. A constraint of this kind takes the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> where</p><p>, and is such that if is control enabled, otherwise, . Thus, constraint (4) implies that should be control enabled at marking if and only if the following two conditions are simultaneously verified: a) ; b) . The corresponding control structure takes the form of a monitor place with a self-loop. As an example, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> we have shown the monitor with self-loop that enforces the constraint . Note that transition must be controllable, transitions and must be controllable and observable, transitions and must be observable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. The Class of ES PR Models and Its Properties</head><p>In this section we first recall the definition of two important classes of Petri nets, namely, the S P and ES PR nets, first introduced by Tricas et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. These classes of nets have been identified because they frequently appear in the framework of manufacturing systems, and for the ES PR class deadlock and liveness problems may be easily characterized by analyzing siphons. In the rest of this paper, we shall see that a reduced model of a railway network, that we call "skeleton net," belongs to this class and the liveness problem may be solved using an important property of this model.</p><p>A simple sequential process (S P) is a strongly connected state machine where all circuits contain a common place , denoted as the idle place. From a modeling point of view, a S P represents the set of different sequences that a unit of the process can follow across the system.</p><p>Definition 2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>): A Simple sequential process, S P, is an ordinary Petri net , where:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">1) . 2)</formula><p>is a strongly connected state machine. 3) All the circuits in contain the place . An extended simple sequential process with resources (ES PR) is defined as a S P that uses resources in the states of the system that are not the idle one. In this class of nets, a process state can need the use of several resources simultaneously.</p><p>Structurally, an ES PR is obtained from a S P net adding a set of places representing available resources, denoted as . These places must satisfy some constraints as stated in the following definition.</p><p>Definition 3 <ref type="bibr">([40]</ref>): An extended simple sequential process with resources, ES PR, is a generalized self-loop free Petri net , such that: 1) the subnet generated by the set is a S P; 2) ; 3) ; 4) a unique minimal P-semiflow such that and . An example of an ES PR net is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>, where and . The following important result has been proven in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Proposition 4 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>): Let be a marked ES PR net. If a transition is dead for a reachable marking , then there exists a reachable marking and siphon such that , i.e., all places in the siphon are empty. Note that the result given in Proposition 4 was proven in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> not only for ES PR nets, but for an even larger class of Petri nets. Now, we present an important result that is useful when studying liveness problems and, in particular, when applying an iterative procedure for deadlock-avoidance that will be presented in Section V. More precisely, let us consider an ES PR net with resource places. Let be a positive and minimal-support GMEC 3 and let be the corresponding monitor place. We prove that the addition of to produces a closed-loop net that is still an ES PR net, if and only if two conditions are verified, namely, the GMEC should only involve places in and the corresponding monitor place should only have ordinary output arcs. 3 A GMEC (w w w; k) is called positive if w w w 0 ; k &gt; 0, and is minimal-support if there exists no P-semiflow x x</p><p>x such that kx x xk kw w wk, i.e., kw w wk does not contain the support of any P-semiflow.</p><p>To do this, we first recall two lemmas whose proof can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Note that in the following we denote by the set of minimal P-semiflows of .</p><p>Lemma 5 <ref type="bibr">([17]</ref>: Let be a Petri net. Let be a positive and minimal-support GMEC and be the corresponding monitor place. It holds that <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> where is the closed-loop net. The above lemma implies that after the addition of a monitor place to a generic Petri net , the set of minimal P-semiflows of the resulting net includes all the minimal P-semiflows of the net before the addition of the monitor, plus the minimal P-semiflow induced by the monitor. Moreover, the addition of the monitor place may also originate other P-semiflows.</p><p>Lemma 6 <ref type="bibr">([17]</ref>: Let be an ES PR net, where and . Let be a positive and minimal-support GMEC only involving places in and be the corresponding monitor place.</p><p>Let , where , be the closed-loop net. It holds that <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> The above lemma implies that if a monitor is added to an ES PR net, and the corresponding GMEC only involves places in , then the set of minimal P-semiflows of the resulting net is a subset of the set of P-semiflows of the original net plus the P-semiflow corresponding to the monitor place . </p></div>

MODELING RAILWAY NETWORKS WITH PETRI NETS</head><p>In this section, we show how Petri nets can be efficiently used as a modeling tool for railway networks. In particular, we show  that the whole network can be seen as the composition of a certain number of elementary modules, namely, tracks, points, and stations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Track Model</head><p>Consider the railway track scheme shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. This track can be divided into the five segments 's shown in the figure . Sensors A and B<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">4</ref> can detect the passage of train regardless of its direction (leftward or rightward). Semaphore A can stop a train directed leftward (from segment to segment ) and it is also able to detect the passage of a train directed leftward. Semaphore B can stop a train directed rightward (from segment to segment ), and it is also able to detect the passage of a train directed rightward.</p><p>A Petri net model for such a track is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. Each couple of places represents segment : the marking of (with respect to, ) denotes the presence of a train directed rightward (with respect to, leftward) in segment . Transitions (with respect to, ) represent the passage of a train directed rightward (with respect to, leftward) from one segment to another.</p><p>Transitions may be (un)controllable and/or (un)observable. In this setting, a transition that is both controllable and observable corresponds to a semaphore. As an example transition (with respect to, ) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> corresponds to semaphore A (with respect to, semaphore B): it is controllable and observable to denote that presence of a train directed leftward (with respect to rightward) can be detected and its transit can be forbidden. In all real situations, a semaphore is placed at the exit of a track, or equivalently at the entrance of a station. A transition that is observable but not controllable (see transitions , and ), represents a sensor.</p><p>Note that the same model can represent two different cases.</p><p>• A single track, i.e., a track that can be crossed in two directions (leftward or rightward). Thus, places and are used to represent the same segment of the single track. Obviously, the two places must contain at most one token and cannot be marked at the same time: this will be enforced by a suitable control logic. • A double track, i.e., two tracks one of which is always crossed rightward, while the other one is always crossed leftward. In the case of a double track, the two lines are independent and places and correspond to parallel segments. The two places must contain at most one token each but both can be marked at the same time.</p><p>The number of places used to represent the track depends on the required precision. On one hand, we assume that the Petri net is safe (such a condition will be imposed by the addition of appropriate monitor places), thus the number of places is mainly limited by the required safeness distance, i.e., we assume that the length of each segment is such that no more than one train can be contained within it at any given time instant. On the other hand, we must take into account the presence of sensors and semaphores (that are modeled by appropriate transitions as discussed above).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Points Model</head><p>Consider the points (switch) sketched in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5(a)</ref>. Depending on the points position trains may follow a different path.</p><p>The Petri net model of a points with possible paths is reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>(b): it contains places (namely, ) and transitions (namely, ). When place is marked, trains may be routed to track . On the contrary, if place is marked, then no train may cross the points. This is the case when either the enabled path is being changed or the points is under maintenance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. The Railway Station Model</head><p>Consider the -tracks railway station whose scheme is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>   The Petri net model of this station is sketched in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>, where double arrows have been used to denote self-loops.</p><p>The firing of controllable and observable transitions and represent the entrance of a train into the station, while the firing of uncontrollable and unobservable transitions and represent the exit of a train from the station. Note that, as in the case of the track model, a controllable and observable transition is used to model a semaphore, while an observable but uncontrollable transition is used to model a sensor.</p><p>The two subnets on the bottom right and on the bottom left of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> model the points. The superscripts 1 and 2 have been used to denote places and transitions relative to the left and the right points, respectively. Remark 8: Let us consider in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> the self-loops between the points places , for , and the transitions limiting the intermediate tracks. These transitions have been defined as observable but uncontrollable because they model the presence of sensors. Therefore, it may appear a contradiction that we have arcs going from the above mentioned places and such transitions. In fact, this implies that the points control uncontrollable transitions.</p><p>In effect, what is controllable is the position of the points, that establishes which is the route that is set up. Depending on the position of the movable parts in the points a certain route is enabled (or no route is enabled) and the flow of the train occurs accordingly.</p><p>A situation in which, say place is marked (i.e., a train leaving track is going right), while place is not marked, is an anomalous state in which the train goes off the lines. To make sure that no situation of this type is reached, the safe operation of the points must be ensured by the controller. This will be done in Section IV-B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. THE CONTROLLER DESIGN FOR TRACKS AND STATIONS</head><p>In this section, we deal with the problem of designing a Petri net supervisor for a railway network so as to ensure safeness and local liveness. In other words, the goal of the supervisory controller is that of guaranteeing that two trains may flow through the net in the same direction or in opposite directions without colliding, while prohibiting that blocking conditions may occur.</p><p>To do this we first consider single modules and derive a controller for tracks and stations separately. In particular, we observe that GMECs may be satisfactorily applied when controlling tracks. On the contrary, we will see that this kind of constraints is too restrictive when controlling the admission to stations and may lead to a deadlock. We show in detail that in this latter case, safeness may be ensured by imposing appropriate logical constraints that also ensure local liveness.</p><p>We will also discuss the constraints that should be kept into account to regulate the orderly movements of the points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Safeness GMECs on Tracks</head><p>GMECs have been first imposed so as to ensure safeness, i.e., to ensure that each couple of places corresponding to the same segment of a single-track (that may also belong to a station) are not marked simultaneously, and each place never contains more than one token at a time.</p><p>In accordance to the supervisory control theory briefly summarized in Section II-B each constraint requires the introduction of a monitor place. Moreover, in the case of uncontrollable and/or unobservable transitions, constraints need to be appropriately transformed.</p><p>Example 9: Let us consider a two-tracks station whose Petri net model is reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>(a), apart from place and all connected arcs. Let us consider places and relative to a given segment of Track 1 within the station. The GMEC that ensures that places and are not marked simultaneously and each place never contains more than one token, takes the form . If all transitions were controllable and observable, the monitor place ensuring the satisfaction of such a constraint would have been that in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8(a)</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, this monitor is not admissible because it has two input arcs going to uncontrollable transitions. Applying the procedure proposed by Moody in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, that is discussed in Section II-B, the more restrictive but admissible monitor, denoted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>(b), is obtained; this monitor imposes the more restrictive constraint .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Safe Operation of the Points</head><p>In this section, we provide a set of constraints that we call safe operation constraints on points, that are necessary to guarantee that a train never goes off the lines. In practice, such constraints define the admissible positions of the movable parts of the points and can be easily expressed in terms of GMECs.</p><p>In particular, for each intermediate track in the station we need two constraints regulating the input of trains in the track from the left and the right I/O tracks, and two constraints regulating the output of trains from the track, after a semaphore has been passed. Now, if we consider the Petri net model of the -tracks railway station in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>, the safe operation constraints on points can be written as follows: <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> where and denote the set of places in Points 1 and 2, respectively.</p><p>Constraints (a) and (b) refer to the entrance of the train in the station, while constraints (c) and (d) refer to the exit of trains from the station.</p><p>In particular, constraint (a), with respect to (b), ensures that once a train has entered the left, with respect to right, I/O track, the entrance to one of the intermediate track is enabled, namely, if either or is marked, then , with respect to is not marked.</p><p>Finally, constraint (c), with respect to (d), ensures that, once a train in the th intermediate track, has passed a semaphore, the position of the point enables its exit. Thus, if , with respect to is marked, then , with respect to is marked. It is easy to verify that the monitors forcing constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> are admissible, thus maximal permissiveness is guaranteed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Local Deadlock</head><p>It can be observed that the addition of monitors enforcing the safe GMECs on tracks may induce local deadlocks.</p><p>Example 10: Let us consider the monitor places and in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8(b</ref>) that have been introduced to enforce the GMECs and , respectively, and applying Moody's transformation to make them controllable and observable. By looking at Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8(b)</ref>, we can immediately observe that whenever place is marked, no train can enter the station since transition is not enabled, and this occurs regardless of the marking of places in the other stretch within the station. Thus, consider the case in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8(b)</ref>, where a train going rightward is within the station (place marked), while a train going leftward is approaching the station (place marked). The train in the station cannot leave and the train approaching cannot enter, thus a deadlock occurs. Note however, that it is perfectly safe to let the approaching train enter, provided it is directed to the empty track.</p><p>This example shows that GMECs do not guarantee a satisfactory policy for the admission of trains into a station. We provide a better solution, by formalizing a set of station admission rules and converting them into a new set of constraints, some of whom also involve the firing vector of the transitions that regulate the input of trains in the stations, and the points within them. The enforce the GMEC m + m 1 and m + m 1, respectively. These monitors have been designed taking into account the uncontrollability and unobservability of transitions, i.e., using Moody's transformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>corresponding Petri net control structure takes the form of monitors with self-loops.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Station Admission Rules</head><p>To make our discussion easier, we use a slightly simplified model of the railway station reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref> that is obtained from the detailed model by simply grouping together some places.</p><p>The station admission rules preventing the net from deadlock may be briefly summarized as follows.</p><p>(1) No more than trains should be simultaneously present in the station including the I/O tracks. Assume, in fact, that trains are in the inner tracks (places are marked): if a further train arrives from outside entering an I/O track (e.g., fires marking place ) the only way we have to forbid its entrance into an inner track, thus avoiding a collision, is that of switching off the right points. In fact, the transitions outputting place are not controllable and we can disable them only acting on the right points. However, in such a way no train may cross over the right points and we reach a deadlock.</p><p>Analogously, assume that only inner tracks contain a train but that the left (with respect to, right) I/O track contains a train directed rightward (with respect to, leftward): if a further train arrives from outside entering the right (with respect to, left) I/O track, a collision will eventually occur.</p><p>(2) No train may arrive from outside entering the left (with respect to, right) I/O track if one inner track is nonempty and the left (with respect to, right) points is enabling the flow of trains towards the nonempty track. These informal rules can be converted into a set of formal constraints: <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> where apart from the constraint due to the first rule that is a GMEC, all the other constraints also involve the firing vector and the corresponding monitors can be computed using the theory reported in Section II-C.</p><p>The control places corresponding to constraints (8) should be added to the net in place of the capacity monitors relative to all tracks within the station [e.g., those corresponding to places , etc., in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8(b)</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. LIVENESS CONSTRAINTS</head><p>In this section, we focus our attention on the problem of global deadlock avoidance. In fact, it is easy to verify that although the control logic designed in the previous section avoids local deadlocks, when too many trains are admitted within a network several blocking conditions may occur.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Skeleton Net</head><p>For this type of analysis, as we have already mentioned in Section I, it is not convenient to use the detailed model of the open loop plant (the railway systems) with the additional control structure (monitors and monitors with self-loop) designed in the previous section.</p><p>In particular, we abstract the previous model representing each station and each track by means of two places, whose token contents represent the number of trains directed leftward and rightward. The net structure consisting of the control places designed in the previous section is also abstracted as monitors that limit the capacity of the places representing tracks and stations.</p><p>The detailed models of a single track, of a double track, of a station of capacity , and of a deviation module in the skeleton net are reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref>. Here, the monitors (dotted places) limit the number of trains within tracks and stations according to  each track or station capacity. Note that in the deviation module, representing a branch of the net, we assume for simplicity that each track is a single track, and only two choices are possible. The generalization of such a module is trivial and is not discussed here for sake of brevity.</p><p>We also observe that at this level of abstraction all transitions can be considered as controllable and observable.</p><p>The skeleton net associated to a given railway system is obtained as the composition of the above elementary modules plus an additional place that limits the total number of trains in the station. Note that since the entrance to each module is controllable and observable, we can assume that all transitions in the skeleton net are controllable and observable. The following example clarifies this.</p><p>Example 11: Consider the railway system sketched in Fig. 11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, that represents a short segment between the stations of Chilivani and Olbia, in Sardinia, Italy. It consists of four stations, where the first one is a three-tracks station, while the others are two-tracks stations. All intermediate tracks are single tracks, apart from the second one, where two trains may travel in opposite directions simultaneously.</p><p>The skeleton Petri net model of the network is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>, where the monitor place contains the maximum number of trains that may be allowed into the network.</p><p>It is easy to verify using this skeleton model that when different modules are put together several blocking conditions may occur. Consider the case in which and two trains are in the station directed towards station (place contains two tokens) and one train has already left station and is moving towards station (place contains one token). When such a marking is reached places and are empty and the net reaches a partial deadlock. Note that the set of places is an empty deadlock. We now prove the following result.</p><p>Theorem 12: The skeleton net associated to a given railway network is an ES PR net.</p><p>Proof: First, we observe that the Petri net obtained from the skeleton net removing all monitor places is a S P net. In fact, it is a strongly connected state machine with set of places , and where all circuits contain the idle place .</p><p>Second, in the skeleton net, all monitors are relative to minimal-support positive GMECs only involving places representing a track or a station (places in ) and have only ordinary output arcs.</p><p>Example 13: Let us consider again the skeleton net in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>. The net obtained removing from the skeleton net all monitor places is an ordinary and strictly connected state machine with two circuits-both containing -and . Moreover, in the case of the skeleton net reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>, we have eight resource places, i.e., corresponding to the minimal-support positive GMECs: and .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Liveness-Enforcing Monitor Computation</head><p>In this section, we present a technique based on the analysis of the skeleton net, to determine a maximally permissive liveness enforcing control policy.</p><p>To ensure liveness of the model, we refer to Proposition 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, stating that given a marked ES PR net , if a transition is dead for a reachable marking , then there exists a reachable marking and a siphon whose places are empty at .</p><p>We then adopt a standard technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> to enforce liveness: we determine if there are siphons in the net that can become empty and if so add a monitor to control them and prevent this. In general cases, there are two problems with this technique: first of all, the new monitors may create new siphons that may need to be controlled as well; second, the addition of new monitors may lead to a net that is not an ES PR net any more. However, Theorem 7 provides an efficient and immediate test to verify when the iterative procedure may be efficiently continued. In fact, we only need to verify that each additional constraint only involves places in and each additional monitor has only ordinary output arcs.</p><p>1) A Linear Algebraic Characterization of Empty Siphons: Now, before going into detail about the iterative procedure used to compute the liveness-enforcing monitors, we first present a linear algebraic technique to compute empty siphons. The proposed procedure is based on integer programming and does not require the exhaustive enumeration of all siphons, whose number is too large even for small nets. Although solving a linear integer optimization problem is still an NP complete problem (as is siphon enumeration), we observed that in practice the integer programming approach is much more efficient. This technique is inspired by other linear algebraic approaches appeared in the literature, in particular, by the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>First of all, we observe that in the case of an ES PR net, such as the skeleton net we are examining, there are P-semiflows corresponding to the monitor places . Thus, the reachable set of the net can be approximated as where each column of the matrix contains a P-semiflow and is a vector whose components represent the token content of each semiflow.</p><p>In the case of the net in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>, there are nine P-semiflows corresponding to the monitor places shown as dashed circles. The places in the support of each semiflow are shown within a rectangle, except for the semiflow corresponding to whose support contains all places in the net.</p><p>Although we cannot formally prove that , if we can enforce that no deadlock marking is reachable, then no reachable marking may be a deadlock. Thus, in the following, we use the previous equation as a larger approximation of the marking reachability. Note that it may also be possible to give a better approximation of the reachability set using the potentially reachable set, as mentioned in Section II-A: however, this requires introducing an additional integer unknown vector (the firing count vector).</p><p>To determine if there are siphons that need to be controlled, one may use the following nonlinear integer program <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> where and are the unknowns, and is a vector whose th component is 1 (with respect to, ) if the th component of is positive (with respect to, null, negative). The equation ensures that is the characteristic vector of a siphon , the second equation ensures that belongs to the set , and the equation ensures that is not the empty set. Thus, a solution of this program with optimal value corresponds to a reachable marking such that the siphon with characteristic vector is empty.</p><p>The nonlinearity of the program is an undesirable feature that makes solving it a hard task. We convert it to an equivalent (linear) integer program <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> where and (for the net in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref> and<ref type="figure"></ref> ). We claim (a formal proof can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>) that the program (9) has an optimal solution such that if and only if the program <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> has an admissible solution. In fact, the first constraint in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> is perfectly equivalent to the first constraint in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, while the new constraint in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> (the third one) ensures that for all holds, i.e., either and or (exclusive or) and . The objective function chosen for the program <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> ensures that only minimal siphons are computed.</p><p>2) Monitors Computation: Now, let us present in detail the iterative procedure that enables us to compute the liveness-enforcing monitors. Therefore, we start with a value of . We evaluate if there are siphons that may become empty by solving an integer linear programming problem of the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithm 14 (Liveness-Enforcing Monitors</head><p>For any siphon , we compute the resulting GMEC preventing it to be empty. If only contains places in , we compute the incidence matrix of its monitor place . If the monitor place only has ordinary output arcs, then both statements (a) and (b) of Theorem 7 hold, and the closedloop net belongs to the ES PR class. In such a case, we add a new monitor to the net to prevent the siphon from becoming empty. After a few steps the procedure converges to a live net. We increase the value of of one token and continue the procedure.</p><p>Note that program <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> gives only sufficient conditions for liveness (and not necessary) due the approximation of the reachability set with the larger set of invariant markings. However, if a solution is found, this solution is maximally permissive: if the siphon is controlled by the monitor it never gets empty, the monitor is behavioral redundant.</p><p>Proposition 15: The liveness enforcing policy computed by Algorithm 14 is maximally permissive.</p><p>Proof: The monitors added by Algorithm 14 prevent the system from reaching a marking belonging to the invariant set and such that a siphon becomes empty. Note that since the skeleton net contains only controllable and observable transitions, this monitor is also maximally permissive, i.e., it only blocks transitions that yields . Now, if is not reachable, then the monitor is redundant and does not modify the behavior of the net. On the contrary, if is reachable, then the monitor effectively prevents reaching a deadlock condition in a maximally permissive way.</p><p>Example 16: We apply the proposed procedure to the application of interest here. We found out that the procedure could be successfully applied up to the case in which is initially marked with tokens, in the sense that by adding new monitors, the net is always an ES PR net, and after a finite number of steps, the net converges to a structure where no siphon may become empty.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table">I</ref>, we have reported the siphons computed for varying from 3 to 7 and the corresponding GMECs. Note that when , no siphon is determined being the net live when no more than two trains are contemporary contained in it. When , the procedure finds out a siphon that cannot be controlled by a monitor with ordinary output arcs, thus we have to stop because assumption (a) of Theorem 7 is violated. More precisely, when , we determine and the corresponding </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Discussion</head><p>As already mentioned in Section I, a deadlock avoidance scheme similar to our approach has been recently proposed by Park and Reveliotis in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. The procedure in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> is more general than ours, but requires solving an IPP with a larger number of binary variables, that are those that significantly increase the computational complexity of the procedure. In particular, while in our approach, the number of binary variables is , in the approach by Park and Reveliotis the number of binary variables is equal to . Thus, we suggest that the two procedures may be used in conjunction. So, we first start with our procedure, and whenever a monitor is placed with only ordinary Pre arcs and satisfying the necessary and sufficient conditions (NSC) is derived, then we go on with it. On the contrary, if at a certain step we find out that a monitor with nonordinary Pre arcs are not satisfying, the NSC should be added, then we switch to the approach proposed by Park and Reveliotis.</p><p>In the example discussed above, we do not apply the procedure by Park and Reveliotis because using our procedure we are able to ensure liveness of the model for a number of trains up to seven and it can be easily seen via numerical simulations, that it is desirable to allow no more than five trains in the network to bound the time it takes a train to go from one end station to the other one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Numerical Simulations</head><p>In this section, we present the results of some numerical simulation performed via the software SIRPHYCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. During numerical simulations, we associate a time delay to each transition, corresponding to the time a train requires to cross over a given segment, or equivalently, in the case of the points models, it denotes the time required to change the enabled track. More precisely, we assume stochastic transitions, with an exponentially distribute law, thus the chosen time delays represent average values.</p><p>We assume that one train starts moving from station to station while trains (with ) are moving from station to . We compute the traversal time of first train, i.e., the time it spends within the net before reaching station and leaving the net. This traversal time grows with , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13</ref>. In particular, we observe that the traversal time significantly increases for , i.e., we may conclude that is the maximum number of trains the considered net can effectively manage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have studied the problem of modeling railway networks with Petri nets so as to apply supervisory control to automatically design a controller that both ensures safeness and liveness. Transitions have been assumed either (un)controllable or (un)observable so as to represent sensors and semaphores.</p><p>The proposed procedure is based on local computations applied to a distributed net, thus making it easily extensible to even large dimensions problems. We used both generalized mutual exclusion constraints and constraints involving the firing vector, and the corresponding control structures take the form of monitor places.</p><p>Then, we provide a high-level description of a railway network using a skeleton net that belongs to a particular class of Petri nets, the ES PR nets. The main feature of this class is that liveness properties can be easily characterized and verified by structural analysis. One of the main contributions of this work consists in the derivation of the necessary and sufficient condition that guarantee that a closed-loop net, constructed adding a monitor place to an ES PR net, still belongs to this class. This characterization provides a useful test when enforcing liveness by applying an original recursive procedure based on siphon analysis.</p><p>Our future research in this area will be twofold. First, we plan to focus on the optimization of the net operations. In particular, we will consider the problem of scheduling the departures and the stops of the trains so as to minimize the time spent to run along certain roads, also taking into account how popular the different ways are. Since Petri nets are an efficient tool for the solution of scheduling problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, this would provide within a unified framework the solution to the most relevant problems that occur in the railway management, e.g., safeness, liveness, and scheduling.</p><p>Second, we plan to make a detailed comparison among our approach and other control approaches that can be derived considering other classes of Petri nets, such as S PR <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, ES PR <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, S LSPR nets <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, etc.</p></div>

Let be the monitor place corresponding to the minimalsupport and positive GMEC . The closed-loop net , where , is an ES PR net if and only if it holds that: a) ; b) , i.e., . Proof: (if) We need to prove that the closed-loop net satisfies the four conditions of Definition 3. The first two conditions are trivially verified. The third is verified by assumption (a). Finally, assumption (b), together with the Lemmas 5 and 6 implies that hence the fourth condition is verified-(only if)-If assumption (a) is violated, then the third condition in Definition 3 is not satisfied, while if assumption (b) is violated, then the fourth condition is not satisfied.</figDesc></figure>

They are used to make sure that no car has been left within a section. In our exposition, we are slightly simplifying the problem.</p></note>
