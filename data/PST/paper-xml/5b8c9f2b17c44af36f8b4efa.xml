<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HE era of internet-of-things (IoT) opens up the oppor- tunity for a number of promising applications in smart buildings, health monitoring, and predictive maintenance. In the context of wireless access to IoT devices, radio frequency (RF) technology is the main enabler. Furthermore, the exponential growth in the data traffic puts tremendous pressure on the existing global telecommunication networks and the expectations from the fifth generation (5G) of wireless networks. Also, it is remarkable that most of the data consumption/generation, which are related to IoT applications, occurs in indoor environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Motivated by this, optical wireless communications (OWC), and especially visible light communications (VLC) or infrared communications (IRC), have been recognized as promising alternative/complementary technologies to RF, in order to provide access to IoT devices in indoor applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Consequently, VLC/IRC are envisioned to be used in a vast number of scenarios, such as in offices, commercial centers, airports, hospitals, industrial environments, in-flight internet etc.</p><p>The data rates reported for indoor VLC/IRC networking are much higher than those achieved by WiFi, especially when client and server are closely located. Apart from the very high data rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the advantages of OWC technologies include: i) increase of available bandwidth, ii) easy bandwidth reuse, iii) increase of energy efficiency and considerable energy savings, iv) no RF contamination, and v) free from RF interference. Moreover, nowadays, light emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodetectors (PDs) tend to be considerably cheaper than their RF counterparts, while the cost-efficiency is further improved due to the potential use of the existing lighting infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Due to the strong dependence of the IoT on wireless access, their applications are constrained by the finite battery capacity of the involved devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Therefore, energy harvesting (EH), which refers to harnessing energy from the environment or other sources and converting to electrical energy, is a critical part of the operation and maintenance of the IoT devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Energy harvesting is regarded as a disruptive technological paradigm to prolong the lifetime of energyconstrained wireless networks, which apart from offering a promising solution for energy-sustainability of wireless nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, it also reduces the operational expenses (OPEX) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. However, the main disadvantage of traditional EH methods is that they rely on natural resources, such as solar and wind, which are uncontrollable. For this reason, harvesting energy from sources, that intentionally generate an electromagnetic (EM) field, seems to be an interesting alternative. The major wireless charging techniques are inductive coupling, magnetic resonance coupling, RF radiation, and light waves, with the first two being appropriate only in near-field power transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>An important challenge associated with the wireless powered systems is the reduction of the unwanted interference, EM pollution (e.g., light pollution <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>), and exposure of people and other living things to potentially injurious EM radiation, which calls for conscious utilization of the radiated energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. This can be achieved by unifying the information and energy transmission, which is the basis of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Note that SWIPT, when properly optimized, can result in significant gains in terms of spectral efficiency, time delay, energy consumption, and interference management, by superposing information and power transfer. However, this approach, calls for the redesign of existing wireless networks, which has been initally investigated by the pioneer works <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. For example, when the aim is to harvest energy from RF signals, 0000-0000 c 201X IEEE which also transfer information by using single-antenna nodes, two fundamental receiver structures have been proposed, named: power-splitting (PS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and time-switching (TSw) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. PS is based on the splitting of the signal's power into two streams, while in TSw, using a switching key at the receiver, for a portion of time the received signal is used solely for energy harvesting. Note that these strategies create an interesting trade-off between the the rate and the harvested energy, which is investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Related Research and Motivation</head><p>Although RF based wireless power transfer is a well investigated topic in the last years <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, optical wireless power transfer is a new topic and only a few works have been reported so far in the open literature. In the fundamental paper of Fakidis et. al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, the visible and infrared parts of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum was used for OWPT, through laser or LEDs at the transmitter and solar cells at the receiver side. Also, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> energy harvesting was performed, by using the existing lighting fixtures for indoor IoT applications. Moreover, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, distributed laser charging is discussed, with the main emphasis being given on the benefits of lightwave power transfer, compared to the other three major wireless charging techniques, i.e., inductive coupling, magnetic resonance coupling, and microwave radiation. Furthermore, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, a hybrid VLC-RF system with light energy harvesting over the downlink is considered. The secrecy outage performance of the RF-based uplink is investigated, while considering the randomness of the locations of the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper.</p><p>Regarding the simultaneous optical wireless information and power transfer, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> the sum rate maximization problem has been solved in a downlink VLC system. However, in this paper the utilized energy harvesting model does not correspond to that of the solar panel, where only the direct current (DC) component of the modulated light can be used for energy harvesting, in contrast to the alternating current (AC) component, which carries the information. The separation of the DC and AC components was efficiently achieved by the self-powered solar panel receiver, proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, where it was proved that the use of the solar panel for communication does not limit its energy harvesting capabilities. Thus, the utilization of the power-splitting in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> reduces the EH efficiency. Moreover, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> an oversimplified energy harvesting model was used, assuming that the harvested energy is linearly proportional to the received optical power, while an optimization of the splitting technique was not presented. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, the implementation of a solar panel receiver prototype was reported, which is able to gather energy and receive data simultaneously. Also, the field-of view (FoV) of the photodetector (PD) was considered in the model analysis. Furthermore, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, a dual-hop hybrid VLC/RF communication system is considered, in order to extend the coverage. In these papers, besides detecting the information over the VLC link, the relay is also able to harvest energy from the first-hop VLC link, by extracting the DC component of the received optical signal. This energy can be used to re-transmit the data to a mobile terminal over the second-hop RF link. Also, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> the proposed hybrid system was optimized, in terms of data rate maximization, while in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> the packet loss probability was evaluated.</p><p>Taking into account the aforementioned research, it is evident that the theoretical investigation of simultaneous information and power transfer using lightwave technology is still in its infancy. More specifically, appropriate strategies are required to increase the efficiency, as well as an optimization framework that takes into account and regulates the tradeoff between the harvested energy and the communication performance. It is noted that this dual-purpose exploitation of light is fundamentally different to the corresponding use of RF signals, due to divergent channels characteristics, transmission/reception devices and EH model, among others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Contribution</head><p>In this paper, we present -for first time-a framework for the simultaneous optical wireless information and power transfer, called from now on as simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT). More specifically, the contribution can be summarized as follows:</p><p>• We propose novel and fundamental strategies in order to increase the feasibility and efficiency of SLIPT, when a solar panel-based receiver is used. These strategies are performed at the transmitter or at the receiver, or at both sides, named adjusting transmission, adjusting reception, and coordinated adjustment of transmission and reception. • Regarding adjusting transmission two policies are proposed: i. Time-splitting (TS), which is based on the separation of the transmission block in two distinct phases, where in each of them the main focus is either on communication or energy transfer. Although inspired by TSw in RF SWIPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, SLIPT TS presents significant differences compared to TSw, mainly due to the differentation of the utilized RF and lightwave technologies. More specifically, TS does not use a switching key and is referred to the adjustment of the transmission parameters, i.e., the DC bias and peak amplitude of the transmitted optical signal at each phase. Also, the separation of the DC and AC components at the receiver is achieved in parallel, by using an inductor and a capacitor at the EH and information decoding branch, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. This justifies the utilization of the term "splitting" instead of "switching". Moreover, in TSw, one of the two phases is dedicated solely to information transmission, while during this phase the harvested energy is zero. This is not the case in TS, where energy can be harvested in both phases due to the DC bias, which is always higher than zero. ii. Time-splitting with DC bias optimization, which is a generalization of TS. In contrast to SWIPT, where the TS strategy and adjustment of the related parameters takes place at the receiver's side, TS in SLIPT refers to the adaptation of specific parameters of the transmitted signal.</p><p>• Regarding adjusting reception, the field-of-view (FoV) adjustment policy is proposed. • For the coordinated adjustment of transmission and reception strategy, we propose the joint optimization of the former policies at both transmitter and receiver. • In order to balance the fundamental trade-off between harvested energy and quality-of-service (QoS) (e.g. data rate and signal-to-noise plus interference ratio (SINR)), two optimization problems are formulated and optimally solved, which aim at maximizing the harvested energy, while achieving the required user's QoS. • Finally, simulation results are provided to compare the proposed optimal strategies with the fixed policies and verify their effectiveness. It is highlighted that, although the proposed strategies are quite general and can be applied in different applications, the provided analysis and the simulation results focus on indoor applications through VLC or IRC.</p></div>

Section III introduces the SLIPT strategies. The optimization problem of harvested energy maximization is formulated and solved in section IV. Section V presents and discusses the simulation results and finally, section VI concludes the paper with some remarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM AND CHANNEL MODEL</head><p>We consider the downlink transmission of a SLIPT VLC/IRC system, consisting of one LED and a single user. We also assume that the user is equipped with the functionality of energy harvesting. The SLIPT transmitter/receiver design is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, while the SLIPT downlink communication is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Optical Wireless Transmission</head><p>Let m(t) denote the modulated electrical signal that corresponds to the bit stream from the information source. A DC bias B is added to m(t) to ensure that the resulting signal is non-negative, before being used to modulate the optical intensity of the LED and regulate the LED in the proper operation mode. The transmitted optical signal from the LED is <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> P t (t</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">) = P LED [B + m(t)],<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where P LED is the LED power per unit (in W/A) of electrical current B + m(t). The electrical signal varies around the DC bias B ∈ [I L , I H ] with peak amplitude A, where I L is the minimum and I H is the maximum input bias currents, correspondingly. In order to avoid clipping distortion by the nonlinearity of the LED, by restraining the input electrical signal to the LED within the linear region of the LED operation, the following limitation is induced </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A ≤ min(B -I L , I H -B).<label>(2)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Channel Model</head><p>The channel gain is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">h = L r d 2 R 0 (ϕ)T s (ψ)g(ψ) cos(ψ),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where ϕ is the irradiance angle, ψ is the incidence angle, L r is the physical area of the photo-detector, d is the transmission distance from the LED to the illuminated surface of the photodetector, T s (ψ) is the gain of the optical filter and g(ψ) represents the gain of the optical concentrator, given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">g(ψ) = ρ 2 sin 2 (Ψ fov ) , 0 ≤ ψ ≤ Ψ fov , 0, ψ &gt; Ψ fov ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>with ρ and Ψ fov being the refractive index and FoV, respectively. From (4), we see that as the FoV is reduced, the gain within the FoV is increased. Also in (3), R 0 (ϕ) is the Lambertian radiant intensity of the LED, given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">R 0 (ϕ) = ξ + 1 2π cos ξ ϕ, (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>where ξ is the order of Lambertian emission, and is given by the semi-angle at half illuminance of the LED, Φ 1/2 , as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ξ = - 1 log 2 (cos(Φ 1/2 )) .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>For example, Φ 1/2 = 60 deg corresponds to ξ = 1. From (3) we can observe that if d and R 0 (ϕ) are fixed, the most effective way to increase h are to increase the detector area L r and increase the concentrator gain, e.g., by decreasing the FoV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Received Electrical SINR</head><p>The electrical current i r (t) at the output of the PD can be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> where η is the photo-detector responsivity in A/W, P o is the received optical signal from other sources, e.g. other neighboring LEDs, I DC is the DC component, i(t) is the AC component, and n(t) is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), which is created from background shot noise and thermal noise.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">i r = η(hP t (t) + P o ) + n(t) = I DC (t) + i(t) + n(t),</formula><p>The AC component i(t) is composed of two terms, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">i(t) = i 1 (t) + i 2 (t),<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">i 1 (t) = ηhP LED m(t)<label>(9)</label></formula><p>is due to the dedicated LED, and i 2 (t) is due to other interfering sources.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Energy Harvesting Model</head><p>As it has already been mentioned the photocurrent consists of both the DC and AC signals. In order to perform energy harvesting, the DC component is blocked by a capacitor and passes through the energy harvesting branch <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The harvested energy is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_12">E = f I DC V oc ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>with f being the fill factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">I DC = I 1 + I 2<label>(12)</label></formula><p>being the DC component of the output current, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">I 1 = ηh n P LED B (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>is due to the dedicated LED, while I 2 is due to different light sources, e.g. neighboring LEDs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. SLIPT STRATEGIES</head><p>In this section, we propose fundamental SLIPT strategies for use in VLC/IRC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Adjusting Transmission</head><p>First, we introduce two policies for the adjusting transmission strategy, named time-splitting (TS) and TS with DC bias optimization.</p><p>1) TS: According to the TS policy the received optical signal is used for a portion of time solely for energy harvesting, instead of decoding. During this period of time the LED transmits by using the maximum DC bias, in order to maximize the harvested energy by the receiver.</p><p>Let T tot denote the block transmission time, which is measured in seconds. Also, τ (unitless value) is the portion of time that is allocated solely to the first phase, in which information transmission is enabled. Thus, the duration of the first phase in seconds is T = τ T tot . Without loss of generality, we assume that T tot = 1 second in the sequel. The two distinct phases are discussed in detail below.</p><p>Phase 1: The AC component of the received signal is used for information decoding and the DC component for energy harvesting. Let A 1 and B 1 ∈ [I L , I H ] denote the peak amplitude of m(t) and DC bias, respectively. During Phase 1, the aim is to maximize the received SINR, denoted by γ 1 . Since SINR is an increasing function with respect to A 1 , then A 1 takes its maximum value, which, considering (2) is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">A 1 = I H -I L 2<label>(15)</label></formula><p>and similarly,</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">B 1 = I H + I L 2 . (<label>16</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>The duration of this phase T ∈ [0, 1 second] can be optimized according to the QoS requirements. For a specific value of T , the amount of harvested energy is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">E [1] TS = f T (ηhP LED I H + I L 2 + I 2 )V t × ln(1 + ηhP LED IH+IL 2 + I 2 I 0 ).<label>(17)</label></formula><p>Phase 2: In the time period 1 -T , the aim is to maximize the harvested energy, which is an increasing function with respect to B. Thus, during Phase 2 the transmitter eliminates the AC part and the and maximizes the DC bias, i.e., A = 0 and B = I H , with the SINR being γ 2 = 0, where A 2 and B 2 ∈ [I L , I H ] denote the values of A and B, respectively. </p><formula xml:id="formula_21">Dynamic T ∈ (0, 1] Dynamic T ∈ (0, 1] Fixed T = 1 Dynamic T ∈ (0, 1] Dynamic T ∈ (0, 1]</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DC Bias (B)</head><p>Fixed in each phase</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">B 1 = I H +I L 2 , B 2 = I H Dynamic in the 1- st, fixed in the 2-nd phase B 1 ∈ [I L , I H ], B 2 = I H Fixed B 1 = B 2 = B Fixed in each phase B 1 = I H +I L 2 , B 2 = I H Dynamic in the 1- st, fixed in the 2-nd phase B 1 ∈ [I L , I H ], B 2 = I H Peak amplitude (A)</formula><p>Fixed in each phase</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">A 1 = I H -I L 2 , A 2 = 0 Dynamic in the 1- st, fixed in the 2-nd phase A 1 ≤ min(B 1 - I L , I H -B 1 ), A 2 = 0 Fixed A 1 = A 2 = A Fixed in each phase A 1 = I H -I L 2 , A 2 = 0 Dynamic in the 1- st, fixed in the 2-nd phase A 1 ≤ min(B 1 - I L , I H -B 1 ), A 2 = 0 Field of view (FoV) Fixed Fixed Dynamic Dynamic in each phase Dynamic in each phase SINR (γ)</formula><p>Fixed in each phase</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">γ 1 = (ηhP LED (I H -I L )) 2 4(P I +σ 2 ) , γ 2 = 0 Dynamic in the 1- st, fixed in the 2-nd phase γ 1 = (ηhP LED A 1 ) 2 P I +σ 2 , γ 2 = 0 Dynamic γ = (ηhP LED A) 2 P I +σ 2 Dynamic in the 1- st, fixed in the 2-nd phase γ 1 = (ηhP LED (I H -I L )) 2 4(P I +σ 2 ) , γ 2 = 0 Dynamic in the 1- st, fixed in the 2-nd phase γ 1 = (ηhP LED A 1 ) 2 P I +σ 2 , γ 2 = 0 Harvested Energy (E) E = f T (ηhP LED B 1 + I 2 )Vt × ln(1 + ηhP LED B 1 +I 2 I 0 ) + f (1 -T )(ηhP LED B 2 + I 2 )Vt × ln(1 + ηhP LED B 2 +I 2 I 0 )</formula><p>Thus, the amount of harvested energy during this phase, is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">E [2] TS =f (1 -T )(ηhP LED I H + I 2 )V t × ln(1 + ηhP LED I H + I 2 I 0 ).<label>(18)</label></formula><p>Considering both phases, the total harvested energy is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">E TS = E [1] TS + E [2] TS .<label>(19)</label></formula><p>2) TS with DC Bias Optimization: This policy is a generalization of TS. During Phase 1, the DC bias is optimized in order to increase the harvested energy, while it simultaneously enables information transfer, i.e., A 1 &gt; 0. In this case, the total harvested energy is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">E TSBO =f T (ηhP LED B 1 + I 2 )V t × ln(1 + ηhP LED B 1 + I 2 I 0 ) + E [2]</formula><p>TS .</p><p>(20)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Adjusting Reception</head><p>In this subsection, we propose the adjustment of the field of view (FoV) policy as a reception strategy, in order to balance the trade-off between harvested energy and SINR. The control of FoV is particularly important, especially when there are extra light sources in the serving area <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, e.g. neighboring LEDs that serve other users. For the practical and efficient implementation of this policy, electrically controllable liquid crystal (LC) lenses is a promising technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>When the aim is to maximize the SINR, the FoV is tuned up to receive the beam of the dedicated LED only (if possible), in order to reduce the beam overlapping. This is achieved by tuning the FoV to the narrowest setting, that allows reception only from that LED.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Coordinated Adjustment of Transmission and Reception</head><p>Considering <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, it is revealed that both SINR and harvested energy -apart from A 1 , B 1 and Talso depend on the selection of Ψ fov , despite the utilized adjusting transmission technique. This dependence motivates the coordinated adjustment of transmission and reception, i.e. the coordination between the strategy III-A1 or III-A2 and III-B, which results in the following two policies, i.e.,</p><p>• Policy 1: TS with tunable FoV (III-A1 and III-B) • Policy 2: TS with DC bias optimization and tunable FoV (III-A2 and III-B).</p><p>Note that in both policies, during Phase 2, where the aim is to maximize the harvested energy, the FoV setting that maximizes</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">E [2]</formula><p>TS should be used. This is not necessarily the widest setting, because although it increases the received beams (if there are neighboring LEDs), it reduces g(ψ). On the other hand, the preferable FoV setting during phase 1, denoted by Ψ fov,1 , cannot be straightforwardly determined, since it also depends on the required QoS.</p><p>For clarity, the proposed strategies and policies are concluded in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. SLIPT OPTIMIZATION</head><p>SLIPT induces a trade-off between harvested energy and QoS. In the present work, we focus on the coordinated adjustment of transmission and reception strategy, which can be considered as a generalization of the other SLIPT strategies. Regarding the QoS, two different criteria are taken into account, namely SINR and information rate. More specifically, since only Phase 1 is used for information transmission (with duration T ≤ 1 second), a lower bound of the achievable rate in bits/second/Hz, within a block with T tot = 1 second, can be expressed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_29">R = T log 2 1 + e 2π γ 1 . (<label>21</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_30">)</formula><p>Note that the combination of TS with DC bias optimization and/or adjustment of the FoV creates an interesting trade-off among the rate, the SINR, and the harvested energy. Thus, given a harvested energy requirement, increasing the SINR might lead to a reduction of the rate and vise versa. Also, for a specific SINR value, a different rate-energy region is created. For example, in applications with low rate requirements, considering solely the rate-harvested energy region, might lead to selection of a point that does not satisfy the practical SINR requirement to enable detection. In that case, the optimal solution belongs in a different rate-energy subregion, that corresponds to a different SINR value, for which, given the harvested energy requirement, the rate might be lower. This is because, in order to satisfy the SINR requirement, B and/or FoV are decreased, while the duration of the second phase (1-T ) is increased, such as to harvest the same energy, which is turn might lead to a reduction of the rate. Specifically, the achievable rate-energy-SINR region can be written as ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_41">22</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_42">23</ref>), for Policy 1 and Policy 2, respectively. Next, we seek to balance the aforementioned trade-off among the harvested energy, the achievable rate, and the SINR, by maximizing the harvested energy, while achieving the required information rate and SINR for the two policies of coordinated adjustment of transmission and reception. The corresponding optimization problems are formulated and optimally solved in the next subsections.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SIMULATIONS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>We assume the downlink SLIPT system of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, where the transmitter plane is parallel to the receiver one, i.e., ϕ = ψ. In the same room there are N other LEDs, which simultaneously use the same frequency band. The distance between each of them and from the dedicated LED is denoted by D.  Regarding the neighboring LEDs, we assume that the DC bias and the peak amplitude are denoted by A ′ n and B ′ n mA, n ∈ {1, ..., N }, respectively with A ′ n = B ′ n , while the rest parameters are equal to those of the dedicated LED. Furthermore, the channel between them and the user's receiver, denoted by h n is modeled according to (3), using the corresponding parameters. Thus, when the widest FoV setting is selected, P I and I 2 are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">P I = N n=1 (ηh n P LED A ′ n ) 2<label>(39)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">I 2 = N n=1 ηh n P LED B ′ n ,<label>(40)</label></formula><p>otherwise their values are zero. Unless stated otherwise, the simulation parameters are given by Table <ref type="table">II</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. the performance of both optimized policies of Section III-C are compared for N = 1, A ′ n = 12 mA, and B ′ n = 0 A while they are also presented against the case of fixed A 1 , B 1 , T 1 , and Ψ fov,1 , which is considered as the baseline policy. More specifically, the harvested energy is plotted against the rate threshold. For this reason, the solutions of the optimization problems ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_31">24</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_36">28</ref>) have been used. The derived curves correspond to the rate-energy boundaries achieved by both optimized policies of Section III-C, which are given in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_41">22</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_42">23</ref>), for γ ′ 1 ≥ γ th . As it is observed, both policies significantly outperform the baseline for both values of Ψ fov,1 . Regarding the baseline, the value Ψ fov,1 = 50 deg reduces the harvested energy compared to Ψ fov,1 = 30 deg, because g(ψ) decreases and thus, cancels the benefit of receiving the beam of the neighboring LED. For this reason, in this case case, none of the policies prefer the widest FoV setting. Also, the baseline policy with Ψ fov,1 = 50 deg is infeasible for medium and high values of R th , because the rate threshold cannot be reached, due to the received interference. Interestingly, Policy 2 outperforms Policy 1, especially for the high region of R th , which is due to the extra degrees of freedom.</p><p>On the other hand, as it is observed by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>, which is for N = 6, A ′ n = 12 mA, and B ′ n = 0 A, in comparison to Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, as the energy that can be harvested by neighboring LEDs increases, the receiver tends to prefer the widest option, especially during phase 1, when the proposed policies are applied. This is because this setting leads to a considerably higher amount of harvested energy, which is also verified by noticing that the baseline policy with Ψ fov,1 = 50 deg is now superior to the baseline policy with Ψ fov,1 = 30 deg, as long as it is feasible. Also, it is noticed that the harvested energy is not continuous for the whole range of the required rate. The reason for this is that, when the rate requirement is small, the receiver prefers the widest FoV setting for both phases. However, as the rate requirement increases, the receiver prefers the smallest FoV setting for the second phase.</p><p>Similar conclusions can be obtained by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>, where the harvested energy is plotted against the number of neighboring LEDS, for A ′ n = 6 mA, and B ′ n = 6 mA. For this specific setup, the baseline with Ψ fov,1 = 50 deg is not feasible, and, thus, it is omitted. We notice here that for a small number of neighboring LEDs, the harvested energy remains constant, since the receiver prefers the smallest FoV setting. However, as the number of neighboring LEDs increases, the receiver prefers the widest FoV setting and the harvested energy increases with the increase of LEDs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we have proposed and optimized new strategies and policies in order to balance the trade-off between the harvested energy and the QoS, when SLIPT with a solar panel based receiver is utilized. Considering that only the DC component be used for energy harvesting, in contrast to AC component, which carries the information, the proposed optimization framework has focused on the appropriate selection of the DC bias, FoV, as well as the time dedicated solely to energy harvesting. The presented simulation results have verified that the proposed strategies considerably increase the harvested energy, compared to SLIPT with fixed policies. It is worth-noting that SLIPT creates a vast number of challenges and future research directions, such as the investigation of performance of specific types of solar cells (e.g., organic) and the utilization of separate receivers for information reception and energy harvesting.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
