Different from the traditional centralized control where a central station is employed to control all vehicles, no central station is required for decentralized cooperative control. Therefore, a number of benefits, for example, scalability, robustness, and easy maintenance, can be obtained by employing decentralized cooperative control.</p><p>A crucial task for decentralized cooperative control is to achieve a global group behavior through only local interaction. As a fundamental problem in decentralized cooperative control, consensus has been studied extensively. The main idea of consensus is for a group of vehicles to reach an agreement on some common features, e.g., positions, phases, and attitudes, by negotiating with their local (time-varying) neighbors. Consensus algorithms have been studied for systems with different dynamics under various scenarios. For systems with single-integrator kinematics, the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> studied synchronous consensus while the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> studied asynchronous consensus when the network topology is modeled in a deterministic setting. When proposed approaches can be extended to the formation tracking scenarios where a group of vehicles tracks the virtual leader while maintaining a certain desired geometric formation simultaneously.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a simple but efficient framework to solve the finite-time formation tracking problem with the aid of decentralized sliding mode estimators by expanding on our preliminary work reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Compared with the consensus tracking algorithms in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, the proposed algorithms demonstrate the following advantages: (1) simple, (2) finitetime convergence, (3) reduced information measurements, and (4) mild requirement on the information flow. We first propose and study both first-order and second-order decentralized sliding mode estimators under a directed switching network topology. In particular, we show that the first-order decentralized sliding mode estimator can guarantee accurate position estimation and the second-order decentralized sliding mode estimator can guarantee accurate position and velocity estimation in finite time. Then we propose finite-time formation tracking algorithms based on the decentralized sliding mode estimators. Note that although finitetime consensus was solved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, the algorithms proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> cannot be applied to the case when there exists a dynamic virtual leader in the absence of velocity or acceleration measurements. Note also that a Lyapunov-based approach was used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> to show finite-time consensus. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> focused on undirected fixed or switching network topologies. Furthermore, because accurate estimation can be achieved in finite time when employing the decentralized sliding mode estimators, many formation tracking/flying problems can be easily decoupled into two subtasks, namely, decentralized sliding mode estimation and vehicle desired state tracking, without imposing a stringent condition on the information flow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Graph theory notions</head><p>For a group of n vehicles, the interaction for these vehicles can be modeled by a directed graph G = (V, W ), where V = {v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v n } and W ⊆ V 2 represent, respectively, the vehicle set and the edge set. Each edge denoted as (v i , v j ) means that vehicle j can access the state information of vehicle i, but not necessarily vice versa. Accordingly, vehicle i is a neighbor of vehicle j. We use N j to denote the neighbor set of vehicle j. A directed path is a sequence of edges in a directed graph of the form (v 1 , v 2 ), (v 2 , v 3 ), . . . , where v i ∈ V. A directed graph has a directed spanning tree if there exists at least one vehicle that has directed paths to all other vehicles.</p><p>Two matrices are frequently used to represent the interaction graph: the adjacency matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A = [a ij ] ∈ R n×n with a ij &gt; 0 if (v j , v i ) ∈ W and a ij = 0 otherwise, and the (nonsymmetric) Laplacian matrix L = [ ij ] ∈ R n×n with ii = n j=1,j =i a ij and ij = -a ij , i = j.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">First-order decentralized sliding mode estimator</head><p>In this section, we propose and study a first-order decentralized sliding mode estimator. Here, we assume that all vehicles are in a one-dimensional space for the simplicity of presentation. However, all results are still valid for the high-dimensional space by the introduction of the Kronecker product.</p><p>Assume that there exist n estimators each of which is embedded in an individual vehicle. Assume also that there exists a virtual leader with a (time-varying) position given by r 0 (t) ∈ R available to only a subset of the n vehicles. The objective of this section is to construct a first-order decentralized estimator such that an accurate estimate of the virtual leader's position can be achieved in finite time. It is assumed that r 0 (t) satisfies the following two conditions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">1. r 0 (t) is differentiable. 2. sup t |ṙ 0 (t)| ≤ γ , i.e.</formula><p>, the velocity of the virtual leader is bounded.</p><p>Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, we propose the following first-order decentralized sliding mode estimator as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ṙi (t) = -α n j=0 a ij (t)[r i (t) -rj (t)] -β sgn n j=0 a ij (t)[r i (t) -rj (t)] , i = 1, . . . , n,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where ri (t) ∈ R is the ith vehicle's estimate of r 0 (t), α is a nonnegative constant, β is a positive constant, a ij (t) is the (i, j)th entry of the adjacency matrix A at time t, a i0 (t) &gt; 0 if r 0 (t) is available to the ith vehicle at time t and a i0 (t) = 0 otherwise, sgn(•) is the signum function, and r0 (t) = r 0 (t). The objective of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">1</ref>) is to guarantee that ri (t) → r 0 (t) in finite time.</p><p>Theorem 3.1. Assume that the virtual leader has directed paths to every other vehicle at each time instant. When β &gt; γ , ri (t) = r 0 (t) for every t ≥ T f , where T f = max i {|r i (0)-r 0 (0)|} β-γ .</p><p>Proof. Define ri (t) = ri (t)-r 0 (t). It follows that (1) can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ṙi (t) = -α n j=0 a ij (t)[r i (t) -rj (t)] -β sgn n j=0 a ij (t)[r i (t) -rj (t)] -ṙ0 (t), i = 1, . . . , n.</formula><p>(</p><p>Define r+ (t) = max i ri (t) and r-(t) = min i ri (t). Then the convergence time can be obtained by studying the following three cases:</p><p>Case (i) r+ (0) ≤ 0 and r-(0) ≤ 0. When r+ (0) = r-(0) = 0. It is trivial to show that r+ (t) = r-(t) = 0 for any t &gt; 0. We next study the case when r+ (0) ≤ 0 and r-(0) &lt; 0. It follows from (2) that r+ (t) ≤ 0 for any t &gt; 0 because ṙ+ (t) ≤ -(β -ṙ0 ) ≤ -(β -γ ) &lt; 0 if r+ (t) &gt; 0. By following a similar analysis, we can also get that r-(t) is nondecreasing. Note that when r-(t) &lt; 0, either ṙ-(t) = -ṙ 0 (t) or ṙ-(t) &gt; βγ &gt; 0. We next show that when r-(T ) &lt; 0 for some T &gt; 0, ṙ-(t) = -ṙ 0 (t) only happens at isolated time instants when t ≤ T . We prove this by contradiction.</p><p>Assume that ṙ-(t) = -ṙ 0 (t) for t ∈ [t 1 , t 2 ] where t 1 &lt; t 2 ≤ T . Then there exists some vehicle, labeled as j, with the state r-(t)</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">satisfying ṙj (t) = -ṙ 0 (t) for t ∈ [t 1 , t 3 ], where t 1 &lt; t 3 ≤ t 2 . Note that ṙj (t) = -ṙ 0 (t) implies that n i=0 a ji [r j (t) -ri (t)] = 0 for t ∈ [t 1 , t 3 ] from (2). Because rj (t) = r-(t), it follows that ṙj (t) = -ṙ 0 (t) for t ∈ [t 1 , t 3 ] implies that ri (t) = r-(t), ∀i ∈ N j , for t ∈ [t 1 , t 3 ]</formula><p>. By following a similar analysis, it follows that ri (t) = r-(t), ∀i = 0, . . . , n, for t ∈ [t 1 , t 3 ] if the virtual leader has directed paths to every other vehicle at each time instant, which results in a contradiction because r-(t) &lt; 0 for t ≤ T . Therefore, when r-(T ) &lt; 0, r-(t) will keep increasing at a speed larger than β -γ when t ≤ T except for some isolated time instants. It follows that the maximal convergence time is given by |r -(0)| β-γ . Note that this bound also applies to the case when r-(0) = 0. Case (ii) r+ (0) ≥ 0 and r-(0) ≥ 0. By following a similar analysis to that of Case (i), it can be computed that the maximal convergence time is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">|r + (0)| β-γ .</formula><p>Case (iii). r+ (0) ≥ 0 and r-(0) ≤ 0. By combining Cases (i) and (ii), it can be computed that the maximal convergence time is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">max{|r + (0)|,|r -(0)|} β-γ</formula><p>. Combining the previous three cases completes the proof. Remark 3.2. From the proof of Theorem 3.1, both α and β in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> can be chosen differently for different vehicle i. Assume that the control gains for the ith estimator are α i and β i . When α i ≥ 0 and β i &gt; γ , the convergence time becomes T f = max i {|r i (0)-r 0 (0)}| <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">1</ref>) is discontinuous, which is different from ṙ0 (t) by noting that ṙ0 (t) might be continuous. However,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">min i {β i }-γ . Remark 3.3. Note that ṙi (t) given in (</formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">t 2 t 1 ṙi (t)dt = t 2 t 1 ṙ0 (t)dt, i = 1, . . . , n for any t 2 &gt; t 1 ≥ T f</formula><p>. Therefore, when t ≥ T f , ṙi (t) can be used to replace ṙ0 (t) in integration related applications for t ≥ T f . Here, the replacement of ṙi (t) for ṙ0 (t) can also be interpreted as follows. Note that ṙi (t) can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">ṙi (t) = ṙ0 (t) + f (t),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where f (t) is a switching signal satisfying</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">t 2 t 1 f (t)dt = 0 for any t 2 &gt; t 1 ≥ T f</formula><p>and the frequency of f (t) is infinitely large. Note also that an integration-based system can be considered an ideal low-pass filter. Therefore, f (t) will be filtered out with the lowpass filter.</p><p>Remark 3.4. Inspired by the analysis in Theorem 3.1, we next study a finite-time leaderless consensus algorithm for singleintegrator kinematics. Consider a group of n agents with singleintegrator kinematics given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">ṙi (t) = u i (t), i = 1, . . . , n,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where r i (t) is the position of ith vehicle and u i (t) is the corresponding control input at time t. Leaderless consensus is achieved in finite time if there exists a positive t such that r i (t) = r j (t) for t &gt; t. Define</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">g(t) =</formula><p>1, G(t) has a directed spanning tree, 0, otherwise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>By using</head><formula xml:id="formula_14">u i = -α n j=1 a ij (t)(r i -r j ) -β sgn n j=1 a ij (t)(r i -r j ) ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where α is a nonnegative constant and β is a positive constant for (4), r i (t) = r j (t), i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n}, holds for every t &gt; σ (i.e., leaderless consensus is achieved in finite time), if</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">σ 0 g(t)dt &gt; max i r i (0)-min i r i (0) 2β .</formula><p>The proof is similar to that of Theorem 3.1 by showing that over a time interval [t 1 , t 2 ] the maximal position will decrease and the minimal position will increase with a minimum speed β before leaderless consensus is achieved except for some isolated time instants if G(t) has a directed spanning tree over [t 1 , t 2 ]. In addition, if G(t) does not have a directed spanning tree over a time interval, the maximal position will not increase and the minimal position will not decrease over the time interval. Different from the traditional linear leaderless consensus algorithm</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">u i = -α n j=1 a ij (t)[r i (t) -r j (t)] [i.</formula><p>e., β = 0 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>] under which leaderless consensus can be achieved if the network topology has a directed spanning tree jointly <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, using (5) for (4), leaderless consensus might not be achieved when the network topology has a directed spanning jointly because max i r i (t) -min i r i (t) might not decrease over time in this case. For example, suppose that there exist three agents in a team. At each time instant, there is only one agent who is a neighbor of another agent. Initially, agent 1 is a neighbor of agent 2 for a period of time that guarantees that agent 2's state will become equal to that of agent 1 due to finite-time convergence. Then agent 3 is a neighbor of agent 1 for a period of time that guarantees that agent 1's state will become equal to that of agent 3 due to finite-time convergence. Then agent 2 is a neighbor of agent 3 for a period of time that guarantees that agent 3's state will become equal to that of agent 2 due to finitetime convergence. Then the previous sequence repeats. Note that the directed graph has a directed spanning tree jointly. However, consensus cannot be achieved.</p><p>Remark 3.5. For (4), there exist two other leaderless finite-time consensus algorithms</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">u i = - n j=1 a ij (t)sgn(r i -r j )|r i -r j | γ , γ ∈ (0, 1)<label>(6)</label></formula><p>which is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref> and</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">u i = -sgn n j=1 a ij (r i -r j ) n j=1 a ij (r i -r j ) γ , γ ∈ (0, 1) (7)</formula><p>which is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Using ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">6</ref>) for ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">4</ref>), finite-time leaderless consensus was shown to be achieved under a fixed/switching undirected network topology in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. Using ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) for ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">4</ref>), finitetime leaderless consensus was shown to be achieved under a fixed directed network topology in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Both ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">6</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) can only solve the finite-time leaderless consensus problem rather than the finite-time consensus tracking problem with a dynamic leader in the absence of velocity measurements. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> That is, if ṙ0 (t) is not known, ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">6</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) cannot solve the finite-time consensus tracking problem. Note also that the author in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> used a Lyapunov-based approach to show that leaderless consensus can be achieved in finite time by using ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">5</ref>) with α = 0 under an undirected network topology. We have shown that (5) can guarantee finite-time leaderless consensus for directed switching network topologies by analyzing how the maximal and minimal positions evolve.</p></div>

Note that vi (t) = v 0 (t) for t ≥ t 1 .

It is worthwhile to mention that the adjacency matrix in (8a) could be different from that in (8b). Accurate estimation can still be achieved in finite time if the corresponding graphs associated with the adjacency matrices in (8a) and (8b) satisfy that the virtual leader has directed paths to every other vehicle at each time instant.</p><p>Remark 4.3. Similar to the analysis in Remark 3.3, although ṙi (respectively, vi ) is not equal to vi (respectively, v0 ) at each time instant, the integration of ṙi (respectively, vi ) over t ∈ (t 1 , t 2 ) is equal to the integration of vi over t ∈ (t 1 , t 2 ) (respectively, v0 ) if t 2 &gt; t 1 &gt; T s , where T s is defined in Theorem 4.1. Therefore, for <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, vi (respectively, vi ) can be used to replace ṙi (respectively, v0 ), and vice versa. Remark 4.4. In Theorems 3.1 and 4.1, it is assumed that either the velocity of the virtual leader (cf. Theorem 3.1) or the acceleration of the virtual leader (cf. Theorem 4.1) is bounded and the bound is known beforehand. When the bound of the velocity or the acceleration of the virtual leader is unknown beforehand, β might be chosen as a nondecreasing switching signal and β increases if the estimation errors do not decrease.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Finite-time decentralized formation tracking</head><p>In this section, we study a finite-time decentralized formation tracking problem for both single-integrator kinematics and double-integrator dynamics by using the decentralized sliding mode estimators. Assume that there exists a (time-varying) virtual leader whose position is given by r 0 (t) and velocity is given by v 0 (t) available to only a subset of a group of n vehicles. The objective is to design a decentralized control law such that all followers track the virtual leader while maintaining a certain desired geometric formation with only local interaction.

Note that vi (t) can be replaced with v0 (t) for t ≥ T s according to Remark 3.3. Define ri = r i -δ i -ri .

Because the second-order decentralized sliding mode estimator can achieve accurate estimation in finite time, formation tracking for double-integrator dynamics can be decoupled into two subtasks: 1: A decentralized estimator to accurately estimate the virtual leader's information in finite time. 2: A local control to guarantee accurate tracking of the virtual leader in finite time.</p><p>Remark 5.5. The main difference between decentralized control and centralized control is whether some group information can be obtained by each group member instantaneously. If there exists a central station which can not only obtain the group information but also communicate with each vehicle in the group, centralized control techniques can then be used to achieve various formation control scenarios. However, the requirement of the central station poses an obvious limitation and may not be feasible in real applications. Therefore, it is more practical to employ decentralized control techniques. By using the decentralized sliding mode estimators, accurate estimation of the group information can be achieved in finite time. Accordingly, centralized-control-like decentralized control techniques can be easily designed and implemented. For example, the decentralized virtual structure approach proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> can be revised by using the decentralized sliding mode approach and the formation control problem can be solved by employing a decentralized estimator and a local controller. From this perspective, this paper provides a new simple but efficient framework to solve the formation tracking/flying problem. Remark 5.6. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, a proportional and derivative (PI) based decentralized estimation method was proposed for multi-agent coordination. However, the proposed decentralized estimator can guarantee only bounded tracking errors. Inspired by Theorem 3.1, each vehicle can establish n -1 decentralized sliding mode estimators to estimate all other external time-varying states. According to Theorem 3.1, each time-varying external state can be estimated accurately by all vehicles in finite time. It then follows that all external states can be estimated accurately by all agents in finite time accordingly. Therefore, accurate estimation of the average of a group of time-varying references can be achieved in finite time accordingly. Furthermore, accurate estimation of an arbitrary function of a group of time-varying references can be achieved in finite time as well.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>This paper proposed a simple but efficient framework to achieve finite-time decentralized formation tracking of multiple autonomous vehicles by introducing the decentralized sliding mode estimators. First, we proposed and studied both first-order and second-order decentralized sliding mode estimators. In particular, the proposed decentralized sliding mode estimators were shown to guarantee accurate estimation in finite time. Then the decentralized sliding mode estimators were employed to achieve decentralized formation tracking of multiple autonomous vehicles in finite time. Because accurate estimation can be achieved in finite time when utilizing the proposed sliding mode estimators, many formation tracking/flying scenarios can be decoupled into two simple subtasks, that is, decentralized sliding mode estimation and vehicle desired state tracking, without imposing a stringent condition on the information flow.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Lemma 5 . 1 (</head><label>51</label><figDesc><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>).
