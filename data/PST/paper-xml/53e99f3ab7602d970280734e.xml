<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This technical note studies the consensus problem for cooperative agents with nonlinear dynamics in a directed network. Both local and global consensus are defined and investigated. Techniques for studying the synchronization in such complex networks are exploited to establish various sufficient conditions for reaching consensus. The local consensus problem is first studied via a combination of the tools of complex analysis, local consensus manifold approach, and Lyapunov methods.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Cooperative collective behavior in networks of autonomous agents has received considerable attention in recent years due to the growing interest in understanding intriguing animal group behaviors, such as W.

To coordinate with other agents in a network, agents need to share information with their adjacent peers and agree on a certain value of interest. In this context, the consensus problem usually refers to the problem of how to reach an agreement among a group of autonomous agents in a dynamically changing environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[2]</ref>. One of the main challenges of solving such a consensus problem is that an agreement has to be reached by all the agents in the whole dynamic network while the information of each agent is shared only locally.</p><p>Various models have been used to study the consensus problem and some of the theoretical results obtained recently are closely related to what is presented in this technical note. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[3]</ref>, Vicsek et al. studied a discrete-time system that models a group of autonomous agents moving in the plane with the same speed but different headings, which in essence is a simplified version of the model proposed earlier by Reynolds <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[4]</ref>. Analysis on Vicsek's model or its continuous-time version <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[9]</ref> shows that the connectivity of the time-varying graph that describes the neighbor relationships within the group is key in reaching consensus. In particular, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[6]</ref>, Olfati-Saber and Murray established the relationship between the algebraic connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[10]</ref> (also called the Fiedler eigenvalue) and the speed of convergence when the directed graph is balanced. A broader class of directed graphs that may lead to consensus are those that contain spanning trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[11]</ref>, which are also called rooted graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. Second-order and higher-order consensus in linear multi-agent systems was studied in <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[33]</ref>.</p><p>Vicsek's model is similar to a class of models discussed in studying the synchronization of complex networks <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[27]</ref>. In 1998, Pecora and Carroll made use of a master stability function to study the synchronization of coupled complex networks <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. Thereafter, stability and synchronization of small-world and scale-free networks have been investigated extensively using this master stability function method. In <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>, local synchronization was studied using the transverse stability to the synchronization manifold, where synchronization was discussed with respect to small-world and scale-free networks. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[18]</ref>, a distance from the collective states to the synchronization manifold was defined and then utilized to obtain conditions for global synchronization of coupled systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[20]</ref>. It is clear that most of the real-world complex networks, e.g., World Wide Web and mobile communication networks, are directed networks. However, many existing tools developed for the study of synchronization in complex networks can only be applied to undirected networks. This is partly due to the fact that algebraic graph theory especially the algebraic connectivity has not been well developed for directed graphs. For example, there are no standard definitions for the algebraic connectivity and consensus convergence rate for directed graphs, while its counterparts for undirected graphs have been extensively used to study the synchronization problem.</p><p>Very recently, the consensus problem in directed networks with nonlinear dynamics has been discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[21]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[25]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[22]</ref>, a class of feedback rules was used and a passivity-based design framework was developed to reach the velocity consensus among agents. Under the assumption that the vector fields satisfy a subtangentiality condition, it was proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[23]</ref> that agents can reach consensus if and only if the network is connected sufficiently frequently over time. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[24]</ref>, distributed algorithms for reaching network consensus was proposed based on nonsmooth analysis and many results assumed that the network is weightbalanced. In contrast, in this technical note, we consider the multi-agent system in which the dynamics of each agent consist of two terms: one is determined by an intrinsic nonlinear function which governs the asymptotical state and the other is a simple linear communication protocol relying only on information about its neighbors. A new framework based on matrix theory was proposed to design cooperative controls for a group of autonomous agents in an intermittent, dynamically changing, and local environment in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[25]</ref>. Different from previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[22]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[25]</ref>, a simple linear protocol is designed in this technical note to generalize the tools developed for undirected complex networks in order to make them applicable to directed networks.</p><p>In this technical note, local stability properties of the consensus states in a directed network of agents with nonlinear dynamics are investigated via complex analysis, local synchronization manifold approach, and Lyapunov method. It is found that the real part of the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix plays a key role in deriving the consensus conditions. By assuming that the nonlinear intrinsic function is Lipschitz and introducing a generalized algebraic connectivity in the directed network, some sufficient conditions for reaching network consensus are established. It is found that the general algebraic connectivity is very critical in reaching network consensus and can be used to describe the consensus ability in a directed network which is similar to the role of the algebraic connectivity (Fiedler number <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[10]</ref>) for undirected networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PRELIMINARIES</head><p>Let G = (V; E; A) be a weighted directed graph of order N, with the set of nodes V = fv1; v2; 1 1 1 ; vNg, the set of directed edges E V 2 V, and a weighted adjacent matrix A = (aij) N2N . A directed edge in graph G is denoted by e ij = (v i ;v j ). If there is an edge from node vj to node vi, then it is said that node vj can reach node vi and a ij &gt; 0 is the weight associated with the edge e ij ; otherwise, a ij = 0. As usual, we assume there is no self-loop in G. The Laplacian matrix L = (Lij) N2N of graph G is defined by Lij = 0aij for i 6 = j, i; j 2 f1; .. .;Ng and Lii = k in i for i 2 f1; ... ;Ng, where k in i = N j=1;j6 =i G ij is the sum of the weights of the edges ending at node vi. It is easy to check that N j=1 Lij = 0 for all i = 1; 2; ... ;N.</p><p>The consensus protocol in a multi-agents system considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[6]</ref> is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">_xi(t) = j6 =i aij (xj(t) 0 xi(t)) = 0 N j=1 Lijxj(t): (1)</formula><p>If the network topology changes with time <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[9]</ref>, then in (1) L = L(t) is a time-varying matrix. Let S = f(x 1 ;x 2 ; 1 1 1 ; x N ) : x 1 = x 2 = 1 1 1 = x N g be the consensus manifold. It is clear that since N j=1 Lij = 0 for all i = 1; ...; N, xi must be time-invariant on the consensus manifold in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(1)</ref>. In other words, the values of x i will not change with time once the consensus x1(t) = x2(t) = ... = xN(t) is achieved. However, as has been repeatedly demonstrated in physical complex networks, the state of each agent is, generally speaking, not a constant after getting synchronized, but a dynamical variable because of the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of each agent and the possible complicated ways in which the network is evolving. To study the synchronization of complex networks for more general cases particularly when the synchronized state is a time-varying function rather than a constant equilibrium, we consider the following general consensus protocol:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">_xi(t) = f (xi(t)) 0 c N j=1 Lij0xj(t) (2)</formula><p>where xi 2 R n is the state of agent i, f(xi) = (f1(xi);f2(xi); . ..;fn(xi)) T is a nonlinear function, c is the coupling strength, and 0 = diag( 1 ; . ..; n ) 2 R n2n is a semi-positive definite diagonal matrix where j &gt; 0 means that the agents can communicate through their jth state <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. Here, the state of each agent is an n-dimensional vector as compared to 1-dimensional variables considered in previous works, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[28]</ref>. Note also that it is straightforward to construct the discrete-time counterpart of system ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), but only the continuous-time case is investigated in this technical note.</p><p>Clearly, since N j=1 Lij = 0, if a consensus can be achieved, the solution s(t) of system ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) is expected to be a possible trajectory of an isolated node satisfying _ s(t) = f (s(t)):</p><p>(3)</p><p>Here, s(t) may be an isolated equilibrium point <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[28]</ref>, a periodic orbit, or even a chaotic orbit <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Let A B denote the Kroneker product [29] of matrices A and B, x(t) = (x T 1 (t);x T 2 (t);.. .;x T N (t)) T , f(x(t)) = (f T (x1(t));f T (x2(t));...; f T (xN(t))) T , In be the n-dimensional identity matrix, 1N be the N-dimensional column vector with all entries being 1, and A s = (1=2)(A + A T ).

Definition 3: The graph G is said to have a spanning tree if there is a node that can reach all the other nodes following the edge directions in graph G. Lemma 1: <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[8]</ref> Assume that there is a spanning tree in graph G. Then the Laplacian matrix L of G has eigenvalue 0 with algebraic multiplicity one, and the real parts of all the other eigenvalues are positive, i.e., the eigenvalues of L satisfy 0 = 1 (G) &lt; R( 2 (G)) .. .

If &lt; 0, then it is possible that a (L) = 0; if = 0, the condition depends only on a (L); and if &gt; 0, then a (L) &gt; 0 must be satisfied. From condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(20)</ref>, global consensus can be reached even if the network is disconnected with &lt; 0.

Then there is a positive vector x such that Ax = (A)x, where (A) is the spectral radius of matrix A. Lemma 8: Suppose that the Laplacian matrix L is irreducible. Then there is a positive vector x such that L T x = 0. Proof: Choose a positive integer l such that l 0 N(L) &gt; 0 and l 0 L ii &gt; 0 for all i = 1; 2; ...; N. Then matrix lI N 0 L is positive definite and, from Lemma 1, (lIN 0 L) = l. The matrix (lIN 0L) T = lIN 0L T is also positive definite and (lIN 0L T ) = l.

From Lemma 12, it is easy to see that D k 0 and D k 6 = 0 for all k = 2; . . . ; p.   Proof: From (28), one knows that L11 is irreducible, and in view of Theorem 2, the consensus of agents in the subgraph L 11 can be reached. Suppose that agents 1; . . . ; m 1 are synchronized to the state of the following system: _ s(t) = f (s(t)) + O(e 0t ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(31)</ref> where is a positive constant.

Since graph G has a spanning tree, L kk = A k + D k , where the sum of the entries in A k is zero, and D k 6 = 0. Now, Lemmas 13 and 14 together lead to the conditions given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(30)</ref> where &gt; 0. The proof is thus completed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this technical note, both local and global consensus problems for multi-agent systems in directed networks have been investigated. The main contributions of this technical note include the following: i) Local consensus in a directed network of agents with nonlinear dynamics has been studied. It is found that the real part of the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix plays a key role in deriving the consensus conditions. ii) A generalized algebraic connectivity, which can be used to describe the consensus ability of the network, has been proposed to discuss global convergence properties of consensus in strongly connected networks and also in networks containing spanning trees. Some future works are as follows: i) Networks with nonlinear couplings and networks consisting of heterogeneous autonomous agents will be studied. ii) The multi-agent system with switching topology will be considered. iii) Based on the general algebraic connectivity discussed in this technical note, the stable consensus regions will be further investigated in multi-agent systems with nonlinear dynamics and a general inner matrix 0 in the future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Manuscript received November 26, 2008; revised April 11, 2009, August 19, 2009, February 08, 2010, August 24, 2010; accepted January 12, 2011.
