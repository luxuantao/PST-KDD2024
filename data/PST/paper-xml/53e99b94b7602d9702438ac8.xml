<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Participatory Design (PD) methods in the field of health informatics have mainly been applied to the development of small-scale systems with homogeneous user groups in local settings. Meanwhile, health service organizations are becoming increasingly large and complex in character, making it necessary to extend the scope of the systems that are used for managing data, information and knowledge. This study reports participatory action research on the development of a PD framework for large-scale system design. The research was conducted in a public health informatics project aimed at developing a system for 175,000 users. A renewed PD framework was developed in response to six major limitations experienced to be associated with the existing methods. The resulting framework preserves the theoretical grounding, but extends the toolbox to suit applications in networked health service organizations. Future research should involve evaluations of the framework in other health service settings where comprehensive HISs are developed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In recent decades, a number of user-centered approaches have been introduced for the development of health information systems (HISs), ranging from Participatory Design (PD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> to usability engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, and contextual design <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. However, even though they have the focus on the end-user in common, the methods differ with regard to whether the user, in the design process, is regarded as an object of study or as an active participant in the planning, performance and evaluation of the design. Being an example of the latter standpoint, PD methods for informa-tion systems (ISs) development were introduced in the 1970s in collaboration between employees, employers, and researchers as a means to empower system users by letting them take active role in the design of an important part of their work environment. It has been claimed that the PD approach can make a difference where traditional systems development methods fail, in particular with regards to the social factors that are of importance for the successful implementation of ISs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. PD approaches have, however, also been exposed to criticism. As early as in the 1980s, Hirschheim <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> found that they were more complicated to implement than literature contended, lacked in formalization, and, even though universally praised by participants, they were seldom applied a second time in the organizations for which they were developed. Since then, several shortcomings in the practical use of PD as a design method have been pointed out. It has been claimed that the approach deals extensively with early 1532-0464/$ -see front matter Ó 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2007.09.004 design, while neglecting the later technical stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. It has also been questioned whether its set of principles is actually agreeable with busy co-participants at a workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The aim of this study is to examine which modifications are needed in order to make PD of HIS applicable in large health service organizations, and to integrate the modifications in a third generation PD method for use in these contexts. To provide some background, the use of PD in health services is first reviewed, and the history of PD methods for IS development is outlined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Participatory design in health services</head><p>Use of participatory design methods where end-users are invited to take part in service development processes is currently widespread in the health sector. Urban planning, public health, and health informatics are multidisciplinary fields that all have improving human health and well-being as their objective, they also have in common an emphasis on needs assessment, management of complex social systems, and use of participatory design methods. Problem definitions in urban planning have traditionally relied on analyses of human needs or interactions in a spatial context, while public health has used a biomedical model that examines normal/abnormal functioning of the human organism <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. However, planning in both areas has included the basic components of assessing needs and possible interventions together with service user representatives in a democratic process. During the last decades of the 20th century, the use of integrated planning and design in human services gained broad international dissemination, and PD methods specialized for particular application areas were introduced, e.g. for constructing organizations for community-based health and safety promotion programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Recently, PD has, for instance, been employed for determining interventions for dealing with environmental hazards <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, community problem solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and bridging generation gaps in youth development programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. As for health informatics, which is a more recently developed field, the use of participatory design has a shorter history. Health service organizations have in recent decades become increasingly large in size and complex in character, e.g. due to the specialization of units and professions. Accordingly, it has become necessary to rather dramatically extend the scope of the systems that are to be used for the management and analysis of data, information, and knowledge. Today, these systems have the character of regional computer networks and have to rely on complex IT infrastructures <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. This inter-woven organizational and technical development has led to that both social conflicts and technical issues currently need to be identified and managed by system developers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. It is mainly in response to the diversity of the problems encountered in these design processes that PD principles have been found attractive for HIS development, and use of the methods has also showed promising results in several settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. The main motivation for the introduction of PD in HIS development thereby differs from the motives for user participation in urban planning and public health. In the latter disciplines, the involvement of service users has primarily been motivated by an interest in social equity and sustainability, in particular by provision of health services to the less privileged groups, while the introduction of PD methods in health informatics has been more technically motivated, e.g. by the finding that involvement and contribution from the major stakeholders and experts early in the design process can lead to technically more effective and usable systems. Rather than an antagonism, however, this difference in background motives can be regarded as an opportunity for the exchange of experiences and method components between the fields when methodological dilemmas are encountered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Participatory design methods for IS development</head><p>From a historical perspective, a first generation of PD methods for IS development can be distinguished that was focused on the ideology behind 'Collective Systems Design' <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. This generation of methods typically concentrated on industrial workers, production and individual workplaces, and the stated objective was to enhance workplace democracy and increase worker autonomy, skill and task variety. Users were to be given direct influence on the design through their participation in design groups where they contributed with organizational and work task knowledge. Collective Systems Design used tools that were easyto-learn and put low demand on users' prior knowledge. Common were mock-ups, Future Workshops and PIC-TIVE, applied to the formulation, visualization and realization of design solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. But criticism was also directed towards Collective Systems Design's prolonged focus on consensus reaching and democratic processes, which sometimes tended to hamper efficiency and a coherent architecture. Additional identified problems included obstacles in gaining access to and motivating users to participate <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and in the collaborative process itself where studies have shown that full-user participation when it comes to, e.g. project initiation and information flow analysis, is neither effective nor appreciated by the users. They tend to want to leave these issues to the expertise and focus on information needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>A second generation of PD emerged in response to this criticism. This generation was characterized by a shift towards the commercial setting and by embracing teamwork, and finding points of contact with the area of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). Since the early 1990s, this approach has been developed in parallel to Collective Systems Design, both gathered under the umbrella term Participatory Design. It was argued that second generation PD resulted in generally more usable systems since these were designed together with the users. Several authors have recently pointed out that even this PD generation is seldom used in large, tangible, productoriented projects and that, once it is applied, it only results in small-scale, stand-alone IT-applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. As a result, there are few large systems developed by means of PD methods in use <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In particular, it has been pointed out that there is a need for renewal of conceptual frameworks as well as PD methods, if they are to extend beyond single workplaces or lab-like settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. Also in the health service context, most recent attempts to apply PD have been restricted to the design of small-scale isolated systems for a limited set of users in a specific organizational unit <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. A future third generation of PD seems thus to demand adaptation to prevalent organizational trends, e.g., to large organizations and projects, inter-organizational collaboration and networking, and that increased consideration is given to third parties in the systems development process. PD has been additionally criticized for presuming a limited, rather homogeneous user group <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. This is part of its inheritance, in which a single workplace was in focus, and the only conflict presumed was between workers' and managers' perspectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Meanwhile, contemporary organizations, in general, as well as health service organizations, move away from traditional codetermination, displaying heterogeneity, multiple hierarchic levels, and horizontal interest groups. Flexibility and temporary assignments are becoming common. It has been suggested that a modification of PD to suit entire organizations involves interplay between local settings and organization-wide exchange for the generalization of local developments <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Only in this way, can more comprehensive IS be designed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Case study context</head><p>The research was performed in a public health informatics setting. Occupational disease and sick leave from work are growing health problems that call for solutions developed in cooperation between employers and employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Trade unions have traditionally supplied an organizational setting for employees to review their working conditions and act for their health and welfare <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In this effort, a central task for labor organizations is to provide employees and their representatives with an infrastructure for peer-to-peer empowerment. In the Swedish Trade Union Federation (LO), 175,000 shop stewards represent the union federation at the workplaces. The aim of the 'Distance Supported Learning for local Knowledge Needs' (DLK) project was to develop a modern information infrastructure that allowed local shop stewards to address their local problems, and to support them in dealing with and improving employee work conditions. Representatives from LO in collaboration with educators from a trade union folk high school and researchers from Linko ¨ping University participated in the project. A participatory design group was formed to develop a design of the infrastructure for information and knowledge support for shop stewards. The system development in the design group was based on Action-Design <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, a participatory design method that includes rules for conduct during design group meetings. The case study project resulted in a requirements specification and a prototype which demonstrated system functionality. Detailed accounts of the design solutions resulting from the project have been reported earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head><p>The design method development was performed with reference to the application of the PD-based method, Action Design. The study was based on Participatory Action Research (PAR). Researchers participated in a system development process as both observers and change agents, i.e. by collecting and analyzing data, reporting the results to practitioners, implementing changes together with practitioners, and evaluating the effects of changes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Application of participatory design through action design</head><p>The design group was formed locally and originally comprised two systems developers, one pedagogue, and 10 user representatives. The latter included four shop stewards, two full-time ombudsmen, two representatives from the DLK project management, and two local LO management representatives. Six affiliations were originally represented. The group held 20 half-day meetings for a period of 2 years, resulting in a requirements specification and the prototype for an IS to be accessed by all union shop stewards. The design work focused, first, on organizational analysis including the establishment of shop stewards' tasks, problems and needs; and second, on iterative prototyping.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Action design</head><p>Action Design (AD) is a second generation PD method, even though the cornerstones of democracy and active user participation from the first generation methods are maintained. It was originally developed within the field of health informatics and has been applied in different health service organization settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. The action design work procedure begins with stabilizing a design group in which both systems developers and user representatives participate. A project contract is established and a project plan initiated. The group then gathers in recurrent meetings throughout the design process. It works through three design phases: organizational analysis, iterative prototyping, and writing the requirements specification <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The process is linear and bottom-up in the sense that, (1) time is initially devoted to creating mutual understanding among parties, agreeing on meeting rules, etc.; (2) a solid organizational analysis is performed, defining experienced problems and their solutions and using easy-at-hand paper-based tools; and (3) prototyping and a design focus on the artifact constitute the final phase of the design process (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). AD extends the original collective systems approach by explicitly including design phases. Further, it aims to have all groups that in some meaning are affected by the system represented in the design group, while PD generally presupposes a rather homogeneous group dominated by primary users. Before the present study, the use of AD had been restricted to small projects of limited strategic importance to organizations. This was mainly due to the requirement of letting representatives from all user groups actively participate in the design process, which becomes increasingly difficult with comprehensive IS and the growing size of an organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Design rationale and argumentative design</head><p>Design rationale is a systems development technique based on argumentation and documentation. It is motivated by the assumption that there exist several possible solutions to a design issue. Therefore, the positive and negative consequences of different design options should be estimated before an option is decided upon. The benefits such a stance result in include a consideration of trade-offs in design, achieved design consistency, and an anticipative perspective foreseeing the consequences of real system implementations <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Design rationale applies to the later software engineering phases. Argumentative Design (ArD) was developed as a corresponding technique to be applied in early design, with focus on IS content and organizational needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. ArD sets out to design systems that from the beginning are well integrated with the organizational context in which they will exist. ArD draws on five core components: need, measure, consequence, goal, and decision. It has been argued that ArD is clearly compatible with PD since both include argumentative processes and the reconciliation of conflicting interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. If PD is to be usable in design of comprehensive IS, the process of bringing in all user groups and integrate their voices with the emerging system can be supported by ArD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Data collection and analysis</head><p>Participatory Action Research (PAR) provides a scientific foundation for the collaboration between researchers and the subjects under study throughout an integrated practice development and knowledge building research process. The motivation is that ordinary people with a realized need for knowledge should be allowed to undertake a research project themselves, thereby being able to transform their own environment. PAR is part of integration between a science paradigm that observes and uses numerical calculations to bring certainty and verifiability to research questions, and qualitative research that attempts to find patterns in, and act upon, complex human and social problems. The main motivation for using PAR in this project is that inter-organizational health service pro-fessionals and their clients/patients with a realized need for knowledge can contribute to research projects, thereby enhancing their own knowledge and transforming their own practice and living environments.</p><p>Participant observation is the observation of subjects in their natural settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Sometimes, the researchers' identities are undisguised but they still actively participate in the activities of the community. Participant observation is a direct research method that provides information on how the studied situation actually is; not how it is re-told by the study subjects. Participant observation further supports flexibility and the successive accumulation of knowledge. Nevertheless, it is still an obtrusion into the lives of the study subjects, which may modify their behavior. Although most participant observers rely on their memory and personal fieldnotes, using tapes and videorecordings are becoming more common. The advantages of these include the enhancement of memory, which is useful, especially in PAR where the researcher has to balance double roles, making it difficult to take extensive fieldnotes. On the other hand, using videorecordings may disrupt the natural course of events in the settings, something that the researcher must be aware of when performing the data analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>In this study, PAR was applied to the design work in the DLK setting, and participant observation a foundation for the further development of the baseline second generation PD method. The basic PAR team comprised academic researchers/system developers, organizational developers, and user representatives, of whom he systems developers assumed the additional role of participant observers. Data was collected by active and passive participant observations during design meetings, and recording of interventions and their outcomes. During each meeting notes were taken by the systems developers as well as by a third person who participated in the meetings explicitly for this purpose. The notes of the systems developers were entered into a project diary. The notes of the third person were elaborated in collaboration with her and the systems developers and documented as ''memory notes''; documents that the whole group had access to. Each meeting was also videotaped and the systems developers watched the video recordings after each session, in order to enhance their memory and complement the project diary.</p><p>For this study, the data analysis focused on the evaluation of PD, i.e. on the implications of applying a PD-based method in the context of a large health service organization. All field notes, were first analyzed by one systems developer and then iteratively discussed with the other. In the categorization process, all data that related to the application of PD was first extracted from the overall data set, which mostly focused on systems design issues. The extracted data was categorized in a process where similar statements were clustered together, and subsequently formed into first tentative, then definite categories. In the subsequent analysis, the major difficulties experienced in relation to the categories were integrated into a small-scale theory. The theory was then used to identify appropriate change measures to overcome these difficulties. Finally, a renewed PD framework was constructed based on the change measures. At the end of the case study project, individual interviews were used to obtain an exploratory evaluation of the design group participants' and external stakeholders' opinions of the third generation framework and the resulting prototype.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>The experience of the design group highlighted several obstacles to applying PD, in general, and to the specific context of a large health service organization, in particular. Six major issues were identified and related to organizational scale and heterogeneity, problems with design group stability, time-consuming procedures, and technology remaining abstract in the design processes. In the analysis, each of these issues was associated with a suitable change in the present design method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Dealing with increment of scale</head><p>PD has traditionally presumed a certain degree of homogeneity as regards the IS target group. In the case study setting, there were 175,000 intended users for the system and the client organization had several layers and sub units, e.g. regional departments and affiliation offices with relative autonomy. They were all going to be stakeholders in the emerging system with responsibility for administration and implementation. Therefore, the focus of the design work had to be broadened. This decision was taken by the systems developers before practical design work started. Design work was to take place in a local design group working according to the principles of PD, i.e. following the AD method. This work was to be complemented with data collection outside the group, from other system stakeholders, which were designated as voices that contributed their perspective to design work. Also, large organizations often are divided into several vertical managerial levels. It was found that the design group easily communicated with the managers at the closest level, but that the verification of decisions at higher levels was established at the grace of the middle managers. There was thus a risk that the design group made decisions that were not approved at the highest organizational levels.</p><p>Obstacle 1: In large PD projects in health service settings, the entire user group and all stakeholders in the system cannot be directly represented in a design group.</p><p>Change measure 1: Dealing with the scale of the organization by means of data collection outside the design group and introducing routines for ongoing organizational verification of decisions made.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Heterogeneity of target user group</head><p>The group's work procedures were established as a result of negotiations between the systems developers and the user representatives. The latter, as stated in the project contract, wanted the systems developers to ''take the main responsibility for collecting and analyzing material''. The user representatives were to assist in this process and to ''contribute with knowledge that is relevant to the group's work''. Subsequently, the systems developers collected data from groups of external users and stakeholders. The user representatives supported data analysis by evaluating researchers' interpretations in light of their own union domain knowledge. The design group participants thus had the double functions of designers and argument analysts, which remained evident throughout the design process. The group's work also functioned the other way round, in that design meetings were used as a basis for testing practices for collecting data externally. In particular, the prototype was developed and continually modified in interplay between informal within-group prototype evaluations and more comprehensive evaluations made with other users.</p><p>A graphical repository of design arguments was introduced to merge the extensive amount of externally collected information into the group's work. An argumentative design (ArD) document behind the intended system was constructed. The ArD considered design issues related both to the internal design work and to the different external perspectives on the system. The ArD was continuously modified until it provided a sound basis for decisions in the group about the final prototype and requirements specification. The system's basic characteristics were graphically documented using a somewhat modified ArD notation, and used as a basis for the initial design proposal.</p><p>Obstacle 2: Difficulties in integrating different perspectives on a heterogeneous health service setting and user groups into one design analysis.</p><p>Change measure 2: Introducing a repository of design arguments (ArD) for integrating different perspectives, thus merging the externally collected data into design work and introducing a twofold function of the design group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Membership turnover in PD group</head><p>Another difficulty concerned the permanence of the group. The shop steward assignment is held for defined periods of time. Several shop stewards left the group when they left their union assignments. The first one was replaced, but the other two were not, as this occurred late in the design process. Furthermore, the two representatives from DLK project management left the entire project for other union assignments after half the design process. In the design group, their predecessors replaced them. Finally, a local trade union management representative left for other duties in the organization after about two-thirds of the meetings.</p><p>Consequently, while in PD the same people are intended to participate in the design work throughout the process, this group was characterized by turbulence created by the turnover in user representatives. Thus, the group at an early stage had to consider forms for meetings and work procedures. The agreed upon project plan states; ''the group's work should be of the character that does not come to a stop when someone does not attend a meeting.'' It was further decided that potential newcomers should be introduced to the group's work beforehand, through the auspices of the researchers and by reading material from previous meetings. The ArD here served as a collective memory for the group, thus reducing interruption in design work. Finally, the group's work should be concentrated on working with iterative modules. Each new practice should be quick to learn and stretch over no more than two meetings. In this way, design work could proceed reasonably smoothly.</p><p>In order to increase structural flexibility, some procedures that are usually part of PD were subsequently abandoned.</p><p>Obstacle 3: Difficulties in retaining stability in the design group process.</p><p>Change measure 3: Increasing the structural flexibility of the PD group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Time-consuming pre-design group procedures</head><p>The early meetings were found tedious particularly by the practitioner representatives in the design group. A solution was to reduce some early work procedures and move on more quickly to concrete design tasks, and integrating consensus into an ongoing ArD process. Some procedures that were initially stated in the project plan were thus reduced. The project contract was never signed by everyone, since re-negotiating it with new group participants took too much time. The project plan was not written together with the user representatives but was prepared beforehand and modified according to their suggestions. Furthermore, the initial idea for a separate organizational/IS goal analysis was abandoned and the analysis was continually performed as part of ArD and design practices. This partial switch in focus immediately met with approval by user representatives. Beginning with the fourth meeting, at which the concrete design work truly got underway through a Future Workshop, user representatives expressed much more enthusiasm, and acknowledged that they had been impatient during the initial procedures. In retrospect, the decision was taken that for the future shorten the time that leads up to initial design even more.</p><p>Obstacle 4: Time-consuming pre-design group procedures resulting in inefficient use of time.</p><p>Change measure 4: Reducing user participation in predesign tasks to attain a leaner early design process. Shorten the time span that lead up to design and a conceptual prototype.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Large administrative overhead in design process</head><p>The initial impatience in the design group led to a decision by the systems developers to increase focus on con-crete design practices and cut down the time spent on the more abstract work procedures when user representatives were involved. This in turn led to a compromise with the PD ideal of full user participation. However, user representatives clearly stated that they regarded procedures such as drawing up a project contract, project planning, and administrative routines not contributing to any advancement of the design process. They wanted the researchers to take responsibility for these matters, and for documenting the ArD. For instance, according to AD, group participants are to take turns chairing meetings and jointly formulate meeting agendas. However, user representatives wanted the researchers to take sole responsibility for chairmanship, and to exclusively propose items for the agendas themselves. In the notes from the second meeting it is stated:</p><p>. . .it was decided that the. . .[researchers] are to be meeting chairpersons. At the end of each meeting, the participants are to propose items for the next meeting agenda. In due time before the next meeting the. . . <ref type="bibr">[researchers]</ref> are to propose an agenda that the others in the group can comment on before the final agenda is settled.</p><p>Practices for organizational analysis were accepted but not with the same enthusiasm as those that were explicitly design-oriented. The design practices thus came to be introduced comparatively early in the design process and included, e.g. a Future Workshop, PICTIVE, the construction of user scenarios and evaluations of the prototype.</p><p>Obstacle 5: Inefficient design procedures related to user participation in administrative tasks.</p><p>Change measure 5: Outsourcing of administrative tasks from the PD process. Early construction of user scenarios and prototype.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Technologies remain abstract in design process</head><p>There was a strong desire in the design group to 'get their hands dirty,' i.e. to work with practical tasks. This led to the decision that potential technological solutions were to be worked with in parallel to the establishment of user needs, i.e. a kind of simultaneous bottom-up/ top-down approach. This would provide hands-on experience as a complement to the otherwise somewhat abstract character of some of the work, before the first prototype version has been developed. In particular, existing ''offthe-shelf'' technologies that might be of use in shop stewards' work were evaluated. More specifically, the group tested an electronic whiteboard for transferring physical writing and drawing on a whiteboard to digital form, a system for communicating and sharing documents, and a speech recognition tool. The user representatives much appreciated the work with demonstrating existing technologies.</p><p>Obstacle 6: An initial focus on needs analysis and requirements leads to technologies remaining abstract in the PD process.</p><p>Change measure 6: Dealing with the need to design highly functional tools by introducing early evaluation of existing technologies in contextual settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.">A third generation participatory design framework for HIS development</head><p>The identified obstacles can be described as being contingent on two orthogonal general demands on the design process, i.e. an obligation to retain the principles of PD while dealing with the management of scarce design resources (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). These difficulties informed successive modification of the PD approach at hand. The definition and integration of change measures into the second generation PD framework resulted in a substantial revision of the design method. The renewed design framework is based on three modules, where the second module contains three sub-modules (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The first module contains activities that are performed before the actual PD starts. It should be noted that even though only the second module contains the core PD process, the first and third modules also include elements of active user participation, e.g. by providing feedback on the outline of the project plan to the pre-design group and by evaluating implemented prototypes during the post-design process.</p><p>The second module, which includes the core PD process, is based on collective systems design meetings. Each meeting is used to address several issues and may include several design practices. ArD is introduced to support flexibility, negotiations and consensus reaching throughout the remainder of the design process. Rules for the design argumentation are established at the first meeting, e.g. for how to rank the importance of issues and how to reach design decisions. The last part of each meeting is devoted to integration of the latest issues and decisions made with the emerging ArD documentation, which serves both as documentation of the design work and a collective memory for the group and potential newcomers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.1.">Module 1: Pre-design (including change measures 4 and 5)</head><p>The systems developers alone perform the pre-design work, such as establishment of general design principles and meeting rules, before the design group actually begins work. Pre-design also includes the allocation of representative users and stakeholders to the design group, through contacts with the organization for which the system is intended, and with the organizational bodies initiating and funding the project. The pre-design work is fed back to user representatives at the initial design meeting before the work procedures are finally established.</p><p>Prerequisites: A clearly stated mission and allocation of resources to complete that mission. Acceptance of PD principles and end-user participation from target organizations and those organizations funding the project.</p><p>Activities: Pre-design scheduling, i.e. setting project goals, project planning, allocating representative users and establishing efficient principles for the design process.</p><p>Participants: Systems developers and stakeholders representing the target organization and project financiers.</p><p>Outcome: Preliminary project plan, project contract and established design group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.2.">Module 2: Participatory design (including change measures 2, 3 and 5)</head><p>The second module includes the core PD process. It is structured as one basic module, in which activities in three sub-modules are regulated. In the basic module, each meeting is used to address several issues and may include several types of design practices, including prototype evaluations. ArD is introduced to support flexibility, negotiations and consensus reaching throughout the remainder of the design process. Rules for design argumentation are established at the first meeting and the last part of each subsequent meeting is devoted to integrating the most recent issues and decisions made with the emerging ArD documentation. The three analysis sub-modules are invoked from, and reported back to, the overall PD module. The Information systems analysis sub-module requires that an organizational analysis has been performed at least once, and the technology analysis sub-module requires that an Information systems analysis has been performed at least once. However, the initial organizational analysis should cover a reasonably short time span, in order to introduce prototyping early in the development process, based on a sub-set of organizational data.</p><p>Prerequisites: Preliminary project plan, project contract and established design group.</p><p>Activities: At the first design meeting, the preliminary project plan and project contract are presented to the user representatives. These documents are negotiated, and modifications are made if necessary. Thereafter, the documents are signed. In the ensuing PD process, the three analysis modules are evoked upon decision making in the PD group, using ArD documentation as a basis. Participants: Systems developers, engineers, user representatives and stakeholders representing the target organization.</p><p>Outcome: ArD documentation of the design and prototype based on the interplay between organization analysis, Information system analysis/prototyping and technology. All sub-modules thus produce input for the prototype.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.2.1.">Sub-module 2a: Analysis-Organizational adaptation and verification. Prerequisites: Final project plan and project contract</head><p>Activities: The organizational context analysis and design verification proceeds during the PD work. External data collection takes place throughout the design process, and the ArD documentation is used to bring structure to the external voices and to ensure that the organizational focus is not lost in local design work. In parallel, design decisions made in the group are verified at higher organizational levels by means of design protocol routines. Organizational analysis and early design practices are iterated.

Sub-module 2c: Analysis-Technology. Prerequisites: ArD documentation issues resulting from at least one round of Information systems analysis.</p><p>Activities: During design meetings existing technologies that can be used to implement different functions demonstrated in the prototypes are evaluated. The technologies that are selected for the evaluation are thus determined based on the outcome of the Information system analysis and prototyping activities.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The aim of this study was to examine how PD methods can be modified to be applicable to comprehensive HIS projects in large and networked health service organizations. It has previously been argued that when using PD for information system development, the small-group process should be merged with software engineering approaches and technology evaluation methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. This study has reported an attempt to formalize such a merge using experiences from a project where the aim was to develop an HIS for 175,000 users. Attempts to apply PD of information systems to large organizations have previously been reported. Bødker worked with a representative PD group and complemented this activity with newsletters and public demonstrations of prototypes for the larger organization. It was found that only those interested in systems design evaluated the prototypes and important perspectives were thus left out <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. In this study, a broadening of focus was instead achieved by complementing work in the design group with data collection outside the design group, and using the ArD design documentation method for integrating this data into the group process. Furthermore, full user participation in the administration of the design work was reduced and the use of prototyping was correspondingly increased and moved to an earlier stage in the design process. Also, executing hands-on practices with current technologies was accommodated together with an organizational analysis in an iterative procedure. By means of these modifications, this third generation PD framework is intended to gradually change, not revolutionize, the practice and understanding of user participation and multi-disciplinary collaboration in HIS design. Iterative prototyping involving users is already, although slowly, becoming an integrated part of the development of large HISs, although the development processes mostly still evolve around the technical aspects of the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. This study thus contributes in systemizing theoretical fundamentals and empirical experience into a method that provides a design process that, with reasonable certainty, leads to the intended results, also with regard to the organizational agenda. The framework proposed has therefore several important implications for both research and managerial practice in HIS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Can broad participation in HIS design be cost-effective?</head><p>An often reported experience from public health and urban planning is that PD models based on consensus and the community's own formulation of the problem can be difficult to coordinate and also costly <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. It can be questioned whether the case study project conducted over two years and involving 20 meetings, can be regarded as a valid test of the resource effectiveness of a third generation PD method. It would, however, in the case study context, have easily been possible to speed up the project process by holding fewer but longer meetings over a shorter period of time to. On the other hand, results still show that when applied to large health care organizations, PD becomes dependent on the effectiveness of the communication infrastructure available for organizational validation of the decisions made at each step in the design process. If no infrastructure is in place to support this communication, the design process becomes delayed or may even fail. Several changes were implemented to make the PD method more time efficient. For instance, the idea of the iterative character of each design meeting emerged gradually with increased awareness that problem-solving that addressed different topics during meetings required more time than was scheduled. Also the original Collective Systems Design approach demanded long design meetings. This may not be compatible with health practitioners' busy schedules. If this is the case, the problem can partly be solved by performing some of the work on-line, in and between meetings. There have been successful attempts to perform some components of the PD work in this way by having user representatives access a continually up-dated database design proposal <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Also the design group in DLK accessed an on-line version of the emerging prototype through their work or home computers. Furthermore, all design documentation was published in an on-line document archive. Future systems development projects may attempt to develop this aspect further. For instance, the evaluation of prototypes is a future candidate for being performed on-line.</p><p>When choosing a PD method for a HIS development project, it is important to consider how the concept of end-product is defined and how success should be measured. Collective Systems Design had its strength in early design phases. In the case study, the product delivered was an extensive prototype complemented by a requirements specification, to be used as the basis for large-scale system implementations. On the other hand, if the delivered product is to be a ready-to-use system, then the framework requires additional components. The idea behind the introduction of separate modules into the PD framework is that it should be possible to modify or extend a design process according to the task at hand. Accordingly, we have recently extended the renewed framework to also include specific components for the later development phases and back-end implementation-based design <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. In this extension, the PD aspects are integrated in the definition of the system architecture, design specifications, sub-systems development, as well as in system integration, verification, deployment and validation. In the sub-systems development, the sub-systems of technology, organization, personnel and method are developed in parallel, in order to ensure a socio-technical, PD perspective. In this extended PD framework, compromises with the ideal of full user participation are allowed in all modules and processes. User influence on the design is instead secured in other ways, above all, through design practices and iterative prototyping, and through continuous feedback to user representatives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">The importance of documentation and technical communication in PD</head><p>PD and other contextual IS development methods have been criticized for being imprecise and leaving out a detailed design specification <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. In order to make the end-products more technically solid, several attempts have therefore been made to integrate different engineering techniques, e.g. combining PD techniques with rapid application development tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> and extreme programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. The third generation PD framework developed in this study supports this continuous integration, adding specified requirements engineering procedures and early prototyping. Nevertheless, performing concrete systems development in the health service setting always includes elements of a trial and error-based adaptation to project complexity, job and user group characteristics, organizational culture, etc. Therefore, reliable technical communication and design documentation techniques that can express the nuances in design decisions are vital for largescale PD projects in these contexts.</p><p>The interest in documentation of the argumentation during IS design projects reached its peak in the 1990s but has since declined. One explanation for this fact is that these techniques are time-consuming. Current research is faced with solving problems with defining rules for structuring of large numbers of design issues, and with the formalization of information gained from heterogeneous data sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Furthermore, techniques such as ArD have lacked rules that guide the argumentative process as well as proper technological support. Nevertheless, the technique is useful when designing complex systems for large organizations in which the need for capturing rationale and structure is especially essential. In this study, argumentative techniques were used to integrate externally collected opinions with the emerging design specification, thus creating compatibility between local findings and organizational memory. Maybe even more importantly, the representation of the design argumentation provided a basis for knowledge transfer from the particular design project to future similar efforts. Thus far, the lack of knowledge transfer between particular design settings has been an obstacle to the expansion of PD as a field of research and design practice.</p><p>External data collection and ArD are extensions which, it might be argued, counteract the attempt to make PD more effective. However, the additional workload imposed was found to be compensated for by a heavy reduction in other initial work procedures. Developing comprehensive IS for large organizations must be scheduled to consume time, also for 'upstream' documentation. The application of ArD in the case study was initial and exploratory. Some perceived problems related to how to structure the argumentative process and when to disclaim argumentation in favor of a decision. However, such deficiencies can be overcome if the technique is formalized, technology supported with a focus on graphical visualization, and clearly integrated with continuous work procedures. In general, the techniques for technical documentation included in the framework at present build on experience from a limited number of design projects, and need to be further developed and tested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Limitations of the third generation PD framework</head><p>This study analyzed only one approach to the development of HIS. The major benefits of PD comes with its focus on the end-user, which increases the possibility that the development results in a system that this stakeholder group needs, approves of, and will use. The authors acknowledge that there exist approaches to development that are significantly more cost effective for other stakeholders in the HIS context. Nevertheless, the framework should still reflect a reasonable trade-off between degree of user involvement and general cost effectiveness for the health service provider. We also trust that the trade-off is particularly relevant in the HIS context where the systems certainly are used to deal with economic constraints, but foremost with health, disease, and caretaking where the human perspective-mediated by the end-users-cannot be afforded to be lost.</p><p>However, the third generation PD framework still has limitations that have to be taken into regard when considering it for use in HIS development. The modifications to the existing PD practices were developed in the employee-employer context, implying that third-party rep-resentatives were not involved in the process. To be able to include service beneficiaries such as patients and consumers, the design process must be described in a language that makes it accessible for laypersons. Because the third-party representatives' backgrounds and standpoints may vary considerably more than in professional settings, fostering a shared commitment to design goals will demand that motivation and social positions of the participants are continuously examined, and that the design process is updated accordingly if changes or conflicts are observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. The resources required for such surveillance and adjustments limit, in practice, the role consumers and patients can play as full partners in HIS design, and in most settings make structural adjustments of PD frameworks necessary, e.g. in the form of special groups for consumers. The third generation PD framework must, in particular, be adjusted if adolescents or children are to be involved. Studies have demonstrated that healthy children can contribute considerably to HIS design in the role as testers, informers and, to some extent, as partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. However, system development for seriously ill children requires particular psychological and pedagogical insights in parallel to design and usability expertise <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. This observation also indicates that an often overseen prerequisite for PD is that technical, social science, and psychological competence is represented among the professional designers, and that the actual persons are able to cooperate with each other. In the case study setting, the designers had their backgrounds in the social sciences and software engineering, and were used to collaborating. In other design contexts, the competence requirements may be different. Likewise, difficulties in balancing different disciplines have been reported from other PD settings, in particular a tendency for social scientists to feel out of place on technical designers' turf <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. One way to alleviate cooperation problems among the designers themselves is to include in the design method graphically simple visualization tools that members of several disciplines can use, and which then can be employed as the language used for envisioning novel solutions to nondesigners.</p><p>In the case study setting, PD methods were used for the entire HIS development project. It is possible, however, to use third generation PD framework only in specific organizational or technical phases of large projects. Examples of such phases include work organization redesign <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, the configuration of communication facilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, and ergonomic workplace design <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. User participation in otherwise traditional HIS development projects can be accomplished by selecting suitable group-work toolkits from the framework, e.g. comprising meeting rules and action checklists. In such delimited uses of the framework, participatory methods and locally adjusted toolkits can thus be used for analysis of local data in order to achieve low-cost improvements and modification of generic designs. Even though restricted use of the framework can lead to concrete results, the gain of addressing multiple organizational and technical areas together will be lost, as well as some of the emancipatory foundations for the collective design idea.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>PAR was used to outline a third generation PD framework for use in HIS development. The framework attempts to make the PD methodology more effective, product-oriented, and suited to the emerging networked structures used to build modern health service organizations, while retaining the theoretical foundations of collective design. Specifically, the modifications included in the framework can be summarized as efforts to:</p><p>• Make PD more resource-effective, and deliver a specified end-product to the health service providers that have invested resources in the design, • Secure 'political' support for the PD process. A PD method must support the idea that the design process is built on trustworthy change agents and that organizational advocates for the process are recruited and encouraged, • Support decision-making that is based on a wide and reliable set of organizational facts, and to support the continuous documentation of argumentation in the design group, and • Integrate rapid computer program implementationbased on solid software development methods-into the PD process, also continuously adjusting the programming by executing an organizational adaptation of the application in parallel.</p><p>The early uses of PD for IS development shared a theoretical perspective, however no specific methods or techniques, even though several groups over the years have organized their practices into coherent approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. The present framework does not break new theoretical ground. It instead formalizes the practical experience from the application of PD in the health service contexts gathered during the past two decades. Future work should involve the evaluation of the framework in other health service settings where comprehensive HISs are developed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
