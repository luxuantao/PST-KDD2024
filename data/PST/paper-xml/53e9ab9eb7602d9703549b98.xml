<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>ifferential Morphology and Image Processin Petros Maragos, Fellow, IEEE Abstract-Image processing via mathematical morphology has traditionally used geometry to intuitively understand morphological signal operators and set or lattice algebra to analyze them in the space domain. In this paper, we provide a unified view and analytic tools for a recently growing part of morphological image processing that is based on ideas from differential calculus and dynamical systems. This part includes both recent and some earlier ideas on using partial differential or difference equations (PDEs) to model distance propagation or nonlinear multiscale processes in images. We briefly review some nonlinear difference equations that implement discrete distance transforms and relate them to numerical solutions of the eikonal equation of optics. We also review some nonlinear PDEs that model the evolution of multiscale morphological operators and use morphological derivatives. Among the new ideas presented, we develop some general 2 -0 maxhin-sum difference equations that model the space dynamics of 2-D morphological systems (including the distance computations) and some nonlinear signal transforms, called slope transforms, that can analyze these systems in a transform domain in ways conceptually similar to the application of Fourier transforms to linear systems. Thus, distance transforms are shown to be bandpass slope filters. We view the analysis of the multiscale morphological PDEs and of the eikonal PDE solved via weighted distance tranforms as a unified area in nonlinear image processing, which we call differential morphology, and briefly discuss its potential applications to image processing and computer vision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>QRPHOLOGIAL image processing has been based traditionally on modeling images as sets or as points in a complete lattice of functions and viewing morphological image transformations as set or lattice operators. Thus, so far, the two classic approaches to analyzing or designing the deterministic systems of mathematical morphology have been (i) geometiy, by viewing them as image set transformations in Euclidean spaces; and (ii) algebra, to analyze their properties using set or lattice theory. Geometry was used mainly for intuitive understanding, and algebra was restricted to the space domain. Despite their limitations, these approaches have produced a powerful and self-contained broad collection of nonlinear image analysis concepts, operators, and algorithms. In parallel to these directions, there is a recently growing part of morphological image processing that is based on ideas from differential calculus and dynamical systems. It combines some early ideas on using simple morphological operations to obtain signal gradients and some recent ideas on using differential equations to model nonlinear multiscale processes or distance propagation in images. In this paper, we present a unified view of the various interrelated ideas in this area, and develop some systems analysis tools in both the space and a (slope) transform domain.</p><p>The main tools of morphological image processing are a broad class of nonlinear signal operators, also called morphological systems. These are (simple or complex) parallel and/or serial interconnections of the basic morphological dilation @ or morphological erosion e operations ( S @ g )</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( : E ) = v f(Y) + s(z -Y) ( f 9 . q ) (:I;) = A f ( y ) -d Y -. ) (1) (2) 1I€E Y E E</formula><p>where v and A denote supremum and infimum, and E = Rd or Z d . Compositions of erosions and dilations yield two useful smoothing filters: the opening f H ( f e g ) @ g and closing f H (,f@) @. The above morphological signal operations and their combinations have found a broad range of applications in image processing and computer vision; examples include problems in noise suppression, feature extraction, skeletonization, multiscale analysis, size distributions, segmentation, and shape recognition; see [15], <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> for surveys and more references.</p><p>The abundant use of set and lattice theory as the main analytic tools for morphological operations has been partly due to the relative intractability of these operations using standard ideas from calculus. Among the very few early connections between morphology and calculus were the morphological gradients. Specifically, given a function f : R2 -+ R, we define its isotropic morphological sup-derivative at a point 2 by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> where r B = {rb: b E B} is a disk B scaled to radius r , and f SB and f 8B are $at dilations and erosions of f by a planar set B, i.e., special cases of (1) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> where g is zero over its support set B as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(f@B)(.) = v P(. -y) ( f e B ) ( x ) = A f(. + Y). YEB Y E B</formula><p>The derivative M has been used in image analysis for edge detection. For example, [ M ( f ) + M ( -, f ) ] / 2 is Beucher's morphological derivative 141, which becomes equal to 1 \of\ \ when f is differentiable. A more recent applications area where calculus-based ideas have been used in morphology is that of multiscale analysis. Multiscale signal analysis is a useful and often required framework for many tasks such as feature/object detlection, motion detection, and multiband frequency analysis. While the majority of such approaches used so far have been linear, a general understanding arises for the limitations or inability of linear systems to successfully model several image processing problems, and the need grows for developing nonlinear approaches. Recently, some nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) have been developed in [SI and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> to model multiscale morphological operators as dynamical systems evolving in scale-space. To illustrate the basiic idea via a 1-D example, let us define the multiscale flat dilation and erosion of a 1-D signal f ( r ) by the set B = [-I, 1 1 at scales t 2 0 as the space-scale functions</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S(n:, t ) = v f ( . -p); E(., t ) = A f ( . +y). I Y l l t l Y l &lt; t</formula><p>An example of 6 and E is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Then th'e PDE generating these multiscale flat dilations or erosions is [SI, where + is for dilation andyields erosion. To deal with possible discontinuities in these partial derivatives, we can replace them with morphological derivatives (explained1 later). Recent works related to the above PDE and its 2-D extensions can be found in <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Further, the morphological PDEs are related to broader classes of nonlinear PDEs that have been developed recently to model nonlinear dynamics in image processing. For references, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and the papers in <ref type="bibr">[lS]</ref>. This rapidly growing interest in using PDEs for image processing is a natural continuation of earlier efforts in computer vision to model several image analysis tasks related to physical phenomena. Examples include shape from shading and optical flow [ 171 and modeling multiscale analysis via the heat diffusion equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Multiscale dilations and erosions of binary images can be also obtained via distance transforms. Discrete distance transforms can be implemented fast via 2-D min-sum difference equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. For example, the city-block distance transform of a discrete binary image f [ m , TL] can be obtained by running the following recursive equation: in a forward and backward image scan. Distance transforms of continuous-domain binary images can be obtained by propagating wavefronts [SI, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> using ideas similar to optic wave propagation according to Huygen's principle. Finally, resulting from Fermat's principle of least time, the wavefront propagation in geometrical optics is governed by the eikonal equation, a nonlinear PDE. This eikonal PDE has found applications in gridless halftoning [3 11, [42], <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> and shape from shading <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. Among other methods, the eikonal equation can also be solved using weighted distance transforms [ 191, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48</ref> 1, which can be implemented via min-sum difference equations with space-varying coefficients.</p><p>We have outlined above some close relationships between the morphological derivatives, the PDEs for multiscale morphology, the eikonal PDE of optics, and the difference equations used to implement distance transforms. The unifying theme is a collection of nonlinear differential/difference equations modeling the scale or space dynamics of morphological systems. We call this area differential morphology. Whereas classical morphological image processing is based on set and lattice theory, differential morphology offers calculus-based tools and some exciting connections to the physics of wave propagation.</p><p>The m e of derivatives and differential equations in image processing has been limited so far mostly to linear schemes; e.g., the Laplacian used in edge detection and the isotropic diffusion PDE used in multiscale vision. To analyze them there are existing tools both in the space domain (using linear systems theory) as well as in the frequency domain (using Fourier transforms). In this paper, we develop analysis tools for the nonlinear systems used in differential morphology, which have many similarities to the tools used to analyze linear differential schemes. Specifically, in Section I1 we present analytic methods to determine the output and properties of these nonlinear systems in the spatial domain based on their impulse response or on 2 -0 max-sum or min-sum difference equations that describe the discrete space dynamics of these systems. Further, in Section 111, to understand their behavior in a transform domain-the slope domain-we develop X X* Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p><p>the tangent.</p><p>Convex signal f, its tangent with slope = cy, and a line parallel to signal transforms, called slope transforms, whose properties and application to morphological systems has some striking conceptual similarities with Fourier transforms and their application to linear systems. Our discussion on morphological systems and slope transforms focuses on 2-D signal and systems; a similar work for 1-D signals and systems can be found in [23] and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>. Despite the wide applicability of morphological systems to image processing and computer vision, so far their analysis has lacked a transform domain. Thus, our work on slope transforms offers a way to fill this gap. Some other works connecting ideas between the slope domain and morphology can be found in [ 121, <ref type="bibr">[ 141, and [261.</ref> Section IV outlines the interpretation of distance transforms as bandpass slope filters. Min-sum difference equations, their application to computing discrete distance transforms, and the analysis of both in the slope domain is described in Section V. The eikonal equation, its solution via continuous weighted distance transforms, and an outline of its applications to image processing and vision are discussed in Section VI.</p><p>In Section VII, we briefly review from <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> some PDEs for multiscale dilations and erosions, and then refine them using morphological derivatives, which also yields a slope domain interpretation. Finally, we conclude with some comments and ideas for further research.</p></div>

Assuming a Lambertian image surface, the unknown function z satisfies an eikonal equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[4X]</ref> as follows: sources, then by ( <ref type="formula">44</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">46</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">@ ( P ) = coT(P)</formula><p>Thus we can equate the eikonal Q(z; y) to the weighted distancejunction between a point (x, y) and the sources along a path of minimal optical length and also see as proportional to the wavefront arrival time T ( z , y). See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">8</ref>(b) for an example of wavefront propagation through a heterogeneous medium. This weighted distance transform uses the Euclidean norm for horizontal path distances and the index values q ( z ; y) as vertical weights. Viewing the solution to the eikonal PDE as a weighted distance function dates back as early as <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>, was discussed in 14x1, and was proven in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>In a homogeneous medium of index 7 G 1 having a planar support X and sources located all over its boundary, the wavefronts propagate at constant velocity CO and can be obtained Numerical solutions to the eikonal, or equivalently to finding weighted distance transforms, solving shape from shading problems have been given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> using discrete distance algorithms implemented via queues and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref> using curve evolution implemented via the numerical algorithms of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>.</p><p>An efficient morphological approach to image segmentation is the watershed <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, which transforms an image f to the crest lines separating adjacent catchment basins that surround regional minima or other "marker" sets of feature points. From the work in [27]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>, it has been established that computing the watershed is equivalent to finding a skeleton by influence zones with respect to a weighted distance function that uses the regional minima as sources and 1 IV f 1 I as the field of indices. (If other markers different than the minima are to be used as sources, then the homotopy of the function must be modified to impose these markers as minima.) Hence, it has been proposed in 1271- <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref> to use existing efficient watershed algorithms for finding the solution to the eikonal.</p><p>Another interesting application is gridless image haljtoning. Inspired by the use of the eikonal function's contour lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> for visually perceiving an intensity image I ( x , y), the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> and especially in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref> attempts to solve the PDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref> jlV@(.r, y)ll = const -I ( % , y) and create a binary gridless halftone version of l(z, y) as the union of the isolevel curves of the eikonal function @(z. y). The larger the intensity value I ( x , y), the smaller the local density of these contour lines in the vicinity of (.E. y). To illustrate the power of this approach, shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">9</ref>, we have computed numerical solutions of the eikonal PDE in (49) using discrete weighted distance transforms, implemented' by iterating the min-sum difference <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref> with a = 5 , b = 7. Extending the discussion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, the rationale for such a solution is that, away from the sources, this difference equation mapping f ++ U corresponds to where uZJ are the chamfer weights inside B equal to the iunion of the output mask and its reflection. The left side of (50) is the (weighted) discrete morphological derivative M ( -U ) equal to U -11, e B, where horizontal distancizs are weighted by a z J . Thus, since in the continuous case ,W(-71) = IIVUII, ( <ref type="formula">50</ref>) is an approximation of the eikonal. In fact, as established in <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>, it is possible to recover a digital image U from its half morphological gradient U -U 8 B using weighted distance transforms if one places the source points in each regional minimum of U . The experimental results shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">9</ref> for various light source locations verify this conclusion of 1321 that this eikonal-based approach to gridless halftoning is indeed very promising and can simulate various artistic effects. whose variance (at) is proportional to scale t. The popularity of this approach is due to its linearity and the fact that the multiscale function y can be generated from the isotropic heat diffusion equation with initial condition y(z, y, 0) = f(z, y). The big disadvantage of the Gaussian multiscale approach is the fact that linear smoothen blur and shift important image features, e.g., edges. In contrast, morphological smoothing filters, such as openings and closings, can smooth while preserving important image features and correspond to simple filtering operations.</p><p>Examples are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>. So far the vast majority of implementations of multiscale morphological filtering had been with q = p/(p -I). This PDE states that the velocity of' the multiscale dilation by a ball Bp along the scale direction 1 is equal to the y-norm of its spatial gradient over the x, y plane.</p><p>The multiscale erosions E satisfy equations identical to the above dilation PDEs except that one must multiply the gradient norms by -1; i.e., ds/&amp; = -\ \ V E ~/ .</p><p>These simple but nonlinear PDEs are satisfied at points where the data are smooth., i.e.. the partial derivatives exist. Starting from a continuous f , the multiscale functions 6 and E remain continuous at all z,, y? i,.</p><p>However, even if f is differentiable, as the scale t increases the multiscale erosions/dilations can create discontinuities in their derivatives; then these derivatives and the generator PDEs have to be interpreted correctly at such points according to the specific case. This problem is solved if we assume that left and right derivatives exist in each direction and replace the con vention,ai deli vati ves with hological derivatives. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> the dilation PDE d ~ I I V d l l ~ was numerically solved using robust algorithms from (303 for curve evolution. Thus multiscale dilations by disks can be modeled in a continuous framework, i.e.. via PDEs, and then implemented via algorithms that can approximate arbitrarily well the shape of the Euclidean disks on the discrete plane. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">11</ref> shows the results of a simulation to compare the traditional dilation of digital images via discrete max-sum convolution of the image by digital approximations to disks, e.g., squares, versus a dilation, which is the solution S(z, y, t ) of the dilation PDE implemented as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> using the curve evolution algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>. Comparing both the gray-level images and their binary versions (from thresholding at level = 0) it is evident that the PDE approach to multiscale dilations can give much better approximations to Euclidean disks and, hence, avoid the abrupt shape discretization inherent in modeling digital multiscale dilations using discrete disks.</p><p>The eikonal PDE IIVu(z, y)ll = ~( L c , y) relates the magnitude of the eikonal's gradient to the index field. Hence, it is related to the multiscale morphological PDEs where the velocity along the scale direction is equal to the norm of the spatial gradient. Actually, in [4 1 ] continuous-scale dilations of binary images have been implemented by embedding the binary image as the zero-level threshold set of a function 4 and solving the PDE aqb/at = liVq!ll using the numerical algorithms of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref> that are suitable for PDEs of the eikonal type. Also, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref> the curve evolution approach to distance transforms is related to solutions of eikonal-based PDEs of the type ut = /IVu(z, y)ll -~( z , y) at steady state (ut = 0).</p><p>Finally note that, given that I I O ~~~ is the upper slope transform of the indicator function of the ball Bp (see Table <ref type="table">11</ref>), it follows that where S"(f) denotes the upper slope transform of a signal f . Namely, the velocity of S along the scale direction t (and its spatial morphological derivative) is equal to the slope transform of the indicator function of the ball Bp evaluated at a slope equal to the spatial gradient of S. Details of this slope transform interpretation of morphological derivatives and dilation PDEs can be found in <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. Also, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref> the PDEs describing the scale-space evolution of multiscale dilations of umbras (i.e., hypographs and epigraphs) of signals were expressed in terms of Fenchel conjugates (closely related to the slope transforms) using ideas from convex analysis; however, note that set dilation of signal umbras does not always correspond to max-sum convolution @ of signals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have developed 2-D max/min-sum difference equations that model the space dynamics of 2-D morphological systems and slope transforms that can analyze these systems in a transform domain. We have also introduced the concepts of impulse response and slope response that are useful in understanding the behavior of distance transforms as infiniteextent min-sum convolutions in the space domain and as bandpass spatial slope filters in the slope domain. Some of these ideas were also used to analyze the eikonal PDE solved via distance transforms and the evolution PDEs modeling multiscale dilations and erosions. We view the analysis of these nonlinear PDEs and the madmin-sum difference equations as a unified area in nonlinear image processing, which we call differential morphology.</p><p>The eikonal PDE has many potential applications, including solving problems in distance-path finding, segmentation, gridless halftoning, and shape from shading. However, its computation via weighted distance transforms has considerable complexity. Since we have shown that distance transforms are slope filters, it remains to be seen whether a faster distance computation can be found based on slope transforms; the appealing fact here is the correspondence of min-sum signal convolutions in space to transform additions in the slope domain. However, since weighted distance transforms require difference equations with spatially varying coefficients, a study is also needed of the shift-varying slope response of adaptive min-sum difference equations.</p><p>The dilation PDEs suggest new ways to view and implement morphological multiscale filtering that avoid the shape discretization effects inherent in all discrete implementations as demonstrated in [41] by implementing continuous-scale morphological dilations of binary images via curve evolution. Given that good approximations to Euclidean distance transforms and, hence, to multiscale dilations of binary images by disks, can be efficiently computed using chamfer distance transforms, a comparison remains to be done to study the relative advantages of the curve evolution versus the chamfer distance approach in terms of goodness of approximation and computational complexity. A preliminary work in <ref type="bibr">[lo]</ref> indicates that the PDE approach, implemented via curve evolution, can achieve a better approximation to Euclidean distances and multiscale analysis than the chamfer distance transforms, but at a higher computational complexity.</p></div>
