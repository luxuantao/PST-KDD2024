<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Owing to abundant spectrum resources, millimeter wave (mmwave) communication promises to provide Gbps data rates, which, however, may be restricted by large path-loss. Thus, antenna arrays are commonly used along with beam alignment (BA) as an important step to achieve the array gain. Efficient BA relies on the beam training codebook design. In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical codebook to achieve uniform BA performance with low overhead. To better elaborate on the design principle, a single-path channel model is considered first to frame the proposal. The codebook design is formulated as an optimization problem, where the ripple in the main/side lobes is constrained such that each training beam is close to the ideal one with a flat magnitude response and a narrow transition band. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm to find such a beam training codebook. Furthermore, we derive closed-form expressions of the BA misalignment probability or error rate of the proposed beam training codebook. Our results reveal that using the proposed codebook, the error rate of tree-searchbased BA exponentially decreases with the SNR for a given channel, and linearly decreases in the log-log coordinate axis for a fading channel. We further propose a power allocation scheme used in different training stages to further improve the BA performance. Finally, the proposed framework is extended to the more complex case of multi-path channels. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed training codebook and power allocation scheme as well as the accuracy of the performance analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>is generally required to increase the communication distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Fortunately, it is possible to pack a large number of antennas into a small size due to the short wavelength of mmwave signals. Considering the fact that an mmwave radiofrequency (RF) chain is expensive and its ADC/DAC is power consuming, a hybrid structure is preferred, where the number of RF chains is far less than that of antennas <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. This brings new challenges for the design of hybrid digital/analog beamforming <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Note that due to possible large path-loss, the receive signal of mmwave communication may be too weak to work before effective beamforming. It is important to align the transmit and receive beams at the very beginning of communication, so as to achieve the array gain. This procedure is commonly called as beam alignment (BA), realized by searching the best pairs of transmit and receive beams from a beam training codebook <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In general, BA with high accuracy plays a key role in building reliable mmwave communication links, achieving desired data of transmission and enlarging the cell coverage area. Particularly, accurate BA techniques can be used for mmwave channel estimation, i.e., by estimating relevant physical parameters including angle of arrival (AoA) and path gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>In practical mmwave communication systems, there are stringent requirements on BA. First, high frequencies of mmwave bands imply that the channels may vary quickly, and BA shall be completed in a small portion of the channel coherent time. Hence, an exhaustive beam search is inapplicable. Second, to fully exploit the array gain of large antenna arrays, the aligned beams need to be narrow, which increases the complexity of BA and thus calls for highly efficient codebook designs and beam search algorithms.</p><p>To reduce the training overhead of BA, an efficient approach is to use a tree search algorithm based on a hierarchical multi-resolution codebook <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The hierarchical codebook is defined with different levels of sub-codebooks. In the high level, the sub-codebook consists of a small number of low-resolution beams (coarse beams), covering the intended angle/beam range. In the lower level, the sub-codebook has an increased number of fine beams to cover the same angle/beam range. The width or coverage of each coarse beam is identical to the aggregated width of multiple finer beams together. Then, a search-and-refine algorithm can be carried out across the hierarchical codebook. It should be noted that there is error propagation in a binary tree search, which can reduce the BA performance. Recently, the BA performance of hierarchical search (in terms of the asymptotic misalignment probability) was analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> via large deviations. It was pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> that a desirable training beam for BA shall have a uniform gain in the main lobe.</p><p>Since the hierarchical codebook design is crucial in improving the BA performance, it has attracted much attention recently. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the hierarchical-search-based BA technique was proposed to overcome the outdoor impairments in millimeter wave propagation. A hierarchical codebook design based on the least squares (LS) method was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> to estimate mmwave channels. By jointly exploiting sub-array and deactivation antenna processing techniques, a hierarchical codebook design was devised in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, where the closed-form expressions were provided to generate the codebook. The deactivation antenna processing technique was also used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to design hierarchical codebooks. However, turning off antennas is not a good approach for broader beam designs since each antenna typically has an active power amplifier and the efficiency of power amplifiers at mmwave frequencies is also poor. Moreover, turning off antennas will lead to a loss of the array gain and collective EIRP levels due to a smaller number of active antennas.</p><p>In general, the training beams designed by the approaches mentioned above usually have a large ripple in main/side lobes. Note that it is important to control the ripple of training beams. Firstly, suppressing the ripple is beneficial to achieve a uniform BA performance, i.e., the BA performance (e.g., the achieved conditional BA misalignment probability) is independent of the angles of arrival and departure (AoA and AoD) of the user channel, which can guarantee user fairness to some extent. Secondly, suppressing the ripple is also beneficial to reduce the BA error rate. Although the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> realized the importance of controlling the ripple, the proposed LS method cannot well suppress the ripple and thus causes a large performance loss on non-quantized points in the angle domain. In the study of beamforming tradeoffs for initial UE discovery, a maximin optimization design was proposed to achieve a well-shaped training beam, which essentially looks for a flat array gain response in the coverage area of the designed beam, and thus can achieve a small ripple in the main lobe as well as side lobe in most cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Nevertheless, to design an effective hierarchical training codebook, it is crucial to strictly control the ripples of the main/side lobes in each beam codeword.</p><p>Although some design insights are available <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, the original fundamental problems have not yet been solved, and meanwhile new practical problems arise. They include:</p><p>(1) how to design a training beam with guaranteed narrow transition band and small ripples in both the main lobe and the side lobe; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> if such training beams are available, how to assess the BA performance more accurately and comprehensively, especially for practical parameter setting; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> what extra benefits and insights can we obtain using the designed training beams? (4) how to address the error propagation and to achieve a desirable BA performance; (5) using the designed training beams, can we further improve the BA performance?</p><p>In this paper, inspired by the former works <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, we propose a training codebook design by shaping the geometric pattern of each beam and formulating the beam design as an optimization problem with both the ripple and the transition band taken into consideration. The designed training beam with arbitrary beamwidth is optimized to possess a flat magnitude response and a narrow transition band. To address the error propagation, we modify the codebook structure based on the method of the proposed training beam design. We further derive the analytic expressions of the achieved BA performance and provide some useful insights. In particular, the use of the designed codebooks is able to achieve a uniform BA performance. Based on the derived concise expressions, we further propose an efficient strategy for allocating training resource to further improve the BA performance. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:</p><p>• To obtain the desirable beam pattern, we formulate the training beam design as a beam pattern optimization problem, with the constraints on the ripple of main/side lobes and the transition band.</p><p>• Then, we propose an efficient method to address the nonconvex beam pattern optimization problem. The obtained beam has a small ripple in both the main/side lobes and a narrow transition band. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We present the system model in Section II. The codebook structure and design guidance are presented in Section III. The beam pattern shaping approach and transition band processing are proposed in Section IV and Section V, respectively. The performance analysis and some extension are presented in Section VI and Section VII, respectively. Simulation results are provided in Section VIII.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL</head><p>We consider a multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system operating in the mmwave spectrum. The transmitter (Tx) is equipped with N t transmit antennas, which are controlled by N rf RF chains, and the receiver (Rx) has a single antenna. Accounting for practical limitation on the mmwave hardware, it is assumed that the RF analog phase shifters have constant modulus and the number of RF chains is limited, i.e., N rf &lt; N t . We first focus on the MISO case as it is easier to understand and illustrate the principle of codebook design and simplify the performance analysis. Later on, we extend our design to the MIMO case.</p><p>An extended Saleh-Valenzuela geometric model was adopted in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. In the ideal setting, the channel is determined by scattering over several clusters/paths with no near-field impairments at the receiver end. In this paper, the channel vector is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">h = √ N t /β L ∑ l=1 α l a t (sin(ϕ l )),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where ϕ l and α l denote the angle of departure (AoD) and the complex path gain of the l-th path, respectively, β is the average path-loss between the Tx and the Rx, and a t represents the array response vector at the Tx. For simplicity, uniform linear array (ULA) is considered in this paper. Hence, a t (x) takes the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">a t (x) = 1 √ N t [ 1, e j 2π λ dtx , • • • , e j(Nt-1) 2π λ dtx ] T ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where λ and d t denote the signal wavelength and the distance between two adjacent antennas at the Tx, respectively. Note that more practical aspects such as frequency selectivity are deferred to our future work, though they are important for mmwave system design.</p><p>In order to perform BA, signal measurement is needed by sounding the training beams, with each transmit beam selected from a designed training beam codebook. The received signal is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">y = √ ph H F RF f BB z + n,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where z = 1 is the normalized pilot signal, p is the transmit power, n is the additive Gaussian noise distributed as n ∼ CN (0, 1), and F RF ∈ C Nt×Nrf and f BB ∈ C Nrf×1 are the analog part and digital part of a training beam f = F RF f BB , respectively. Since F RF is realized by a set of RF phase shifters, each element of F RF takes the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">F RF (m, n) = e jφm,n (φ m,n ∈ R, 1 ≤ m ≤ N t , 1 ≤ n ≤ N rf ).</formula><p>We denote F RF f BB by f and concentrate on the design of f with desired properties. With f available, we then map f into F RF and f BB .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. CODEBOOK STRUCTURE AND DESIGN GUIDANCE</head><p>In this section, we first present the codebook structure and the corresponding BA algorithm. Then, we derive the guidance for the codebook design with the objective of minimizing the BAER.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Codebook Structure</head><p>The designed codebook possesses a tree structure which can reduce the training overhead <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. For simplicity, we temporarily consider only the codebook design and BA based on a binary tree. For convenience, throughout this paper, we use ψ to denote the sine of an AoD ϕ, i.e., ψ(ϕ) = sin(ϕ).</p><p>If not explicitly stated, an AoD means its sine value. Let the desired BA accuracy or resolution ∆ d be 1/N , where N is a dyadic integer. Then, we define the absolute error of BA as ∆(ψ) = ψ -ψ , which shall satisfy ∆(ψ) ≤ ∆ d for any AoD ψ ∈ [-1, 1], where ψ denotes the estimated value of ψ. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, we define that a hierarchical training codebook consists of S = log 2 N sub-codebooks {C s | s = 1, 2, • • • , S}, each for a training stage, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. It is seen that, in the s-th layer of the hierarchical codebook, i.e., sub-codebook C s , for the s-th training stage, there are totally 2 s beamforming vectors with the same beam width 2/2 s . The number of the beamforming vectors in the s-th layer is twice of that of the (s -1)-th layer, i.e., card(C s ) = 2 • card(C s-1 ). To facilitate binary tree search, the beam coverage of each pair of the beamforming vectors in the s-th layer, denoted as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">R 1,1 f R 2,1 f L 2,2 f R 2,2 f L 2,1 f R 3,4 f L 3,4 f L 3,2 f [ 1,1] C 1 C 2 C 3 L 3,3 f R 3,3 f R 3,1 f L 3,1 f R 3,2 f L 1,1 f F 1,1 = {f L 1,1 , f R 1,1 }, F 2,1 = {f L 2,1 , f R 2,1 }, F 2,2 = {f L 2,2 , f R 2,2 }, • • •</formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">F s,b = {f L s,b , f R s,b }</formula><p>, shall be identical to that of the b-th beamforming vector in the (s -1)-th layer. Each beamforming vector in one pair occupies half of the beam coverage. Mathematically, the beam coverage of the beam pair F s,b is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">I s,b = [ -1 + b -1 2 s-2 , -1 + b 2 s-2 ] , (b = 1, • • • , 2 s-1 ). (4)</formula><p>Accordingly, the beam coverages of f L s,b and f R s,b are I L s,b = I s+1,2b-1 and I R s,b = I s+1,2b (s ≤ S -1), respectively. Using such a hierarchical training codebook, the binary tree search based BA can be implemented to find the strongest beam for single-path mmwave channels. For clarity, the pseudo code of the BA algorithm is provided in Algorithm 1 which is similar to that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The term y q s,m in Algorithm 1 denotes the observation at the Rx corresponding to the training beam </p><formula xml:id="formula_7">f q s,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">q ⋆ = arg max q∈{L,R} ∑ Ms m=1 y q s,m</formula><p>(3) Rx feeds back q ⋆ to Tx with 1 bit (4) Tx updates b f :</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">if q ⋆ = L, b f = 2b f -1; else b f = 2b f . end 4: Output: aligned beam direction ψ ⇐ -1 + 2b f -1 2 S</formula><p>In the first step, the Tx successively uses a pair of lowresolution beamforming vectors in the first layer of codebook to transmit signal z, each repeated M s times to increase the receive SNR. Then, the Rx selects the beamforming vector with higher receive energy and feeds back its index to the Tx, by which the Tx determines the range of the strongest AoD. Within the detected range, the Tx selects a pair of higherresolution beamforming vectors in the next layer of codebook to transit signal z, so that a finer range of AoD is determined and so on, until the specific highest-resolution beamforming vector in the codebook is finally selected by the Rx and fed back to the Tx.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Codebook Design Guidelines</head><p>Now we focus on the guidance of the codebook design aiming to minimize the BAER. </p><formula xml:id="formula_10">y q s,b,i = √ κ q s,b h H f q s,b z + n q s,b,i (i = 1, • • • , M s ) =α √ κ q s,b N t /βa H t (ψ)f q s,b + n q s,b,i ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where κ q s,b is the transmit power of z, and n q s,b,i is the noise random variable distributed as CN (0, 1). In order to reduce the impact of noise, f q s,b is used repeatedly at M s successive time slots. Note that throughout this paper p and q always denote L or R, i.e., p, q ∈ {L, R}.</p><p>Without loss of generality, we further assume that ψ is contained in We can prove that m q s,b / √ M s is distributed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">I L s,b . Let u q s,b (ψ) = a H t (ψ)f q s,b and m q s,b = ∑ Ms i=1 y q s,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">m q s,b / √ M s ∼ CN ( α √ κ q s,b M s N t /βu q s,b (ψ), 1</formula><p>) .</p><p>Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, using the result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">P(|m L s,b | ≤ |m R s,b |) = Q(x, y) - 1 2 I 0 (xy)e -1 2 (x 2 +y 2 ) , (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>where Q is the first-order Marcum Q-function, I 0 is the 0-th order modified Bessel function of the first kind, and x and y are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">x = αu L s,b (ψ) √ 0.5κ L s,b M s N t /β y = αu R s,b (ψ) √ 0.5κ R s,b M s N t /β. Since I 0 (xy) ≥ 0 and Q(x, y) ≤ exp ( -(y -x) 2 /2 ) [29], with a reasonable assumption of κ L s,b = κ R s,b , an upper bound of P(|m L s,b | ≤ |m R s,b |) can be obtained as P L s,b (ψ) &lt; Q(x, y) ≤ exp ( - M s N t |α| 2 κ L s,b ( |u L s,b (ψ)| -|u R s,b (ψ)| ) 2<label>4β</label></formula><p>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">. (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>The upper bound of P R s,b (ψ) can be obtained similarly. The upper bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> indicates that P q s,b (ψ) at least decays exponentially in κ q s,b and M s . However, P q s,b (ψ) is generally not uniform since P L s,b (ψ) is ψ (AoD) dependent, which implies that the probability is intimately related to the direction of the Rx relative to the Tx. However, this is unexpected in practice since the location of the Rx is randomly distributed. For example, in the context of 802.11ad, two users having different angles relative to an access point (AP) may try communicating with the AP . However, in this case it is very likely that one of them can access to the AP successfully, while the other one fails, though the distances between them and the AP are the same, which is unfair for the later.</p><p>To make the probability P L s,b (ψ) independent of ψ and therefore achieve a uniform performance,</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">|u L s,b (ψ)|-|u R s,b (ψ)| should be constant for any ψ ∈ I L s,b . To minimize P L s,b (ψ), |u L s,b (ψ)| -|u R s,b (ψ)</formula><p>| should be positive and as large as possible according to the derived upper bound. However,</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">since |u L s,b (ψ)| -|u R s,b (ψ)| dependents on both f L s,b and f R s,b</formula><p>, the coupling makes it challenging to design f L s,b and f R s,b . Moreover, to perform multiple beam alignments, it is also necessary to consider the influence of the magnitude response of the other beamforming vectors in the same sub-codebook, which makes the codebook design more complicated.</p><p>To circumvent this difficulty and make the designed codebook applicable to multiple beam alignments, we let |u q s,b (ψ)| be equal to two constants r q s,b and r q,c s,b that correspond to</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">ψ ∈ I q s,b and ψ ∈ [-1, 1]\I q s,b , respectively. This guarantees that |u L s,b (ψ)| -|u R s,b (ψ)| is a constant.</formula><p>To further simplify the design, without loss of generality, we let r q,c s,b be 0 and maximize r q s,b , which is similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Therefore, the design of f q s,b can be formulated as the following optimization problem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">max f q s,b r q s,b s.t. a H t (ψ)f q s,b = r q s,b , (ψ ∈ I q s,b ) a H t (ψ)f q s,b = 0, (ψ / ∈ I q s,b ).<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Unfortunately, there is only a trivial solution to the problem (9), as shown in the following lemma.</p><p>Lemma 1. The problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> has only a trivial solution f q s,b = 0, and r q s,b is 0 in this case. 1 Such a trivial solution is a consequence of the strict constraint that the ripple is zero. To avoid such a trivial case, the beam pattern shall be allowed to fluctuate within a small scope for different directions. Therefore, we propose the following guidance for the training codebook design:</p><p>• The ripple in both the main lobe and the side lobe should be sufficiently small and the transition band should be narrow, which guarantees uniform BA performance and high accuracy of BA. • The magnitude response in the main lobe should be as large as possible. Moreover, in order to minimize the upper bound (8), the magnitude response in the side lobe should be as small as possible (zero in the ideal case). Though some prior works have discussed part of the above design guidance, e.g., expressions similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> were derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the guidance is first refined and stated explicitly in a relatively comprehensive form based on the new derived upper bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. It is a non-trivial task to design a training codebook having the above properties and a satisfactory solution is yet not available. In the next section, we will address the problem by using beam pattern shaping approach.</p></div>

CODEBOOK DESIGN ALGORITHM</head><p>In this section, we first formulate the problem of training codebook design as an optimization problem, where the derived guidance of codebook design is used as constraints.

With the initial point obtained by solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, the CCCP algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 2. For the sake of convenience, Algorithm 2 is termed as BPSA, i.e., the beam pattern shaping approach. Note that though the ULA is used to elaborate the principle of BPSA, BPSA applies to other antenna array geometries as well. For this purpose, we first define a coverage space which the antenna array can cover. For example, a uniform planar antenna array can, typically, cover a rectangular region in a plane. Then, we define the main lobe and the side lobe within the coverage space and sample the main/side lobes, obtaining two discrete point sets. Finally, to obtain an expected training beam vector, we construct an optimization problem similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> and solve this problem. Now, the remaining problem is the hybrid implementation of the designed training beamforming vector f ⋆ Nt×1 . Mathematically, it is equivalent to finding an analog precoding matrix (F RF ) Nt×Nrf and a digital precoding vector (f BB ) Nrf×1 such that f ⋆ = F RF f BB . As revealed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, this problem is feasible and can be solved exactly if N rf ≥ 2. We would like refer the interested reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> (the proof of Theorem 1) for how to obtain the hybrid implementation.</p></div>

TRANSITION BAND PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS</head><p>In this section, we first point out an underlying problem of the tree-search-based BA using hierarchical training codebooks, i.e., error propagation. Then, we propose a modified codebook structure to solve this problem and further analyze its influence on the BA resolution or accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Influence of Transition Band -Error Propagation</head><p>Though the transition band of our designed beamforming vectors can be very narrow, its effect on the BA performance still cannot be ignored as we aim at achieving a uniform BA performance. Here we first give an example to shed light on the error propagation of the tree-search-based BA based on training beam codebooks with the conventional hierarchical structure. Without loss of generality, we consider the first training stage whose task is to determine which one of the two intervals [-1, 0] and [0, 1] contains the AoD ψ, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3(a)</ref>. Note that δ is used to denote one half of the width of the transition band in the remainder of this paper.</p><p>We assume that the real AoD ψ lies in the left half of the transition band of f L </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. New Codebook Structure</head><p>The analysis above indicates that if the real AoD locates in the transition band of some beamforming vector, the designed codebook using the conventional hierarchical structure may still suffer from a performance loss. This motivates us to devise a new hierarchical structure. Specifically, we propose to modify the setting of the main lobes of the designed beamforming vectors such that the main lobe of the beamforming vector in the s-th layer covers the transition band of the corresponding beamforming vector in the (s -1)-th layer. This goal can be  achieved by our proposed beam design method, as the width of the transition band of a beamforming vector can be accurately controlled in our approach. For ease of understanding, we provide an example to illustrate this method.</p><formula xml:id="formula_57">G G AoD (1) (2) (3) , L 1,1 R 1 1 ,f f [-1 1] R 2,2 f L 2,2 f R 3,4 f L 3,4 f (a) 0 1 1 0 G G 0 0.5 G G 0 1 (1) (2) New setting [-1 1] , L 1,1 R 1 1 ,f f Conventional setting L 2,2 f L 2,2 f (b)</formula><p>Example: Suppose that the transition band of</p><formula xml:id="formula_58">f L 1,1 and f R 1,1 is (-δ, δ), the conventional setting of the main lobe of f L 2,2 is [δ, 0.5 -δ].</formula><p>While in our design, the main lobe of f L 2,2 is modified as [-δ, 0.5 -δ] ⊃ (-δ, δ), as shown in the second sub-figure of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref></p></div>

Now whether {f</head><formula xml:id="formula_59">L 2,1 , f R 2,1 } or {f L 2,2 , f R 2,2</formula><p>} are used in the second training stage, we can always obtain a stable detection result, regardless of whether the AoD is in the main lobe or the transition band. This method can also be generalized to other cases.</p><p>The devised new hierarchical structure can be mathematically expressed as follows. For simplicity, we denote the interval I q s,b (q ∈ {L, R}) in Section III-A by [c, d], i.e., I q s,b = [c, d].

Therefore, the proposed new codebook structure suffers a resolution loss by δ to guarantee a uniform BA performance in the presence of the transition band in each beam. However, in practice such a loss is negligible for a large-scale antenna array. This is due to the fact that for a large N t , to guarantee the same level of the ripple in both the main lobe and the side lobe, δ shall be very small, for example, δ can be safely set as δ = 1/N t , which is inversely proportional to N t . In practice, the parameter δ can be carefully chosen to achieve a reasonable tradeoff between the BA resolution and the error rate, up to the system designer. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">5</ref>VI. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS In this section, we provide a thorough performance analysis on the presented BA algorithm based on the designed codebook. Particularly, we focus on deriving the expressions of the BAER for different channel environments, so as to reveal the relation between the achievable BA performance and the designed codebook. In the first subsection, we consider the case of a constant channel path gain. The case of a fading channel path gain is deferred to the second subsection. Here we consider performance analysis for single-path mmwave channels, i.e., L = 1 in (1), since for mmwave channels with LOS link, the effect of NLOS links is marginal compared to that of LOS link <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_61">2 -k + δ after k (1 ≤ k ≤ S) training stages,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Multi-path Channels</head><p>In this subsection, we consider the BA for multi-path mmwave channels. One method is to design multi-level beam training codebooks. Note that we can use Algorithm 2 to generate the desired multi-level training codebooks since the beams designed by Algorithm 2 have narrow transition bands and small ripples in the main/side lobes. We refer interesting readers to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> for more details about multi-level codebooks. Next, we focus on the BA for multi-path channels using the training codebooks designed previously, i.e., binary hierarchical codebooks, since there is no need to redesign the training codebooks.</p><p>Let L 0 denote the number of beams to be aligned. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">8</ref> The basic principle to align multiple beams is to transform the problem of multiple beams BA multiple single beam BA problems. For this purpose, the Tx divides the initial interval [-1, 1] into l 0 smaller sub-intervals of the same size and subsequently find L 0 most probable sub-intervals within the l 0 sub-intervals. Note that l 0 = 2 D0+⌈log 2 (L0)⌉ is a dyadic integer and determines the number of divided small sub-intervals, where D 0 is an adjustable parameter introduced to make the initial division more flexible. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">9</ref> Even though [-1, 1] may be divided into sub-intervals of different sizes, an advantage of the presented partition pattern is that there is no need to redesign training codebooks. Within the L 0 most probable subintervals containing the beam directions, (slightly modified) Algorithm 1 is repeated L 0 times to further perform BA.</p><p>For clarity, the BA algorithm for multi-path mmwave channels is provided in Algorithm 3. For convenience, we denote the (log 2 l 0 )-th sub-codebook used at the Tx by C init , i.e., C init = C log 2 l0 . To find out the L 0 most probable sub-intervals containing the beam directions, the transmitter uses f i ∈ C init at M 0 successive time slots. The received signals are denoted by </p><formula xml:id="formula_123">{y i,m | i = 1, • • • , l 0 , m = 1, • • • , M 0 },</formula><formula xml:id="formula_124">B = {i 1 , i 2 , • • • , i L0 } and Y i1 ≥ Y i2 ≥ • • • ≥ Y iL 0 ≥ Y iL 0 +1 ≥ • • • ≥ Y i l 0 .</formula><p>For i k ∈ B, the corresponding sub-interval is [-1 + 2(i k -1)/l 0 , -1+2i k /l 0 ], and the BA accuracy is about 1/l 0 . Finally, to achieve the desired BA accuracy, a modified Algorithm 1 is used repeatedly within the L 0 found sub-intervals. In fact, in modified Algorithm 1, there is no need to perform hierarchical search with the sub-codebooks</p><formula xml:id="formula_125">C 1 , • • • , C log 2 l0-1 . The total search time of Algorithm 3 is T = M 0 l 0 + 2L 0 ∑ log 2 N s=log 2 l0</formula><p>M s time slots. The increase of complexity is two-fold. Firstly, more paths need to be aligned. Secondly, to find out the L 0 most probable sub-intervals containing the beam directions, l 0 training beams need to be transmitted at the first training stage, whose search time is M 0 l 0 time slots. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Designed Training Beams</head><p>In this subsection, we provide several instances to illustrate the characteristics of designed training beamforming vectors. We consider ULA arrays with varying number of antennas. The distance between any two adjacent antennas is 3λ/8.

The normalized magnitude response of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">4</ref>(a). One can observe that the ripple in both the main lobe and the side lobe is small. Moreover, the goal in terms of controlling transition band is achieved as well. Specifically, the width of transition band is not greater than 2/N t = 1/8. Moreover, the designed beamforming vectors do satisfy the requirement of transition band covering in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, i.e., the transition band of {f</p><formula xml:id="formula_126">{f L 1,1 , f R 1,1 } and {f L 2,1 , f R 2,1 } is plotted in Fig.</formula><formula xml:id="formula_127">L 1,1 , f R 1,1 } is contained in the main lobe of f R 2,1 .</formula><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">4</ref>(b), we consider the case where the number of antennas is moderate (N t = 64). It is clear that the width of transition band becomes much narrower. However, the ripple in both the main lobe and the side lobe band still keeps small. Moreover, the requirement of transition band covering is still satisfied in this instance.</p><p>To further show the advantages of BPSA, a design instance with relatively large number of antennas is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">5(a)</ref>. For comparison, two training beamforming vectors designed by BMW-SS (beam widening via single-RF subarray) method (proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>) are presented as well. One can observe that the ripple in both the main lobe and the side lobe is still small, though the width of transition band is very narrow. In contrast, the ripple of the training beamforming vectors designed by the BMW-SS method is relatively large in the side lobe. Moreover, the width of transition band is also relatively large. This brings difficulty to deal with the error propagation and achieve a uniform BA performance.</p><p>It is well known that an antenna array with a larger aperture has more gain to obtain and therefore has a higher resolution. From above three design instances, we conclude that the proposed algorithm can take full advantages of this property of large-scale antenna arrays, especially designing training beamforming vectors of high resolution.</p><p>The array gains of normalized training beamforming vectors in different sub-codebooks and the corresponding normalized magnitude response are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">5(b</ref>). Since the array gains of any two training beams in the same sub-codebook are almost equal, only one training beam is chosen from each of the sub-codebooks C 1 , • • • C 4 . Suppose that r ⋆ and ε in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> for different beamforming vectors are approximately equal, the beam pattern spread is approximately equal, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">4</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">5(a)</ref>. However, the larger the beam width is, the larger E in (15) is required. Therefore, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, the maximal beamforming gain of normalized beamforming vector is smaller if the beam width is larger, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">5(b</ref>). It is also observed that the upper bounds of array gains derived in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_39">18</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_43">19</ref>) are tight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. BA Performance</head><p>The simulation setting is given as follows. The average path-loss β in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) is assumed to be 1. The AoD ϕ takes continuous values in [-π/2, π/2] uniformly. The tree search consists of S = log 2 N t training stages. The width of transition band 2δ is set to be 2/N t , i.e., δ = 1/N t . Besides the BMW-SS codebook, another codebook designed by the beam shape synthesis method (BSSM) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> is also considered for comparison. To be fair in comparison with the BA based on different codebooks, we restrict that the total training powers for the comparing schemes are equal. We use the metric P fail or Pfail to evaluate the performance of BA using different training codebooks. The simulation results are obtained by averaging over 10 8 independent channel realization for each SNR value defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</p><p>We first consider single-path and fixed-gain mmwave channels and adopt the equal power allocation strategy. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">6(a)</ref> shows the average BAER of hierarchical search with the BMW-SS, BSSM and BPSA codebooks. The results show that the BAER performance with our BPSA codebook is better than that with the BMW-SS or BSSM codebook when the SNR is greater than -2dB. As the SNR increases, the BAER with the three codebooks all decreases. However, the BAER with the BPSA codebook decreases dramatically, while the BAER with the other codebooks decreases gently. Particularly, the BAER with the BPSA codebook decays exponentially in the SNR, which agrees with the result derived in Corollary 1. The reason is two-fold. Firstly, the training beams generated by Algorithm 2 have narrower transition band and small ripple in main/side lobes. Secondly, since the transition band of training beamforming vectors within the BPSA codebook is processed carefully, a uniform BA performance in the whole interval [-1, 1] can be achieved. One can also observe that the upper bound provided by Theorem 2 is effective but not tight, however, the BAER expression provided by Theorem 1 is close to the numerical results over the whole SNR range. Moreover, it is interesting to see that the expression derived in Corollary 1 is also effective though a couple of approximations are adopted in the derivation.  The average BAER of hierarchical search with the three codebooks for single-path fading channels is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">6</ref>(b). "Equal" and "Optimized" in the legend represent the equal power allocation strategy and the optimized power allocation strategy derived in Corollary 3, respectively. One can observe that for either of the two strategies the BAER of the BPSA codebook is lower than that of the BMW-SS codebook or the BSSM codebook over all SNRs. Moreover, the BAER performance of the optimized power allocation strategy derived in Corollary 3 is better than that of the equal power allocation strategy. It is also observed that the BAER decreases almost linearly with the SNR in the log-log coordinate axis. This result is consistent with the analytical one given in (46).</p><p>Next we consider the BAER performance of multi-path mmwave channels, where the number of paths, i.e., L in (1), is 3 and the number of beams to be aligned L 0 is also 3. The channel paths are assumed to be apart from each other. For the multi-path model, if one path fails to achieve predefined accuracy, BA is regarded failed. The average BAER and spectral efficiency of hierarchical search with the three codebooks for fading channels are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">7</ref>(a) and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">7</ref>(b), respectively. The thin dash lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">7</ref>(a) denote the probability that at most one path fails.</p><p>It is observed from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">7</ref>(a) that the BAER performance of the BPSA codebook is better than that of the BMW-SS or BSSM codebook. Interestingly, one can observe from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">7</ref>(a) that it is difficult to align all beams successfully for multi-path fading channels, since the gains of some paths may be very small. However, it is still able to align most of the paths with a high probability, as shown by the thin dash lines. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">7</ref>(a) also shows the superiorities of the proposed power allocation strategy for multi-path fading channels. Since the BPSA codebook can achieve better BAER performance, as expected, the spectral efficiency of hierarchical search with the BPSA codebook is better than that of the BMW-SS or BSSM codebook, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">7(b)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. CONCLUSION</head><p>We first derived the guidance for codebook design with the aim to achieving a uniform BA performance. From the perspective of shaping the pattern of a training beam, especially controlling its ripple, we formulated the hierarchical codebook design into a non-convex optimization problem. Then, we reached an efficient solution to the problem which converged to a KKT point. The simulation results showed that our designed beam has flat main/sibe lobes and a controllable transition band. To address the error propagation, we proposed a modified hierarchical codebook structure, which helped to achieve the uniform BA performance and caused ignorable extra overhead when the number of antennas is large. Using the designed training codebook, we analyzed the achievable performance of the binary-tree-search-based BA in terms of BAER, and derived closed-form approximate expressions for both fixed-gain channels and fading channels. The effectiveness was verified via numerical results. They revealed that the BAER of the BA using our designed codebook decreases exponentially with the SNR for fixed-gain channels while decreases linearly in the log-log coordinate axis for fading channels. To further improve the BA performance, we proposed a power allocation scheme. Finally, simulation results were provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms under different channel environments, which almost coincided with our analytical results. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

The training beamforming vectors f L 1,1 (main lobe: [-1, -δ], side lobe: [δ, 1]) and f R 1,1 (main lobe: [δ, 1], side lobe: [-1, -δ]) are used to detect the AoD ψ, as shown in Fig. 3(a)-(1). Because of low SNR and non-ideal feature of training beamforming vectors, the detected result is probably ψ ∈ [0, 1]. However, in the second training stage, instead of f L 2,1 and f R 2,1 , the training beamforming vectors used to detect the AoD are f L 2,2 and f R 2,2whose main lobes do not cover the real AoD ψ, as shown in Fig.3(a)-(2). In the subsequent training stages, similar phenomena will still occur. For example, in the third training stage, f L 3,4 and f R 3,4 may be used to detect the AoD (See Fig.3(a)-(3)), leading to an unexpected and uncontrollable result finally.</figDesc></figure>

A small value of δ, e.g., 1/Nt, will not significantly affect the beam forming gain at earlier stages. However, at a higher level, since the main lobe of each beam is narrow, δ becomes significant and comparable to the beam width of the main lobe (in conventional design). Broadening the main lobe by δ may lead to considerable loss of the beam forming gain.</p></note>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="8" xml:id="foot_4"><p>For the proposed multi-beam BA algorithm, i.e., Algorithm 3, it is not very important to accurately estimate the number of paths for sparse multi-path fading mmwave channels. The reason is two-fold. Firstly, the prior knowledge of the number of paths to improve the BAER performance is limited when the gains of some paths are small and such paths can usually be safely ignored. Secondly, strong beam components can still be aligned with a high probability (See Fig.7).</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="9" xml:id="foot_5"><p>Note that D 0 implies a tradeoff between the exhaustive search and the tree-based search. Specifically, a larger D 0 indicates that more sub-intervals need to be tested, which will introduce more training overhead. In the extreme case, i.e., D 0 = log 2 N -⌈log 2 (L 0 )⌉, Algorithm 3 becomes the exhaustive search in fact. However, thanks to the sparsity of mmwave channels, D 0 is usually small and 0 or 1 (and at most 2) may be enough.</p></note>
