INTRODUCTION</head><p>N the past few years, there has been a great deal of interest I in the generation of motion planning algorithms for robots with nonholonomic or nonintegrable velocity constraints in cluttered environments. These constraints on the instantaneous velocities arise from the kinematics of the drive "isms of the carts. This work has been a departure froa the traditional robot motion planning (see, for example, [81, [19], [22]) which concentrated on understanding the complexity of the computational effort associated with planning trajectories for robots (with no constraints on their instantaneous velocities) which would avoid both fixed and moving obstacle. the motion plans arising from these more traditional methods often required sideways motion of robot carts with wheels and,</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>as was pointed out by Laumond, most mobile robots ate not on castors <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[23]</ref>, [MI.</p><p>In this paper, we consider and solve the motion planning problem for a system consisting of a car-like mobile robot pulling n trailers. This system has been an important canonical example for the work on nonholonomic motion planning ever since it was posed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[25]</ref> and [33]. The nonholonomic constraints for this system arise from constraining each pair of wheels to roll without slipping. Strictly speaking, if an axle has a differential that keeps the pair of wheels rolling without slipping, then each wheel turns a Merent amount ia acc&amp;ce with a simple geometric relationship called the Alexandw-Maddocks condition [l]. In our work we will neglect this and model the wheels on an axle as being parallel.</p><p>The system of a car with n trailers has been viewed as a canonical example because each trailer adds one dimension to the state space of the system (representing its angle with respect to the inertial frame) and one nonholonomic constraint.</p><p>Regardless of the number of trailers attached, the general system always has two degrees of freedom, corresponding to the driving and steering directions of the front car. It has been shown that every point in the state space is reachable, i.e., that the system is completely controllable <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[25]</ref>. The question that is answered in this paper is one of constructive controllability; explicit open-loop controls for steering the car with n trailers from an initial to a final position are given. We first give a btief description of some of the previous work on this problem. A more detailed review of the general nonholonomic motion planning problem can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[34]</ref> or in a recent collection of papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[27]</ref>. A more detailed description of the N-trailer problem and its variations can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[25]</ref>. A tutorial introduction to nonholonomic motion planning is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[32]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Barraquand</ref> and Latombe [3] proposed a planner for cars with trailers in a cluttered environment, with an attempt at finding one with a minimal number of backups. The main drawback to their approach was that it required a discretization of the state space followed by an exhaustive search of all possible directions the robot could go at each point. Consequently, the method became computationally infeasible for a large n u b e r of trailers. The method world well, however, in a very cluttered environment since the presence of many obstacles drastically reduced the number of search directions.</p><p>Related to this work is that of Divelbiss and Wen [Ill, who have explored a computational approach to the N-trailer problem. They also discretize the system and use gradient descent in the (discretized) input space to generate a feasible path. Convergence projmties of their method are currently under investigation, but the algorithm has demmstrated good performance in simulation. They are also able to incorporate obstacles into the p b l e m formulation, using potential field methods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[35]</ref> proved an interesting result on the mini" length feasible paths for a robot of the Hilare type with bounded turning radius. They showed that the optimal length path belonged to a family of paths that consisted of segments of straight lines and arcs of circles. It seems doubtful that such a method could be generalized easily to a car with n trailers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reeds and Shepp</head><p>A paper by Murray and Sastry <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[34]</ref> studied motion planning for nonholonomic systems and focused attention on a specific class of systems in so-called "chained form" This class of systems was inspired by some early work of Brockett [4] on optimal control of "canonical systems." In <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[34]</ref>, sufficient conditions were given for converting systems into chitined form along with an algorithm (using sinusoids at integrally related frequencies) for steering chained-form systems. The theory was used to transform the fiont-wheeldrive car, a car with one trailer, and a hopping robot into chained form, and to find feasible trajectories for these systems using the sinusoidal steering algorithm. The car with two trailers, however, did not fit the sufficient conditions and was left an open problem. Recently Sqjrdalen [39] showed that the system of the car with n trailers could be put into chaipexl form using the coordinates of the nth trailer (rather than ttme of the cab) for parameterizing the configuration space of the system. Necessary and sufficient conditions for converting systems into chained form are given in [31]; there is no general procedure known, however, for finding the coordinate transformation into chained form.</p><p>Femandes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref> used numerical methods for solving constrained optimal control problems associated with nonholonomic motion planning problems, using a perturbation (of the cost functional) to make the singular optimal controI problem regular. In another work [ 131, they also suggested the use of input sinusoids (as basis functions) in a Ritz approximation algorithm for steering nonholonomic systems. Sinusoids were also used in a method proposed by Suss" and Liu [40] (see also [MI). Their method was completely general in that it applied to any controllable nonholonomic system and used asymptotically high frequency, high magnitude sinusoids to achieve convergence. This method was applied to the system of Hilare with two trailers in 1421, but the paths generated were highly oscillatory and impractical, owing to their use of high magnitude and frequency sinusoids.</p><p>Several other methods have been proposed which used piecewise constant inputs [aO], <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[30]</ref>. AU of these worked best in the cases where the control Lie algebra is nilpotat.</p><p>Their extension to systems whose control Lie algebra is not nilpotent is not fully satisfactory, requiring a large number of steps to come close to the goal point. Very recently, it was pointed out that the N-trailer system is diffexentially flat ([14],</p><p>[15]), and thus motion planning can be done using Fdnet series [36], [37].</p><p>Our current paper is somewhat different in style from most of the previous work. Instead of focusing on the directions in which the system is allowed to move, namely the two vector fields which correspond to the two degrees of f r d o m of the system, we have defined the system from the constraints on its velocity. That is, instead of looking at the control system</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">5 = gl(x)Ul -f 92(x)U2</formula><p>and the distribution spanned by the input vector fields A = (91, g2}, we consider the exterior differential system d o gonal to this distribution, namely I = A I = { a1 , ---, a"}. In the context of motion planning, this is a very natural framework since each ai is a one-form defined on the co&amp;guration space and represents the constraint that the wheels on the ith axle must roll without slipping.</p><p>This codistribution I generates a Pfaffian system (of codimension two); such exterior differential systems and their properties were first studied by PfaE in the early 1800's. There and are reviewed in Section 11 of this paper. The normal form for P f a f h systems of codimension two that was proposed by Goursat is in fact the dual of chained canonical form as defined above. The conditions for converting a system into Goursat form are straightforward to check, but the main advantage of using the Goursat form is that there exists an algorithm for findtng the necessary c c " t e transformation. No such general algorithm exists for converting systems to chained form. As in the work of Sgrdalen, the ealculatians for the Goursat normal form for the n-trailer problem are simplified quite considerably by using the coordinates of the last trailer instead of those of the cab to parameterize the configuration space of the multitrailer system. Exterior differential forms to describe linear velocity constraints have been also been used in some of the mechanics literature; see, for example (21, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[45]</ref>,</p><p>and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[47]</ref>.</p><p>After the review of exterior Merentid systems in Section 11, we examine the Pfaffian system associated with a mobile robot towing n traiIers. We show in Section ID that this system can be converted into Goursat nonnal form or equivakntly chained form. Section lV is devoted to presenting methods for steering systems in chained form. Three different methods are presented, using as inputs sinusoids, piecewise constant inputs (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[30]</ref>), and polynomials. Finally, we apply some of these steering methods to the N-trailer example and display the results in Section V. Mathematica code for computing the coordinate transformations and control inputs used in this paper, as well as complete movie animations of some of the trajectories, can be found in E431 or obtained from the first a u k .</p></div>

A RFiyiEw OF EXTERIOR DIFFERENTlAL SYSTEMS</head><p>Here we give a very brief review of the tools available from the study of exterior differential systems and show how to apply these tools to the problem of finding a feedback transformation which converts a system into chained form.

We will make frequent use of the following fact. Just as in the case of polynomials, it is often desirable to speak of a vector of mixed order (or unknown order). Using the wedge product, we can define an algebra over the set of p vectors. Let A = Ao @ 11' @ -. -@An and define multiplication between two elements of A using the wedge product. The wedge product is a bilinear, associative, distributive, skew product which maps A' x As + Ar+* andhence Ax A + A.</p></div>

The System of Roiling Constraints and Its Derived Flag</head><p>Consider a mobile robot such as Hilare' with n trailers attached, as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>. Each trailer is attached to the body in front of it by a rigid bar, and the wheels of each body are constrained to roll without slipping. The trailers are assumed to be identical, but to have possibly different link lengths Li. A set of variables for defining the configuration of the system is the z, y coordinates of a point on each axle, say the midpoint, denoted by (2%) y;), together with the angle of each pair of wheels, which we call 8; and measure with respect to the horizontal.</p><p>The connections between the bodies give rise to the following constraints</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">2; =2;-1 -L i C O S 8; y; =y;-1 -Lisin 8;.

These constraints are holonomic and will reduce the dimension of the configuration space, since the positions (z;, yt) for i 2 1 can be expressed in terms of 2 0 , yo, 80, . . , 8i. By symmetry, (z~, y;) for i &lt; n can also be expressed in terms of $, , y , , B, , ..., Bi. For our purposes it is useful to use as configuration space variables the z, y coordinates of a point on the nth trailer and the n f l hitch angles:</p><p>z , , y , , e, , . . ) 60 because the calculations that follow are vastly simplified?

We have assumed that the bodies are connected between the midpoints of the two sets of rear wheels; it should be noted that if the trailers are hitched behind the rear axle, the equations will not simplify as shown here.</p><p>The wheels of the robot and trailers are constrained to roll without slipping; this implies that the velocity of each body in the direction perpendicular to its wheels must be zero. We model each pair of rear wheels as a single wheel at the midpoint of the axle and state the nonslipping conditions in terms of coordinates, beginning with the nth trailer Equation (11) models the fact that the velocity perpendicular to the wheels is zero.

The direction of motion of the (i + 1)st trailer and consequently the direction of wi+1, if its wheels are rolling without slipping, is along the direction of the hitch joining the (i + 1)st body to the ith body. Since the bodies are linked together by rigid rods, it follows that the projection of w; onto the line of the hitch is equal to q + l .

(The fact that such a transform exists follows fmm our having verified the Goursat congruences for the ai in the previous subsection.) It does need to be checked that the transformation which results from (28) is a valid diffeomorphism. In general, there are many possible transformations into chained form; two are presented here. These two are exactly the same as those discussed in the previous subsection in the context of the Goursat normal form. If the input vector fields for a general system satisfy the sufficient conditions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[34]</ref>, then the techniques given in that paper could be used to find the transformation into chained form. If the system does not satisfy those conditions but satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions of Theorem 9, then a transformation to chained form exists.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Other Trailer Configurations</head><p>Thus far, we have concentrated our attention on the example of the Hilare mobile robot pulling a chain of trailers. In this section we describe how this model is equivalent (under a coordinate transformation and state feedback) not only to the more familiar system of a front-wheel-drive car pulling trailers, but also to the luggage trains commonly found in airports.</p><p>The model of the front-wheel-drive car is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">3</ref>. In comparison with the Hilare model, we have added another axle to the front body of the chain, and a variable 4 representing the angle of the front wheels with respect to the car. The length of the wheelbase of the lead car is defined to be LO.</p><p>The equivalence between the two models is most easily seen by looking at the form constraints. Each constraint corresponds to one axle rolling without slipping. Hilare with n trailers has n+l axles; the car with n trailers has n+2 axles, and its H&amp;an system is therefore equivalent to that of Hilare pulling n+l trailers.</p><p>O f course, the states and inputs that we define for the car system are slightly different. By convention, we define the angle of the front axle relative to the car instead of relative to the coordinate frame. This angle 4 is merely 60 -01 on the Hilare system. The velocity input is the same, assumed to be the linear velocity of the first body (we can define it at either the front or rear axle depending on whether our car is front-wheel-drive or rear-wheel drive), but the rotational input is usually taken as w' = 4, the steering wheel velocity.</p><p>Since in the-Hilare case we can control the velocity of the first body w = Bo, state feedback can be used to reconcile these differences. As mentioned after Proposition 13, there are many choices of vector fields orthogonal to a given H&amp;an system with each choice having a different physical meaning.</p><p>The luggage carts used at most airports are also equivalent to the Hilare model. Each trailer on the luggage cart train has two sets of wheels; the front axle can spin freely about its center but the back axle is constrained to be aligned with the trailer (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref>). Here again we have defined the angles of the front wheels with respect to each trailer, but looking at the form constraints it is easily seen that the cab with n luggage trailers is equivalent to a front-wheel-drive car with 2n one-axle trailers. Again, a coordinate transformation is needed, since in the model of the luggage carts we define the angle of the front wheels of the trailers relative to the trailer instead of relative to the coordinate frame.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. STEERJNG CHAINED FORM SYSTEMS</head><p>Now that we have seen how to transform an N-trailer system into chained form, we examine various methods for steering chained-form systems (27). We assume an m-state system and note that Hilare with n trailers has n+3 states, a car with n trailers has n+4 states, and a car with n luggage trailers has 2n+4 states.</p><p>The problem that we address in this section is: Given a system in chained form with an initial state zo and a goal state zf, find some control inputs ul(t), u2(t) which will steer the system from zo to zf after some time T. The application of these results to the problem of steering the mobile robot with multiple trailers is covered in the next section.</p><p>We present three methods to steer the chained-form system: 1) Sinusoidal inputs.</p><p>2) Piecewise constant inputs.</p><p>3) Polynomial inputs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Sinusoidal Inputs</head><p>The first steering method that we consider uses sinusoidal inputs. Steering chained-form systems with sinusoids was originally proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[34]</ref>. The method that we have developed here is different from the original algorithm in that it steers all the states in one step, instead of one state at a time.</p><p>Given an m-state chained-form system, it is easily seen that the first two states, z1 and 2 2 , can be steered from their initial to their final positions using constant inputs over any time period T. Of course, the states 23, --e , z, will drift as a consequence of this.</p><p>By direct integration, it may be verified that a Combination of out of phase sinusoids applied to the inputs, The states 24,</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">ul(t) = Q</formula><p>, z, will drift in some fashion. Now, consider inputs with u2 having k times the frequency of u1, namely ul(t) = cy sin w t ug(t) = p COS If these inputs are applied over one period T = 27r/w, it may be verified directly by integration that The intuition behind this steering scheme lies in the different levels of Lie brackets. If we consider the input vector fields 91, g2 for the chained-form system, we note that [91, gz] = [0 0 1 0 0IT, precisely in the z3 direction. Motion in this first level Lie bracket is generated by cycling between the two input vector fields in a continuous manner described by the out-of-phase sinusoids. To get motion in the second level Lie bracket, [gl, [gl, 9211 = [0 0 0 1 0 . -. 0IT or equivalently the z4 direction, the input 212 completes two cycles for one cycle on ul. More generally, motion in the ad:lg2 = [0 e . -1 e 0IT or the zk+2 direction is achieved by using k times the frequency of u1 on 212.</p><p>The steering algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[34]</ref> is step by step: It first steers z1, 2 2 to their final positions using constant inputs, disregarding the other states. Then it steers z3 to its desired final position using sinusoids; zl, z2 will return to their final values. Now z4 can be steered, and similarly on down the chain, until all states are at their final positions. This is a simple algorithm that is easy to implement, but can be timeconsuming when there are many states to be steered.</p><p>We propose instead an "all-at-once" sinusoids method, combining all the frequencies on u2 together in one step and maps them to values in the state space (zf , e , z i ) . We d e h e &amp;o(Q, bo, -, bm-2) to be the value of z(T) when the chained-form system <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(27)</ref> is integrated starting at the initial condition zo and applying the inputs (29) over the time period [0, TI.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remark2:</head><p>We have dealt with the overparameterization of the input (m+l parameters: ao, al, bo, ..-, bm-2 and m states) by initially choosing a value for a1 and then solving the m equations for the remaining m input parameters. We note here that by choosing a fixed value for al, we are requiring ul to go through one period. Since u1 roughly corresponds to the driving input in a mobile robot system, paths planned using the sinusoidal method generally have one back-up or speed reversal, corresponding to the zerocrossing of 211. Parallel-parking type maneuvers seem particularly wellsuited to sinusoidal trajectdries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Piecewise Constant Inputs</head><p>The second method we investigate for steering chainedform systems uses piecewise constant inputs. This method was originally proposed by Monaco and Normand-Cyrot <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[30]</ref> and was inspired by multirate digital control. It is most easily understood in the context of nonholonomic motion planning simply as piecewise constant inputs.</p><p>Consider holding the inputs u1 and u2 constant over some small time period [0,8)</p><p>The chained-form state equations can then be integrated, and evaluated at time 8 to yield z l ( q = Zl(0) + u1,18 z2(8) = z2(0) + u 2 , J z2 z3(8) = z3(0) + z2(0)w, 18 + 211,1u2,1 7</p><p>We can now consider another pair of constant inputs on the time interval @, 28)</p><p>Integration of the state equations gives us ~( 2 5 ) as a function of z(a), q 2 , u2,2. Using .(a) from (30), we get an expression for ~( 2 8 ) in terms of z(o), u1,1, UI, 2, u2,1, u2,2. This procedure of piecewise integration and substitution can be repeated as many times as necessary.</p><p>For path planning, we choose to keep u1 at a constant value over the entire trajectory. We therefore iterate <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(30)</ref> m-1 times so as to have exactly m parameters for which to solve: 211, U ~J , -, ~2 , ~-1 .</p><p>The total time needed for steering is 6 = ( m -1)8. Although S can be chosen arbitrarily, a smaller time S will result in larger inputs U to achieve the same path.</p><p>The m equations which result from setting z(0) = zo and z(6) = zf are polynomial (of order m-2) in u1 but are linear in u2,1, . . , u2, m--l. Since u1 is easily determined from the remaining m -1 linear equations can be solved â‚¬or u2 quite easily. This is one of the reasons that we propose keeping u1 constant over the entire trajectory; if u1 varied, we would need to sdve high-order polynomial equations in the ui,k parameters.</p><p>It should be noted that if zf = zy, or the initial and final states agree in the 6rst coordinate, this method as stated so far will fail to yield a solution. From looking at the chainedform equations, it is obvious that if ~1 = 0, only the second state z2 can move; all other states must remain stationary. In practice, this case is dealt with by planning two paths, the first of which takes the initial condition to an intermediate state, the second of which joins the intermediate state with the goal position. The concatenation of these two paths is a valid trajectory between the start and goal. Our algorithm chooses the intermediate point zm halfway between the initial and final points in all coordinates except the first, which we choose to be offset from the starting position by a constant amount</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">~2 = (zf -z,O)/2, k = 2, * * . , m z;" = zy + const.</formula><p>The constant offset can be adjusted to fit the situation.</p><p>The procedure detailed in the previous paragraph is used when a parallel-parking trajectory is desired for the mobile robot with trailers, since the z1 direction in chained form corresponds to "sideways" in the original coordinates. We have found it practical to choose the constant offset at approximately twice the length of the entire robot and trailer system. A smaller offset will result in tighter tums and more lateral motion. If there are obstacles in the field, this constant offset gives a parameter that can be adjusted in an effort to avoid collisions.</p><p>Another reason for choosing u1 to be constant over the entire trajectory is that in the mobile robot and trailer system, this input is roughly equivalent to the driving velocity. Because of the coordinate transformation that maps u1 to the actual velocity VO, the actual velocity of the robot will not be constant, but in most cases it will not cross zero and change sign. This means that the robot will not have to execute backing-up maneuvers to achieve its final goal position.</p><p>The main drawback of the piecewise constant inputs is the discontinuity of u2. The models used in this paper are purely kinematic using as inputs the driving and steering velocities. In a real robot system, the inputs are not velocities but accelerations, or torques. When a path satisfying the velocity constraints is found, the input velocities need to be differentiated to find the corresponding accelerations. Of their very nature, the piecewise constant trajectories are not Merentiable at the switching points.</p></div>

Polynomial Inputs is to use polynomial inputs</head><p>Yet another possibility for steering systems in chained form Tbis approach bas the advantage of a constant input on ul with the iadded advantage of the differentiability of U Z .</p><p>'Fhe time needed to steer the system from zo to zf is determined by the change desired in the first coordinate T = zfzf.</p><p>Once T has been found, the state (27) can be integrated using the initial condition z(0) = zo where the matrix entries Mi, j (T) have the form It may be shown that this matrix is nonsingular for T # 0. athough if zf -&lt; o the solution gives a negative time period, this situation is easily remedied by choosing u1 = -1.</p><p>As in the case of steering with piecewise constant inputs, this method will yield no solution when zfzf = 0. We follow the same procedure outlined in Section IV-B to deal with this case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Other Choices</head><p>Because of the simple form of the chained-form system, many different classes of input functions other than the three described above could be used to steer systems in this form.</p><p>The chief requirement is that there should be at least as many parameters in the input functions as there are states. For rnultitrailer systems, a desirable characteristic of the input functions is that u1 have few or no zero-crossings since these will correspond to fewer backups. In fact, the number of backups needed to complete a maneuver may be taken as a measure of complexity of an input class. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SIMULATIONS AND OBSERVATIONS</head><p>We now have an extensive toolbox from which to choose for steering an N-trailer system. With two different coordinate transformations into chained form and at least three different methods for steering the system once it is in chained form, we can try to pick the best combination of coordinate transformation and input type for each start and goal point. There is as yet no formal way to define when one path is "better" than another, but as we mentioned earlier, we tend to think of desirable paths as those that have few backups and do not stray too far from the vicinity of the start and goal One of the things that must be considered is coordinate singularities. Although we have shown that all three methods proposed here will find a path between any start and goal points in the chained-form coordinates, there is no guarantee that this path, when transformed back into the actual coordinates, will avoid the transformation singularities. This must be checked for each desired path. If a singularity does result, another steering method might yield a valid path, or perhqs an intermediate point will need to be chosen, and the path planned in two or more steps.</p><p>In Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref> and<ref type="figure">6</ref>, we show two different paths for a frontwheel-drive car with two trailers. We have chosen the wheelbase of the car to be L1 = 0.5 units, and each trailer to have a length of LZ = L3 = 2 units. Each path was generated using points. techniques described in this paper: first, transforming the start and goal points into the chained-form coordinates; second, steering the chained-fom system using one of the methods from Section IV; and finally, transforming the trajectory back into the original coordinates.</p><p>The trajectory shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> represents the truck backing into a loading dock. The initial condition is position is (0, O,n/2, 7r/2, 7r/2, 7r/2). Coordinate transformation 2 is used, since the first coordinate transformation is singular at the goal position. In the figure, we have presented the trajectory of the front of the car ($0, yo) instead of the back of the second trailer (23, 9 3 ) to amplify the difference between the two steering methods; the trajectories of the second trailer are virtually identical.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> we again have chosen to present the path taken by the front car; this figure shows a parallel-parking maneuver.</p><p>Here we have used two different coordinate transformations with the same steering method. The trajectories in the chainedform coordinates are identical; however, a difference can be seen in the physical coordinates. Once again, the trajectory traced by the rear of the second trailer is very similar in both cases. Some scenes from a movie animation of this trajectory are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">7</ref>; in the movie we present the coordinates derived from transformation 1.</p><p>With the sinusoidal steering method, there is one parameter that can be adjusted independently of the start and goal positions; this is the magnitude of the sinusoid on the first input, or a1 in the terminology of Section IV-A. In constructing this movie, we examined several different values of al; a larger value of a1 will correspond to the car driving out farther before it starts backing into the space. We were able to choose a value for this parameter so that the car and trailer system did not hit any of the obstacles along its path. Although our planning method does not explicitly take obstacles into account, we wanted to show that the generated paths are "nice" in some sense and may avoid obstacles in many cases. We are hopeful that the techniques described in this paper for constructing feasible paths can be integrated with an obstacle-avoidance package to solve the complete path planning problem.</p><p>(z3, y3, e3, e2, el, eo) = (io, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0) and the final </p></div>

We showed that the multitdler system could be put into Gwrsat normal form, and that this is the dual to chained form. We solved the motion planning problem for the mobile robot pulling n trailers by converting the kinematic constraints into Goursat form, using this to convert the kinematic equations into chained-form, steering the chained-form system from an initial to a final position, then converting the trajectory back into the original coordinates. Three different methods for steering chained-form systems were proposed.</p><p>The work done in this paper has several natural avenues of continuation:</p><p>1) The generation of trajectories for the N-trailer system in an environment cluttered with obstacles. This line of work has been started in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[29]</ref> where the authors considered the motion of a single Hilare-like robot in a cluttered environment. Another approach for a Hilare-like robot was defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[26]</ref>. Other methods for obstacle avoidance which use optimization-based approaches may be found in [ 1 11 and [ 121.</p><p>2) The stabilization of open-loop trajectories. The trajectories generated by our method need to be stabilized, perhaps using a technique such as that outlined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[46]</ref>. There has also been considerable interest in stabilizing nonholonomic systems not to trajectories but to points. Although from Brockett's necessary condition [5], it follows that such stabilizing control laws cannot be both CO and time-invariant, methods using either discontinuous or time-varying feedback have been suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[28]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[41]</ref>.</p></div>
