<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Brand-related user posts on social networks are growing at a staggering rate, where users express their opinions about brands by sharing multimodal posts. However, while some posts become popular, others are ignored. In this paper, we present an approach for identifying what aspects of posts determine their popularity. We hypothesize that brandrelated posts may be popular due to several cues related to factual information, sentiment, vividness and entertainment parameters about the brand. We call the ensemble of cues engagement parameters. In our approach, we propose to use these parameters for predicting brand-related user post popularity. Experiments on a collection of fast food brand-related user posts crawled from Instagram show that: visual and textual features are complementary in predicting the popularity of a post; predicting popularity using our proposed engagement parameters is more accurate than predicting popularity directly from visual and textual features; and our proposed approach makes it possible to understand what drives post popularity in general as well as isolate the brand specific drivers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>More than ever social media, where people are expressing their opinions through posts, is reshaping the business and marketing landscape. It has become an invaluable source for companies to understand the engagement of people with their brand or product. Instagram in particular, with its focus on self-expression and engagement, might provide an answer to the question of which aspects make some posts about brands more popular than other. Some of the information to answer this question is explicitly captured in parameters such as the number of likes. The bulk of information, however, is hidden in the text and visual content of the post. To benefit from the abundance of data in posts for understanding brand-related user post popularity, we need to be able to leverage both the explicit information in a post as well as the visual and textual content.</p><p>Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

To copy otherwise, or republish, to post on servers or to redistribute to lists, requires prior specific permission and/or a fee. Request permissions from permissions@acm.org.  Explicit parameters and textual content have been studied extensively to understand popularity of tweets on Twitter <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8]</ref> and videos on YouTube <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>, Hong et al.</p><p>show the importance of retweets for the prediction of message popularity on Twitter. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> found a relation between the sentiment and popularity of tweets. Szabo et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> study the popularity of YouTube videos by analyzing the social cues, comments, and associated tags. All of these works successfully predict popularity using textual data. Visual content, which also holds a lot of information, is not addressed in these methods.</p><p>In recent years, various aspects of predicting the popularity of images have been studied by analyzing data from the photo-sharing site Flickr <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>, Cappallo et al. approach popularity prediction as a retrieval problem and learn a ranker that takes into account the distinctive visual cues in popular and unpopular images. Kholsa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> and McParalane et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, model image popularity by learning regressors on both visual and textual context. Gelli et al. in <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> study the effect of visual sentiment features as well as contextual features. These methods demonstrate the potential of predicting the popularity for image content. Yet, in case of images from a photo-sharing site, the objective information as well as aesthetic quality are likely the determining factors for popularity. For Instagram, with its high portion of selfies and other forms of self-expression, different factors may determine the popularity and hence other or additional algorithms may be more appropriate.</p><p>We hypothesize that brand-related user posts may be popular due to several visual and textual cues such as the presence of the logo, products, faces, specific objective content descriptors, and sentiment evoked in the user posts. Therefore, we propose a new brand post popularity detection method by estimating the factual information, sentiment, vividness and entertainment parameters of the brand-related post. These aspects are based on frameworks from the context specific field, i.e. Marketing. The correlation between each of these parameters and the number of likes of each post (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) provides a measure of predictive quality. By making the parameters contributing to brand post popularity explicit contributes to understanding the drivers of post popularity as well as increasing the prediction accuracy.</p><p>We make the following contributions in this paper:</p><p>• We are the first to study automatic multimodal brand popularity prediction on Instagram.</p><p>• We introduce a new layer of engagement parameters inspired by marketing research.</p><p>• We reveal which engagement parameters are most influential in making a brand-related user posts popular and how this varies between brands.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">THE PROPOSED METHOD</head><p>In this section we describe our approach to popularity prediction by engagement parameters. We first define the parameters which play an important role in marketing. Then, we show how to extract and use them for predicting the popularity of brand-related posts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Defining Engagement Parameters</head><p>We aim at developing an effective predictive model of post popularity in social media. We hypothesize that brandrelated posts may be popular due to several reasons. For example, a marketeer analyzing the popularity of McDonald's posts in social media may wonder whether a post is popular because it comes from a famous person, the logo is visible, some brand specific products are present, or that it evokes a certain sentiment. We conjecture that the information needed to answer such questions may be implicitly or explicitly captured in the visual and textual channel of user posts. To study popularity, we first need to identify parameters that are context-specific to Marketing and are known from that field to influence popularity.</p><p>We are inspired by recent research in the marketing community for predicting the popularity of a post <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>, De Vries et al. consider information, entertainment and vividness as important sources for predicting brand post popularity. Smith et al. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> investigate the popularity by identifying four parameters in each post: promotional selfpresentation, brand centrality, factually informative of the brand, and brand sentiment. We adapt and combine these parameters to define nine parameters, engagement parameters, which potentially impact the popularity of user generated brand related posts. Our engagement parameters are the following: Brand (brand centrality), Product (factual information about the brand), Sentiment (brand sentiment), Image aesthetics (vividness), Concepts (information and entertainment), Face (promotional self-presentation). We also combine Product and Face to produce Person-Product and People-Product which might reveal whether a brand may be perceived as more individual or social. At the end we consider number of Followers as a parameter which has direct effect on popularity. Different from <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref>, which rely on manual classification for extracting drivers of image popularity, we propose to automatically detect the parameters that drive post popularity and effectively incorporating them into a model for popularity prediction of brand-related posts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Extracting Engagement Parameters</head><p>To detect the existence of engagement parameters in user posts, we analyse their visual and text content. For detecting the presence of a Brand, Face(s), and Product(s) in the image of each post, we use the Google Vision API.</p><p>Brand: Binary indication of the Brand logo presence.</p><p>Face(s): The number of detected faces. Product: In order to assess whether a Product is present in an image, we use the following procedure. We select the top 10 labels extracted by Google Vision API based on their confidence score. Each of the labels corresponds to an entry in Freebase. A label is considered to be a Product of the fast food restaurant if an entry was found in the food or dish category of Freebase. We consider a Product to be present in the image if at least one match was found.</p><p>Person-Product: Binary indication of the coincidence of exactly one Face and Product.</p><p>People-Product: The value of this parameter is 1 if there are 2 or more Faces and Product in image.</p><p>Sentiment: To detect the sentiment in user posts, we perform late fusion of Visual-Sentiment and Textual-Sentiment. We determine the Visual-Sentiment, similar to <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>, using Sentibank detectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>. The ontology consists of a collection of 1,200 Adjective-Noun-Pairs (ANP). So we represent each image with a 1,200-dimensional vector in which each dimension shows the probability of the ANP being present in the image. Textual-Sentiment is determined by analyzing the text from hashtags, captions, and the comments associated with the images. Due to its effectiveness in extracting sentiment from short informal texts and for consistency with <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>, we then deploy SentiStrength <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> to generate the positive (ranging from 1 to 5) and negative (ranging from -1 to -5) sentiment scores.</p><p>Image aesthetics: There are in total 42 filters in Instagram which the users can apply before sharing their images. We extract the information about the filters applied to the image from the contextual metadata of the post in to a 42dimensional binary vector.</p><p>Concepts: we extract the convolutional neural network features, initially proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> and trained to identify those 15,293 ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> concept categories, for which at least 200 positive examples are available. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11]</ref>, we represent the image of each post by the 15,293dimensional output of the softmax layer of the network.</p><p>Followers: The number of contacts of the given user.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Post Popularity Measurement</head><p>Similar to <ref type="bibr">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9]</ref>, we treat the post popularity prediction as a ranking problem. As the measure of post popularity we use the number of likes it received. We find that the number of likes follows a power law distribution, where the majority of posts receive little or no likes and the minority of them receive a high number of likes. To deal with the large variation in the number of likes, we apply the log function to make it resemble a Gaussian distribution. In order to predict post popularity, we use L2 regularized L2 loss Support Vector Regression (SVR) from the LIBLIN-EAR package. We train a popularity model on the training set and use it for predicting the popularity of a post at test time (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). To find the optimal value of the regularization parameter C of SVM, we perform 5-fold cross-validation for C ∈ {0.001, 0.1, 1, 10, 100}.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">EXPERIMENTAL SETUP</head><p>Dataset: We investigate the effectiveness of our proposed approach for post popularity prediction on an Instagram dataset. As mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref> the fast food category is one of the most popular categories on Instagram. As we are interested in analyzing brands, we select the six most popular fast food brands based on the annual revenue from 2014, namely: McDonald's, Burger King, Culver's, Wendy's, Sonic Drive In, and Jack In The Box. We created a dataset by crawling 75,000 user-posts related to these six categories.</p><p>In order to explore the effect of the engagement parameters on all user posts or in a specific brand category, we define two different settings:</p><p>Category-mix: In this setting the whole dataset is used to build a general model for popularity prediction.</p><p>Category-specific: For this setting, we perform the training and evaluation independently for each brand category.</p><p>In both settings we split the data randomly into two halves, one for training and the other for testing. We average the performance over 10 random splits to ensure consistency of the results.</p><p>Baseline features: Visual features, As low-level visual features we used the CNN-Pool5, the 1024-dimensional features from pooling the last fully connected layer of the Deep Net in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. We use also Concepts, and Visual-Sentiment explained in section 2.2 as high level features. We use three different representations based on the tags added to the posts as Textual features: Term-based, a sparse binary representation with a length of 22,110, where the length of the vector equals the number of unique tags in the dataset. Only the values of those elements corresponding to the tags of the post are set to one. The W2V, a state-of-the-art word embedding method which is a deep neural network trained on over a billion Google news documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. Using this net, we compute a 300-dimensional vector by mapping each tag of a post to its word2vec representation. From there, average pooling is used to obtain the final 300-dimension representation of the post. At the end we use the Textual-Sentiment as explained in Section 2.2.</p><p>Evaluation metric: After predicting the popularity of each post at test time, we compute the Spearman's rank correlation between the prediction and ground truth which returns a value between [-1, 1]. A value close to 1 corresponds to perfect correlation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Experiments</head><p>Experiment 1: Effect of multimodal features on post popularity In this experiment we evaluate the effect of different baseline features on predicting the popularity of a post in Category-mix and Category-specific datasets. In the Category-specific setting we report the average rank correlation score of all six brand categories. We also report the effect of combining Visual features, Visual-Combi, and Textual features, Textual-Combi, by average pooling in a late fusion scenario. We also report the result of combining Visualcombi and Textual-combi, denoted by Visual-Textual-combi.</p><p>Experiment 2: Effect of the engagement parameters on post popularity In this experiment we evaluate the post popularity prediction accuracy of our proposed engagement parameters on both settings of the dataset. Here, we attempt to quantify the extent to which the individual engagement parameters impact the popularity of a post. Finally by average pooling the rank of each post at test time we produce the Late-fusion results. To have a fair comparison with baseline features, we do not consider the follower parameter in the rank aggregation.</p><p>Experiment 3: Analysis of the engagement parameters on the popularity of each category In this experiment we analyze the effect of each engagement parameter on the popularity of brand-related posts in the Categoryspecific setting. We aim to understand which parameters make a brand become more popular. In particular, we try to understand the difference between the popularity of different brand categories. By analyzing the engagement parameters on brand-related posts we divide the brands into four categories: Brand-based, Product-based, Social-based, and Individual-based. The categorization is based on the parameter having the highest influence on the brand popularity, namely the presence of Brand identity (e.g., a logo), Product (e.g., fries or burger), People, and Person.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">RESULTS</head><p>Experiment 1: Effect of multimodal features on post popularity We show the results of experiment 1 in Table 1. As we can see, the rank correlation performance using Visual-Combi reaches 0.233 and 0.270 in Category-mix and Category-specific respectively. In both settings, we find that the best visual feature is Visual-Sentiment which demonstrates the sentiment captured in the visual content of an image has a high impact on post popularity. We also observe that using Textual-Combi the results reach 0.231 and 0.250 on Category-mix and Category-specific respectively. To investigate whether the visual and textual features are The results of experiment 1, in general, confirm the importance of using both visual and textual features for predicting the popularity of a post in social media.</p><p>Experiment 2: Effect of the engagement parameters on post popularity We show the results of using different engagement parameters on the Category-mix and Categoryspecific in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach has a positive effect on predicting popularity of posts where using the existence of a Brand results in 0.322 and 0.361 rank correlation accuracy on both Category-mix and Category-specific respectively. We also observe that by considering only the existence of a Face results in 0.321 and 0.375 in both settings. The results of post popularity prediction by Person-Product and People-Product in both settings show the effectiveness of these variables as compared to considering Face and Product separately. We observe that the fast food brand-related posts showing one person or people with products are more attractive and will likely get a higher number of likes. By fusing the rank correlation scores of our engagement parameters on each post by the average operator, the result reaches 0.441 and 0.462 popularity detection accuracy in Category-mix and Category-specific settings.</p><p>The results show a significant improvement in post popularity prediction against the baseline features. The results improve by a factor of two, 0.441 versus 0.252 on Categorymix and 0.462 versus 0.290 on Category-specific. Here we compare our proposal with Visual-Textual-combi which as shown in experiment 1 is the best performing baseline. It shows that for predicting the popularity of brand-related posts considering visual and textual features alone is not sufficient. The results confirm that post popularity prediction accuracy profits from using engagement parameters, which incorporate the correlation of different parameters with the popularity of posts.</p><p>Experiment 3: Analysis of the engagement parameters on the popularity of each category We plot the result of experiment 3 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. The rank correlation of late fusion over all engagement parameters reaches to 0.520, 0.450, 0.424, 0.451, 0.421, and 0.511 for brand categories Burger King, Culver's, Jack In The Box, Sonic Drive In, Wendy's, and McDonald's respectively. By focusing on the correlation of the Brand parameter with the popularity of each category we find that for McDonald's and Burger King, the existence of the logo of the brand in user posts is more important in comparison with the other brands. This suggests that these two categories are more Brand-based in comparison with Culver's and Jack In The Box which are Product-based. We also observe that the existence of Face in all brand categories has a high impact on post popularity. It has a particularly high impact when combined with the Product parameter. The correlation score between the People-Product parameter and the popularity of Burger King, Culver's, Jack In The Box, Wendy's, and McDon- The results show that our approach is able to differentiate between the popularity of brands by analyzing the effect of engagement parameters on brand related user posts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper we study the drivers behind popularity of brand-related social media posts. Different from existing work, which simply models the popularity of a post directly from the visual and text features, in our approach we extract a set of parameters which are known to influence post popularity based on research frameworks in the filed of Marketing and directly embed them into the post popularity prediction model. Our proposed engagement parameters capture a number of factors of critical importance for studying the popularity of multimodal posts in a marketing setting. We evaluate the performance of our proposal by conducting a set of experiments on a collection of brand-related Instagram posts. The results of our experiments show that popularity prediction using the engagement parameters outperforms direct modelling of popularity using visual and text features only by up to a factor of two. Our engagement parameters, such as the existence of brand logo, sentiment and image aesthetics, all play important role in predicting post popularity. Moreover, the results show that utilizing the user engagement parameters gives us the ability not only to better predict the popularity of a post, but also to highlight the properties specific of each brand category.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>MM ' 16 ,</head><label>16</label><figDesc>October 15-19, 2016, Amsterdam, Netherlands c 2016 ACM.
