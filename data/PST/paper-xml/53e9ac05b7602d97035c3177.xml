<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Since the heart of the work in companies is done in groups, many people are designing a variety of new technologies to support it. The new technologies range from group decision rooms to asynchronous conferencing systems that help participants coordinate work across time and space. In our research, we are concentrating on the kind of group work that happens in small groups, such as project teams or task forces. We are looking for ways to support the "meeting" part of this work with various kinds of tecimology, initially for those meetings that take place faceto-face.</p><p>Our research strategy began by understanding group work in the field <ref type="bibr">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr">15]</ref> where we noted important baseline features of group work and gathered ideas about how various kinds of technology can help. We have now moved to the laboratory to study specific phenomena, such as how technologies change the flow of activities in meetings or affect the quaIity of the work. From these laboratory Permkw.iOn to COPY wlthwt fee all Orpart Ofthis mawml is granted p,ovided that the copies are not made or distributed for direct commercial advantage, the ACM copyright notice and the title of the publication and its date appear, and notice IS given that copying IS by permwsvcm of the Associamm for Computmg Machinery.</p><p>To copy otherwise, or to republish, requires a fee andlor specfific p.xnwssm". @ 1992 ACM 0-89791.543-7/92/0010/0091 ...$l .50 studies, we will move back to the field, assessing the use of these new technologies in the full organizational context. This strategy has the benefit that we are informed by actual practice and can eventually test ideas in the field, but also puts the burden onus to construct laboratory situations that mirror the field in important ways, This paper reports a laboratory study that fits into this overall research strategy.</p><p>Others have looked at various kinds of technology to support groups in face-to-face meetings, finding mixed results <ref type="bibr">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr">10]</ref>. One of the reasons the results are mixed is the difficulty of running a large number of intact groups.</p><p>Most studies involve only a smatl number of such groups, and some resort to artificial groups whose members are new to each other. One goal of our research is to invest the time to run enough groups so that reliable effects can be determined above the noise of inherent between-group variation.</p><p>A second difficulty in comparing results from these studies is that they differ widely in both the tasks presented to the group and the kind of technology offered to them. For example, the groups in many studies are led by a facilitator who structures the discussion into phases of brainstorming, commenting, and voting, with various electronic support tools for each phase <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">12]</ref>. Other studies use technology that is more free form <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref> where the group organizes their activities on their own, using the tools whenever they seem appropriate.</p><p>There is no general answer to whether technology helps or hinders these groups. It depends on the tasks the groups are engaged in, and it depends on what the technology does [17],</p><p>This paper reports how one kind of technology, a group editor, changes the face-to-face work of small groups of people working in the laboratory on a design task. We examined the meetings of 38 existing groups of people using either conventional meeting tools or a new group editor that allows all participants to see and edit the same document at the same time. We use a detailed analysis of their moment-by-moment talking and typing to study the process of group work, Since they are doing a standard CSCW 92 Proceedings November 1992 task, we can measure the quality of the outcome of their work, and through questionnaires can measure their satisfaction with their work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects</head><p>The subjects were 38 existing groups of three professionals. Most of the groups consisted of three MBAs1 each enrolled in the Michigan Business School, with a few consisting of one MBA and two of that person's work cohorts. In all groups, the members had worked together before in class or work projects and all knew at least one Macintosh application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Setting</head><p>The group members were seated in a meeting room called the Collaboration Technology Suite (CTS) <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> in which workstation units make up a conference table, with the monitors recessed in the table top so as not to interfere with normal eye contact, One wall of the room has two large panels of whiteboard, which all groups were allowed to use. In practice, all but two unsupported groups used it for collecting their ideas, typically in lists; only one supported group used it, for a quick drawing of the proposed layout. All the sessions were video-taped.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task</head><p>We chose to study the task of group design, that of early requirements definition, because it is both important and interesting. The early stages of design are probably the most important in the development of useful, usable, maintainable software [1, 3] And, the early stage of design is interesting because it is a classic example of an illstructured problem <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>,</p><p>In terms of <ref type="bibr">McGrath's [8]</ref> task taxonomy, this activity is a blend of Planning, Creativity, Decision-Making and Cognitive Conflict. Our observations of design in the field show a seemingly erratic sequence of these subtasks, with associations, implications and evaluations taking the group from one topic to the next and back. But by categorizing details of the activity in the episodes into core design activities and coordination activities, we found interesting, systematic patterns of behavior <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. In particular, groups engaged in periods of design activity, punctuated by coordination episodes. The behavior within each kind of activity showed strong regularities, and there was little intermixing. Once designing, the group designed; when they needed coordination, they did that for a time, and then jumped back into the regular design pattern.</p><p>In this study, all groups were instructed to draft the initial requirements definition for an Automatic Post Office (APO), a collection of postal services offered through a stand-alone device similar to an ATM for which a prototype lNinety percent of the MBAs at Michigan have significant work experience before coming back to school. These are professionals with practical group experience.</p><p>could be built by their fictitious company of 30 people in a year. They were instructed to determine the core services they would offer, some of the required equipment, the rough cost/benefit analysis, and a list of things they would like to investigate before the next time they would (hypothetically) meet. They were given 1-1/2 hours to complete the assignment, producing meeting notes that could be read by a (fictitious) additional group member who could not attend that day's meeting.</p><p>Technology Support</p><p>The technology used here was one we designed and built called "ShrEdit," which stands for Shared Editor [9] Its features were motivated from an analysis of the ways in which groups work in the field with conventional tools <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. This analysis suggested that a number of observed difficulties would be alleviated by having a shared, editable display of their current work object. Since the design task is a small-group, free flowing task, we did not embed any particular design methodology or require a facilitator. ShrEdit is a simple text editor which allows all participants to view and change the same simple text dccument, with all participants being able to type simultaneously within one character position of each other. Although the individuals' views of the document are normally independent (each can scroll to a different part of the document or arrange the windows on the screen in a unique way), the views can also be locked together if the discussion calls for it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The subjects came to the CTS for a single three-hour period, broken into two 1-1/2 hour portions with a 15 minute break in between. In the first half, the subjects filled out background questionnaires and permission forms, and solved two small problems. These tasks served both to allow the subjects to warm up to the task situation and, for those in the supported condition, to learn the software and adjust to the software's capability for simultaneous editing.</p><p>Those taught the technology were instructed in a 20 minute period before the two small problems, The instructions demons~ated the system's capabilities and how to control them, but did not prescribe how to use these features to support work. Those in the control condition were encouraged to use paper and pencil or whiteboard as is natural for their group. Following a 15 minute break, the groups did the APO task in a single 1-1/2 hour sitting. All groups filled out the questionnaire on satisfaction after the session. The unsupported groups were taught the software and given a 10 minute group task after the questionnaire.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design</head><p>Groups were recruited en masse through various MBA classes, and encouraged to sign up at convenient times, either morning, afternoon, or evening sessions for three hours. The groups were assigned to conditions at random as they came in with the proviso that at the end of each week the conditions were balanced for time of day.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Our goal wastoassess three things: thequality of the product, the participants' satisfaction with the process, and the process of design and coordination.</p><p>Outcome. We assessed how the technology affected the outcomes of the meetings, the quality of the design as reflected in the final document of each group. In order to allow fair comparisons, the unsupported groups' written outputs were typed in the same style as the supported groups' output.</p><p>We developed a quality measure after extensive discussion with both designers and researchers of design. Three major aspects of the groups' output were scored: how completely the output covered all the aspects of the assigned task, the easeof understanding of the ideas reported in the document, and the judged quality of the post office design, including the feasibility of producing a prototype of the suggested post office within the stated time and manpower constraints, the coherence of the ideas, and the judged success of the ideas if marketed. Each aspect was then detailed further and a rating form constructed.</p><p>Six researchers then coded the output from the same six meetings. The average pairwise correlation between raters was .85. Since this was well above acceptable range for reliability of measures, one researcher then coded the quality of the remaining 32 meetings' outputs using the same instrument.</p><p>Out of a possible score of 80 points, the quality of the meetings ranged from 29-78.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Satisfaction.</head><p>To assess satisfaction, we constructed a post-session questionnaire that asked the participants to a) rate their satisfaction with the process that they used (adapted from <ref type="bibr">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>) as well as with the design result [6], b) assess the evenness of the participants' contributions</p><p>[6] and c) identify a leader if one emerged.</p><p>Process. The transcripts of the meetings were coded for what kinds of activity were taking place at each moment, using the categories devised and tested in our study of field design meetings <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref> The measures on various key aspects of activity related to design itself, with origins in the Design Rationale literature <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>. We also cataloged the time it took the group to organize themselves (an activity we call "meeting management"), to clarify their ideas, talk through difficulties with the technology, or engage in side digressions. The division of activity into task and process management was inspired by work in the literature <ref type="bibr">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr">22]</ref>,</p><p>Several new categories were required to account for the work associated with producing the output times when they would plan the organization and wording or dictate the words, called Plan and Write. In the supported groups, we required yet another two categories: times when they were confused about something having to do with the technology, and other comments about the placing of their work into the windows on the screen. We called these Technology Confusion and Technology Management, respectively.</p><p>Inter-rater reliability of the core 22 categories were measured in two ways. A strict measure shows the correspondence of categorization, second by second; our inter-rater reliability is .68%, with a Cohen's K = .64. If we look at the summary measures used, the correlation between the two raters' summary statistics on time in category is .97.</p><p>We also analyzed the groups for the breadth and depth of their discussions. To do this, we coded the transcripts not only for the type of activity, but noted which particular topic they were discussing at each moment. That is, we constructed a Design Rationale diagram, which connects the topic, the alternative solutions to the question posed, and the evaluative comments raised both for and against each proposed solution, independent of when each event occurred, or how many times the same alternative was mentioned. The notation is similar to that developed by researchers who advocate the use of a notation scheme to capture the aspects of design while it is happening. We use it instead to code the development of natural design activity. An example of part of a connected issue, alternative set, and associated critenal comments are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>The results are organized by the major classes of measures as described above: outcome, satisfaction, and process. But first, since this laboratory work was motivated by work in the field and we wish to generalize back to the field, we examine the correspondence between the measures of process in the field and that found in our unsupported laboratory condition. The laboratory situation we chose was intended to be similar to early requirements tasks we examined in the field <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. It differed from the field in that the participants met only once, were not concerned with their performance for career advancement, and did not have to spend the company's money to make the post office they designed. However, the task did require an examination of features to offer the user, how the device could work, and assessment of feasibility in terms of resources and benefit to the client.</p><p>To assessthe correspondence, we compared the behavior of our groups in the unsupported laboratory condition with that of the field groups on two key measures: the amount of time they spent doing various aspects of design versus managing their group process, and the breadth and depth of their discussions.</p><p>In general we found that the time spent in the laboratory task matched that in the field, with a few explainable exceptions.</p><p>There was virtually no time spent doing project management in the lab, since the groups met only once, and they spent less time in clarifying the ideas in the lab study, presumably because the participants were solving a problem for which they have nearly equal expertise. And, since the lab groups were required to write up a document, they spent a significant portion of their time doing this, about 12%.</p><p>The correlation between the lab and field groups for 22 base categories of activity is 0.62, using figures that exclude laboratory groups' writing time; with "project management" and all "clarification:' time removed, the correlation rises to ,69. They explored the issues more broadly in the laboratory, with 7 alternatives raised per issue in the lab and only 2.5 in the field. Since the nature of the task in the lab had people generate lists of features, benefits, and costs, it is reasonable that they would consider more such ideas. They raised about the same number of issues per hour in the two situations, and made similar kind of evaluative arguments. We are thus satisfied that the problem solving aspects of these two tasks are roughly comparable, and whatever we find in the lab in terms of effects of technology on group process has a chance of relating back to the field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome differences</head><p>Two key measures of the output of the session are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>: the quality, as described above, and the length of the document. The average judged quality of the groups supported by ShrEdit was significantly higher than that for conventional groups (t(36) = 2.32, p&lt;.03). Interestingly, the distribution of unsupported groups was far wider than the supported groups (F(18,18) = 2.86, p&lt;.05), Something about the technology not only added to the average quality, but significantly raised the tail of the distribution. On average, the groups using ShrEdit produced final documents that were twice as long (r(36)=2.78, pe.01). For the people with ShrEdit, the text explanation of their ideas was either in sentence form or more fully fleshed out, whereas the output from unsupported meetings consisted mainly of bullet lists. Overall, however, there was no correlation between length of document and quality (r (37)= .29, p &gt; .05), nor within each of the conditions (unsupported r (18)= .12, p &gt;.05, supported r(18) = .27, p &gt; .05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Satisfaction</head><p>Analysis of the questionnaires on satisfaction revealed very few differences between the two groups. In general, both groups were satisfied with the process they used in generating, discussing and deciding on their design, and they liked their final post office design. However, the unsupported groups were marginally more satisfied with the discussion quality (t(36) = 2.74, p &lt; .01) and they rated the problem solving process to be more even and fair (t(36) = 2.24, p &lt; 0.03). However, both kinds of groups rated their groups equally when indicating whether one individual influenced the outcome more than others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Process differences</head><p>What is it that produced the quality differences? We now look at how the groups spent their time, how they moved among activities in the course of design, and the breadth and depth of their discussions.</p><p>One way in which these groups differed was the amount of time spent on each of the subactivities. We coded the transcripts of the spoken parts of the meetings, noting the kinds of activities they engaged in, and then summarized how much total time was spent in each activity as well as the flow between activities. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows a view of the flow of activities, the unsupported groups on the left, the supported ones on the right.</p><p>Comparable pictures of the times and transitions for field design groups can be found in <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>, Each category of activity is represented by a circle, the area of which represents the total time the group spent in that activity, aggregated over the whole meeting. White portions of the circle represent the direct introduction of the idea the black wedges represent the time spent clarifying that topic. The arrows denote the transitions between them, the width of which reflects the likelihood of going from one category to the next.2 Most categories of activity are very similar across the supported and unsupported groups. Of interest, about the same amount of time ( <ref type="formula">490</ref>) is spent in managing the flow of meetings in both conditions, and they plan the writing for about the same amount of time (11% and 9% for supported and unsupported, respectively).</p><p>The ShrEdit groups spend 7% of their time asking each other questions about the technology because they are unsure or confused.</p><p>Groups in these two conditions, however, differ in several striking ways. There is a clear tradeoff between the amount of time spent in discussing the design itself (the alternatives and their evaluative criteria) and the amount of 2T0 make this diagram less "busy, " we include here only those transitions that occurred 1% of time or more.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The timing at time dictating and writing.3 People supported with ShrEdit spent less time than the unsupported groups in direct discussion of issues, alternatives, and criteria (34% vs 5370 for supported vs unsupported, respectively, t(36) = 5,33, p&lt;.001). They spent much more time writing down their design (at least the amount that occurs during pauses) than the unsupported groups did (28% vs 13%, t(36)=4 .09 p&lt;.ool), Of note here is the activity in and out of pause, which occurred four times as many times in the supported groups compared to unsupported. In the supported groups, the writing of the ideas (which occurs primarily in the pauses) is much more interspersed than in the unsupported groups, and the average time spent writing is shorter for the supported groups (5 sec. per episode on average vs 10 sec for supported vs unsupported). In unsupported meetings the discussion of alternatives occurs with some note-taking on the board while they talk and then write their final reports.</p><p>We next coded the content of the discussion using Design Rationale notation, described earlier. Using this kind of analysis, we can compare these unsupported and supported groups for how many issues were raised, how many alternative solutions were raised for each issue, and how extensive the discussion was to evaluate each alternative raised.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Id flow of activities in each cate~ory</head><p>3There was more writing than indicated here. This is the writing that is done when no one is speaking, or when someone is dictating word for word. It does not include time when someone wrote while other talking was going on. This is particularly important in interpreting the category "Digression, "" which often occurred between two people while a third wrote, in both conditions.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows the distrm~u~n of issues, alternatives, and criteria raised, Some striking differences appear. The unsupported groups covered more issues, and raised more alternatives than the supported groups did (1(18)=3. 11, p&lt;.004; t(18) =2.24, p&gt;.03).</p><p>Looking more closely, however, it turns out that the oups covered an equivalent P proportion of the core topics but the unsupported groups raised and discussed twice as many ancilla~issues (8 vs. 4; r(36)=3.08, pc.005), each with on average 3 alternatives and only one evaluative statement. So, some of the extra time these unsupported groups spent on design is on less central topics. Also, the unsupported groups spent on average signifkantly more time per unique alternative than the supported groups (6.6 sec vs 8,3 see, r(36)=2.39, p&lt;.02), Observation shows that rather than this time being spent in explaining or elaborating the idea, it is spent merely repeating the ideas at various delays. Taken together, it appears that although the supported groups are spending more time "on design," they are not necessarily designing more.</p><p>4Core topics were the ten that the problem statementprompted them to tatk about. Ancillary ones were topics the group brought up that were beyond the core ten.</p><p>There is one more difference that the technology affords.</p><p>We compared the ideas (issues/alternatives/criteria) that were spoken some time during the meeting with those that appeared in the final document.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows the comparisons between what appears in the final document and what is spoken for the groups in the two conditions, and the number of ideas that appear in the documents that were never spoken, called "extra." Two things are of interest here. First, many more ideas are spoken than appear in the final document. Some, of course, are ideas that are discussed and rejected, Most groups generate harebrained ideas (e.g., teleconferencing facility in an ATM-like post office station) as well as reasonable ones that they decide to eliminate ( e.g., an address/zip code data base that serves marketing needs as well).</p><p>But some are merely forgotten. Both kinds of groups captured about the same proportion of the alternatives raised (30% and 27% for supported and unsupported), and almost none of the criteria (2.6% and 1.7% respectivley).</p><p>But also of interest is the number of "extra" ideas written in both conditions. There are some ideas that appear on the final document that were never discussed, Both groups add these extra ideas. It appears that the one who "holds the pen" has some license. In the supported groups, however, all hold the pen, and all can see the extra items if they choose. Except for one unsupported group who passed the paper version of their output around to the other group members for checking, none of the unsupported groups' members saw the final output except its author, So it appears from the analysis that there are differences in the way the groups approach the problem. The unsupported groups discuss more alternatives and evaluate them more, then write them down en masse at the end. The supported groups capture their ideas in the final document as they go (they have five times as many writing episodes, each half the length of those from the unsupported groups), Both groups add to the final document items that were never talked about, but in supported groups there is a chance that the other group members will read them and object if they disagree.</p><p>What correlates with quality?</p><p>Since all groups in this study were solving the same problem, we had a chance not only to look at the aggregate differences between the two support conditions and quality, but also to look within conditions for relationships among our process measures and quality. We examined whether quality was related to the time spent on writing, on raising alternatives, or on evaluating with various criteria, as well the number of issues and alternatives raised, and the number of criteria generated.</p><p>For supported groups non e of the variables were significantly correlated with quality, likely because the variance among the quality scores was relatively small (from 49 to 78 on an 80 point scale, with a large number clustered very near the mean of 65). For the unsupported groups, which had a wider variance, an interesting pattern emerged, fitting with the major pattern of differences between groups. Interestingly, the less time spent on design (issues, alternatives, criteria and their clarifications), the higher the quality; the more time on writing (which includes "pauses" and "digressions" which cover occasions when one person is writing and the others are having a side conversation) the higher the quality (r( 18)=.44, pc.06 for design; r(18)=.58, p&lt;.01 for writing). Unsupported groups were better when they spent less time per alternative (r(18)=.43, p&lt;.07). Quality was better also when there were~ewer issues covered, and when core issues had more alternatives explored (r(18)=.58, x.02).</p><p>The Use of ShrEdit How much of the time is the technology being used? Do people ever type simultaneously? What do they do when typing simultaneously? Note that in teaching the groups ShrEdit we introduced them to the features, but we did not tell them how to use them to support various aspects of the meeting's work.</p><p>To answer these questions, we cataloged the timing of the keystrokes for each person individually and noted overlap. Since a keystroke is an instantaneous event, we assumed that a person's attention was paid to typing both a second before each keystroke and a second after. Using this technique, we found that, on average, simultaneous typing occurred 10% of the time. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the timeline of typing and talking activity for one group <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. The top twelve lines show the typing activity of three people in each of three windows, as well as their activity in private windows. The next three lines show aggregate talking by each of the three participants.</p><p>Looking at the transcript for these episodes, we note that in the earlier bursts, the group is typically brainstorming for features the post office should have. The second burst is typically what we call "divide and conquer," where group members take various sections of their emerging document and flesh it out. In several groups, for example, one wrote the introduction, while others expanded on the costs and benefits of this particular design.</p><p>In contrast, the unsupported groups use the white board to capture ideas as they occur, one at a time. They then stop their discussion early to begin the slow job of getting the ideas down on paper. This is typically done by one person  Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We gave subjects who were doing an interesting problem solving task (i.e., design) a simple collaborative tool to assist them in their face-to-face work. The tool provided no particular process support or structure to their work. They were free to organize their activities as they wished. By the time they did our target design task they had had about an hour's practice in using the new electronic workspace tool.</p><p>Yet this simple tool and this limited experience had a profound effect on their work. The designs they produced were of higher quality than those of the control groups who worked in a more traditional fashion. They liked the process a little less, perhaps not surprising given the use of a new technology. But most surprising of all was the way in which they worked. They actually did a less extensive exploration of the design space than the traditional, unsupported groups, contrary to our expectations. Instead of encouraging a more exhaustive look at design ideas, something about the technology led them to a more selective examination of what turned out to be better ideas.</p><p>They seemed to focus more on the core issues, and captured and examined by reading what they were thinking while they worked, rather than in two stages--once on the whiteboard and once on paper while those other than the scribe talked about other things.</p><p>We can only speculate about a lot of things that might have produced the effecc shared access to an easily editable workspace that permitted parallel work when appropriate; an easier blending of the activities of idea generation, idea selection, and report generation; early capture of good ideas that led to a quicker consensus about a sensible design; a mixed mode of participation (talking and typing) that favored consensus development as opposed to unfettered exploration of fringe design ideas. All of these are plausible, and so far our analyses have not pushed deeply enough to sort them out.</p><p>The technology had other direct effects on the behavior of the supported groups. They spent a large amount of their time (7Yo) trying to figure out the technology itself, On average they spent 10% of their time doing parallel work, though as we showed, in general this tended to be concentrated at specific stages of their work. They used the technology to capture ideas that they never felt compelled to talk about, since everyone could see the ideas as they emerged and comment if they disagreed.</p><p>Our overall impression is that the simple group editor we gave these subjects was a functional and useful tool. This was true despite its shortcomings of functionality and interface that were revealed by the subjects' use and comments <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, On the basis of relatively little experience the subjects were able to organize their work with the aid of this tool,</p><p>In the final analysis, both the significant and nonsignificant results are interesting, Some confirm our notions of what makes a good meeting; some tell us that prescriptions we hold about good meetings (e.g., that discussing more alternatives is better) may not be widely true.</p><p>To our knowledge, no one has ever before run this complete an analysis of technology's effect on work--run enough groups to overcome variability, analyzed the process in such detail, and had the opportunity to ferret out the relationship between process and quality of outcome.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
