<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Our objective is to produce a richly integrated platform for the investigation of human-like information processing-exploring the underlying mechanisms of the human brain in dealing with the real world. In this paper, we present a humanoid robotic system, a platform created to facilitate our studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Research landscape</head><p>Major projects on humanoid robots are still being actively pursued. Honda with their landmark work on P2, then P3 and recently ASIMO <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> have impacted upon the recent trends in robotics research. The HRP project was a major project that was established to investigate the feasibility of applications for humanoid robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The SONY QRIO project was targeted to produce robotics systems suitable for entertainment purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Activities at the University of Tokyo have produced a number of humanoid robots, e.g., H5, H6 and H7, which were designed for walking and, recently, balancing while reaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The Waseda University group developed the WABIAN series robots, e.g., the new humanoid robot, WABIAN-2, designed for walking with/without walk-assist machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Following much of the initial success in humanoid robotics research, Johnnie, produced by the TUM group in Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and the KHR series robots from KAIST in Korea <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> are examples of humanoid robots focusing on biped locomotion research.</p><p>Much of the initial research in humanoid robotics to date has been geared toward bipedal walking. More recently, works on furthering behaviors of these robots have been considered, noticeably ASIMO in user interactions and HRP in producing various applications (e.g., operating a backhoe/assisting in daily living) are just some of the recent successful example applications for humanoid robots. The group at the University of Karlsruhe focuses on designing and using upper-body humanoid robots for service tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The prime focus of these systems has been toward the discovery of an application that is suitable for humanoid robots.</p><p>With regard to intelligent systems research, the earlier works of Brooks et al., utilizing an upper-body humanoid robot, COG, aimed at studying cognitive abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, producing a number of real-world human-like behaviours on COG <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The work of Kuniyoshi et al. is another example; they take the view that intelligent behaviors can emerge via an integrative system and its interaction with the world <ref type="bibr">[12 -14]</ref>. The recent work of Sandini et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> has been utilizing studies of developmental psychology and neuroscience research as a guide in developing a child-like humanoid robot system, Robot-cub.</p><p>The recent work of Ishiguro et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> places a strong emphasis on physical appearance in the development of their 'androids' and they examined the effects of human-robot interaction with such human-like robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>In our investigation, we wish to utilize a richly integrated system for investigating human-like behaviors. Our CyberHuman project was initiated at the behavioral level to explore ways to reproduce human-like behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Our research follows on from these previous studies, extending beyond the reproduction of human-like behaviors, to account in greater detail for the underlying processes. Downloaded by [Erciyes University] at 05:06 11 January 2015</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Motivations-our approach</head><p>As our research interests fall in line with the notion of 'understanding through creating'. Two essential aspects motivate our approach: • Engineering. Engineers can gain a great deal of understanding through studies of biological systems, which can provide guiding principles for developing sophisticated and robust artificial systems; • Scientifically. Building of a human-like machine and the reproduction of humanlike behaviors can in turn teach us more about how humans deal with the world, and the plausible mechanisms involved.</p><p>Our focus is towards the understanding of humans, more specifically the human brain and its underlying mechanisms in dealing with the world. We believe that a humanoid robot that is closer to a human being will facilitate this investigation. Such a sophisticated system will impose the appropriate constraints by placing our exploration within the context of human interactions and human environments. As a result, a full-size humanoid robot-Computational Brain (CB, developed by SARCOS)-was built to closely match the physical capability of a human, thus making it suitable for the production of a variety of human-like behaviors, utilizing algorithms that originate in computational neuroscience (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Outline</head><p>The following sections describe the physical robotic system and the supporting software control architecture used in our research. We present experimentally three aspects of our system: (i) adequate performance (Section 3.1), (ii) force controllability (Section 3.2) and (iii) perceptual abilities of our humanoid system (Section 3.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">RESEARCH PLATFORM-HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE</head><p>In this section, a presentation of the hardware and software architecture of our research platform, CB, is presented. An overview of the setup is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents the overall specifications of the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Humanoid robot-CB</head><p>The humanoid robot CB was designed with the general aim of developing a system that is capable of achieving human capabilities, especially in its physical performance. The physical system is of general human form. The following sections present the basics of the system.    arms, 2 × 7-d.o.f. legs, 1 × 3-d.o.f. torso and 2 × 6-d.o.f. hands (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>), making 50 d.o.f. in total (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The system has similar ranges of motion and physical performance as a human person (as guided by a human factors studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>). The system is able to perform saccadic eyes movements at up to 3 Hz (similar to that of humans). The hands (as shown Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) have been developed to provide basic functionality, such as grasping, pointing and pinching.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Sensing subsystems.</head><p>The active head houses a set of inertial sensors (three-axis rotational gyro and three-axis translational accelerometer). They are used to emulate the human vestibular system (the inner ear), providing head orientation, as used for gaze stabilization (see <ref type="bibr">Section 3.3</ref>). An additional inertial sensor is installed at the hip to provide angular velocity/translational acceleration near the center of mass of the whole body, used to provide the overall orientation of the system. The visual system is made up of two cameras per eye-a peripheral (wide-angle view) and a foveal (narrow view) camera are installed on each eye to emulate the visual acuity of the human visual system. Stereo microphones have also been installed to provide hearing to the robot. Images from the video cameras and the auditory signals are transmitted over high-speed wireless communication to a network of PCs for perceptual processing (discussed in Section 2.4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.">Proprioceptive sensing.</head><p>Proprioceptual information plays a key role in human motor control, informing the limbs and higher-level cortices of critical information in carrying out suitable action. Our system is equipped to support various forms of control to account for interactions and position/velocity/torques sensing is provided at the key joints for proper active compliant control (arms/legs/torso/neck-34 d.o.f.). Foot force sensors are installed at the soles of each foot to provide information during ground contact and weight distribution, as it is critical for walking and balancing control. The uniqueness of this system over previous systems is that torque sensors are installed on the main joints of the system, i.e. the arms/legs, torso and neck, allowing joint-level active compliant possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Software control architecture</head><p>As depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, we developed a network-based architecture to better enable us to explore various levels of human-like processing on our humanoid system. It is divided into two: on-board low-level computing and higher-level perceptual processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">On-board computing.</head><p>The control of the robot is through an on-board PC-104Plus CPU stack with an Intel 1.4 GHz Pentium-M processor, which provides control and sensory feedback to all the joints, performed at a maximum rate of 1 kHz (for all 50 d.o.f.). The Motor Control process (a software module) gathers sensory data (joint position/velocity/force information, foot force sensors, gyro/accelerometer data) of the four internal network branches to each of the low-level joint controllers (as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). A Task-level Control process (a software module) running on the local processor communicates with the Motor Control process to perform higher-level control functions (see Section 3). One external 100 Mbits/s Ethernet network connection is also provided for debugging and testing purposes. The on-board computer runs the ART-Linux operating system, a real-time version of the Linux, which retains all the standard functionality of Linux with the addition of real-time support <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The on-board processor is sufficient for walking control (Section 6) and force-based balancing control (Section 3.2). Any processing that requires substantial computations such as vision processing are performed remotely on a cluster of PCs (see next section).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Dynamic simulation and ubiquitous interface</head><p>Having a testbed is an essential element in conducting research, and for validating a variety of control strategies and algorithms for a complex physical system such Downloaded by [Erciyes University] at 05:06 11 January 2015 as a humanoid robot. A realistic dynamic simulator has been developed for our humanoid robot (Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and data not shown). The simulator serves two purposes: (i) realistic dynamic simulation, providing a realistic testbed for our controllers prior to experimentation on the real robot and (ii) ubiquitous interface, providing a transparent programming interface between the simulator and the real robot.</p><p>2.3.1. Realistic dynamic simulator. Our dynamic simulator serves as a realistic testbed for our controllers prior to experimentation on the real robot. One key aspect of the simulator is the development of a new contact model <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The contact model was developed to better facilitate evaluation of our controllers in a safe and consistent manner by quickly computing accurate contact interactions based on empirical estimates of real-world friction properties. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> shows our CB simulator.</p><p>The simulator provides kinematic and dynamic analyses for task control. It provides access to the robot's posture, link coordinate frames, dynamic Jacobians, zero moment point, etc., based on sensor data (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p><p>Modeling contact. Contact resolution methods have been extensively investigated to support our simulator <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In our CB simulator, an efficient contact handling method that applies Coulomb friction exactly has been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. It is important for humanoid robots to handle contact and friction forces accurately and efficiently in order to validate their controllers for real-world conditions. The method used in the CB simulator models contact between the humanoid's feet and a planar ground surface, and explicitly identifies the contact state of each foot. For a rectangularly footed biped, there are 361 possible contact states. Each foot may be contacting in one of 19 ways: at one of four vertices, one of four edges, with its face or not in contact at all. Active contacts may be static or dynamic.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.1.">Friction parameters.</head><p>These may be specified during simulation. Static friction is applied by incorporating the appropriate motion constraints into forward dynamics computations using Lagrange multipliers and dynamic frictions are integrated as additional forces. Measurements of the friction properties of CB's feet with various surfaces were conducted in order to provide an empirical basis for accurate simulation of the robot's contact interactions with its environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Ubiquitous interface.</head><p>The simulator also acts as a common interface to our collection of humanoid robots. Controller code running a simulated robot can be executed identically on the corresponding real robot. This accords with the concept of a humanoid robotics platform described in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, i.e., it provides a seamless control interface between the simulated and actual robot. Also, the provision of a ubiquitous control environment ideally facilitates an identical software interface to arbitrary robots. This ensures the portability and generalized utility of control software. In our system we provide this functionality by using an identical network interface for communication between the Motor Control process (described in Section 2.2.1) and the simulator. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> illustrates the general idea of our ubiquitous interface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">An architecture for emulating human-like processing</head><p>The overall structure of the system has been developed to facilitate the emulation of human information processing. The distributed architecture we proposed is motivated by neurological studies of the visual cortices, e.g., Van Essen and De Yoe <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. These findings showed in great detail that processing in the brain is a well-organised structure, with connections and pathways. In our system, we emulated this aspect of this organizational structure with a network of computers. The cluster of PCs is connected via a series of 1-Gbit/s Ethernet networks. We proposed a framework utilizing the UDP protocol with data streamed from one process to another. The processing on each PC can range from the most basic Downloaded by [Erciyes University] at 05:06 11 January 2015 (e.g., color extraction, edge filtering, etc.) to higher level (e.g., visual tracking, recognition, etc.). The sophistication of the system can increase quite rapidly simply through connecting the processing outputs of simpler elements to the inputs of more advanced processing elements in a bottom-up manner. Manipulation of the lowerlevel processes can also be performed in a top-down fashion. This framework will provide the capability to explore a greater range of cognitive architectures. Modules from spatial hearing to learning modules (SOM, R-L learning, Associative Memory) have also been developed to support our studies.</p><p>The effectiveness of this distributed architecture has been demonstrated with the development of a visual attention system <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, a real-time human hand-tracking system <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and visual ocular-motor control for our humanoid system (described in Section 3.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">HUMAN-LIKE BEHAVIOURS</head><p>In this section, we present experimentally three aspects of our system: (i) physical power for walking, (ii) full-body compliant control-physical interactions and (iii) perception and control-visual processing and ocular-motor responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Human-like performance-walking</head><p>To examine human-like walking, we have investigated a number of biologically inspired walking algorithms <ref type="bibr">[25 -27]</ref>. Here, we present one central pattern generator (CPG)-based locomotive controller that managed to produce naturally looking walking movements on our humanoid robot. In the experiment shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> we demonstrate that a humanoid robot can step and walk using simple sinusoidal desired joint trajectories with their phase adjusted by a coupled oscillator. The center of pressure and velocity are used to detect the phase of the lateral robot dynamics. This phase information is then utilized to modulate the desired joint trajectories, thus enabling us to generate successful stepping and walking patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. This walking demonstration shows that our system has adequate performance in supporting the full body.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Compliant control: three-dimensional (3-D) balancing and physical interactions</head><p>Force control or compliant control plays a key role in the ways humans interact with the world. This is well supported by biomechanical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Humans control the stiffness of their limbs in dealing with contacts while performing appropriate tasks. This is also supported by the passivity of non-linear control theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. We developed a controller to perform 3-D force-based control of CB.</p><p>One of the controllers we developed is a full-body contact force controller with gravity compensation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. The gravity compensation is possible only for a forcecontrollable humanoid like CB; an example of the force-tracking performance of the system is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>. This makes the robot passive with respective to any external force applied to arbitral contact points and, hence, results in compliant fullbody interaction. The additional contact force allows the robot to generate desired ground reaction forces and other necessary interaction forces. For example, if we Downloaded by [Erciyes University] at 05:06 11 January 2015  define the desired ground reaction force as a feedback to the center of mass, then full-body 3-D balancing is easily realized. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> shows such an example, where the robot is being abruptly pushed on the upper-left shoulder. The robot was able to recover and maintain balance. With the same force control framework, the robot performed squatting, force tracking to external forces and position tracking while keeping balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Perception-visual processing and ocular-motor responses</head><p>Human interaction with the external world involves the utilization of a fully integrated sensory system. To deal and interact with the external world, our system is equipped with microphones for hearing and video cameras for seeing (two eyes for stereo vision processing; two cameras per eye-foveal and peripheral camerato mimic foveated vision of biological systems). The peripheral cameras provide a wide visual view of the environment, whereas the foveal cameras provide a more detailed view of a smaller portion of the world.</p><p>Results from neuroscience research show that visual information is transferred along a number of pathways (e.g., magnocellular pathway, parvocellular-blob pathway and parvocellular-interblob pathway) and that visual processes are executed in well-defined areas of the brain. Visual perception results from interconnections between these partly separate and functionally specialized systems. Such a processing system is much too complex to be implemented on-board. The distributed architecture described in Section 2.4 was designed to allow remote execution of such processing models. It allows us to organise vision processing in a brain-like manner, i.e., serially, parallelly with feedforward connections as well as feedback connections, forming networks of interconnecting processing elements.</p><p>As a first example that tests the proposed distributed architecture we developed a visual attention system for CB based on the biologically motivated model described in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. This visual attention model exhibits a distributed processing architecture, which is quite typical for the processing of information in the brain. The original visual stream is subdivided into several processing streams associated with different features (color, intensity, orientation, motion and disparity were used) that are in part independent of each other. Further down the processing stream the results must be integrated and synchronized to produce a global saliency map suitable for the selection of the focus of attention. Once the focus of attention is selected, a feedback connection is needed to suppress visual processing during the saccade. The developed architecture allowed us to distribute visual attention processing among eight PC workstations, and provided us with the means to realize the feedforward and feedback connections. One issue that became noticeable when implementing the attention system was that the processing time, and consequently the latency and frame rate, can vary across the visual streams. This led us to develop and test a number of synchronization schemes that enable time synchronization of visual streams running at various frequencies and latencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The result of the visual attention system is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>.</p><p>We also experimented with ocular-motor responses similar to that of humans. The following biological ocular-motor control schemes have been incorporated into our system: Downloaded by [Erciyes University] at 05:06 11 January 2015 • Vergence-minimizing target disparity by symmetric eye movement.</p><p>• Saccadic eye motion-quick knee-jerk-type eye movements to redirect gaze.</p><p>• Vestibulo-ocular reflex-gaze stabilization by compensating for externally induced head movements (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref>). • Coupling of eye movements with head movement.</p><p>• Saccade followed by smooth pursuit of a target in an integrated control environment. These motions form the basis for the realization of active higher-level visual processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This paper presented a new integrated humanoid robotic system, CB, developed for the studies of human-like information processing in dealing with the real world. The hardware and software architecture of the overall system were presented. Three aspects of our system were discussed: (i) it provides sufficient power for Downloaded by [Erciyes University] at 05:06 11 January 2015 walking, (ii) it has force controllability and (iii) it has a fully supported perceptual system, with a distributed architecture to emulate brain-like processing of sensory information.</p><p>The humanoid robot CB, we believe, is the first humanoid robotic system that is capable of full-body force-based (compliant) control. It has a similar range of motion, with a similar configuration (50 d.o.f.) and similar performance as a human. Additionally, its perceptual system attempts to mimic that of humans. These characteristics makes CB suitable as a research tool to investigate the neuroscience of information processing in the brain. This is because, we believe, a sophisticated system such as CB will impose the appropriate constraints by placing our exploration within the context of human interactions within human environments.</p><p>With our current human-like system, our immediate objectives are to conduct the following studies: • To understand agile and natural human-like movements; in particular, to investigate what are the significant properties necessary to produce natural-looking agile and robust locomotion? • To understand the role that active interactions play in object learning, e.g., utilizing the human-like perceptual system, an object reaching and grasping system will be developed to manipulate an object and vary the views while learning the necessary features required to represent the object.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
