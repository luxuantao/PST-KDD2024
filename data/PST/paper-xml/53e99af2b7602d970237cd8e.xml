<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We consider the problem of filling in missing or damaged wavelet coefficients due to lossy image transmission or communication. The task is closely related to classical inpainting problems, but also remarkably differs in that the inpainting regions are in the wavelet domain. New challenges include that the resulting inpainting regions in the pixel domain are usually not geometrically well defined, as well as that degradation is often spatially inhomogeneous. We propose two related variational models to meet such challenges, which combine the total variation (TV) minimization technique with wavelet representations. The associated Euler-Lagrange equations lead to nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE's) in the wavelet domain, and proper numerical algorithms and schemes are designed to handle their computation. The proposed models can have effective and automatic control over geometric features of the inpainted images including sharp edges, even in the presence of substantial loss of wavelet coefficients, including in the low frequencies. Existence and uniqueness of the optimal inpaintings are also carefully investigated.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Image inpainting refers to filling in missing or damaged regions (like cracks or scars) in images. In fine art museums, inpainting of degraded paintings is traditionally carried out by professional artists and usually very time consuming, not to mention the risk of completely destroying a precious and world-unique ancient painting due to direct retouching.</p><p>Mathematically speaking, inpainting is essentially an interpolation problem, and thus directly overlaps with many other important tasks in computer vision and image processing, including image replacement <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, disocclusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>, zooming and superresolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>, and error concealment <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>. The current work has been more motivated and inspired by the error concealment application, which is to automatically recover lost packets information during transmission processes.</p><p>The notion of digital image inpainting was invented by Bertalmio-Sapiro-Caselles-Balleste in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, where the authors pioneered a novel inpainting technique based on a 3rd order nonlinear PDE. This work has stimulated the recent wave of interest in geometric image interpolation and inpainting problems, for example, variational PDE models <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, Navier-Stokes equation and fluid dynamic system related methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, landmark based inpainting <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, texture inpainting <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, inpainting by vector fields and gray levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, inpainting by corresponding maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and morphological component analysis for cartoon and texture inpainting <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Very recently, PDE techniques in image inpainting were featured in the article "Filling in Blanks" by Ivars Peterson in the Science News (Vol. 161/19, 05/11/2002) <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we study a generalized (as compared with conventional inpainting) inpainting problem for which data loss occurs in the wavelets domain. The primary motivation for us to study wavelet based image inpainting is that many images are formatted and stored in terms of wavelet coefficients, especially after the release of the new image compression standard JPEG2000, which is largely based on wavelet transforms, including the famous Daubechies 7-9 biorthogonal wavelet decomposition. Minor damages to compact discs coding JPEG2000 image files and data loss during wireless transmission processes, for example, could both result in the need for filling-in the missing information in the wavelet domain instead of the pixel domain.</p><p>Working in the wavelet domain, instead of the pixel domain, changes the nature of the inpainting problem, since damages to wavelet coefficients can create correlated damage patterns in the pixel domain. For instance, for wavelets based image inpainting problems, there usually exists no corresponding regular geometric inpainting regions, which are however necessary for many PDE-based inpainting models in pixel domains. Such lack of spatial geometric regularity of inpainting regions also prohibits many other existent inpainting techniques applied to pixel domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. On the other hand, direct interpolation in the wavelet domain is also problematic. Unlike thresholding-based image denoising <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, wavelets decoupling achieved by Besov image models is convenient for componentwise image denoising but intrinsically insufficient for direct interpolation in the wavelets domain. Section 3.1 will further clarify this key point.</p><p>For this reason, many contemporary error concealment methods for JPEG (built upon discrete cosine transforms (DCT)) or JPEG2000 (upon wavelets) images require the additional control of regularity in pixel domains, in addition to direct operations in transformed domains (i.e., DCT or wavelets). Such examples include Hemami-Gray's bi-cubic Coons surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) by Park-Lee <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> and by Cheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, Niu-Poston's harmonic postprocessing techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, Sapiro and collaborators' separate reconstruction techniques for structures and textures <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, and least square minimization in wavelet-domain reconstructions <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. However, these JPEG based error concealment methods usually work on images that have already been partitioned into 8 × 8 or 16 × 16 blocks. Each missing or damaged block corresponds to a well defined square region to be filled-in in the pixel domain. Our present work however makes no a priori assumption on block partitioning.</p><p>An important guiding principle for our new models is that even though the primary goal is to fill in the missing coefficients in the wavelet domain, it is important to control the regularity in the pixel domain, so that the inpainted images retain important geometrical features such as sharp edges, especially when noise is present.</p><p>Such considerations have motivated the variational PDE approach in our current work. The variational PDE technique has been widely used in numerous applications such as image segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>, restoration <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref>, compression <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, zooming <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, and conventional image inpainting <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</p><p>The growing impact of variational PDE techniques in image processing is mainly due to their capability and flexibility in controlling geometrical features of images. For example, total variation (TV) minimization, which leads to a curvature term in the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation, can retain sharp edges in image restoration. In this paper, we select TV minimization to facilitate the inpainting process so that the missing or damaged coefficients can be filled in to faithfully restore geometric image features. In addition, the TV minimization can also systematically suppress the noise in the images. All the above properties make TV minimization a crucial ingredient for wavelets based image inpainting. As detailed later in Section 3.1, the TV Radon measure, with its rich geometric properties, cannot be replaced by any Besov norm, or equivalently, be controlled sheerly by the sizes of wavelets coefficients.</p><p>It is worth pointing out that the idea of using TV minimization together with wavelet representations in image processing has been proposed by different research groups. For example, in an earlier work of the first and third authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, models of combining wavelets and TV minimization have been studied for image denoising and compression. Later, Durand-Froment <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> use TV minimization in conjunction with wavelets to eliminate pseudo oscillations in image restoration. Candes-Guo <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> use TV minimization to clean up oscillations from curvelet reconstructions, and Starck-Elad-Donoho <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> decomposes images using combination of TV norm and l 1 wavelet coefficient norm. Interesting work on combining TV with wavelets for general image restoration problems has also been studied by Malgouyres <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. More recently, another interesting and related study has been conducted by Candes-Romberg-Tao <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, in which a probabilistic theory has been developed for the conditions of exact reconstruction of small support functions, such as impulses, from their incomplete frequency information by minimizing convex functionals including l 0 , l 1 and TV norms. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Candes-Tao has further analyzed the reconstruction error in probability sense by minimizing l 1 norm for the functions whose frequency coefficients obey a power-law decay property.</p><p>We now describe briefly our main approach to the wavelet inpainting problem and some of the main results in our paper. We propose two related TV-wavelet inpainting models, one for noise-free channels while the other for noisy ones. Mathematically, the noise-free model is non-parametric, while the other is inevitably parametric in order to incorporate the noise information (e.g., noise variances). We then explain the major difference between TV-wavelets inpainting and the well-known thresholding methods for wavelet-based image denoising <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. Wavelets inpainting requires coupled wavelets regularities such as TV to correlate the missing and existent components, whereas in classical denoising, decoupling plays a fundamental role in simple and componentwise algorithms. For the theoretical part of the paper, we rigorously prove the existence of solutions to our wavelet inpainting models. The proof is non-standard because boundedness of the solution does not follow from standard arguments due to the lack of data in the inpainting regions and needs to be first established. We also showed a counter-example to show that in general uniqueness cannot be established for our models. We also explain why the non-uniqueness for such generalized inpainting problems (i.e., loss of linearly transformed data) is not so straightforward as the classical inpainting problems (e.g., Chan and Shen <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>). For practical applications in the error concealment of wavelets-based image communication, we develop the necessary (though by no means optimal) numerical algorithms and demonstrate surprisingly good experimental performance of the models for both generic natural images and synthetic ones with salient geometric ingredients. The two key features are (a) unlike controlled optimal wavelets analysis or compression, the data loss is random and spread across all resolutions levels; and (b) unlike lossy wavelets synthesis or decompression algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>, TV-wavelets hybrid inpainting successfully suppress the notorious Gibbs' phenomenon due to the TV control. Our experiments show that even with substantial loss of wavelet coefficients (up to 50%, including low frequencies), our models are able to reconstruct the original image remarkably well, especially in retaining geometric structures.</p><p>This paper is arranged as follows. In Section 2, we give two models for the wavelet based inpainting problems according to the presence or absence of noise. In Section 3, we derive the Euler-Lagrange equations for the models and analyze their relationships to other wavelets based image processing tasks. We also prove the existence of the solutions and construct an nontrivial example to illustrate the non-uniqueness of the solutions. Section 4 presents numerical algorithms and schemes for solving the Euler-Lagrange equations. Generic numerical examples in Section 5 further highlight the remarkable inpainting qualities of both the models and their numerical schemes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">TV Minimization Models for Wavelets Based Image Inpainting</head><p>In this section, we propose two TV regularized wavelet based image inpainting models depending on whether or not noise needs to be suppressed in the image.</p><p>We start with a standard image model,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">z(x) = u 0 (x) + n(x),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where u 0 (x) is the original noise free image and n(x) the Gaussian white noise. We assume that the size of the image is n × m. Let us denote the standard orthogonal wavelet transform of z(x) by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">z(α, x) = j,k α j,k ψ j,k (x), j ∈ Z, k ∈ Z 2 . (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>(For tensor-product based multiresolution analysis in 2-D, there should be three mother wavelets ψ (1) , ψ (2) , and ψ (3) , but for convenience we shall instead only use a single symbol ψ. No confusion will arise below since both our models and algorithms will not specifically differentiate them.) In wavelet based image representations, the coefficients α = {α j,k } are the values being stored. Notice that here the low and high frequency (or scale) coefficients are not being distinguished, while standard digital representations usually need to separate them. One reason to do so is for simplicity. A different reason is that in the proposed models and methods, we allow the missing or damaged coefficients to be in both the low and high frequency ranges. The models can automatically handle them differently if they belong to different frequency ranges, even though low frequency coefficients have completely different properties than the high frequency ones. We remark that in the following models and analysis, we have employed orthogonal wavelets for convenience. All the analytical results and computational schemes can be easily modified for biorthogonal wavelets for which it suffices to distinguish the analysis and synthesis wavelets.</p><p>Damages (scratches and scars) in the wavelet domain cause loss of wavelet coefficients of z(x) on the index region I , i.e., {α j,k }'s with ( j, k) ∈ I represent those wavelet components missing or damaged. The task of inpainting is to restore the missing coefficients in a proper manner, so that the image will have as much information being restored as possible.</p><p>As mentioned before, the inpainting problem usually allows more than one solutions and many different ways to fill in the missing coefficients, which lead to different reconstructions in the pixel domain. One often has to use proper regularization to guide the filling of missing coefficients. In many applications, it is crucial to have geometrical features (from available image information) propagated into the pixel domains of inpainting. For this reason, it is important to control the regularity in the pixel domain, so that broken or incomplete edges can be completed faithfully, and noise removed effectively.</p><p>With all these factors in mind, we now propose two variational models for wavelets based image inpainting.</p><p>If the target image is noiseless or the noise n is small enough to be negligible, one just needs to fill in the damaged wavelet coefficients and preserve the other coefficients. We propose a simple TV minimization scheme to fill in the missing coefficients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model I (for noiseless images): min</head><formula xml:id="formula_3">β j,k :( j,k)∈I F(u, z) = R 2 |∇ x u(β, x)|dx = TV(u(β, x)),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where u(β, x) has the wavelet transform:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">u(β, x) = j,k β j,k ψ j,k (x), β = (β j,k ), j ∈ Z, k ∈ Z 2 ,</formula><p>and subject to the constraint:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">β j,k = α j,k , ( j, k) / ∈ I,</formula><p>where I is the inpainting index region. We remark that the derivative ∇u is often denoted by the Radon measure symbol Du in the standard literature on functions with bounded variations (BV).</p><p>In many applications, such as signal transmission in wireless channels, noise is unavoidably introduced in addition to the loss of data packages. More precisely, in addition to the possibility that some coefficients β j,k , ( j, k) ∈ I can be completely lost or damaged, the remaining others (β j,k , ( j, k) / ∈ I ) can also be polluted by noise, which cannot be ignored. In this situation, we propose a second model for wavelet inpainting.</p><p>Model II (for noisy images): min</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">β j,k F(u, z) = R 2 |∇ x u(β, x)|dx + ( j,k) λ j,k (β j,k -α j,k ) 2 , (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">)</formula><p>and the parameter λ ( j,k) is zero if ( j, k) ∈ I , the missing index set; otherwise, it equals a positive constant λ to be properly selected (see further discussions in the next section).</p><p>In the objective functions in (3) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">4</ref>), we use the total variation (TV) norm because it can retain sharp edges while reducing the noise and other oscillations, such as Gibbs' phenomena, in the reconstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. Our approach can be easily extended to include other regularizers, such as ones containing curvature <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>The models are related to our earlier studies of TV model for wavelet based image denoising and compression <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The key difference between the models is that in Model I, the arguments in the TV minimization are restricted to the inpainting regions I only, the dimension of unknowns is the number of coefficients in I , while in Model II, the parameter λ is taken to be zero in the inpainting regions in the wavelet domain, in contrast to the standard denoising and compression models, where λ is usually taken to be a constant. This difference essentially puts no constraint on the missing wavelet coefficients so that they can change freely, and therefore restore the missing information.</p><p>We remark that unlike most image processing models, Model I does not require any user-defined parameter. This provides significant advantages for Model I over the other TV based image processing models. Of course, the preassumption for Model I is that the given image observation, or equivalently the available collection of its wavelet coefficients, is noiseless.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Analysis of the Models</head><p>For convenience, we shall assume in this section that the image domain is the entire plane = R 2 , and the gradient symbol ∇u represents ∇ x u(β, x). As common in the variational literature, the image u is always assumed to be smooth so that all the subsequent formal derivations of the Euler-Lagrange equations in 3.4 can be valid in the classical sense (see, e.g. Rudin-Osher-Fatemi <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>). Generally, the gradients involved must be properly understood in the settings of subdifferentials or distributions. On the other hand, following the work of Chan-Osher-Shen <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the total variation measure allows a self-contained digital formulation on a general discrete lattice or graph, and most of the analytical complications can be avoided from a practical point of view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Why the Hybrid Models</head><p>From the wavelet representation point of view, one naturally asks the following question: "Can both models be expressed explicitly by the wavelet representation?" More specifically, as in the celebrated denoising works by Donoho, DeVore, and their collaborators <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>, is there an equivalent model (to Model II, say) that is fully based on the wavelet coefficients in the classical form of:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">F * (β) = (|β j,k | s) + ( j,k) λ j,k (β j,k -α j,k ) 2 ,</formula><p>where (|β j,k | s) denotes the sizes of all wavelet coefficients, and a suitable function of all these sizes. By equivalence to model II, we mean there exist two fixed positive constants C 1 and C 2 , independent of β or u, so that</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">C 1 TV(u(β, x))≤ (|β j,k | s)≤C 2 TV(u(β, x)). (5)</formula><p>More rigorously, we assume that does not depend upon the particular (orthonormal) wavelets basis employed but the two constants C 1 and C 2 may.</p><p>The answer is negative, which reveals the major difference between our models and the classical wavelets denoising schemes based on Besov regularity conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. Recall that the Besov regularity norm is defined in 2-D by</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">u Ḃα q (L p (R 2 )) = ∞ 0 (ω p (u, h)h -α ) q dh/ h 1/q ∼ j 2 jq(α+1-2/ p) β j, q l p 1/q .</formula><p>Here the dot symbol in Ḃα q (L p (R 2 )) indicates the homogeneity of the Besov norm in discussion, β j, l p the sequence l p -norm at each resolution j, and ω the p-modulus of continuity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">ω p ( f, h) = sup |a|≤h f (x + a) -f (x) L p (R 2 ) .</formula><p>In fact, one has the following negative result for images with bounded variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</p><p>Theorem 1. The space of BV (R 2 ) cannot be characterized by size properties on wavelet coefficients. This is mainly because there exist "rotations" (or unitary transforms) in L 2 (R 2 ) that "swing" some BV images out of the BV space, which could not occur if (5) were true.</p><p>Furthermore, the wavelet coefficients vector β of a BV image lies somewhere strictly between l 1 and weak l 1 , but cannot be characterized by either, according to the remarkable results of Yves Meyer <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, and Albert Cohen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>The fact that a generic image of BV is beyond simple wavelet description is mainly due to the geometric nature of the total variation semi-norm, or more generally, the total variation as a Radon measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. The preceding discussion has already revealed that the first variation of the total variation measure leads to the most important second order Euclidean geometric featurethe curvature</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">κ = κ(β, x) = ∇ • ∇u(β, x) |∇u(β, x)| .</formula><p>Even more profound on the geometric nature is the celebrated co-area formula of Fleming-Rishel <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and De Giorgi <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">R 2 |∇u|dx = ∞ -∞ length(u ≡ γ )dγ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where u ≡ γ denotes the γ -level curve for any γ ∈ R 2 . Therefore, the total variation Radon measure |∇u| amounts to summing up the lengths of all the level lines of a given image u. For simplicity, u has been assumed to be smooth so that its level lines are well defined.</p><p>For more general images with bounded variation, the above coarea formula can be updated to</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">R 2 |Du| = ∞ -∞ Per(u &gt; γ )dγ.</formula><p>Here |Du| denotes total variation as a Radon measure, and Per(u &gt; γ ) the perimeter of the Caccioppli set <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_15">{x ∈ R 2 | u(x) &gt; γ }.</formula><p>Classical wavelets, as space-scale representation tools, are however not originally motivated by, nor designed to handle explicitly, geometric information. This could at least shed some light on why generic BV images are beyond explicit descriptions based upon only the sizes of their wavelet coefficients. Many researchers have noticed this drawback, and proposed different ways to incorporate geometries in the study. Nowadays, geometric harmonic analysis, e.g. curvelets <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, is a hot research topic.</p><p>On the other hand, in computer vision as well as human vision, geometric information in images, such as edges, smoothness, junctions, and corners, are significant visual cues for successful perception (see, e.g., David Marr's work <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>). The space of functions with bounded variations, among all the familiar functional spaces in classical real analysis, is perhaps the simplest one that legalizes the existence of jumps or edges. Other image models such as the celebrated Mumford-Shah's object-edge model <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, often substantially increase the complexity in both theory and computation, by explicitly singling out the edge geometric feature.</p><p>To conclude, with wavelet coefficients inevitably polluted by noise and partially missing, it seems natural to explicitly enforce the edge geometric information using the total variation Radon measure. Such hybrid models (e.g., Models I and II) can faithfully inpaint the missing wavelet coefficients while retaining the sharpness of missing edges. Our later numerical results shall further confirm our claim.</p></div>

For example, on a bounded Lipschitz image domain , the existence of Chan and Shen's TV inpainting model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> was proven by Chan, Kang, and Shen <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> under the assumption that u(x) ∈ [0, 1] on . The restriction to [0, 1] conveniently leads to the boundedness of any minimizing inpainting sequence (u n ). In the following proof, however, we make no such assumptions on the boundedness of either the image domain or the range of image gray values. Instead, to avoid the unnecessary complication due to boundary wavelets, we shall assume = R 2 , and further benefit as well from the scaling-invariant Poincaré Inequality on the entire plane to control the boundedness of any minimizing inpainting sequence.</p><p>Following the preceding notations, let I denote the set of indices associated with all the missing wavelets coefficients and d = #I &lt; ∞, the number of lost coefficients. Define two orthogonally complementing subspaces of L 2 (R 2 ) according to I :</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">V I = span{ψ j,k | ( j, k) ∈ I }, U I = closure(span{ψ j,k | ( j, k) / ∈ I }).</formula><p>Let Q I and P I denote the orthogonal projections onto V I and U I separately. Then</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Q I + P I = I d, the identity operator in L 2 (R 2 ),</formula><p>and z I = P I z is the available observation while Q I z is lost during transmission. We now first turn to the existence of Model I. Any inpainting candidate u can be decomposed to</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">u = u I + v I , with u I = P I u, v I = Q I u.</formula><p>For Model I, z is assumed to be noiseless and u I = P I z is therefore fixed. The only freedom comes from the v I or β I component. Write:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">v I = v I (β I , x), β I = {β j,k | ( j, k) ∈ I },</formula><p>to indicate the dependence of v I on the missing wavelet coefficients β I . Define</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">F(β I ) = F(u, z) = TV(u I + v I (β I , x)).</formula><p>Then F(β I ) could be considered as a function on R d . Theorem 2. Assume that the mother wavelet ψ(x) belongs to BV(R 2 ) and is compactly supported, which are true for most familiar wavelets (e.g., Haar wavelets, or any C 1 family) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Also assume that u I belongs to BV(R 2 ). Then the objective function F(β I ) satisfies</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">(a) F(β I ) is (Lipschitz-) continuous; and (b) F(β I ) → +∞ as β I → ∞ in R d .</formula><p>As a result, the minimizer to F(β I ) must exist.</p><p>Proof: By the assumption on the mother wavelet, ψ j,k belongs to BV(R 2 ) for any ( j, k) ∈ I . Since TV is a semi-norm, one has for any β I and</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">β I in R d , |F(β I ) -F(β I )| = |TV(u I + v I (β I , x)) -TV(u I + v I (β I , x))| ≤ TV(v I (β I , x) -v I (β I , x)) = TV(v I (β I -β I , x)) ≤ β I -β I l 1 max ( j,k)∈I TV(ψ j,k ).</formula><p>This proves (a) since all norms in R d are equivalent. By further noticing that v I = Q I u is compactly supported, by Poincaré's inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, one has</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">R 2 |v I | 2 dx 1 2 ≤ C R 2 |∇v I |dx = C × TV(v I ),</formula><p>where the positive constant C is universal and independent of v I , or equivalently β I .

A natural way to proceed is to deal with the physical image u directly, instead of its wavelet coefficients β.</p><p>Model II is to minimize the energy</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">F(u, z) = R 2 |∇u|dx + λ R 2 (u I -z I ) 2 dx, (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_26">)</formula><p>where u I = P I u and z I = P I z. Unlike most other variational models in image processing, the incompleteness of data imposes a subtle challenge for proving the existence, because the lack of data (in the fitting term) results in an incomplete control over the global norms, which is however often crucial for establishing weak compactness of minimizing sequences in the direct method. For this purpose, Poincaré's inequality on the entire plane plays a fundamental role in the following proof.</p><p>Theorem 3. Suppose that the available set of wavelet coefficients α I c is in l 2 , or equivalently,</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">z I = P I z ∈ L 2 (R 2 ).</formula><p>Then the minimizer to F(u, z) in Model II <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> exists.</p><p>Proof: First, from the assumption it follows that for any admissible inpainting u, its u I component must belong to L 2 (R 2 ) due to the fitting term in F(u, z). Since</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">u = Q I u + P I u = Q I u + u I ,</formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">Q I u ∈ V I ⊂ L 2 (R 2 )</formula><p>, it follows that an F(u, z)admissible inpainting u must belong to L 2 (R 2 ). Since u = 0 is apparently admissible, there must exist a minimizing sequence (u i ) ∞ i=1 for F(u, z). Then u i ∈ L 2 (R 2 ), and</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">R 2 |∇u i |dx ≤ F(u i , z) → inf u F(u, z), i → ∞.</formula><p>In particular, the total variations of u i 's are bounded.

We thus conclude that (u i ) must be bounded in L 2 (R 2 ).</p><p>As a result, on any bounded open domain ⊂ R 2 , the restriction of (u i ) must be bounded in BV( ) (according to Schwarz's inequality). By the L 1 pre-compactness of bounded BV functions on finite domains and the diagonal selection procedure, one can find a subsequence of (u i ), still denoted by the same notation for convenience, such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">u i → u * , as i → ∞ in L 1 loc (R 2 ),</formula><p>for some locally integrable image u * .

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> depicts the performance on a damaged image with severe wavelets loss of 90%, corresponding to the leftmost end of the curve panel.</p><p>Next, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> shows the performance on a noisy image (with PSNR = 9.2 (dB)). The results clearly show that Model I can recover the geometrical features of the image, but can not suppress the noise in the reconstruction. The PSNR is improved to 15.1 (dB). While Model II with parameter λ = 10 can perform both tasks of inpainting and denoising at the same time. The PSNR is 19.6 (dB), which certainly outperforms Model I in the noise case. To complete the comparison, we plot the similar curves for PSNR improvements v.s. the percentage of retained coefficients for the noisy case and show them in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>. As one can see, Model II outperforms Model I in the noise case, and Model I can not reduce the damage caused by the noise.</p><p>The next example in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> further investigates an intriguing extreme situation when all but one coefficients     What happens if all the low-low wavelet components are lost? The example in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref> answers the question. The inpainted image in the middle looks like the orig-inal square but the intensity values are wrong, as seen in the slice plotting in the right panel. The solid line is the original square, and the dotted for the damage image, which oscillates and loses all intensities in the middle of the square. The dash-dotted line is the output from Model I whose values are very different from the original ones. However, the inpainted image well recovers the heights of the jumps due to the retained high-band information. However, if one retains any one nonzero low frequency coefficient as in the preceding example of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>, the intensities can also be perfectly determined.</p><p>In the next set of examples, we apply the models to a real noisy picture (the left panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref> from the Internet. Similar to the first example, 50% of the wavelet coefficients are randomly lost, including some low frequency coefficients (the right panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref>). The PSNR is 10.9 (dB). Again, there are no well defined inpainting regions in this example. We show the restored images by using Models I (left) and II (right) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref>. They fill in the black regions properly, and retain the sharp edges. Moreover, one can also observe that some detail information (such as the texture of the tie) is recovered surprisingly well. This is due to the retained high frequency wavelet coefficients which contain the fine structure. Their respective PSNR's are 18.8 (dB) and 18.7 (dB).</p><p>To further confirm the inpainting capability of the proposed models, we specially investigate the case where large regions in the low-low subband are lost. We show the picture on the left panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">13</ref> with PSNR = 13.1 (dB). In this case, the standard inpainting methods cannot fill in the large missing region properly, while the proposed models can recover the image and improve the quality drastically. This is mainly because there is still some information available from the retained wavelet coefficients on the dark regions in the pixel domain. As seen on the right panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">13</ref>, we demonstrate the image obtained by using Model I. PSNR of the inpainted image is improved to 22.0 (dB).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented two models for restoring arbitrary number of coefficients with arbitrary locations of wavelet coefficients for images with or without noise.</p><p>The idea is to use explicit regularization (i.e., the TV Radon measure and the BV image model) in the pixel domain to control and restore wavelet coefficients in the wavelet domain. Existence and uniqueness of the models have been rigorously investigated. We have shown through synthetic and real images that both models are very effective for restoring geometric features as well as filling in smooth regions, even with relatively large number of randomly lost coefficients uncontrollably spread across all resolutions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
