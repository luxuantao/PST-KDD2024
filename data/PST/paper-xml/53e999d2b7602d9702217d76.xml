<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We describe a new family of clocked logic gates based on the resonant-tunneling diode (RTD). Pairs of RTD's form storage latches, and these are connected by networks consisting of fieldeffect transistors (FET's), saturated resistors, and RTD's. The design, operation, and expected performance of both a shift register and a matched filter using this logic are discussed. Simulations show that the RTD circuits can achieve higher performance in terms of speed and power in many signal processing applications. Compared to circuits using III-V FET's alone, the RTD circuits are expected to run nearly twice as fast at the same power or at the same speed with reduced power.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>A resonant-tunneling diode (RTD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> is a heterostructure device whose essential structure is a sandwich of two very thin layers of high-band-gap material (in our case typically seven monolayers, about 2 nm, of AlAs) surrounding a thin layer of lower band-gap material (in our case typically 5 nm of InGaAs). The outer layers act as potential energy barriers to form quasi-bound states in the central layer. These layers can be grown with great precision and uniformity using epitaxial deposition techniques, such as molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). Thicker layers far outside the barriers serve as source and drain contacts to the RTD, while other thin layers just outside the barriers can be added to tailor the RTD characteristics. The structure we use is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a)</ref>.</p><p>The small spacing between the two barriers leads to quantization of momentum of the electrons in the well and, thus, to quasi-bound states with discrete energy levels, depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> as a dashed line between the barriers. For the very narrow wells typically used, the energy levels are widely spaced, and there is only one such quantum state of consequence. In the structure shown, the In Ga As layers just outside the barriers create two additional quantum wells, and the energy levels in those wells are also quantized, as shown by additional dotted lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Upon application of an external potential between the source and drain, a net electron current through the barriers can occur. For applied voltages that result in alignment of electron states on the source side of the barriers with a quasi-bound state in the well, a condition called resonance [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b)</ref>], the tunneling current is strongly enhanced. Thus, for applied voltages increasing from zero, the tunneling current rises to a local maximum at resonance (the peak current, , at voltage ) through a negativedifferential-resistance (NDR) region to a local minimum (the valley current, , at voltage ), and then rises again as scattering and hot-electron effects begin to contribute. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows both a measured -curve for an <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> 8m RTD grown with the layers depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a) and a simulation of the same structure using the software NEMO Version 2.0.8 (Nanotechnology Engineering Modeling Program developed by Texas Instruments <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>). The NEMO simulation was scaled to bring the peaks into coincidence. 1  Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows: (a) an RTD -curve; (b) the schematic RTD symbol used in this paper, which mimics the forward and reverse current peaks; and (c) an equivalent circuit for the RTD.</p><p>The high current density, low capacitance, and NDR of RTD's make them very fast nonlinear circuit elements. For example, oscillators at fundamental frequencies above 700 GHz have been demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. These same device characteristics can be exploited in high-speed, low-power digital logic circuits. Indeed, under special conditions, 1 The NEMO simulation predicted a current density about half of the experimental value and a peak voltage of about 0.6 V. The current scale of the simulated I-V curve was changed linearly, and an effective series resistance has been added to align the current peak with the experimental curve. RTD's have shown 0.5-V switching in times less than 2 ps <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In this paper, we will describe a logic family in which pairs of RTD's serve as high-speed data latches, and combinations of field-effect transistors (FET's), saturated resistors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and RTD's provide the logic functionality.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RTD LATCH</head><p>The RTD logic family to be discussed here was inspired by a tunnel-diode (TD) shift-register circuit presented by Aleksander and Scarr <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> in 1962. A series pair of RTD's, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>(a), forms a bistable latch when voltage biased within a suitable range (beginning at about 2 ), as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4(b)</ref>. Biased below that range, the pair is monostable [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>(a) and (e)]. The grounded RTD is referred to as the drive RTD; it is biased through the other RTD, which is called the load RTD. As a latch, its state is given by the data-node voltage: high for the "1" state or low for the "0" state. More generally, the state of a pair, which may not be in static equilibrium, will be specified by the instantaneous voltage and current of the drive RTD. At the two stable equilibrium states of the pair, marked with crosses in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>(b), the device tunneling currents are equal. These currents are also equal at a third point, where the NDR regions [shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>(b) as dashed lines] of the two RTD's cross: a point of unstable equilibrium. For an RTD pair in one of the stable equilibrium states, a voltage fluctuation creates an imbalance between the two RTD tunneling currents that charges or discharges the circuit and device capacitances in such a way as to drive the node voltage back toward the equilibrium value. For a pair in the unstable equilibrium state, an imbalance between the currents forces the node voltage away from the unstable equilibrium value. Since the unstable state is between the two stable states, a pair will always evolve to one stable state or the other.</p><p>External currents into and out of the data node influence the future state of the latch. To store a new value in a showing the two stable states. Voltage biasing two RTD's in series results in a bistable circuit. The state of a bistable pair is given by the voltage of the DATA NODE. In (b), the stable equilibrium states are labeled as "0" STATE and "1" STATE. The grounded RTD is referred to as the drive RTD, and its current as I DRIVE ; the bias-connected RTD is referred to as the load RTD, and its current as I LOAD . latch, the bias voltage is lowered into the monostable range long enough for the state of the pair to go low. The bias is then restored to the bistable level, and the pair evolves to one of the stable states, a process called the monostablebistable transition (MBT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The final state of the latch is determined primarily by the amount of current injected into the data node during the MBT. If the injected current is above a threshold level , the latch ends up in the "1" state; for currents below this threshold, the latch ends up in the "0" state. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> illustrates, using load-line diagrams, the evolution of the state of an RTD pair during a high-speed MBT. The state of the pair, represented by the cross in the diagrams, includes both the tunneling current of the drive RTD and the current charging its capacitance. Sequence (a)-(d) shows a latch being set low, while sequence (e)-(h) shows a latch being set high. Both sequences begin with a monostable bias voltage, (a) and (e). In (b) and (f), the bias voltage has been rapidly brought to its bistable value, but the pair is not yet in static equilibrium. The presence or absence of an input current to the data node determines to which of the stable states the pair evolves. In (b), where , the tunneling current through the drive RTD exceeds the tunneling current through the load RTD, and the net current flow from the node discharges the total datanode capacitance, decreasing the voltage at the node. In (c), at the reduced node voltage, the difference between the drive and load RTD tunneling currents is greater, and the node discharges faster. Finally, in (d), the latch has reached equilibrium in the "0" state. In (e) and (f), where , the input current adds to the tunneling current through the load RTD. At the moment depicted in (f), the tunneling current through the load RTD plus the input current exceeds the tunneling current through the drive RTD, and the net current flow into the node charges the total data-node capacitance, increasing the voltage at the node. As the voltage rises, the difference in currents increases, as shown in (g), and the node charges faster. Finally, in (h), equilibrium is reached, and the latch is in the "1" state. Now we can see the reason for using an RTD as a load, rather than a resistor or a current source (which could be implemented using a depletion-mode FET or a saturated resistor). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> compares the three cases. The advantages of using an RTD load are: 1) faster operation owing to larger maximum charging current, , and discharging current, , and 2) lower static power dissipation owing to low bistable bias voltage and low static current in both equilibrium states.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. RTD LOGIC GATES</head><p>The original shift register of Aleksander and Scarr [8] used two 180 out-of-phase clocks biasing alternate TD latches with a coupling network between them consisting of a single rectifying diode. That circuit and a similar circuit using RTD's instead of TD's show a significant clock-speed limitation due to the large current drawn through the output coupling diode. This reduces the current available to charge the node capacitance and greatly slows the transition to the high-voltage state. By incorporating enhancement-mode FET's (EFET's) into the coupling networks as source- In each load-line diagram, I 0 is the maximum current that the latch can sink in the "0" state before it switches to the "1" state; I 1 is the maximum current that the latch can source in the "1" state before it switches to the "0" state. While each circuit shown is a bistable RTD latch, the advantages of using an RTD load are: larger I 0 and I 1 ; larger bistable bias range (compared to the resistor load); and low static current for both states.</p><p>follower buffers [see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7(a)</ref>], the output-current load on a pair is reduced as it is being set. This allows more of the available current to charge the node capacitance and speeds up the switching process.</p><p>An additional element was added to the coupling network to improve performance. Variation in a latch's high-state voltage, due to noise in the clock voltage, could cause improper biasing of the coupling network, possibly causing too much (or too little) current to flow during the critical period of an MBT and, therefore, creating an error. (Too much current can cause the input latch to fall from the high state; too little can cause the output latch to fail to be set high.) To improve the operating-voltage margins for these circuits, a current-limiting element was introduced in series with the coupling network. This element can be implemented as an active load [a depletion-mode FET (DFET) with its gate connected to the source] or as a saturated resistor <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The latter is preferable because of its simplicity of fabrication and lower capacitance. A saturated resistor is shown schematically as a resistor symbol with a line over or beside it, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>.</p><p>A latch with this simple coupling network provides the logic function required for a shift register, namely, a delay. By combining various coupling networks, these logic functions can be implemented. The XOR gate (c) relies on the fact that, with both inputs high, the XOR RTD is biased into its valley, resulting in insufficient current to set the XOR latch high. An inverter (or NOT gate) is implemented as an XOR with one input kept high. The AND gate (d) operates similarly to the XOR gate: two high inputs cause the AND RTD to be biased into its valley. In this case, the high voltage of the valley state biases the second FET driver to send sufficient input current to set the AND latch to the high-voltage state.</p><p>In general, we call an RTD latch, together with its input coupling network, a logic gate. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>(a) shows the DELAY gate. Multiple-input gates are implemented by OR wiring multiple coupling networks, as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>(b). The nonlinear -characteristic of RTD's in the coupling network can be used to create other, more complex gates. While the circuit of Aleksander and Scarr was strictly noninverting, adding an RTD in series with two OR-wired coupling networks creates an XOR, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7(c</ref>). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> shows the operating principle of the XOR. The state of the series RTD, called the XOR RTD, is shown for various inputs when the latch is in a low-voltage state, as at the beginning of an MBT. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>(b), if neither input is high, the current delivered by the coupling network is low, below the threshold required to set a latch high, and the XOR latch is set low. If only one input is high, the XOR RTD is biased at a voltage just below its peak with a current limited by the saturated resistor. The circuit is designed so that this current is above , and the XOR latch is set high. If both inputs are high, the combined input currents bias the XOR RTD into its valley, thereby reducing the coupling current through it to a level below , and the XOR latch is set low. This gate also implements the inverter (NOT) function if a clocked "1" state is maintained at one of the inputs. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>(d) shows another variation-with the coupling RTD grounded and an additional FET buffer-that implements a majority gate, in this case a two-input AND gate. The state of the grounded AND RTD for various combinations of inputs is similar to that of the XOR RTD, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8(b</ref>). In this case, however, when two inputs are high and the AND RTD is biased into its valley, the high voltage of the valley state biases the gate of the second FET buffer high. This buffer is similar to the buffer in a delay gate: when the gate goes to a high voltage, current flows to the following latch, setting it high. If only one (or neither) of the inputs is high, the AND RTD remains biased at a voltage below its peak, and that low voltage biases the second buffer off. The current into the AND latch is below threshold, and the latch is set low.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. RTD-LOGIC CIRCUIT DESIGN</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Shift Register Operation</head><p>A shift register serves as a useful example to illustrate circuit design in this logic family. Indeed, because of the latching nature of the gates and the requirement of clocked transitions, most circuits implemented in this technology will rely on shift registers as a basic element. A shift register consists of a chain of master-slave D-type flip flops made from two DELAY gates, each biased by one of the two overlapping out-of-phase clocks, and , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>. A simplified description of the circuit operation follows.</p><p>While latches biased by clock are held at a bistable bias, clock falls and rises, creating an MBT. While biased in the monostable condition, latches are in a low-voltage state. If the preceding bistable latch is in the high-voltage state, the coupling EFET is biased on, and coupling current, limited by the saturated resistor, flows into the data node of the monostable latch. As the MBT continues, that latch makes a transition into a highvoltage state. If the preceding bistable latch is in the low-voltage state, the coupling EFET has little or no gatesource voltage, and no coupling current flows, setting the latch to the low-voltage state. Thus, upon undergoing an MBT, a DELAY-gate latch takes on the same voltage state as the preceding latch. In turn, the latches are held bistable while the latches undergo an MBT, and thus the data are passed down the shift register.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Circuit Design and Simulation</head><p>For simplicity in combining gates in a variety of configurations and because from a fabrication perspective it Each phase must maintain a bistable bias while the other phase undergoes a transition from bistable to monostable to bistable. During the MBT, a latch is set high or reset low according to its input. is easier to fabricate identical devices, all the saturated resistors in a circuit are designed to have the same value of saturated current. The source-follower EFET's must be large enough that the saturated resistor limits the current, but not so large that the gate adds unnecessary capacitance to a latch's node. The peak currents of the RTD's are optimized for each type of logic gate. It is convenient, then, to specify the sizes of the RTD's by the ratio of their peak currents to the fixed saturated-resistor current, denoting, for example, the size of the drive RTD as and the size of the load RTD as . Our primary design tool is SPICE,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> using the RTD model shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Any suitable expression may be used for the nonlinear tunneling-current function , but some functions, especially the exponential function, can increase computation time significantly. SPICE simulation allows us to explore: the design space for these circuits, including the sizes of the RTD's, saturated resistors, and FET's; the clock frequency and waveform; and the circuit configuration. Power dissipation is easily derived, and unique perspectives can be found by replotting time-series data in various formats. For example, as a valuable tool for understanding what limits the operations of a given circuit configuration, a series of instantaneous voltage-current states of an RTD (or any device) can be plotted on a load-line diagram as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>, providing insight into circuit operation. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref> shows an example of the simulated waveforms of the XOR gate of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7(c</ref>), being driven by delay gates.  Actual circuits have interconnect wiring whose capacitance and resistance can affect circuit performance. To obtain realistic values for these parasitic elements, IC's are laid out using a standard IC software layout tool, and the parasitic capacitance and resistance are calculated and included in the simulation. Generally, elements are placed close together to minimize wiring parasitics. Where it is necessary to connect across longer distances, interconnect wiring is placed within the coupling networks between the source node of the FET follower and the saturated resistor. In this way, the parasitics are driven directly by the FET, isolating them somewhat from the high-speed transitions of the latch. A typical interconnection is modeled as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Clock Drivers</head><p>As described above, the RTD logic depends on MBT's and thus requires a time-varying (clocked) voltage bias for the RTD pairs. At the multigigahertz clock rates considered below, clock currents will be on the order of a milliampere for every latch. The requirements in terms of waveform and total current are challenging for circuits of even moderate size and, thus, demand on-chip clock drivers. Two clock-driver configurations are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref>, both using a sinusoidal RF input to drive a commonsource EFET. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12(a</ref>) uses an FET follower, allowing the common-source EFET to be smaller. Simulations show it to dissipate somewhat less power. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref>(b) requires a larger common-source EFET, and while it dissipates more power than (a), its use is required for some gates, especially the XOR, to insure that the data node of the latch is driven to a low-voltage state at the beginning of an MBT. The number of latches biased by a single driver is a variable of the design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Large Capacitive Loads</head><p>In some cases, the clock speed is limited by the time required to discharge a large interconnect capacitance at the coupling EFET's source node. Normally, the only discharge path is through the saturated resistor and drive RTD of the output latch. To reduce the discharge time and permit a faster clock rate, a discharge FET is added where necessary, creating a push-pull configuration. The discharge FET is driven by the same phase RF clock signal as is used by the clock driver of the output latch for that gate, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref>. When the RF signal is high, the clock driver reduces the bias voltage to the output latch, rendering it monostable and ready to undergo an MBT. At the same time, the RF signal turns on the discharge FET, providing a supplemental discharge path for the interconnect capacitance. When the input latch is in the low state, the coupling FET is biased off, and the interconnect capacitance discharges. When the input latch is in the high state, both the coupling FET and discharge FET are biased on simultaneously. Nevertheless, the interconnect charges, and the coupling current into the output latch sets it to the high state.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Margins</head><p>One of the difficulties in making tunnel-diode digital circuits in the 1960's was the need to closely control the peak currents of the diodes. The circuit uniformity requirements were more than the manufacturing techniques of the time could reliably achieve <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. To explore the limits of allowable diode variation in RTD circuits, multiple Combinations of drive and load RTD sizes within the limits will operate correctly. This plot, and similar plots for the other logic gates, determine the fabrication tolerances required and allow an estimate of manufacturing yield. SPICE simulations were performed with various circuitparameter values. The margins describe the range of sizes of the various RTD's for which the circuit operates properly. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">13</ref> shows an example of these margins, expressed as the ratio of peak RTD currents to saturated resistor currents ( and ), for shift registers running at 5 and 25 GHz, using RTD's with peak current densities, , of 10 and 10 A/cm and simulated EFET's having of 100 and 1000 mS/mm. The circuits presented here are considerably more tolerant of RTD-size variation than earlier TD or RTD circuits without FET's <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Considering that RTD's with peak-current standard deviations measured to be 2.3% have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the prospect of achieving moderate-size circuits is good. The challenge remains to match the currents of the saturated resistors to the peak currents of the RTD's in fabricated circuits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. TECHNOLOGY COMPARISON</head><p>The dynamics of these gates at high clock rates are complex, making analytic evaluation difficult. SPICE simulations form the foundation of this circuit design. As these circuits have not yet been reduced to practice, the conclusions presented here are based on those simulations. We first compare simulations of RTD logic to simulations of some of the best experimental CMOS circuits, and then to high-speed III-V technology. The CMOS comparison is based on circuits that have been laid out using the same design rules; in the III-V comparison, both circuits use the same transistor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) CMOS</head><p>To compare the performance of this RTD-based technology with an existing 0.25-m fully depleted SOI CMOS line running at MIT Lincoln Laboratory <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, circuits with identical function were laid out in both technologies The function simulated is the comparator section of a matched filter, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14</ref>. Matched filters are used in digital signal processing and communications systems to detect the presence of specific serial bit patterns. The required pattern of 1's and 0's is stored in a reference register, while a bit-serial signal is clocked through a signal shift register. Pairs of signal and reference bits are compared using exclusive OR (XOR) gates, whose output indicates a match ("0") or a miss ("1"). These values are summed to create a single number that represents the degree of correlation between the signal and reference. A single stage of the comparator section of the matched filter consists, then, of a reference register (latch) to hold the reference data, a shift register to pass the signal data along, and an XOR to compare the bits (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14</ref>).</p><p>A schematic of one stage of the RTD implementation of the comparator is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">15(a)</ref>. A schematic of the CMOS version, using pass transistors, is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">15(b)</ref>. As laid out, the area of the RTD circuit was about twice that of the CMOS circuit; however, no effort was made to optimize the RTD-circuit area. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> summarizes the simulated performance of the two implementations. Using RTD's with of 10 A/cm and EFET's with of 100 mS/mm, the RTD circuits run at a maximum clock speed and with power dissipation comparable to the 0.25-m SOI CMOS. Using state-ofthe-art devices-RTD's with of 10 A/cm and EFET's with of 1000 mS/mm-the RTD circuit operates up to 25 GHz with a power dissipation of 8.3 mW.</p><p>It should be noted that these comparisons apply to applications that require a gate to switch during every clock period. For general-purpose computing, however, where a large fraction of the circuit may be idle, CMOS would have lower total power dissipation by far because of its very low static power consumption. RTD's will see their greatest application in signal processing circuits, such as the matched filter discussed here. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. III-V's</head><p>SPICE simulations also allow us to compare the speed and power dissipation of a FET-coupled RTD circuit and a conventional FET-only design. A shift register was simulated in each technology using a load capacitance of 30 fF to represent wires and/or fanout.  Among the fastest FET shift-register designs are dynamic pass-transistor circuits <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. While direct-coupled (DCFL) would allow a low-power implementation of this circuit, super-buffer FET logic (SBFL), which adds a noninverting push-pull buffer to a DCFL gate, provides improved load driving capability to maintain high-speed operation. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">16</ref>(a) shows a schematic of a dynamic latch with an SBFL inverter. Q1 is the pass transistor, Q2-Q3 is the DCFL inverter, and Q4-Q5 is the super buffer. For comparison, an RTD DELAY stage is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">16(b)</ref>. Q1 is a clocked FET that biases the RTD pair; Q2 is the coupling FET; and Q3 is the discharge FET, which helps to discharge the load capacitance. The depletion-mode active load in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">16</ref>(a), Q2, and the saturated resistor shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">16</ref>(b) are essentially equivalent devices.</p><p>Both circuits in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">16</ref> could be chained to create a shift register. However, it has been found that, in the dynamic SBFL latch, clock feedthrough in the pass transistor can cause logic errors. By using a differential architecture, the memory cell flip-flop (MCFF) circuit of Shikata et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">17</ref>) operates more reliably at high speeds. We simulated an SBFL-MCFF shift register circuit reported by Theide et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, using a transistor model that had a simulated of 100 GHz based on the 0.25-m FET's reported by Hida et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The same FET model was used for the RTD shift-register simulations. For simplicity in simulating both circuits, the clock inputs were driven by voltage sources. These circuits were kept intentionally simple to put the basic circuits of both technologies on an even footing for the sake of comparison.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">18</ref> shows the results of the simulation for the case of a 30-fF load capacitance. The MCFF circuit was scaled for transistors from 5 to 20 m wide, with the maximum clock frequency and the dissipated power rising with increasing FET width. In the RTD circuit, the peak current density was fixed at 10 A/cm , and the circuits were scaled two ways: varying the current of the saturated resistors and varying the size of the push-pull buffer FET's. In scaling the saturated resistors, both the peak currents of the RTD's and the clocked bias FET were scaled proportionately. The push-pull FET's were of equal width and scaled to 5, 10, and 15 m, as indicated in the figure . 
As can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">18</ref>, the RTD logic is capable of operating at nearly two times the maximum clock frequency of the FET-only logic with no increase in power. The addition of RTD's allows operation up to one-third of the 100-GHz of this FET, whereas the FET-only circuit could operate only up to about . In addition, the power required for the RTD circuit is only one-fourth of that required by the FET-only circuit at . Since power dissipation often limits the maximum density of III-V circuits, this implies that RTD logic could increase circuit complexity by four times for the same total power dissipation of the chip. These advantages, combined with reduced circuit complexity and low-power RTD memory should outweigh the additional fabrication complexity required to incorporate RTD's into FET circuits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. SUMMARY</head><p>We have described a new family of clocked logic gates in which RTD's are used to form high-speed storage latches, while FET's, saturated resistors, and RTD's are used to couple the latches and create logic gates. The family includes a delay gate, an OR gate, an AND gate, and an XOR gate (which also implements the NOT function). We discussed in detail the design, operation, and expected performance of a shift register formed using delay gates. We studied implementations in both RTD and SOI CMOS logic of digital correlators comprising two shift registers with XOR gates between them at each stage. Our simulations using circuit parameters derived from IC layouts show that the RTD circuits can achieve higher performance in terms of speed and power in many signal processing applications. We also compared shift registers implemented using our RTD logic with those using III-V FET's alone. The simulations show that RTD shift registers can run twice as fast at the same power or with one-fourth the power at the same speed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1. Energy band diagrams of an RTD under three bias conditions. The various materials that make up the essential layers of our typical RTD are indicated in (a).

Tunneling through the AlAs barriers is enhanced in (b) when an externally supplied bias voltage aligns the energy of the quasi-bound state between the barriers with the energies of the heavily populated states adjacent to them, a condition called resonance.

The state of the instantaneous voltage and total current (conduction and capacitive) of the drive RTD is shown as a cross on a sequence of load-line diagrams. To establish a new state in a latch, it must first be brought to a monostable bias, (a) or (e), and returned quickly to the bistable level, (b) or (f). In order to set a latch to the high-voltage state (h), an input current, I IN , must be supplied to the data node during the restoration of the bias voltage to the bistable level, (f)-(h); otherwise the latch will be reset to the low-voltage state, (b)-(d). When the total drive current is less than the drive-RTD conduction current, the capacitive current is negative, as is dV RTD=dt, and the voltage is driven lower, as in (b) and (c). Likewise, when the total drive current is above the drive RTD conduction current, the voltage is driven higher, as in (f) and (g). The difference between the I-V curves is the current available to charge/discharge the capacitances of the RTD's as well as circuit capacitance. The greater the current difference, the faster the voltage change [compare (b) and (c) to (f) and (g)].</figDesc><graphic coords="3,47.70,241.38,229.92,298.56" type="bitmap" /></figure>

RTD logic gates: (a) DELAY; (b) OR; (c) XOR (also NOT); and (d) AND.By combining various coupling networks, these logic functions can be implemented. The XOR gate (c) relies on the fact that, with both inputs high, the XOR RTD is biased into its valley, resulting in insufficient current to set the XOR latch high. An inverter (or NOT gate) is implemented as an XOR with one input kept high. The AND gate (d) operates similarly to the XOR gate: two high inputs cause the AND RTD to be biased into its valley. In this case, the high voltage of the valley state biases the second FET driver to send sufficient input current to set the AND latch to the high-voltage state.</figDesc><graphic coords="4,317.28,150.78,216.72,67.56" type="bitmap" /></figure>
