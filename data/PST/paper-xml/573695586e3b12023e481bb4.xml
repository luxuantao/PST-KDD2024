<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Requirements engineering (RE) has attracted a great deal of attention from researchers and practitioners in recent years. Requirements engineering education (REE) is therefore an important undertaking if the field is to have professionals who are capable of successfully accomplishing software projects. This increasing interest demands that academia should provide software engineering students with a solid foundation in the subject matter. This paper aims to identify and to present the current research on REE that is available at present, and to select useful approaches and needs for future research. A systematic mapping study was therefore performed to classify the selected studies into five classification criteria: research type, empirical type, contribution type, RE activity, and curricula. A total of 79 papers were selected and classified according to these criteria. The results of this systematic mapping study are discussed, and a list of advice obtained from the REE literature for instructors is provided.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Education research is becoming increasingly important not only for educators but also for practitioners and researchers in the domain. Top software engineering journals publish papers on software engineering education. Important Software and Requirements engineering (RE) Conferences, such as the International Conference on Software Engineering and the International Conference on RE, include tracks or workshops on Software or requirements engineering education (REE), respectively.</p><p>RE is concerned with the real-world goals for functions (functional RE) and constraints (nonfunctional RE, e.g., constraints on quality and costs) on software systems. It is also concerned with the relationships that these factors have with precise specifications of software behavior and with their evolution over time and across software families <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. RE is a multidisciplinary activity that deploys a variety of techniques and tools at different stages of development and for different kinds of application domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Research endeavors in software development have found that the failures and deficiencies of software systems are often rooted in the requirements activities undertaken <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. One of the main causes of this is the lack of appropriate skills and knowledge of those engaged in RE activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The correct teaching of RE at university level has therefore become an important mission for the profession. This education should ideally be provided as an integrated part of developing the requisite of RE and software engineering technical skills, shortly before students become engineers and enter the workforce <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. There has thus been an increasing emphasis on incorporating RE into the university curricula of both undergraduate and postgraduate students in the past decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and a significant number of studies have been carried out in the area of REE <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>In order to present academics and practitioners with effective methodologies that can be adopted to provide high quality and relevant RE courses, a preliminary survey of REE was carried out beforehand <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The survey in question identified the contribution types of 31 articles, while the paper presented here provides a new and complete systematic mapping study. In addition to the formal protocol established by systematic mapping studies, the scope has been broadened, now including 79 papers in addition to new classification criteria, i.e., RE activities and RE curricula are now considered. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic mapping study has been published in the field of REE to date. A systematic mapping study <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> is a defined method with which a classification scheme can be built and a field of interest structured. It provides a structure of the type of research reports and results that have been published by categorizing them. In this paper, a systematic mapping study has been preformed, which has allowed us to summarize the approaches proposed for the development of the RE skills and to address REE deficiencies. This mapping study has additionally enabled us to discover which RE activities are most frequently addressed in the REE literature and whether the authors of the selected papers have based their solutions on model curricula. The primary studies were identified by using search strings in digital libraries.</p><p>The structure of this paper is as follows: Sect. 2 lists main RE curricula. Section 3 presents the research method of our study. Section 4 reports the results obtained from the systematic mapping study. Section 5 discusses the main findings of this mapping study, presents a list of hints for RE instructors, and outlines threats to validity. Finally, our conclusions and future work are shown in Sect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RE in model curricula, bodies of knowledge, and standards</head><p>This section presents an analysis of the current situation in REE, as regards the most important software engineering model curricula, bodies of knowledge (BoKs), and standards. Various organizations have made great efforts to identify RE knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Many curricula, BoKs, and standards, including RE content, have been provided to assist REE scholars to successfully undertake RE activities.</p><p>A BoK represents the complete set of concepts, terms, and activities that a professional domain institutes, while a model curriculum is a set of guidelines with which to address education issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. A standard is a technical specification that has been approved by a recognized standardization organization with the objective of achieving the optimum degree of order in a given context <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Some examples of the three categories are presented in the following subsections in order to provide an overview of the results presented in Sect. 4.8, although this is not an exhaustive description:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Model curricula</head><p>• The Joint IEEE/ACM Computing Curriculum-Software Engineering (CCSE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. This is a basic undergraduate curriculum in software engineering that contains a bibliography of information that every software engineer should know. One of the programs in this curriculum aims to help students understanding the process of determining client needs and translating them to software requirements. • The Joint IEEE/ACM Computing Curriculum-Computer Science (CCCS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. This curriculum contains undergraduate programs in each of the major computing disciplines. It highlights their commonalities and differences and describes the characteristics of graduates from each kind of undergraduate degree program. Some of the units in this curriculum address software requirements, specifications, and analysis. • ACM/AIS Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Information Systems (IS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>One of the learning objectives of this curriculum is to teach undergraduate students how to ''apply information requirements specification processes in the broader systems analysis &amp; design context'' and how to ''write clear and concise business requirements documents and convert them into technical specifications.'' • Graduate Software Engineering (GSwE2009)-Curriculum Guidelines for Graduate Degree Programs in Software Engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. This curriculum is the first product of Integrated Software &amp; Systems Engineering Curriculum (iSSEc) Project. It primarily addresses the education of students for a professional masters degree in software engineering. Among its guidelines is a Knowledge Area (KA) that focuses on the comprehension of software requirements fundamentals, requirements elicitation, requirements analysis, requirements specification, and requirements validation.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> has developed the model and architecture of the body of knowledge of REBOK and its proof of concept.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Body of knowledge</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Standards</head><p>• IEEE Std 1233-98 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> for system requirements specification. This standard was replaced by ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011, which provides additional guidance in the application of RE and requirements management processes. • IEEE Std 1465-98 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> is a guideline for quality requirements in software packages. • IEEE Std 830-98 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> is a guideline for the production and content of the software requirements specification. • ISO/IEC 25030:2007 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> is a guideline for software product quality requirements and evaluation. It applies the quality model defined in ISO/IEC 9126-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and it complies with the requirement processes defined in ISO/IEC 15288 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, which is a system engineering standard. • ISO/IEC TR 24766:2009 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> is a guideline or RE tool capabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Research methodology</head><p>According to Petersen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the main goal of a systematic mapping study is to provide an overview of a research area and identify the quantity and type of research and results available within it. A researcher often wishes to map the frequencies of publication over time to see trends.</p><p>A secondary goal may be to identify the fora in which research in the area has been published. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the mapping process, which covers the search for relevant publications, the definition of a classification scheme, and the mapping of publications. A mapping study differs from a systematic literature review <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, which aims to establish the state of evidence, focus on identifying best practices, and shows where particular evidence is missing or is insufficiently reported in existing studies. This is not the goal of a systematic mapping study, since the articles are not studied in sufficient detail. Its main focus is rather on classification, conducting a thematic analysis and identifying publication fora <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Research questions</head><p>The overall objective of our study is to gain insight into the solutions designed to address the problems in REE, such as the problems identified by Memon et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. In order to obtain a detailed view on this topic, the systematic mapping study addresses seven research questions (RQ). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> presents the seven RQs with their corresponding motivations. These questions will allow us to categorize the current research in REE and to identify future areas of research in the field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Search strategy</head><p>The articles were identified by consulting the following sources: IEEE Digital Library, ACM Digital Library, and Science Direct. Google Scholar was also used to seek gray literature in the field such as white papers and technical reports. The efficient use of Google Scholar to perform bibliometric studies has been demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The following search string was used in order to perform the automatic search in the digital libraries selected:</p><p>''Requirements'' AND (''Engineering'' OR ''Elicitation'' OR ''Specification'' OR ''Analysis'' OR ''Validation'' OR ''Process'') AND (''Educat*'' OR ''Train*'' OR ''Teach*'' OR ''Course'' OR ''Learn*'' OR ''Curricul*'' OR ''Guide'' OR ''Coach*'' OR ''Explain*''). Requirements Eng 123</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Study selection</head><p>The aim of the selection process was to identify the articles that are the most relevant to the objective of this mapping study. When the same paper appeared in more than one source, it was considered only once according to our search order. Each paper was retrieved by one author and evaluated by two authors, in order to decide whether if it should be included, by considering its title, abstract, and keywords. Articles that were judged differently were discussed by the two authors who carried out the evaluation of articles until an agreement was found. The remaining authors reviewed the final selection. The Cohen's Kappa coefficient was used to calculate the interrater agreement between the two authors in their evaluation. The Kappa coefficient was 0.95 which, according to Landis and Koch <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, indicates an almost perfect agreement between the two assessments.</p><p>The first step after the articles had been identified was to eliminate duplicate titles, and titles clearly not related to the review. The inclusion criteria were limited to the search string, and the studies that met at least one of the following exclusion criteria (EC) were excluded: EC1 Papers that are not focused on education. EC2 Papers presenting a general focus on software education. EC3 Papers about requirements for engineering education.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the search process result. 79 studies were selected of 1,359 identified studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Quality assessment</head><p>The quality assessment (QA) is usually carried out in systematic literature reviews and less in systematic mapping studies. However, in order to enhance our study, a questionnaire was designed to assess the quality of the papers selected. The QA was carried out by the two authors who retrieved the studies. The way in which this questionnaire was written was inspired by a previous mapping study <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>(a) The study provides a contribution toward how REE can be conducted. The possible answers were ''Yes (?1)'' and ''No (?0).'' (b) The study presents clear solutions to the problems in REE. The possible answers were ''Yes (?1),'' ''Partially (?0.5),'' and ''No (?0).'' (c) The study presents empirical results. The possible answers were: ''Yes (?1)'' and ''No (?0).'' (d) The study has been published in a recognized and stable publication source. This question was rated by considering the computer science conference rankings (CORE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> (A, B, and C), and the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) lists. The possible answers to this question were</p><p>• for conferences, workshops, and symposia:</p><p>• (?1.5) if it is ranked CORE A,</p><p>• (?1) if it is ranked CORE B,</p><p>• (?0.5) if it is ranked CORE C,</p><p>• (?0) If it is not in CORE ranking. • for journals:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">• (?2) if it is ranked Q1, • (?1.5) if it is ranked Q2, • (?1) if it is ranked Q3 or Q4</formula><p>• (?0) If it has no JCR ranking.</p><p>• for others; (?0).</p><p>The score for the quality criterion (d) refers to the fact that journals are more advantageous than conferences, workshops, and symposia because the authors believe that the possibility of publishing work in Q1 or Q2 journal may be more difficult than in other publication channels. The sum of the four closed-question scores for each study provided a final score (an integer between 0 and 5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Data extraction strategy and synthesis method</head><p>The data extraction strategy was based on providing the set of possible answers to research questions.</p><p>RQ1. To answer this question, publication source and channel for each paper should be identified. RQ2. To draw the publication trend, articles should be classified per publication year. RQ3. A research type can be classified into the following categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>:</p><p>• Evaluation Research: An evaluation or an investigation of REE approaches is conducted. This also includes the identification of problems in REE. • Solution Proposal: A solution to REE problems is proposed. This solution may be novel or a significant extension of an existing approach. The potential benefits and the applicability of the solution are shown with a small example or a good argumentation. • Experience Papers: These papers must express the author's personal experience and explain what has been done and how it was realized in practice. • Other: e.g., Theoretical papers, opinion papers, reviews.</p><p>RQ4. The empirical research type can be classified into <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>:</p><p>• Case study: An empirical inquiry that investigates a phenomenon within its real-life context. This term may refer to single or multiple case studies. • Survey: A method for collecting quantitative information concerning items in REE, e.g., a questionnaire. • Experiment: An empirical method applied under controlled conditions and using students as subjects in order to observe its effects on REE.</p><p>RQ5. An approach can be classified into the following categories as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</p><p>• Method: A means or manner of procedure and a series of steps taken to acquire knowledge in REE. • Tool: Anything used as a means to accomplish a task or purpose in REE. • Model: A representation of a system that allows for investigation of the properties of REE to be investigated. • Guideline: An indication of policy or procedure by which a course of action in REE can be determined. The synthesis method is based on counting the primary studies that are classified in each of the RQ responses, presenting a ranking of the primary studies based on their QA, and finally, presenting charts for the classification result. A variety of evaluation approaches have been used in the analysis of the results and a narrative summary with which to recount the principal findings of this systematic mapping study and describe them is presented in the discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>This section describes the results related to the systematic mapping questions presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. Some studies were chosen to illustrate examples of each RQ's result. We consider that they are relevant and make an important contribution to REE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Selection results</head><p>Of the 148 articles deeply investigated, 69 papers were discarded and 79 were finally selected. The 79 papers identified were analyzed in order to answer the RQs explained above. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref> presents the list of the selected papers with details of the overall classification results and their QA.  Regev et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> described their experience in teaching an RE course. The course used an active, affective, experiential pedagogy giving students the opportunity to experience a simulated work environment which demonstrates the social/design-problem complexities and richness of a development organization in the throws of creating a new product. Davis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[97]</ref> proposed an approach that was designed to facilitate life-long learning and stimulate the continuous improvement of RE practice. One of the most significant planned contributions of their project was the establishment of a test bed in order to integrate RE research and education which has a direct impact on practice. Hainey et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> evaluated a game to teach requirements collection and analysis in software engineering at tertiary education level. The results indicate that the game did not meet the expectations of Further Education (FE) learners (college level) to the same degree as the Higher Education (HE) learners (university level). The approach seems to be more suited to HE learners in terms of knowledge acquisition, aspects of the game, and perceptions as opposed to FE learners.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">RQ4. Are REE studies empirically validated?</head><p>The result for this question revealed that 34 % of the studies are not empirical studies because they do not provide any type of validation and do not present any proof of concept. About 52 % of the nonempirical studies identified in this paper suggest solutions with which to enhance REE without empirically validating the proposed approaches. Another 44 % of the nonempirical studies report their authors' experiences in teaching RE. A review <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[112]</ref> was also identified, which presents a comparison of practitioners' perspectives of the usefulness of the RE content knowledge included in higher education programs. In around 38 % of the selected papers, experiments were conducted with students in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the authors' approach in REE. 6 % of the papers reported case studies in industry, and 22 % reported the results of surveys.</p><p>Note that if the paper selected indicates that it contains a case study and the authors used students as subjects for their case study, then according to our classification criteria, it is classified as an experiment. All of these empirical studies were carried out by using previously trained students who had a high level of control as regards the study. The students first received lectures about an RE topic (for example, the tools and methodologies used to manage requirements) and then applied the knowledge and skills acquired to the design of a system or even the creation of a physical product in a laboratory environment. The investigations identified could be repeated under identical conditions. The studies therefore had execution control and ease of replication, which are the research strategy factors of an experiment, not a case study. According to Wohlin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[113]</ref>, ''the difference between case studies and experiments is that experiments sample over variables that are being manipulated, while case studies sample from the variables representing the typical situation.'' In our opinion, a case study that is carried out with students in the environments described does not represent a typical situation that is suitable for the industrial evaluation of RE methods and tools because the students are manipulated by the researchers to act in a defined scenario.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows that around the half of the solution proposals and experience papers were empirically validated through experiments. It also shows that in order to evaluate an existing approach, authors mainly use   <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[114]</ref>. The results showed that when students learn about security Requirements Engineering using SQUARE, they have a better understanding of what is needed to produce more secure software. Svahnberg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref> investigated students' abilities to understand and assess multiple perspective (basic skills, state of practice, and state of the art) involvement in the requirements selection process. The authors performed a survey in relation to requirements selection as part of an Advanced Course on Requirements Engineering at Blekinge Institute of Technology. The results indicated that students have a good understanding of the way industry acts in the context of requirements selection and that students may work well as subjects in empirical studies in this area. Memon et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> attempted to assess the status of REE courses offered in major public universities in Malaysia. The aim of their paper was to discover out the problems that students confront on an RE course and compare them with those presented in the REE literature. The survey results confirmed many of the problems presented in the literature but also explored insights that may encourage researchers to be aware of the limitations of the way in which RE courses are commonly conducted. 4.6 RQ5. What are the approaches that were reported in REE research that address REE problems?</p><p>The majority of all research type approaches describe methods. About 20 % of REE approaches describe tools and 16 % describe models. Guidelines (6 %) and frameworks (5 %) are also proposed as solutions to REE problems. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows that the majority of authors report </p><note type="other">Requirements Eng 123</note><p>their experience in delivering REE course methods. With regard to proposing solutions, the authors' tend to propose both methods and tools. Models were almost equally reported in solution proposals, in experience papers and in evaluation research. The framework approach (in this context 'framework' is considered to be a structure that forms a frame for REE) is mainly reported as an REE proposed solution, while the guideline approach is reported as the authors' approach experience. Some of the REE approaches reported in the selected papers are listed below. Callele and Makaroff <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> presented a second-year computer science course designed to simulate appreciation for the need for RE and to provide students with an opportunity to engage in RE activity. Damien et al. <ref type="bibr">[62]</ref> described a course that was taught in collaboration between three universities in different locations, time zones, and culture: Canada, Australia, and Italy. The students from the three locations played the roles of a client and developer and experienced the iterative development of requirements specification in global projects. Smith and Gotel <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> designed the RE-O-Poly game to explain and explore good RE practices. Since requirements are often conflicting, players have to learn to resolve conflicts and determine priorities in the game. Zowghi and Paryani <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> used role playing as a pedagogical tool to provide their students with a fuller appreciation of the range of both technical and nontechnical issues involved in RE practices. Knauss et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[101]</ref> presented a Web-based simulation game, which was easy to understand and fun to play within just a few minutes in order to take RE more seriously. The Software Quantum game helps students to understand one of the principal challenges of RE which is to build the right system within the available time. Barnes, Gause, and Way [59] described sample techniques for the teaching of the unknown (e.g., recommendations about requirements for disaster recovery) and unknowable (e.g., requirements to predict future trends) in RE for systems design and presented their experiences in teaching as part of requirements analysis in an engineering systems design class. Armarego <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> presented an approach based on problem-based learning (PBL) which attempts to provide students with a solid foundation in the subject matter while simultaneously exposing them to real-world characteristics. It provides students with a process to deal with problems within a metacognitive-rich framework that makes complexity apparent and allows students deal with it in an adaptive manner. 4.7 RQ6. What are the RE activities that were addressed in the REE literature? About 52 % of the selected papers present approaches for requirements processes, and 27 % of the selected papers did not specify any RE activity and were therefore classified under Requirements Engineering. Requirements elicitation was reported in 11 % of the selected papers, 9 % discussed requirements analysis, and only one paper discussed requirements specification, while no requirements validation were identified. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>, the answers for RQ3, RQ4, and RQ5 were combined in order to establish a mapping with the aim of providing an overview of RE activities. This mapping has allowed us to obtain more information on how the results from each RQ are related to the others. The diagram presents the research facet related to RE activity, distributed over approaches and research types. This figure allows us to conclude that only one tool was proposed as a solution for requirements specification that authors mainly report their experience in teaching requirements processes and that the majority of the solution proposals concern requirements processes. In addition, most of the REE tools are designed for requirements elicitation activities. Further information regarding the relationship between the three facets is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>. </p></div>

About 59 % of the selected papers had an above average score, and 13 % had an average score, while 28 % were below average.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion and implication</head><p>This section summarizes and discusses the results related to the systematic mapping study. Advice for instructors is also proposed in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Principal findings</head><p>The goal of this systematic mapping study was to examine the current knowledge in REE by selecting 79 papers from a total of 148. They were then classified according to five Requirements Eng criteria: research type, empirical type, approach type, RE activity, and RE model curricula. The principal findings of our study are the following:</p><p>• The REE research area has gained increasing attention since 2004, and 2005 marked the shift in the REE publication trend as it was the year in which an International Workshop on REET began. About 46 % of the selected papers were published in workshops, while only 9 % had reached the maturity of a journal publication. However, upon taking into consideration, the yearly Chaos Report series conducted by the Standish Group <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and the studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">115,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">116]</ref> that demonstrate the criticality of RE with regard to the success of SE projects, we believe that REE will probably gain much more attention in the future. • About 77 % of the selected papers reported solutions to REE. This result shows that the REE field has not yet attained sufficient maturity for evaluation and that the main concern for REE researchers is to propose approaches with which to enhance REE. This is also shown by the fact that experience papers reporting the authors' teaching experience and solution proposals were the most common research types found in the literature. The objective of the solutions identified in this study is principally to address students' lack of awareness of RE principles and practices in the development of software projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">50]</ref> and their lack of interest in RE courses <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">101]</ref>. • The most frequently reported approaches in the selected papers were methods which were mainly reported as RE courses. Some authors shared their teaching experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr">70,</ref><ref type="bibr">76]</ref> or their course designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">103]</ref> in order to present solutions to REE. Other authors preferred to evaluate the efficiency of the existing training and teaching programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">46]</ref> and their impact on REE improvement. Another approach category that has received attention was that of tools. Authors proposed games as teaching tools because games are fun and engaging and provide friendly competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr">80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">106]</ref>. Many of the approaches identified were suggested to enhance REE and to replace traditional RE course teaching methods, such as the use of simulated project examples that do not provide the students with a realistic experience of client-developer interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>.  Requirements Eng</p><p>• In 38 % of the selected papers, the authors conducted experiences, and in only 6 % of the selected articles did they include industrial case studies in their research. In RE, a case study is an observational study which usually aims to track a specific attribute or identify relationships between different attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[113]</ref>. The reduced number of studies identified in this category can be justified by the amount of people involved and the inherent difficulty of finding industrial projects. What is more, in 22 % of the selected papers, the authors used surveys to collect quantitative information about REE approaches. About 73 % of the selected papers were empirical studies and 58 % of these empirical studies used students as subjects. A common criticism of controlled experiments in which students are used as subjects is their external validity, and it is therefore difficult to generalize the results to industrial settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[117]</ref>. However, the study by Svahnberg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref> shows that in certain circumstances, it may be possible to use students as subjects for empirical studies and to influence them to provide answers that are in line with industrial practice. • Around the half of the selected papers presented approaches for requirements processes. About 11 % discussed requirements elicitation, 9 % requirements analysis, and only one paper discussed requirements specification. No study for requirements validation was reported. Researchers mainly propose approaches with which to address the teaching of requirements process that involves the general aspects of RE. More research is needed to address the broad teaching of each RE activity, and more attention should be paid to requirements validation. • The main RE sources identified that inspired authors were SWEBOK, CCSE, and IEEE std 830. However, only a quarter of the selected studies took into consideration the well-known RE model curricula, BoKs, and standards in the design of their REE approaches. This result shows that the remaining approaches do not conform to curricula, BoKs, or standards. • About 24 % of the courses reported in the selected papers were designed for undergraduate students, and around 16 % were designed for professional engineers, while only 9 % could be carried out with both undergraduate and post graduate students. More research is therefore needed to assess new teaching methods and tools in postgraduate courses which requires the acquisition of a more specialized knowledge of the RE discipline. • The main audience interested in this systematic mapping study could be instructors in the field of REE, since the majority of the REE literature is written by teachers and instructors. To support this statement, two points were investigated: the affiliation of the authors and the publication source. About 84 % of the papers selected were written by instructors from universities, while 10 % were written by professionals who are mainly consultants, and 6 % were written jointly between instructors and professionals. Only a few practitioners therefore appear to be interested in REE. Also, as it was mentioned in the RQ1 result, around 46 % of the selected papers appeared in REE-related workshops and 39 % in conferences, which are mainly held for instructors in order to give them the opportunity to share their knowledge and experiences. Observe that no paper was found in IEEE Transactions on Education journal, which is one of the most important journals related to education and computer science.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Implications and advice for instructors</head><p>The findings of our systematic mapping study have implications for instructors who are working in REE, since this study will allow them to discover the existing approaches in the literature concerning REE and to exploit combined approaches in REE. Moreover, the empirical studies presented can provide an overview of the efficiency of each approach. In order to improve the quality of RE courses, instructors could take into consideration some advice. These pieces of advice are addressed toward instructors since they are probably the main audience interested in this systematic mapping study, as has been demonstrated in the previous section. The studies cited in this section were chosen by considering their content. First, those papers in the mapping study that provided any kind of practical guidance for REE were classified among those found in the ''Study selection'' phase, by reading their abstracts. Second, one author carried out an in-depth review of previously selected papers in order to make recommendations for the teaching of RE. No predefined templates or guidelines were used in this screening process. During this process, important problems in RE training and discussions addressing key issues in RE were searched for. Recommendations were extracted from the papers as provided by the authors, and their original purpose and meaning were maintained.</p><p>According to the literature reviewed <ref type="bibr">[16, 31, 39-41, 45, 101]</ref>, various issues have been identified to be considered in this section. Other sources have also been identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[118]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[119]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[120]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[121]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[122]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[123]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[124]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[125]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[126]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[127]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[128]</ref>, which are not necessarily REE focused, but are related to these issues; in that, they provide interesting complementary information regarding the following recommendations:</p><p>Requirements Eng</p><p>• Teach how to define scope of the problem and avoid general and vague specifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. In order to address this issue, instructors can take into account the different personalities of students when teaching an RE course. Instructors can ask the students to answer a questionnaire in order to discover their personality traits. The results of this questionnaire will allow the instructors to form teams which exhibit a better performance. Previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[119]</ref> show a significant positive correlation between the personality factor extraversion and software product quality, including satisfied requirements. • Show how to select and use an RE tool. More than 100 RE tools can be found on the market <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[120]</ref>. Students should be aware of the features that the current RE tools provide and should be taught how to select the best tool for a project, according to its needs: requirements elicitation, requirements analysis, requirements specification, requirements verification and validation, and requirements management. • Promote activities in requirements analysis and modeling in addition to requirements management and introduce the concept of prototyping in the course.</p><p>Prototyping is an important technique in the RE phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[121]</ref>. Through prototyping, an executable model of the software product can be achieved before the final product has been created <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[122]</ref>. Moreover, prototypes presented to stakeholders are very effective in ensuring valid requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[123]</ref>. A part of the course could be devoted to prototyping the system described in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and the enterprise models. Students should rewrite the SRS and submit an executive summary, including features such as Return On Investment (ROI) in a nontechnical language <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. The difficulties involved in learning these issues on RE courses have been identified in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. • Involve students in industrial projects in order to allow them to acquire sufficient knowledge and practice, especially on postgraduate courses. Instructors could also invite industry practitioners to present real projects and to describe their accumulated industrial experience. The difficulties involved in how to apply RE knowledge in the real world have been reported in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">118]</ref>. By providing the student with an accurate view of reality and the adequate tools, instructors can offer them the opportunity to attain a critical mindset in order to deal with RE in practice. • Have the ability, skills, and strategies needed to align RE courses with contemporary global software development (GSD) conditions. REE must adapt to meet the changing demands in the global development environment. Instructors can refer to the experience by Damien et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[124]</ref> in designing and evaluating a framework to teach GSD courses and to extract ideas that can be implemented in RE courses. • Familiarize students with approaches to problem solving, development methodologies, and development tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Instructors can improve their courses by using some of the solutions proposed in Sect. 4.6. RE courses are often given in a traditional lecture/exercise format <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. It often occurs that students do not place importance on RE activities and do not see their impact on the success or failure of projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[101]</ref>. Instructors are encouraged to include alternatives approaches in the curricula. Some studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">101,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">125]</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[126]</ref>. Instructors can deliver their courses in an interactive classroom: The students can share a virtual whiteboard, electronic textbook, and data over a networked environment to actively participate in the course discussions <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[127]</ref>. These devices will encourage students to share their knowledge, and students will be far more active than on traditional courses. We propose that instructors refer to the experience of Yau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[128]</ref> in order to adopt the concept of a smart classroom which facilitates collaborative learning among students and can be adapted to REE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Threats to validity</head><p>Four kinds of threats to validity are discussed below.</p><p>• Construct validity: Construct threats to validity in a mapping study are related to the identification of primary studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[129,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">130]</ref>. In order to ensure that as many relevant primary studies as possible were being included, two authors identified and proposed potential search keywords in several iterations. Seven terms related to RE and nine terms related to education were used in the search string. However, the list might not have been complete, and additional or alternative terms might have altered the final list of papers found <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[131]</ref>.</p><p>The search was performed by using IEEE Digital Library, ACM Digital Library, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. According to the statistics of literature search engines <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[132]</ref>, we believe that most of the research on RE can be found in these electronic Requirements Eng libraries. To decrease the risk of missing related and important publications, the authors also sought related papers in major RE research venues (e.g., REJ, ER, REFSQ, ICSE, TSE). We believe that the inclusion of publication sources that are not top journals and conferences in the review might decrease the quality standards of the primary studies, but it signifies that the representativeness of the primary studies is increased. In particular, the REET workshop is an essential venue when undertaking a study on REE, in spite of its reducing the mean score for primary studies in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref> (2.94 out of 5). Moreover, certain papers may have been overlooked as the result of the subscription limitations of our university library, as was the case of two conference papers found in the IEEE Digital Library. This problem was overcome by asking the authors of the papers to provide us with a copy of their published articles. Another threat concerns the potential mishandling of duplications, which might have slightly altered our results. Two cases of possible duplication were detected, which were examined exhaustively to discover whether or not they were the same study.</p><p>Although certain content elements were common to different papers, these papers are based on innovative ideas or new studies. The final decision to select a study depended on the two authors who conducted the search process. If a disagreement arose between them, then a discussion took place until an agreement was reached. Finally, note that although the same papers were not found in a replication of this secondary study (which is only possible in a relatively narrow area with experts in the area conducting the study), the same general conclusions may be drawn <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[133]</ref>. • Internal validity: Internal validity deals with extraction and data analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[129,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">130]</ref>. Two authors carried out the data extraction and classification of the primary studies, while the other two authors reviewed the final results.</p><p>The decision as to which data to collect and how to classify the papers therefore depended on the judgement of the two authors conducting the systematic mapping study. These authors who were from different culture and research groups carried out two different classifications for reliability purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[134]</ref>. The Kappa coefficient was 0.95, reflecting a high level of agreement between the authors, which indicates a similar understanding of relevance, thus reducing this threat significantly. The authors were in different time zones and communicated with each other using videoconferencing via Skype, and therefore needed to agree on a timetable for their meetings to avoid them becoming tired-a situation that is identified as a threat in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[135]</ref>. Data extraction from prose could also result in a misclassification, but this problem was addressed by developing a classification scheme on the basis of widely accepted guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and terminology proposed for use in RE <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[136]</ref>. This would, therefore, only have a minor influence on the general classification derived in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Conclusion validity:</head><p>The threat to conclusion validity is concerned with the identification of incorrect relationships which may lead to incorrect conclusions. In the case of a mapping study, this threat refers to factors such as missing studies and incorrect data extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[130]</ref>.</p><p>The aim is to control these factors so that a systematic mapping study can be performed by other researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[129,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">131,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">137]</ref> who will draw the same conclusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[134]</ref>. Bias both as regards selecting and classifying primary studies and analyzing data may therefore affect the interpretation of the results. In order to mitigate this threat, every step performed in the selection and data extraction activity was clearly described as discussed in the previous paragraphs.</p><p>The traceability between the data extracted and the conclusions was strengthened through the direct generation of bubble plots and frequency plots from the data by using a statistical package. In our opinion, slight differences based on publication selection bias and misclassification would not alter the main conclusions drawn from the 79 articles identified in our mapping study. • External validity: External validity is concerned with the generalization of this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[113,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">137,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">138]</ref>. The systematic mapping results were considered with regard to the RE domain, and the validity of the conclusions drawn in this paper concerns only the REE context. Since no time restriction was introduced in the search for published studies, the representativeness of the selected studies was not affected. This threat is not therefore present in this context. The search string and the classification scheme presented in this paper may serve as a starting point for RE researchers, and practitioners can search for and categorize additional papers accordingly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions and future work</head><p>This paper has presented a systematic mapping study that summarizes the existing research in REE. Of 1359 studies, 148 papers were identified between 1995 and 2012, 79 of which were selected and classified according to five criteria: research type, empirical type, approach type, RE activity, and RE model curricula. Publication source and trend were also identified. The results obtained showed that an increasing amount of attention has been paid to REE since 2004. Around half of the selected papers appeared in workshops, and only a few papers had reached the maturity of a journal publication. The two main research types found were experience papers and solution proposals. The majority of the selected papers were empirical studies. Many papers proposed solutions to address the education of RE, and the main contribution types were methods. The RE process is the most frequently addressed RE activity in the literature, and few authors take into consideration model curricula, bodies of knowledge or standards in the design of their REE approaches.</p><p>This research could be a starting point to investigate better ways in which to give RE courses in the future. Furthermore, the REE approaches presented in this study may help instructors to identify approaches that can be adopted in order to improve the quality of their courses. For future research on REE, greater presence in journals should be considered and more attention should be paid to the teaching of each RE activity, particularly requirements specification and validation. More evaluation research should be carried out in order to evaluate existing REE approaches. Moreover, it is advised that future proposed approaches should conform to the existing model curricula, BoKs, or standards.</p><p>Ongoing research is based on performing a systematic literature review to assess the research on REE by taking into consideration the results found in this systematic mapping study and performing a joint experiment between the University of Murcia and the University of Mohammed V Souissi in Rabat in order to study the RE in GSD.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1Systematic mapping process<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> </figDesc><graphic coords="3,204.23,607.60,340.32,106.32" type="bitmap" /></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_3"><head>Table 3</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Workshops and especially REET workshop impacted the trend of REE publications per year. The REET workshop started in 2005. The next editions of this workshop were held yearly after 2007, which explains the drop in publications on 2006. The spike of other sources on 2008 is explained by the fact that on this year, 4 articles were presented in the IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference. The reader will also notice that in 1996, 1998, and 2001, no articles were published. That could be explained by the fact that REE gained interest on the beginning of the last decades after the publication of software engineering BoK and RE standards. The decrease in 2012 may be explained by the point in time at which this mapping study was performed and probably does not reflect the real number of articles in 2012. 4.4 RQ3. What are the research types of REE studies? Four research types were identified in this systematic mapping study. Evaluation research (17 articles), solution proposal (31 papers), experience paper (30 papers), and one review. Theoretical papers or opinion papers were not found in the REE literature. Around 77 % of the selected papers (solution proposal and experience paper) therefore present a solution to an REE problem, while 22 % evaluate REE approaches, and one paper reviews the methods reported in the REE literature. Examples of research types are presented in the following paragraph.</figDesc><table /><note><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>lists all the sources, the different publication channels, and the number of articles per publication source.
