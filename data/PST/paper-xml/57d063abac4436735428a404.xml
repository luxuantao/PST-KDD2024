<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The proliferating wireless infrastructures with complementary characteristics prompt the bandwidth aggregation for concurrent video transmission in heterogeneous access networks. Multipath TCP (MPTCP) is an important transport-layer protocol recommended by IETF to integrate different access medium (e.g., Cellular and Wi-Fi). This paper investigates the problem of mobile video delivery using MPTCP in heterogeneous wireless networks with multihomed terminals. To achieve the optimal quality of real-time video streaming, we have to seriously consider the path asymmetry in different access networks and the disadvantages of the data retransmission mechanism in MPTCP. Motivated by addressing these critical issues, this study presents a novel quAlity-Driven MultIpath TCP (ADMIT) scheme that integrates the utility maximization based Forward Error Correction (FEC) coding and rate allocation. We develop an analytical framework to model the MPTCP-based video delivery quality over multiple communication paths. ADMIT is able to effectively integrate the most reliable access networks with FEC coding to minimize the end-to-end video distortion. The performance of ADMIT is evaluated through extensive semi-physical emulations in Exata involving H.264 video streaming. Experimental results show that ADMIT outperforms the reference transport protocols in terms of video PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), end-to-end delay and goodput. Thus, we recommend ADMIT for streaming high-quality mobile video in heterogeneous wireless networks with multihomed terminals.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Recent advancements in the network infrastructures and communication technologies of wireless systems provide ubiquitous access options for mobile users (e.g., LTE, Wi-Fi, HSDPA, 3G, etc.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. As these different wireless networks have complementary characteristics, it is desirable for the individual mobiles to establish multiple simultaneous associations to improve data throughput and transmission reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. With the prevalence of multihomed terminals (e.g., the Samsung S5 smart cell phones [7] and Mushroom products <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>), the future wireless environment is envisioned to be a converged system that incorporates heterogeneous access networks for providing high-quality mobile services. Therefore, new research trends <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[11]</ref> have moved towards integrating the heterogeneous access networks with Multipath TCP (MPTCP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref>, which is the transport-layer protocol recommended by IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) to enable parallel data transfer (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>Prompted by the radical evolutions in wireless infrastructures, mobile video streaming has already become the most popular applications over the past few years. The latest market research conducted by Cisco company indicates video traffic accounts for 55% of the total mobile data usage over the Internet in 2014 and will reach 72% by the year 2019 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[13]</ref>.</p><p>sions. However, this error control mechanism ignores the delay constraint imposed by real-time video applications. The overdue packets cannot contribute to the decoding process even if they are successfully retransmitted.</p><p>2) Congestion control. The congestion window sizes in MPTCP are adapted in a additively increased and multiplicatively decreased fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[10]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref>. Such congestion control strategy results in the frequent throughput fluctuations and significantly increases the end-to-end delay. 3) Path asymmetry. Different physical properties result in the path asymmetry of heterogeneous wireless networks. Involving an asymmetry communication path in multipath video communication may degrade the overall streaming quality. To address these critical issues, this study presents a quAlity-Driven MultIpath TCP (ADMIT) to enable smooth live video streaming with following solutions: 1) employs the Forward Error Correction (FEC) coding to remedy the shortcoming of packet retransmission for protecting video data within stringent delay constraint (Section 4.1); 2) analyzes the MPTCP connection state to mitigate throughput fluctuations (Section 3.2); 3) delivers video streaming over the communication paths with regard to the reliability (Section 4.2).</p><p>Compared with the existing studies in MPTCP <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[11]</ref>, we advance the state of the art by introducing a quality-driven optimization framework into the decision process of multipath data transfer. This framework comprehensively analyzes the video quality characteristics, end-to-end connection delay, and time-varying wireless channel status. We analytically formulate the constrained optimization problem of joint FEC coding and rate allocation to minimize the end-to-end video distortion. Then, we present a utility maximization framework for online adaption of FEC coding parameters and flow rate allocation. ADMIT is able to effectively integrate the most reliable wireless access networks with FEC coding to maximize the video quality. The detailed descriptions of the proposed ADMIT will be presented in Section 4.</p><p>In particular, the contributions of this study are three-fold.</p><p>• Develop an analytical framework to model the end-toend distortion of real-time video communication with MPTCP over multiple wireless access networks. • Propose a MPTCP scheme dubbed ADMIT that effectively integrates the following components 1) A reliability-aware flow rate allocation algorithm to dynamically select appropriate access networks to maximize the video quality. 2) A utility-maximization based FEC coding scheme to strike the balance between delay and loss performance to minimize the effective packet loss rate.</p><p>• Perform extensive semi-physical emulations over the Exata platform involving H.264 video streaming. Evaluation results demonstrate that: 1) ADMIT improves the average video PSNR by up to 5.8 (18.2%), 7.6 (23.3%), 9.7 (31.7%), and 12.1 (37.5%) dB compared to the GreenBag <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[25]</ref>, FMTCP <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[21]</ref>, MPLOT <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[26]</ref>, and MPTCP <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref>. 2) ADMIT reduces the average end-to-end delay by up to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">22</ref> ) Mbps compared to the GreenBag, FMTCP, MPLOT and MPTCP, respectively. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the related work to this paper. In Section 3, we present the system model and problem formulation. Section 4 introduces the solution procedure of the proposed ADMIT in detail. The performance evaluation is provided in Section 5 and Section 6 gives the concluding remarks of this work.</p></div>

The goal of this system is to maximize the video encoding bit rate on the basis of aggregate bandwidth, as well as overcoming the channel loss. In literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[27]</ref>, the authors propose a sub-frame level (SFL) scheduling approach, which splits large-size video frames to optimize the delay performance of HD video streaming over heterogeneous wireless networks. Song et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[28]</ref> present a Probabilistic Multipath Transmission (PMT) scheme, which sends video traffic bursts over multiple available paths based on a probability generation function of packet delay.

In <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the authors propose a Distortion-Aware Concurrent Multipath Transfer scheme (CMT-DA) to minimize the end-to-end video distortion in mobile video delivery over heterogeneous wireless networks. However, CMT-DA still provides data protection with retransmissions and is not appropriate for delay-constrained video applications. Bui et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[25]</ref> propose the GreenBag that includes the load balancing, segment management and energy-aware mode control to deliver mobile video over heterogeneous wireless networks. Xu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> propose a Quality-Aware Adaptive Concurrent Multipath Transfer (CMT-QA) scheme that includes the components of data distribution, path quality estimation and optimal retransmission.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">MPTCP Solutions</head><p>Bonaventure et al. generally review the recent studies on MPTCP in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[31]</ref>. The Request For Comments (R-FC) of IETF to describe MPTCP is presented in reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[32]</ref>. The Fountain Code-based Multipath TCP (FMTCP) proposed by Cui et al. in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[21]</ref> leverages the random nature fountain coding to overcome channel erasures and path heterogeneity in multipath data transfer. However, the video quality is not considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[21]</ref> and this metric is significantly different from the network-level parameters (e.g., throughput, delay, packet loss rate, etc.). Furthermore, the block size of fountain code is too large, and thus is not effective for real-time video applications with stringent delay constraint. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[33]</ref> propose the SC-MPTCP scheme that introduces the linear systematic coding into MPTCP. SC-MPTCP addresses the problem of tolerating the path heterogeneity under receiver buffer limitation. The redundancy is provisioned into both proactive and reactive data.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">System Overview</head><p>The system overview of the proposed ADMIT framework is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. ADMIT is special version of MPTCP designed for streaming real-time high-quality video traffic. We consider the end-to-end transmission of a single video flow using the MPTCP connection over heterogeneous wireless access networks. The goal of the proposed ADMIT is to achieve the optimal-quality video streaming by adapting the FEC coding parameters and assigning the video transmission rate. The input video flow is divided into multiple subflows onto the available access networks. Each sub-flow is composed of several segments. In this study, we use the following two default settings of MPTCP.</p><p>Setting 1 (Full-MPTCP mode). Under the full-MPTCP mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[35]</ref>, the traffic data can be concurrently transmitted through all the available communication paths.</p><p>Setting 2 (Coupled congestion control). This congestion control algorithm (linked increase algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref>) couples the increases in congestion windows and decreases the window sizes by half (i.e., the multiplicative decrease pattern in TCP) should packet loss occurs.</p><p>The working components in the system design of ADMIT are implemented at both sender and receiver sides. The sender blocks include the parameter control unit, FEC coder, rate allocator, and data transmitter. In particular, the FEC redundancy (Algorithm 1) and packet size (Algorithm 2) adjustment algorithms are implemented at the FEC coder. The flow rate allocation algorithm (Algorithm 3) is implemented at the rate allocator. The input parameters for the FEC coder include the communication path status (RT T p , μ p , π B p ), delay constraint T, and FEC adaptation step size ΔΘ, ΔS (for redundancy and packet size). The parameters passed onto the Rate allocator include the communication path status (RT T p , μ p , π B p ), delay constraint T, and threshold limit value (TLV). The role of the Parameter Control Unit is to collect the control parameters (delay constraint T, FEC adaption parameter), communication path status (round trip time, packet loss rate and available bandwidth) and output the decision parameters for the scheduling algorithms 1-3. The data transmitter is responsible for assigning the FEC packets onto different communication paths according to the rate allocation vector. This process can be implemented by the packet scheduling function in MPTCP <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref>, which associates segments sent on different sub-flows. For each decision epoch, the video frames are coded into the FEC packets and dispatched onto different communication paths at the data transmitter.</p><p>At the receiver side, the information feedback unit is responsible for periodically sending back the channel status information (round trip time, available bandwidth and packet loss rate), which is involved in the scheduling algorithms at the sender side. ADMIT employs the same connection and sub-flow level acknowledgements (ACKs) mechanisms specified in the baseline MPTCP <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref>. Due to the path asymmetry in heterogeneous wireless networks, the packets may arrive at the destination out-of-order. These packets will be reordered by the Data Flow Reassemble block (i.e., the MPTCP reordering buffer) to reconstruct the original video traffic for the decoding process. To ensure the in-order data delivery, the arrival packets are temporarily stored in a connection-level receive buffer until being read by the video application. A larger receive buffer can tolerate higher level of packet reordering and the size should be able to store all data until the missing segment is successfully retransmitted <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref>. The basic frame-copy error concealment is implemented at the application layer of the receiver side to mitigate the playback disruptions.  The optimization problem of joint FEC coding adaption and multipath rate allocation involves the models of wireless access network <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, video quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[36]</ref>, FEC coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[37]</ref>, and end-to-end connection delay <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[20]</ref>. The aggregate throughput of a MPTCP connection is impacted by the end-toend connection states of the available communication paths. For instance, if there is bandwidth shrink/packet losses on one communication path, the throughput fluctuations can be mitigated by assigning more traffic loads to another path with better quality. Thus, analyzing the connection state is important in the FEC coding adaption and flow rate allocation. For the sake of completeness and integration with the system framework, these models are also presented in this section. The basic notations used throughout this paper are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">2</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Wireless Access Network Model</head><p>We consider a heterogeneous wireless environment integrating P access networks between communication terminals. The wireless access networks represent the communication paths in MPTCP, which include wired and wireless domains. Each communication path p ∈ P is an independent transport link and characterized with the following properties. Property 1 (Round trip time RT T p ). The elapsed time for a packet to be delivered to the destination plus the delay it takes for an acknowledgment of that packet to be received. Therefore, RT T p consists of the packet transmission time and path propagation delay.</p><p>Property 2 (Packet loss rate π B p ). The average percentage of data packets failed to arrive at the destination while travelling across the communication paths. These packet drops can be caused by the network congestion, wireless channel fading, external interference, etc. Property 3 (Available bandwidth μ p ). The maximum transmission rate that the end-to-end communication path can provide to the video flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref>. In HTTP/TCP video streaming systems, the available bandwidth can be estimated according to the observed TCP throughput. In this work, we use the confidence intervals (with the sample size of 5) to combine the historical estimated values <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>The above channel status information can be periodically estimated using end-to-end network measurement techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref>. In this work, we employ the multipath status estimation model developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to accurately sense the path quality. We model the burst packet losses over endto-end communication path as a continuous time stochastic process based on the Gilbert loss model <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39]</ref>. The state X p (t) of path p at time t assumes one of two values: G (Good) or B (Bad). We assume the packet loss rate to be zero in the 'Good' state <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[40]</ref>. If a packet is sent at time t with X p (t) = G, then the packet can be successful delivered. Otherwise, when X p (t) = B, then the packet is lost. We use the notations π G p and π B p to denote the stationary probabilities that the communication path is good or bad. Let ξ B p and ξ G p represent the transition probability from G to B and B to G, respectively. In this work, we adopt two systemdependent parameters to specify the continuous time Markov chain packet loss model: (1) the average loss rate π B p , and (2) the average loss burst length 1/ξ G p . Then, we can have</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">π B p = ξ B p /(ξ B p + ξ G p ) and π G p = ξ G p /(ξ B p + ξ G p )</formula><p>. Remark: An important problem in FEC coding redundancy adaption is to distinguish the congestion losses from random losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[41]</ref>. In the congested network status, the available bandwidth will shrink and more data packets encounter channel losses. If we try to add more FEC redundant packets, it will increase the network congestion level and cause further packet losses. This vicious congestion circle is already observed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[41]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[42]</ref>. In the literatures, many schemes have been proposed for the packet loss differentiation. For instance, the TCP Veno <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[43]</ref> identifies the congestion losses by estimating the backlogged packets at bottleneck link. In this study, we employ the ZigZag scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[44]</ref> for the end-to-end packet loss differentiation based on the number of consecutive losses (m p ), average RT T p (RT T p ) and the standard deviation (σ RT Tp ). The ZigZag scheme is selected with regard to the fairness in bandwidth sharing, TCP-friendliness, and low misclassification rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[44]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Video Quality Model</head><p>To characterize the real-time streaming video quality, we employ a generic end-to-end video distortion model developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[36]</ref>. The user-perceived quality in video streaming environment is impacted by the the end-to-end distortion (D). Specifically, D is the sum of two major categories of distortion: source distortion (D src ) and channel distortion (D chl ), i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D = D src + D chl .</formula><p>(</p><p>Specifically, the source distortion is mostly driven by the video content characteristics and encoding parameters. These parameters largely impact the efficiency of video codec (e.g., the larger distortion will be induced for a more complex video sequence under the same video encoding rate). As the source coding parameters are out of the control scope of ADMIT, we focus on the channel distortion, which is caused by the effective packet loss rate (Π) defined as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 1 (Effective packet loss rate Π). The ratio of lost video data after the FEC recovery process. This loss probability includes both the channel errors/losses and expired packet arrivals.</head><p>D chl is roughly proportional to the number of video frames that cannot be decoded. In particular, the end-to-end distortion can be expressed (in units of Mean Squared Error, MSE) with the following equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[36]</ref>[45]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">D = α R -R 0 Dsrc + β • Π D chl , (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>in which R denotes the video encoding rate and α, R 0 , β are parameters depending on specific video codec and sequence. These parameters can be online estimated by using trial encodings at the sender side <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>[45]. To allow fast adaptation of the transmission scheduling to abrupt changes in the video content, these parameters can be updated for each group of pictures (GoP).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Systematic FEC Model</head><p>We use the systematic Reed-Solomon (RS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[37]</ref> code for video data protection against wireless channel losses. The main motivation to choose the RS code over the popular fountain code is the stringent delay constraint. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, a FEC block of n data packets contains k source packets and (nk) redundant packets. The receiver is able to reconstruct all the k source packets if any k packets of the FEC block are correctly received. In the FEC(n, k) coding, (nk) redundant data packets are introduced for every k source packets to make up a codeword. If the number of received packet is less than k, the received packets can still be used for the decoding process due to the systematic nature of the FEC code. In this work, we implement the GoP-level FEC coding for the data protection. In each FEC coding phase, the video frames in each GoP are made into k source packets. For the last source packet, some zero bytes are often padded to keep the same size with other packets. The FEC packet size (S) also affects the tradeoff between loss recoverability and end-to-end delay in the presence of burst losses. With a smaller FEC packet size, the value of n (FEC block size) will become larger and there is higher possibility for the receiver to recover the lost packets. However, a larger FEC block size also delays the FEC decoding because: 1) more FEC packets will result in higher protocol overhead and this induces larger end-to-end delay; 2) the probability of packet reordering will also increase and the recovery time degrades the delay performance.</p></div>

Delay performance components.</p><p>In this work, we employ the TCP delay performance model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[20]</ref> to analyze the end-to-end connection delay (d E p ) for each communication path in MPTCP. d E p includes two main components (shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>): 1) network-level delay (d N p ); 2) TCP-level delay (d T p ), i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">d E p = d N p + d T p . (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>The TCP-level delay is dependent on the end-to-end connection state, and this state is determined by the congestion control phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[20]</ref>. Specifically, the TCP-level delay includes the congestion control and head-of-line blocking time. The head-of-line blocking delay is caused by the TCP receive buffering (the purpose of the receive buffer is to hold out-oforder packets while a loss is being detected). The networklevel latency consists of the packet transmission and path propagation delays. We employ the Markov chain model developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[20]</ref> to analyze the TCP-level delay. According to the Equation (3) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[20]</ref>, the steady-state TCP delay distribution is modeled as follows The notation d i s,s denotes the TCP delay of the ith packet sent in a transition from state s to s and is expressed as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P d T p = d = s∈Ω s • s ∈Ω P s,s • n s,s i=1 I d i s,s =d s∈Ω s • s ∈Ω P s,s • n s,s ,<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">d i s,s = b p /R p + RT T p + (3 + i)/f p , if s ∈ FR, b p /R p , otherwise,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where b p denotes the backlogged packets and f p represents the load in packets per second.

Note that the video encoding rate R = p∈P R p is not a fixed parameter for constant bit-rate video streaming due to the bit rate variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[49]</ref>.

It is computationally prohibitive to directly solve this problem for the optimal solution. Therefore, we present a utility maximization based FEC coding and rate allocation framework to solve the optimization problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(15)</ref> with polynomial time complexity. The challenging issues to apply the utility maximization theory in optimization problem (15) can be summarized as: 1) In the context of multipath video communication, the throughput gains cannot always guarantee the video quality improvement with regard to the delay constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>; 2) Under the path capacity constraint, it is also a critical problem to dynamically adapt the video flow rate and FEC redundancy level to achieve the optimal quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">SOLUTION PROCEDURE OF ADMIT</head><p>In this section, we describe the solution procedure of the proposed ADMIT solution in detail. The key decision blocks in the system design of ADMIT (i.e., the flow rate allocation and FEC coding adaption) are introduced to address the two critical issues in problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(15)</ref>. Specifically, the FEC coding adaption is the execution procedure of the flow rate allocation. In each decision epoch (e.g., the duration of a GoP), the FEC coding scheme (Algorithm 1) is invoked in the rate approach algorithm to estimate the redundancy parameters (n, k).</p><p>We first introduce the FEC coding scheme that includes the redundancy level and packet size adaption. Then, we present the reliability model and rate allocation algorithm. It is a challenging issue to determine the FEC redundancy value with regard to the tradeoff between loss and delay performance. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5a</ref> depicts the variation of effective packet loss rate with the increase in FEC redundancy. The experimentation is performed with a single video flow (2.5 Mbps) over a Wi-Fi network. According to literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[51]</ref>, the average packet loss rate of Wi-Fi networks mainly ranges from 2% to 6%. Therefore, the packet loss rate of the communication path is 6% in the emulations. The detailed experimental setup of network environments and video codec is specified in Section 5.1. With the imposed delay constraint of 200 ms, there is a sudden increase in the effective loss rate when the FEC coding redundancy is above 20%. The excessive FEC packets will significantly increase the end-to-end delay, which is not tolerable for the delay-stringent video applications (e.g., cloud gaming, video conferencing, etc.). To show the tradeoff between delay constraint and video PSNR, we also plot the relationship in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5b</ref>. It can be observed from the result that the increase in PSNR values is rapid for tight delay constraints but becomes slow in the relatively loose deadlines. In the following, we will introduce the FEC redundancy estimation algorithms for each coding phase.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">FEC Redundancy Adaption</head><p>The FEC redundancy adaption is a critical problem in the decision process of multipath transfer since ADMIT intelligently sends FEC packets over different sub-flows. There is an inherent tradeoff between the FEC redundancy [Θ = (n-k)/k] and delay performance due to the decoding deadline imposed by video applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[52]</ref>. By introducing more redundant packets, the receiver is able to recover from more serious transmission losses. However, a higher redundancy level also increases the end-to-end delay (overdue loss rate) and the possibility of network congestions.</p><p>In order to effectively take advantage of the available network resources to minimize the effective packet loss rate, we employ the utility maximization theory in the FEC redundancy adaption. Conventionally, the objective of the utility theory is to maximize the network throughput. Therefore, we introduce a congestion-level parameter C p to indicate whether the network path is overloaded, and thus alleviate severe congestions. This parameter is motivated by the reliability model introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[53]</ref> and can be expressed as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">C p = max {R p , (n p • S)/T} • (1 + Θ) μ p , (<label>17</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_38">)</formula><p>If the value of C p is higher than a threshold value (Thresh) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[30]</ref>, the network is overloaded.

The path asymmetry in heterogeneous wireless networks may also significantly increase the head-of-line blocking delay of specific communication paths.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">PERFORMANCE EVALUATION</head><p>In this section, we evaluate the efficacy of the proposed AD-MIT via extensive semi-physical emulations in the network emulator Exata. The semi-physical emulations are different from the traditional trace-driven simulations (e.g., using NS-2 or OPNET). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>, the sender and receiver are connected to the emulation server through the Exata connection manager. The emulation setup and network environment are configured in the emulation server. The transmission ends in the emulation topology are mapped to the communication terminals in local networks to mimic real data transfer with high fidelity.</p><p>First, we describe the evaluation methodology that includes the emulation setup, performance metrics, reference schemes, and emulation scenario. Then, we present and discuss the emulation results in detail. The componentwise validation is shown at the end of this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Evaluation Methodology</head><p>Network emulator: We use Exata 2.1 [56] as the network emulator. Exata is an advanced edition of QualNet [57] in which we can perform semi-physical emulations. In order to implement the real-video-streaming based emulations, we integrate the source code of JM (Joint Model) with Exata and develop an application layer protocol of "Video Transmission". The detailed descriptions of the development steps could be referred to Exata Programmer's Guide <ref type="bibr">[56]</ref>. In the emulated network topology, the sender has one wired network interface and the mobile client has three wireless network interfaces, i.e., Cellular, WLAN and WiMAX. The parameter configurations of different wireless access networks (e.g., round trip time) are summarized in Table 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>[5] <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[58]</ref>.</p><p>As the MPTCP is not available in the transport-layer stack of the Exata emulator, we develop this transport protocol based on the TCP module and the C code from GitHub <ref type="bibr">[59]</ref>. As depicted in the figure, each router is attached to one edge node, which is single-homed and introduces background traffic. Each of the edge nodes has four traffic generators producing cross traffic with a Pareto distribution. The packet sizes of background traffic are chosen to resemble the distribution measured from the Internet: 43% are large (≥ 1400 Bytes), 17% are medium [(144, 1400) Bytes], and 40% are small (≤ 144 Bytes) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[60]</ref>. The aggregate cross traffic loads imposed on the available network paths are similar and vary randomly between 20 -40 percent of the bottleneck links' bandwidth. The data distribution interval is 250 ms (the duration of a GoP). The packet interleaving level (θ p ) is 2 ms for each communication path. The threshold limit value (TLV) for L p is set to be 1.25 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[47]</ref> in the emulations. Video codec: The reference software JM (Joint Model) 18.2 [61] for H.264/AVC is adopted as the video encoder. The generated video streaming is encoded at 30 frames per second and a GoP consists of 15 frames. The GoP structure is IPP...P. The test video sequences are blue sky, mobcal, park joy, and river bed in high definition (HD) content. These test sequences feature different patterns of temporal motion and spatial characteristics that reflected in their corresponding video quality versus encoding rates. We concatenate the video sequences to be 15000 frame-long (500 seconds) in order to obtain statistically meaningful results. The delay constraint (T) for each GoP is set to be 500 ms to prevent playback buffer starvation. The streaming video is encoded at the source rates of 1.8, 2, 2.2, 3, and 4 Mbps for the Trajectory I to V.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reference Schemes</head><p>• GreenBag <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[25]</ref>. This scheme includes the components of medium load balancing with recovery, segment management and energy-aware link mode control to stream realtime video over multiple TCP connections.</p><p>• FMTCP <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[21]</ref>. The fountain code based Multipath TCP (FMTCP) scheme exploits the random nature of fountain code to flexibly transmit encoded symbols over available communication paths. The data allocation is based on the expected arriving time and decoding demand.</p><p>• MPLOT <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[26]</ref>. This transport-layer protocol achieves transmission reliability with a proposed HARQ (Hybrid Automatic Request) mechanism. The FEC redundancy is provided in hybrid proactive/reactive manner and the FEC packets are mapped to different communication paths based on estimated quality. • MPTCP <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref>. The baseline MPTCP scheme is also used as a reference scheme for performance comparison. The congestion control, buffer management and data retransmission algorithms are specified in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref>. The above reference schemes are selected due to the representativeness, protocol layer stack, and implementation issues. The RTT-based scheduler (i.e., the default scheduler in MPTCP) is used in the evaluation of MPTCP results. Besides, the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is enabled in the emulations for MPLOT to achieve its full performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance Metrics</head><p>• PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[62]</ref> is the standard metric to measure objective video quality. This metric is expressed as a function of the MSE between the original and the reconstructed video frames. If a video frame is dropped during transmission or past the deadline, it is considered to be lost and will be concealed by copying the content from the previously received frame.</p><p>• The end-to-end delay of a video frame consists of the transmission delay and the holding time at both server and client side. It is counted from the generation time of a video frame to the time when it can be decoded. • Goodput represents the amount of useful information data successfully delivered to the destination within the imposed deadline T.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emulation Scenarios</head><p>We conduct the emulations in mobile scenarios along the trajectories indexed from I to V as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>. These mobile trajectories represent different access options and capacity constraints as specified in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">3</ref>. The mobile terminal is set to move along these trajectories back and forth at the speed of 2 m/s. In each transmission scenario, the emulation is repeated over 20 times obtain the average values with a 95% confidence interval. The microscopic results (time series analysis) are refined from a single run with finer granularity. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a</ref> shows the average PSNR results obtained with the competing transport protocols along the mobile trajectories. ADMIT outperforms the GreenBag scheme due to the quality-driven optimization framework that incorporates the FEC coding and rate allocation. As the fountain code is not effective for real-time video applications with stringent delay constraint, FMTCP frequently induces large end-toend packet delay and achieves lower quality than ADMIT. We can also observe the performance gaps become larger while moving along Trajectory II.   To compare the subjective video quality of the competing schemes, the 618th received frames of Trajectory III (measured from the park joy sequence) are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>. The frame received with ADMIT can be clearly seen while the images of the reference schemes are damaged to different levels. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10a</ref> shows the average end-to-end video frame delay for all the competing transport protocols. The results' pattern is almost the opposite to that shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a</ref>. In real-time video applications, the media quality in terms of PSNR is generally inversely proportional to the end-to-end delay <ref type="bibr">[28][63]</ref>. This is because larger latency will incur more overdue packets and recent studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[28]</ref>[63] suggest the one-way delay should not exceed 150 ms to achieve excellent quality. In order to guarantee the acceptable quality, this delay is constrained to be less than 400 ms. Expectedly, ADMIT achieves the lowest end-to-end delay as it employs the RS code for data protection, and thus significantly reduces the number of unnecessary retransmissions. Of equal importance to the delay reduction, ADMIT takes into account the characteristics of MPTCP connection (e.g., fast recovery, congestion avoidance, slow start, etc.) in estimating the end-to-end connection delay. These important factors are not considered in the reference protocols. Thus, ADMIT provides higher estimation accuracy in the end-to-end delay than the reference schemes. Different from the rank in quality results, MPLOT outperforms the FMTCP in reducing the end-to-end delay. This is because the fountain code is of large block size, and thus results large additional delay. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10b</ref> plots the ratio of video frames past decoding deadline to compare the playback fluency achieved with different transmission schemes. FMTCP guarantees more video frames deliver within the delay constraint because it exhibits superiority in mitigating the transmission losses with the rateless fountain code. To illustrate the microscopic results of the delay performance, the cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of interpacket delay (measured at the receiver based on the timestamps of arrival packets) for different video test sequences are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref>. The results indicate ADMIT outperforms the reference schemes in reducing the delay jitters, which may induce frequent playback disruptions. During the video transmission and display process, the receiver side is frequently annoyed with video stalls or glitches while using the reference transport protocols. Much smoother video streaming can be obtained with the proposed ADMIT.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goodput</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12a</ref> compares the average goodput for the evaluated schemes in the emulations along different mobile trajectories. The performance gaps between ADMIT and the reference schemes become larger in Trajectory III and the results' trend is similar to that shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a</ref>. Another critical problem that degrades the goodput performance is the out-of-order packets, which is mainly caused by the path diversity in heterogeneous networks. The early-arrival packets will be temporarily stored in the receive buffer to wait for the late packets, and this will induce larger end-to-end delay and degrade the channel utilization level. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7b</ref> shows the average percentage of out-of-order packets while the mobile terminal is moving along different trajectories. The risk of packet reordering is obviously higher while the mobile terminal is associated with three access networks in trajectories IV and V. ADMIT succeeds in mitigating the packet reordering problem due to the effectiveness in the rate allocation and delay estimation.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">13a</ref> sketches the evolutions of the instantaneous goodput values and it can be observed ADMIT delivers smoother video streaming than the reference transport protocols. This is because the congestion control in MPTCP is a packet-based adaption mechanism and we adjust the FEC packet size to mitigate the throughput fluctuations. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">13b</ref>, we profile the out-of-order arrival packets during the interval of [0, 400] seconds. ADMIT alleviates the packet reordering problem by appropriately selecting the access networks and assigning the transmission rates. First, we reveal the effectiveness of the proposed reliabilityaware rate allocation algorithm by disabling the FEC adaption component. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">14</ref> compares the PSNR values of the proposed allocation algorithm with those of the packet loss rate (PLR) based scheme specified in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref>. The results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">14</ref> verify that the reliability model developed in this work is a better metric than the packet loss rate to indicate the path status for improving overall video streaming quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Componentwise Validation</head><p>In this emulation scenario, we set the video data to be concurrently transmitted through both cellular and Wi-Fi networks. The evolutions of the total transmission rate and available bandwidth are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">15a</ref>. It can be observed the total transmission rate tracks closely to the available bandwidth during the emulations. Such results indicate the FEC coding scheme in ADMIT is able to saturate the communication path to maximize the video quality. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">15b</ref>, we plot the FEC redundancy in comparison to the packet loss rates of Wi-Fi and cellular networks. ADMIT is able to dynamically adjust the redundancy level according to the time-varying packet loss rates to effectively integrate both access networks. We have also evaluated the impact of congestion losses on the Wi-Fi path. The fairness of ADMIT in this environment is presented in terms of congestion window size (in units of KBytes). We compare the performance of ADMIT with TCP and MPTCP (LIA). There are two video streams in parallel over the Wi-Fi path with one using standard TCP and the other one using ADMIT/MPTCP The results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">16</ref> indicate ADMIT flow consumes approximately the same bandwidth that used by the TCP flow. The congestion window size of MPTCP is obviously higher and this is because the Linked Increase Algorithm (LIA) is aggressive toward TCP users <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[19]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION</head><p>The exponential growth of mobile video streaming over the Internet has become a major driving force for multihomed communication over heterogeneous wireless networks. Multipath TCP (MPTCP) is an important transport-layer protocol to enable parallel data transmissions over multiple communication paths. This paper proposes ADMIT, a qualitydriven MPTCP scheme for multihomed video transmission over multiple wireless access networks. To achieve the optimal quality of real-time video streaming, we first propose a rate allocation algorithm to select the appropriate access networks. Then, we present a FEC coding adaption scheme to strike the balance between end-to-end delay and loss performance to minimize the effective packet loss rate. Emulation results show that ADMIT outperforms the reference transport protocols in improving video quality in terms of PSNR. Furthermore, the superiority of ADMIT over the competing protocols becomes more obvious as the number of access networks increases.</p><p>As future work, we will consider the following directions. 1) Minimizing the energy consumption of multihomed mobile devices while achieving the target quality to provide user-satisfied video streaming services. 2) Introducing the Quality-of-Experience (QoE) metrics into ADMIT to optimize the video viewing experience. 3) Combining the FEC and retransmission mechanisms in ADMIT (e.g., sending ACK if data is recovered in FEC coding) to reduce unnecessary retransmissions and conserve bandwidth.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
