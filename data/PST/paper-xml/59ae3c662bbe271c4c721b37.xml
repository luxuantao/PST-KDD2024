<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has been considered as a promising technology for future 5G wireless communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, since it can provide wider bandwidth <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and achieve higher spectral efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. However, in MIMO systems, each antenna usually requires a dedicated radio-frequency (RF) chain (including high-resolution digital-to-analog converter, mixer, etc.) to realize the fully digital signal processing (e.g., precoding) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. For mmWave massive MIMO, this will result in unaffordable hardware complexity and energy consumption, as the number of antennas becomes huge and the energy consumption of RF chain is high <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. To reduce the number of required RF chains, hybrid precoding has been recently proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Its key idea is to decompose the fully digital precoder into a large-size analog beamformer (realized by the analog circuit) and a small-size digital precoder (requiring a small number of RF chains). Thanks to the low-rank characteristics of mmWave channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, a small-size digital precoder can achieve the spatial multiplexing gains, making hybrid precoding enjoy the near-optimal performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, most of the existing hybrid precoding schemes require a complicated phase shifter network, where each RF chain is connected to all antennas with high-resolution phase shifters <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Although this architecture can provide high design freedom to achieve the near-optimal performance, it requires hundreds or even thousands of high-resolution phase shifters with high hardware cost and energy consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>To solve this problem, two categories of schemes have been proposed very recently. The first category is to directly employ finite-resolution phase shifters instead of high-resolution phase shifters <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. It can reduce the energy consumption of phase shifter network without obvious performance loss, but it still requires a large number of phase shifters with considerable energy consumption. The second category is to utilize the switch network to replace the phase shifter network <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. It can significantly reduce the hardware cost and energy consumption, but it suffers from an obvious performance loss.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a switch and inverter (SI)based hybrid precoding architecture with considerably reduced hardware cost and energy consumption. Instead of using phase shifters, the analog part of the proposed architecture is realized by a small number of energy-efficient switches and inverters. Then, we provide the performance analysis to quantify the performance gap between the proposed hybrid precoding architecture and the traditional ones. After that, inspired by the crossentropy (CE) optimization developed in machine learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, we propose an adaptive CE (ACE)-based hybrid precoding scheme for this new architecture. Specifically, according to the probability distributions of the elements in hybrid precoder, this scheme first randomly generates several candidate hybrid precoders. Then, it adaptively weights these candidate hybrid precoders according to their achievable sum-rates, and refines the probability distributions of elements in hybrid precoder by minimizing the CE. Repeating such procedure, we can finally generate a hybrid precoder close to the optimal one with a sufficiently high probability. Simulation results verify that our scheme can achieve the near-optimal sum-rate performance and much higher energy efficiency than traditional schemes.</p><p>Notation: Lower-and upper-case boldface letters denote vectors and matrices, respectively; (•) T , (•) H , (•) -1 , tr (•), and • F denote the transpose, conjugate transpose, inversion, trace, and Frobenius norm of a matrix, respectively; |•| denotes the absolute operator; E(•) denotes the expectation; ⊗ denotes the kronecker product; I N is the N × N identity matrix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL</head><p>In this paper, we consider a typical mmWave massive MI-MO system, where the base station (BS) employs N antennas and N RF RF chains to simultaneously serve K single-antenna users (the extension to users with multiple-antennas is also possible as will be explained later). To fully achieve the multiplexing gains, we assume N RF = K <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. For hybrid precoding systems as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, the K × 1 received signal vector y for all K users can be presented by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y = HF RF F BB s + n,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">H = [h 1 , h 2 , • • • , h K ]</formula><p>H is the channel matrix with h k presenting the N × 1 channel vector between the BS and the kth user, s is the K × 1 transmitted signal vector for all K users satisfying E ss H = I K , F RF of size N × N RF is the analog beamformer realized by analog circuit (different architectures incur different hardware constraints as will be discussed later), F BB is the baseband digital precoder of size N RF × K satisfying the total transmit power constraint as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">F RF F BB 2 F = ρ,</formula><p>where ρ is total transmit power.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. ENERGY EFFICIENT HYBRID PRECODING</head><p>In this section, we first describe the proposed SI-based hybrid precoding architecture. Then, we propose an ACEbased hybrid precoding scheme for this new architecture. Finally, the complexity analysis is provided.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The proposed SI-based hybrid precoding architecture</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> (a) and (b) show the traditional precoding architectures, i.e., the one with finite-resolution phase shifters (PSbased architecture) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and the one with switches (SW-based architecture) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, respectively.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> (a), the traditional PS-based architecture requires a complicated phase shifter network, and the corresponding energy consumption can be presented as where P RF , P PS , and P BB are the energy consumption of RF chain, finite-resolution phase shifter, and baseband, respectively. Note that although the PS-based architecture enjoys high design freedom to achieve the nearoptimal performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, it requires a large number (e.g., N × N RF = 64 × 16 = 1024 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>) of phase shifters. Moreover, the energy consumption of finite phase shifter is also considerable (e.g., P PS = 40mW for 4-bit phase shifter <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>), These make the traditional PS-based architecture still suffer from high energy consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P PS-architecture = ρ + N RF P RF + NN RF P PS + P BB , (4)</formula><p>By contrast, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> (b), SW-based architecture can efficiently relieve such problem by employing a small number (N RF instead of N × N RF ) of energy-efficient switches. The energy consumption of SW-based architecture can be presented as P SW-architecture = ρ + N RF P RF + N RF P SW + P BB , <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> where P SW is the energy consumption of switch, which is much lower than P PS (e.g., P SW = 5mW <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>). Nevertheless, since only N RF antennas are active simultaneously, SW-based architecture cannot fully achieve the array gains of mmWave massive MIMO, leading to an obvious performance loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>To overcome the problems faced by traditional architectures, we propose the SI-based architecture as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1 (c</ref>), which can be considered as a better trade-off between the near-optimal PS-based architecture and the energy-efficient SW-based architecture. Specifically, in the proposed SI-based architecture, each RF chain is only connected to a sub antenna array with M = N/N RF (assumed to be an integer) antennas instead of all N antennas <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Moreover, each RF chain is connected to the sub antenna array via only one inverter and M switches instead of N phase shifters. The energy consumption of SI-based architecture can be presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> where P IN is the energy consumption of inverter. It worth pointing out that the inverters can be realized by the digital chip with the energy consumption similar to switches (i.e., P IN ≈ P SW ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. As a result, by comparing ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">6</ref>), we can conclude that the energy consumption of the proposed SIbased architecture is much lower than that of PS-based one. Furthermore, as all antennas are used, SI-based architecture can also achieve the potential array gains of mmWave massive MIMO, which will be further proved as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">P SI-architecture = ρ+N RF P RF +N RF P IN +NP SW +P BB ,</formula><p>To do this, we need to first explain the hardware constraints induced by the proposed SI-based architecture, which are different from those of the traditional ones. The first constraint is that the analog beamformer F RF should be a block diagonal matrix instead of a full matrix as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">F RF = ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ f RF 1 0 . . . 0 0 f RF 2 0 . . . . . . . . . 0 0 . . . f RF NRF ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ N ×NRF , (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>where f RF n is the M × 1 analog beamformer on the nth sub antenna array. The second constraint is that since only inverters and switches are used, all the N nonzero elements of F RF should belong to</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">1 √ N {-1, +1} . (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>Based on these constraints, we have the following Lemma 1.</p><p>Lemma 1. Assume that the channel h k of user k only has single path, i.e., L k = 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. When N → ∞ and N/M = N RF , the ratio ζ between the array gains achieved by SI-based architecture and that achieved by PS-based architecture with sufficiently high-resolution phase shifters can be presented by</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">lim N →∞, N M =NRF ζ = 4 N RF π 2 . (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>Proof: For the traditional PS-based architecture with sufficiently high-resolution phase shifters, the phases of the elements in the analog beamformer can be arbitrarily adjusted to capture the power of h k . Therefore, the array gains achieved by PS-based architecture is α</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">(1) k 2</formula><p>. By contrast, the array gains achieved by SI-based architecture can be presented by</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">h H k f RF k 2 = N α (1) k 2 a H (ϕ k ) f RF k 2 (10) = 1 N α (1) k 2 M m=1 e j φm 2 = 1 N α (1) k 2 ⎛ ⎝ M m=1 cos φm 2 + M m=1 sin φm 2 ⎞ ⎠ ,</formula><p>where f RF k is the kth column of F RF including the zeros and φm denotes the phase quantization error. Since the nonzero elements in f RF k belong to 1 √ N {-1, +1}, φm can be assumed to follow the uniform distribution U (-π/2, π/2) for 1 ≤ m ≤ M <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Then, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">lim N →∞ N/M =NRF ζ = 1 N RF M ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ M m=1 cos φm 2 + M m=1 sin φm 2 ⎫ ⎬ ⎭ = 1 N RF E cos φm 2 + E sin φm 2 = 4 N RF π 2 , (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>which verifies the conclusion in Lemma 1. Lemma 1 indicates that although the proposed SI-based architecture suffers from some loss of array gains compared to the near-optimal PS-based architecture, the performance loss keeps constant and limited, which does not grow as the number of BS antennas goes to infinity. Recalling the low energy consumption of SI-based architecture, we can conclude that our scheme is a better trade-off between the traditional architectures, which will be also verified by simulation. Next, we will design a near-optimal hybrid precoding scheme for SIbased architecture with quite different hardware constraints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. ACE-based hybrid precoding scheme</head><p>We aim to design the analog beamformer F RF and the digital precoder F BB to maximize the achievable sum-rate R, which can be presented as</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">F opt RF , F opt BB = arg max FRF,FBB R, s.t. F RF ∈ F, F RF F BB 2 F = ρ, (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">)</formula><p>where F denotes the set with all possible analog beamformers satisfying the two constraints ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">7</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">8</ref>) described above, and the achievable sum-rate R can be presented by</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">R = K k=1 log 2 (1 + γ k ),<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where γ k presents the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the kth user as</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">γ k = h H k F RF f BB k 2 K k =k h H k F RF f BB k 2 + σ 2 , (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_24">)</formula><p>where f BB k is the kth column of F BB . It is worth pointing out that the constraints ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">7</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">8</ref>) on the analog beamformer F RF are non-convex. This makes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> very difficult to be solved. Fortunately, as all the N nonzero elements of F RF belong to the set<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> √ N {-1, +1}, the number of possible F RF is finite. Therefore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> can be regarded as a non-coherent combining problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. To solve it, we can first select a candidate F RF , and compute the optimal F BB according to the effective channel matrix HF RF without non-convex constraints. After all possible F RF 's have been searched, we can obtain the optimal analog beamformer F opt RF and digital precoder F opt BB . However, such exhaustive search scheme requires to search 2 N possible F RF 's and F BB 's, which involves unaffordable complexity as N is usually large in mmWave massive MIMO systems (e.g., N = 64, 2 64 ≈ 1.84 × 10 19 ). To solve this problem, we propose an ACE algorithm, which can be considered as an improved version of the CE algorithm developed from machine learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>At first, we would like to briefly introduce the conventional CE algorithm, which is a probabilistic model-based algorithm to solve the combining problem by an iterative procedure. In each iteration, the CE algorithm first generates S candidates (e.g., possible hybrid precoders in our problem) according to a probability distribution. Then, it computes the objective value (e.g., achievable sum-rate in our problem) of each candidate, and selects S elite best candidates as "elite" <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Finally, based on the selected elites, the probability distribution is updated by minimizing the CE. Repeating such procedure, the probability distribution will be refined to generate a solution close to the optimal one with a sufficiently high probability. However, although the CE algorithm has been widely used in machine learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, it still has some disadvantages. One is that the contributions of all elites are treated as the same. Intuitively, the elite with better objective value should be more important when we update the probability distribution. Therefore, if we can adaptively weight the elites according to their objective values, better performance can be expected. Following this idea, we propose an ACE algorithm to solve <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</p><p>The pseudo-code of the proposed ACE-based hybrid precoding scheme 1 is summarized in Algorithm 1, which can be explained as follows. At the beginning, we formulate the nonzero elements in</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">F RF as N × 1 vector f = f RF 1 T , f RF 2 T , • • • f RF NRF T T</formula><p>, and set the probability</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">parameter u = [u 1 , u 2 , • • • , u N ]</formula><p>T as an N × 1 vector, where 0 ≤ u n ≤ 1 presents the probability that f n = 1/ √ N , f n is the nth element of f . Then, by initializing u (0) = 1 2 × 1 N ×1 (1 is the all-one vector), we assume that all the N nonzero elements of F RF belong to  RF ; Digital precoder F <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> BB . Algorithm 1: The proposed ACE-based hybrid precoding calculate the corresponding digital precoder F s BB according to the effective channel H s eq = HF s RF for 1 ≤ s ≤ S. Note that there are lots of advanced digital precoder schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In this paper, we adopt the classical ZF digital precoder with the nearoptimal performance and low complexity as the example <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and F s BB can be computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">RF ≥ R F [2] RF ≥ • • • ≥ R F [S] RF ; 5. Select elites as F [1] RF , F [2] RF , • • • , F [Selite</formula><formula xml:id="formula_28">G s = H s eq H H s eq H s eq H -1 , F s BB = β s G s , (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_29">)</formula><p>where β s = √ ρ/ F s RF G s F is power normalized factor. After that, in step 3, the achievable sum-rate {R (F s RF )}</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S s=1</head><p>are calculated by substituting F s RF and F s BB (also a function of F s RF ) into <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. We sort {R (F s RF )} S s=1 in a descend order in step 4. Then, the elites can be obtained in step 5. In the conventional CE algorithm, the next step is to using elites to update u (i+1) by minimizing CE, which is equivalent to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> u (i+1) = arg max</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">u (i) 1 S S elite s=1 ln Ξ F [s] RF ; u (i) ,<label>(16) where Ξ F [s]</label></formula><p>RF ; u (i) denotes the probability to generate F</p><p>[s] RF . As mentioned above, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>, the contributions of all elites are treated as the same, leading to performance degradation. To solve this problem, we propose to weight each elite adaptively based on its achievable sum-rate. Specifically, we first define an auxiliary parameter T presenting the average achievable sum-rate of all elites as</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">T = 1 S elite Selite s=1 R F [s] RF .

Finally, it is worth pointing out that the proposed ACE-based hybrid precoding scheme can be also extended to the scenario where users employ multiple antennas.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Computational complexity analysis</head><p>In this subsection, the computational complexity of the proposed ACE-based hybrid precoding scheme is discussed.</p><p>From Algorithm 1, we can observe that the complexity of the ACE-based hybrid precoding scheme mainly comes from steps 2, 3, 6, and 7. In step 2, we need to compute S effective channel matrices H s eq S s=1 and digital precoders {F s BB } S s=1 according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. Therefore, the complexity of this part is O SN K 2 . In step 3, the achievable sum-rate of each candidate is computed. Since we employ the digital ZF precoder, the SINR γ s k of the kth user for the sth candidate is simplified to γ s k = (β s /σ) 2 . As a result, this part only involves the complexity O (S). In step 6, we calculate S elite weights based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, which is quite simple with the complexity O (S elite ). Finally, in step 7, the probability parameter u (i+1) is updated according to (21) with the complexity O (NS elite ). In summary, after I iterations, the total computational complexity of the proposed ACE hybrid precoding scheme is O ISN K 2 . Since K is usually small, I and S also do not have to be very large as will be verified in the next section, we can conclude that the complexity of the proposed ACE-based hybrid precoding scheme is acceptable, which is comparable with the simple least squares (LS) algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. SIMULATION RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we provide the simulation results in terms of achievable sum-rate and energy-efficiency to evaluate the performance of the proposed ACE-based hybrid precoding scheme. The simulation parameters are described as follows:</p><p>We assume that the BS employs an UPA with antenna spacing d 1 = d 2 = λ/2. For the kth user, we generate the channel h k based on (2), where we assume: 1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Finally, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is defined as ρ/σ 2 . Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the achievable sum-rate comparison in a typical mmWave massive MIMO system with N = 64, N RF = K = 4. In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the proposed CE-based (i.e., using the conventional CE algorithm to solve ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">12</ref>)) and ACEbased hybrid precoding schemes are designed for SI-based architecture, where we set S = 200, S elite = 40, and I = 20 for Algorithm 1, the conventional two-stage hybrid precoding scheme is designed for PS-based architecture with 4-bit phase shifters <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and the conventional antenna selection (AS)-based hybrid precoding scheme is designed for SW-based architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> with switches. Firstly, we can observe from Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> that the proposed ACE algorithm outperforms the traditional CE algorithm, where the SNR gap is about 1 dB. Note that the ACE algorithm only involves one additional step (i.e., step 6 in Algorithm 1) with negligible complexity. Therefore, the proposed ACE algorithm is more efficient. Moreover, Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> also shows that the proposed ACE-based hybrid precoding can achieve the sum-rate much higher than the conventional ASbased hybrid precoding, as it can achieve the potential array gains in mmWave massive MIMO systems. Finally, we can observe that the performance gap between ACE-based hybrid precoding and two-stage hybrid precoding is limited and keeps constant, which further verifies the conclusion in Lemma 1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">L k = 3; 2) α (l) k ∼ CN (0, 1) for 1 ≤ l ≤ L k ; 3) ϕ (l) k and θ (l) k follow the uniform distribution U (-π, π) for 1 ≤ l ≤ L k</formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the achievable sum-rate of the proposed ACEbased hybrid precoding against the number of candidates S and the number of iterations I, when S elite /S = 0.2, N = 64, N RF = K = 4, and SNR = 10 dB. From Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, we can observe that when S is small, increasing S will lead to an obvious improvement in the sum-rate performance. However, when S is sufficiently large, such trend is no longer obvious. This indicates that the number of candidates S does not have to be very large, e.g., S = 200 is enough. Furthermore, Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> also indicates that the proposed ACE-based hybrid precoding can converge with a small number of iterations, e.g., I = 20. These observations verify the rationality of the parameters for Algorithm 1 we used in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the energy efficiency comparison when N = 64 is fixed and N RF = K varies from 1 to 16. The parameters for Algorithm 1 are the same as Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, the energy efficiency can be defined as the ratio between the achievable sum-rate and the energy consumption, which should be (4), <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, and (6) for twostage hybrid precoding, AS-based hybrid precoding, and ACEbased hybrid precoding, respectively. In this paper, we adopt the practical values ρ = 30mW <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, P RF = 300mW <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, P BB = 200mW <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, P PS = 40mW (4-bit phase shifter) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and P SW = P IN = 5mW <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, we can observe that the proposed ACE-based hybrid precoding with SI-based architecture can achieve much higher energy efficiency than the others, especially when K is not very large (e.g., K ≤ 12). Furthermore, it is interesting to observe that when K ≥ 8, the energy efficiency of the two-stage hybrid precoding with PSbased architecture is even lower than that of the fully digital ZF precoding. This is due to the fact that as K grows, the number of phase shifters in PS-based architecture increases rapidly. As a result, the energy consumption of the phase shifter network will be huge, even higher than that of RF chains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient SI-based hybrid precoding architecture, where the analog part is realized by a small number of switches and inverters. The performance analysis proves that the performance gap between the proposed SI-based architecture and the traditional near-optimal one keeps constant and limited. Then, by employing the idea of CE optimization in machine learning, we further propose an ACEbased hybrid precoding scheme with low complexity for SIbased architecture. Simulation results verify that our scheme can achieve the satisfying sum-rate performance and much higher energy efficiency than traditional schemes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>λ is the signal wavelength, and d 1 (d 2 ) is the horizontal (vertical) antenna spacing.
