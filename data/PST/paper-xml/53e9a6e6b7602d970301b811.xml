<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>On a wireless channel, diversity techniques are used to combat channel fadings. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the so called cooperative diversity techniques, where multiple terminals in a network cooperate to form a virtual antenna array in order to exploit spatial diversity in a distributed fashion. In this manner, spatial diversity gain can be obtained even when a local antenna array is not available. Since the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, several cooperative transmission protocols have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. These protocols can be categorized into two principal classes : the amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme and the decode-and-forward (DF) scheme. In practice, the AF scheme is more attractive for its low complexity since the cooperative terminals (relays) simply forward the signal and do not decode it. Actually, for most ad hoc wireless networks, it is not realistic for other terminals to decode the signal from a certain user, because the codebook is seldom available and the decoding complexity is unacceptable in most cases.</p><p>The non-orthogonal amplify-and-forward (NAF) scheme was proposed by Nabar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for the single-relay channel and was then generalized to the multiple-relay case by Azarian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, it is shown that the NAF scheme outperforms all previously proposed AF schemes in terms of the fundamental diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and that it is optimal within the class of AF schemes in the single-relay case. The superiority of the NAF scheme comes from the fact that the source terminal is allowed to transmit during all the time, which boosts up the multiplexing gain. However, even though they showed that the DMT of this scheme can be achieved using a Gaussian random code of sufficiently large block length, no practical coding scheme that achieves the tradeoff has been proposed since then.</p><p>The main contributions of our work are summarized as follows:</p><p>1) We extend the single-antenna NAF scheme proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to the multiple-antenna case.</p><p>We establish a lower bound on the optimal DMT of the MIMO NAF channel. In particular, we show that the maximum diversity order of a single-relay MIMO NAF channel is lowerbounded by the sum of the maximum diversity order of the source-destination channel and the maximum diversity orders of the source-relay-destination product channels. This lower bound is tight when the source, relay and destination antenna number n s , n r and n d satisfy</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">|n s -n d | ≥ n r -1.</formula><p>2) We provide an explicit algebraic construction of short block codes that achieves the optimal DMT of the general multiple-antenna multiple-relay NAF cooperative diversity scheme. Our algebraic code construction is inspired by the non-vanishing determinant (NVD) space-time codes design for MIMO Rayleigh channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. First, we show that for any linear fading Gaussian channel (not only the Rayleigh channel as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">y y y = √ SNR H H Hx x x + z z z,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>in the high SNR regime, the error event of a "good" space-time code X (which will be properly defined later) occurs only when the channel is in outage. Therefore, the optimal DMT can always be achieved by X . Then, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, we derive equivalent signal models of the AF cooperative schemes in the form <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, subject to certain input constraint (e.g., block diagonal for multiple-relay channel). Since codes that achieve the optimal DMT of the equivalent channel (1) also achieve the optimal DMT of the corresponding cooperative channel, optimal codes for an AF cooperative channel can be obtained from the NVD criterion. As a result, we show that for a single-relay AF channel with n s antennas at the source terminal, a 2n s × 2n s full rate NVD space-time code (e.g., the Golden code <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for the single-antenna case and the 4 × 4 Perfect code <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> for the two-antenna case) can be directly applied to construct an optimal block code. In the N-relay case, the optimal code is constructed from a block-diagonal NVD space-time code with N blocks. The performance of our construction is confirmed by simulation results.</p><p>The rest of the paper is outlined as follows. Section II introduces the system model and recalls the single-antenna NAF protocol as well as the equivalent channel model. In section III, we extend the NAF scheme to the MIMO channel and develop a lower bound on the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. The codes design criteria are derived in section IV and the explicit algebraic construction that satisfies the design criteria is provided in section V. Section VI shows some examples of channel configuration and the parameters of the corresponding optimal codes.</p><p>Simulation results on our construction are available in section VII. Section VIII contains some concluding remarks. For continuity of demonstration, most proofs are left in the appendices.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Channel Model</head><p>We consider a wireless network with N + 1 sources (users) and only one destination. The channels are slow fading (or delay-limited), i.e., the channel coherence time is much larger than the maximum delay that can be tolerated by the application. For the moment, we assume that all the terminals are equipped with only one antenna. The multi-antenna case will be treated separately in section III. The channel is shared in a TDMA manner, i.e., each user is allocated a time slot for the transmission of its own data. Within the same time slot, any of the other N users can help the current user transmit its information. The extension to a more general orthogonal access scheme is straightforward. Suppose that the network configuration is symmetric. Without loss of generality, we consider only one time slot and the channel model becomes a single-user relay channel with one source, N relays and one destination, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Here, we exclude the multi-user case, where information of more than one user can circulate at the same time in the network (e.g., the CMA-NAF scheme proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>). In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, variables f, h i and g i , i = 1, . . . , N stand for the channel coefficients that remain constant during a block of length L. As in the previous works we cite here, we assume that all the terminals work in half duplex mode, i.e., they cannot receive and transmit at the same time. The channel state information (CSI) is supposed to be known to the receiver but not to the transmitter.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">s d f g N g 1 h 1 h N r 1 r N</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Non-Orthogonal Amplify-and-Forward Relay Channel</head><p>In our work, we consider the NAF protocol ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>). In this scheme, the relays simply scale and forward the received signal. However, unlike the orthogonal AF protocols, the source can keep transmitting during the transmission of the relays. 1) The Single-Relay Case: In the single-relay case, each frame is composed of two partitions of T /2 symbols<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">1</ref> . The frame length T is supposed to be smaller than the channel coherence time L, i.e., the channel is static during the transmission of a frame. The half duplex constraint imposes that the relay can only transmit in the second partition. The frame structure is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, from which we get the following signal model</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">           y y y 1 = π 1 SNR f x x x 1 + v v v 1 y y y r = π 1 ρ SNR h x x x 1 + w w w y y y 2 = π 3 SNR g (b y y y r ) + π 2 SNR f x x x 2 + v v v 2<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where x x x i , y y y i ∈ C T /2 , i = 1, 2 are the transmitted signals from the source with normalized power and the received signals at the destination, respectively, in the i th partition; y y y r ∈ C T /2 is the received signal at the relay in the first partition; v v v 1 , v v v 2 , w w w ∈ C T /2 are independent additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) vectors with i.i.d. unit variance entries; the channels between different nodes are independently Rayleigh distributed, i.e., f, g, h ∼ CN (0, 1); ρ is the geometric gain representing the ratio between the path loss of the source-relay link and the source-destination link; b is the normalization factor satisfying E b y y y r 2 ≤ T 2 , i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">d 2 2N 2N -1 3 4 1 s r 1 r 2 1 2 2N -1 2N 1 2N -1 1 2N -1<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">|b| 2 ≤ 1 π 1 ρ SNR |h| 2 + 1 .</formula><p>We consider a short term power constraint, i.e., the power allocation factors π i 's do not depend on the instantaneous channel realization f, g and h, but can depend on ρ and SNR. We impose that i π i = 2 so that SNR denotes the average received SNR at the destination 2 .</p><p>As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the channel model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">2</ref>) is equivalent to T /2 channel uses of a 2 × 2 channel :</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">y y y i =   √ π 1 SNR f 0 √ π 1 π 3 ρ SNR b h g √ π 2 SNR f   x x x i +   0 √ π 3 SNR b g   w i + v v v i for i = 1, . . . , T /2 where ũ u u i = u u u 1 [i] u u u 2 [i]</formula><p>T for u u u ∈ {x x x, y y y, v v v} and u u u k [i] denotes the i th symbol in the k th partition.</p><p>In the following, we consider a more convenient normalized model</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">y y y i = √ SNR H H H x x x i + z z z i for i = 1, . . . , T /2</formula><p>where z z z i ∼ CN (0, I) is the equivalent AWGN and</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">H H H   √ π 1 f 0 π 1 π 3 ρSNR 1+π 3 SNR|bg| 2 bhg π 2 1+π 3 SNR|bg| 2 f   .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>2 The total transmit power in two partitions are (π1 + π2 + π3)SNR. Since the channel coefficients and the AWGN are normalized, (π1 + π2 + π3)SNR represents the average received SNR per two partitions as well.</p><p>2) The Multiple-Relay Case: In the multiple-relay case, a superframe of N consecutive cooperation frames is defined, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. It is assumed that the channel is static during the transmission of the whole superframe (of NT symbols). The N relays take turns to cooperate with the source. Within each cooperation frame, the cooperation is in exactly the same manner as in the single-relay case. However, by allowing an encoding over the whole superframe, a diversity order of N + 1 is achieved.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. THE NAF SCHEME FOR MIMO CHANNEL</head><p>In this section, we generalize the NAF protocol to the MIMO case, where each terminal is equipped with multiple antennas. The notation (n s , n r , n d ) will be used to denote a single-relay channel with n s , n r and n d antennas at the source, relay and destination. All matrix variables defined for a single-relay channel apply to a multiple-relay channel with an index i denoting the i th relay.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Signal Model</head><p>For convenience of demonstration, we only present the signal model of the single-relay channel. The extension to the multiple-relay case is straightforward.</p><p>May 5, 2006 DRAFT 1) n r ≤ n s : In the case n r ≤ n s , a direct generalization of (2) is as follows :</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">           Y Y Y 1 = π 1 SNR F F FX X X 1 + V V V 1 Y Y Y r = π 1 ρ SNR H H HX X X 1 + W W W Y Y Y 2 = π 3 SNR G G G(B B BY Y Y r ) + π 2 SNR F F FX X X 2 + V V V 2<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where F F F , G G G, H H H are n d ×n s , n d ×n r and n r ×n s independent matrices, respectively, with zero mean unit variance i.i.d.

In this case, the received signal at the relay is in the n s -dimensional subspace generated by the n s eigenmodes of H H H, represented by U U U H H H from the singular value decomposition</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">H H H = U U U H H H Σ Σ Σ H H H V V V † H H H .</formula><p>Since the relay-destination channel G G G is isotropic, it is of no use to forward the received signal in more than n r antennas (spatial directions). However, by using only a subset of the antennas at the relay, we cannot obtain all the diversity gain provided by the channel G G G. To exploit all the available diversity, we propose two schemes.</p><p>The first scheme is the virtual N-relay scheme. Since no CSI is available at the transmitter and therefore no antenna combination is a priori better than the others, one solution is to use all the nr ns antenna combinations equally. Intuitively, the typical outage event is that all the antenna combinations are in deep fade, which implies that the channel G G G is also in outage. In this scheme, a superframe of nr ns cooperation frames is constructed. Within each cooperation frame, a different combination of n s antennas is used. The second scheme is the antenna selection scheme, which is used only when limited feedback from the destination to the relay is available.</p><p>In this case, the destination tells the relay which antenna combination is optimal according to a given criterion (e.g., maximization of mutual information). With this scheme, maximum diversity gain is obtained without a superframe structure, which means a significant reduction of coding-decoding complexity.</p><p>As an example, let us consider a (1, n r , 1) relay channel with n r &gt; 1. In this case, the received signal at the relay can be projected into a one-dimensional subspace. Consider a superframe of n r cooperation frames. In each cooperation frame, a different relay antenna is used. This scheme is virtually an N-relay single-antenna channel. The only difference is that the equivalent sourcerelay link, which is i |h i | 2 after the matched filter operation, is the same for the N virtual relays. In this scheme, the achievable diversity order of the source-relay-destination link is n r , since the channel is in outage only when i |h i | 2 is in deep fade or all the n r relay-destination links are in deep fade. When feedback is possible, the antenna selection scheme can be used.</p><p>The difference from the first scheme is that only the antenna with maximum relay-destination channel gain (say, |g max | max i=1...nr {|g i |}) is used in the relaying phase. Therefore, only one cooperation frame is needed and the diversity order is also n r .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Optimal Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff: a Lower Bound</head><p>With the discussion above, considering the case n r ≤ n s is without loss of generality. In addition, since the destination is usually equipped with more antennas than the relays are in practice, we will restrict ourselves to the case n d ≥ n r hereafter. In the rest of this section, we study the optimal DMT of the MIMO NAF cooperative channel. Unlike the single-antenna case, a closed form expression of the DMT of the MIMO NAF channel is difficult to obtain, since the probability distribution (in the high SNR regime or not) of the eigenvalues of H H H defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> is unknown. In the following, we will derive a lower bound on the tradeoff, as a generalization of the DMT of the single-antenna NAF channel provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. To this end, we first study the DMT of a Rayleigh product channel.</p><p>1) DMT of a Rayleigh Product Channel:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">Proposition 1: Let G G G, H H H be n × l, l × m independent matrices with i.i.d. entries distributed as CN (0, 1). Assume that m ≥ l, n ≥ l and define A A A G G GH H H, ∆ |m -n| , q min {m, n}, then</formula><p>the optimal DMT curve d * A A A (r) of the Rayleigh product channel, i.e., the channel defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">y y y = SNR l • m A A Ax x x + z z z<label>(10)</label></formula><p>with z z z ∼ CN (0, 1) being the AWGN is a piecewise-linear function connecting the points</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">(s, d * A A A (s)), s = 0, . . . , l, where d * A A A (s) = (l -s)(q -s) - 1 2 [(l -∆ -s) + ] 2 2 . (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">)</formula><p>Proof: See Appendix II. A more general result is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, where a Rayleigh product channel is seen as a special case of the double scattering channels and the assumption m ≥ l, n ≥ l is unnecessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remark 1:</head><p>From proposition 1, we note that (i) d * A A A (r) only depends on ∆ and q, which means that interchanging m and n does not change d * A A A (r), which is obvious if we consider the fact that A A AA A A † has the same eigenvalues as</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">A A A † A A A; (ii) d * A A A (s) is upper-bounded by dA A A (s) min d H H H (s), d G G G (s) = (l -s)(q -s) and coincides with it when s ≥ l -∆ -1; (iii) when ∆ ≥ l -1, d * A A A (s) = dA A A (s), ∀s.</formula><p>Without loss of generality, assume that n ≥ m. Intuitively, by increasing n and keeping m unchanged, the diversity gain of the channel G G G is increasing and so is that of the product channel A A A. When nm = l -1, the best possible DMT for q = m is achieved. With this n, the fading effect of G G G vanishes, since</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">d * A A A (s) = d H H H (s).</formula><p>In other words, it is of no use to have n &gt; l + m -1, for m and l fixed. The optimal DMTs of a Rayleigh product channel for l = 2, 3 are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. As indicated in remark 1, when ∆ * = 1, 2 for l = 2, 3, the tradeoffs of the Rayleigh product channels are the same as those of the corresponding Rayleigh channels, i.e., the 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 Rayleigh channels.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_25">∆ = 0, 1, 2 l = 3 ∆ = 0, 1 l = 2</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) DMT of a MIMO NAF Channel:</head><p>Theorem 1: For a single-relay MIMO NAF channel (5), we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">d NAF (r) ≥ d F F F (r) + d G G GH H H (2r)<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where d F F F (r) and d G G GH H H (r) are the optimal DMT of the fading channel F F F and the fading product channel G G GH H H, respectively.</p><p>Proof: See Appendix III.</p><p>The interpretation of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">12</ref>) is as follows. First, since the transmitted signal passes through the source-destination link all the time, a diversity gain d F F F (r) can be obtained. Then, due to the half duplex constraint, only half of the transmitted signal is protected by the source-relay-destination link, i.e., the channel defined by G G GH H H. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> shows the lower bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> for a Rayleigh channel with n s = n r = n d = 2 and 3.</p><p>This result of theorem 1 can be generalized to the N-relay case.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. OPTIMAL CODES DESIGN CRITERIA</head><p>In this section, we will derive design criteria for a family of short codes to achieve the optimal DMT of an N-relay MIMO NAF channel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. A General Result</head><p>Let us first define the "good" code mentioned in section I.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 2 (Rate-n NVD code):</head><p>Let A be an alphabet that is scalably dense, i.e., for 0 ≤</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">r ≤ n |A(SNR)| . = SNR r n and a ∈ A(SNR) ⇒ |a| 2 ≤ SNR r n Then, an n T × n T space-time code X is called a rate-n NVD code if it 1) is A-linear 3 ;</formula><p>2) transmits on average n symbols PCU from the signal constellation A;</p><p>3) has the non-vanishing determinant (NVD) property <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">4</ref> .</p><p>The following theorem is fundamental to our construction.</p><p>Theorem 3: For any linear block fading channel</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">y y y = √ SNRH H Hx x x + z z z</formula><p>where H H H is an n R × n T channel and z z z ∼ CN (0, I) is the AWGN, the achievable DMT of a rate-n NVD code X satisfies</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">d X (r) ≥ d out q n r<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where q min{n R , n T } and d out (r) is the outage upper bound of the DMT for the channel H H H.</p><p>Proof: See Appendix V.</p><p>In particular, for a full rate code (n = q), the upper bound d out (r) is achievable. This theorem implies that the NVD property is fundamental for X to achieve all the diversity gain d, for any linear fading channel. For a given diversity gain d, the achievable multiplexing gain r of such X is a shrunk version of r out (d), the best that we can have for channel H H H.</p><p>One of the consequences of theorem 3 is the possibility of constructing optimal codes (in terms of the DMT) based on the NVD criteria for some channels. For example, we can get an equivalent MIMO space-time model for the single-antenna fast fading channel (also called a Gaussian parallel channel) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">Y Y Y = diag (h 1 , . . . , h N ) X X X + Z Z Z (17)</formula><p>with X X X, Y Y Y and Z Z Z diagonal N ×N matrices. The best code that we can have is a rate-1 NVD code X due to the diagonal constraint. According to theorem 3, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">d X (r) ≥ d out (Nr) with d out (r)</formula><p>the DMT of ( <ref type="formula">17</ref>) without the diagonal constraint. In fact, we can verify that d out (Nr) coincides with the DMT of the fast fading channel. The NVD criterion includes the product distance criterion since the determinant of a diagonal matrix is the product of the diagonal entries. In addition, it implies that the product distance should be non-vanishing as the constellation size increases.</p><p>Note that another such general result as theorem 3, has been derived independently in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the NVD property is derived from the mismatched eigenvalue bound (worst case rotation) while the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> are derived using the worst case codeword error probability, which is effectively the same thing as the worst case rotation. Theorem 3 is a generalization of the result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> (for the full rate codes) to a rate-n code. This result is more adapted to the algebraic construction of explicit codes for the relay channel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Design Criteria</head><p>With theorem 3, we are ready to give out the design criteria of the optimal codes for the NAF cooperative channel.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Codes Construction</head><p>We use the same methods as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Some particular cases can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The main difference is in the choice of the base field F. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, this base field was equal to P. Here, we choose a Galois extension of P with degree N and denote τ i , i = 1, . . . , N the elements of its Galois group Gal F/P . Now, we construct a cyclic algebra whose center is F. We need a cyclic extension over F of degree 2n s . We denote it K. The generator of its Galois group is σ.</p><p>The code construction needs two steps.</p></div>

Shaping</head><p>As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, we may be interested in constructing codes that achieve the DMT and that behave well in terms of error probability even for small alphabets such as QPSK (4QAM). In that case, we add another constraint to our codes design, the shaping factor. This new constraint implies that |γ| = 1. Moreover, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the linear transform that sends the vector composed by the N • (2n s ) 2 QAM or HEX information symbols to vec(X X X) has to be unitary.</p><p>The following examples will illustrate this claim.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. NUMERICAL RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we provide the simulation results on the performance of some of the codes proposed in section VI. The performance is measured by the frame error rate (FER) vs. receive SNR per bit. For simplicity, we set the power allocation factors π 1 = 2π 2 = 2π 3 for all the scenarios that we considered in this section. An optimization on the π i 's in function of ρ and SNR can improve the performance <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">5</ref> . However, this kind of optimization is out of the scope of this paper and will not be considered here. The transmitted signal constellation is 4and 64-QAM.</p><p>The geometric gain ρ varies from 0 to 20 dB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Single-Antenna Channel</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">7</ref> shows the performance of the Golden code on the single-relay single-antenna channel.</p><p>The performance of the channel without relay is also shown in the figures. In this case, the frame length is 4 symbols. Compared to the non-cooperative case, the Golden code achieves diversity 2.</p><p>For 4-QAM, a gain of 12.5 dB (resp. 13.8, 14.3 and 14.8 dB) is observed for ρ = 0 dB (resp. 5, 10 and 20 dB) at FER = 10 -4 . First of all, note that in the low SNR regime, the non-cooperative channel is better than the cooperative channel. This is due to the error cumulation (at the relay) which is more significant than the diversity gain provided by the relay in this regime. Then, we see that the difference between ρ = 10 dB and ρ = 20 dB is negligible, which means that a geometric gain of 10 dB is enough to achieve the (almost) best performance of the Golden code. In practice, it is often possible to find this kind of "helping agent" (with a geometric gain of 10 dB). When we increase the spectral efficiency (64-QAM), same phenomena can be observed except that the gain of the relay channel is reduced. Still, a gain of 6.3 and 9.5 dB can be obtained at FER = 10 -4 for ρ = 0 and 20 dB.</p><p>The performance of C 4,1 on the four-relay single-antenna channel is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. The frame length is 16. For ρ = 20 dB, a gain of 21 dB (resp. 12.8 dB) at FER = 10 -4 is obtained with 4-QAM (resp. 64-QAM).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Multi-Antenna Channel</head><p>1) A (1, 2, 1)-Relay Channel: As an example for the case n r &gt; n s , we consider the (1, 2, 1)</p><p>channel. Here, we use the virtual N-relay scheme with N = 2. As discussed in section III-A.2, the diversity order of this scheme is comparable to the 2-relay single-antenna channel. To compare these two channels, we use the same code C 2,1 . The performance is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>. As compared to the 2-relay single-antenna channel, the (1, 2, 1) channel has a gain of 1.5 dB at FER = 10 -4</p><p>with ρ = 0 dB. With ρ = 20 dB, the two channels have essentially the same performance. In fact, the inter-relay cooperation in the virtual two-relay channel improves the receive SNR (3 dB) of the source-relay channel with antenna combining. Thus, the geometric gain ρ is increased effectively. However, as stated before, the global performace is not sensitive to ρ for large ρ's.</p><p>This is why there is a gain only with small ρ's.</p><p>2) A (2, 2, 2)-Relay Channel: In the case of n s ≥ n r , we consider a single-relay channel with two antennas at each terminal. The code C 1,2 is actually the 4 × 4 Perfect code. For the non-cooperative scenario, we take the same code for fairness of comparison. More precisely, the non-cooperative channel we consider here is equivalent to a cooperative channel with π 3 = 0 and π 1 = π 2 . As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">10</ref>, the gain of the cooperative channel over the non-cooperative channel is much less significant in the SNRs of interest. This is because the diversity order of the Perfect code in the two-antenna non-cooperative channel is already 4 and a diversity gain does not play an important role in the scope of interest. Note that at FER = 10 -5 , the gain of the cooperative channel with ρ = 0 dB over the non-cooperative channel is 2 dB for 4-QAM and 3 dB for 64-QAM. Also note that the difference between different ρ's is within 1 dB.</p><p>3) A (2, 2, 2)-Relay Channel with Shadowing: In this scenario, we consider the shadowing effect of a wireless channel. Assume that each link between terminals is shadowed. Mathematically, the channel matrix is multiplied by a random scalar variable, the shadowing coefficient.</p><p>Suppose that this variable is log-normal distributed of variance 7 dB <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and that the shadowing is independent for different links. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">11</ref> shows the performance of the cooperative channel with the use of C 1,2 (4-QAM) at ρ = 0 dB, as compared to the non-cooperative channel. FER is the averaged frame error rate on the channel fading and the shadowing. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">11</ref>, the slope of the FER-SNR curve of the non-cooperative channel is reduced as compared to the non-shadowing case, in the scale of interest <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">6</ref> . Since the shadowing is independent between different links, the cooperative channel mitigates the shadowing effect and we get a larger gain over the non-cooperative channel than in the non-shadowing case (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">10(a)</ref>). At FER = 10 -4 , this gain is 8 dB, in contrast to 1.2 dB in the non-shadowing case (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">10(a)</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper, a half-duplex MIMO amplify-and-forward cooperative diversity scheme is studied. We derived the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of a MIMO Rayleigh product channel, from which we obtain a lower bound on the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of a MIMO NAF cooperative channel. Moreover, we established a lower and upper bound on the maximum diversity order of the proposed MIMO NAF channel and showed that they coincide when the numbers of antenna satisfy certain conditions. Based on the non-vanishing determinant criterion, we constructed a family of short space-time block codes that achieve the DMT of our MIMO NAF model. Our construction is systematic and applies to a system with arbitrary number of relays and arbitrary number of antennas. Numerical results on some explicit example codes revealed that significant gain in terms of SNR can be obtained even with some non-optimized parameters. This gain is much more important in the single-antenna case than in the MIMO case. Fortunately, in reality, it is also the case that we need cooperative diversity only when local antenna array is not available.</p><p>Nevertheless, it still remains two important open problems to solve :</p><p>1) optimization of the power allocation factors: Based on the statistical knowledge of the channel (notably ρ), how to choose the factors π i 's in order to optimize the code performance according to certain criteria? We set π 1 = 2π 2 = 2π 3 for simplicity. It is clear that the optimal DMT is independent of these parameters. However, in practice, for different ρ and SNR, the factor π i 's are significant for the performance (e.g., the error rate performance).</p><p>How to analyze the impact theoretically is an interesting future work;</p><p>2) optimization of the matrix B B B: we set B B B to be identity matrix and derived the lower bound <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Based on the receiver CSI at the relay, is there an optimal matrix B B B that gives a better DMT than the lower bound ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">12</ref>)?
