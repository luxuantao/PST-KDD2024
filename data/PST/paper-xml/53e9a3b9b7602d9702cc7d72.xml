<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are relatively new communication paradigms. MANETs do not require expensive base stations or wired infrastructure. Nodes within radio range of each other can communicate directly over wireless links, and those that are far apart use other nodes as relays. Each host in a MANET also acts as a router as routes are mostly multihop. The lack of fixed infrastructure and centralized authority makes a MANET suitable for a broad range of applications in both military and civilian environments. For example, a MANET could be deployed quickly for military communications in the battlefield. A MANET also could be deployed quickly in scenarios such as a meeting room, a city transportation wireless network, for fire fighting, and so on. To form such a cooperative and self-configurable network, every mobile host should be a friendly node and willing to relay messages for others. In the original design of a MANET, global trustworthiness in nodes within the whole network is a fundamental security assumption.</p><p>Recent progress in wireless communications and micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS) technology has made it feasible to build miniature wireless sensor nodes that integrate sensing, data processing, and communicating capabilities. These miniature wireless sensor nodes can be extremely small, as tiny as a cubic centimeter. Compared with conventional computers, the low-cost, battery-powered, sensor nodes have a limited energy supply, stringent processing and communications capabilities, and memory is scarce. The design and implementation of relevant services for WSNs must keep these limitations in mind. Based on the collaborative efforts of a large number of sensor nodes, WSNs have become good candidates to provide economically viable solutions for a wide range of applications, such as environmental monitoring, scientific data collection, health monitoring, and military operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>An example WSN is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the WSN is deployed to detect targets. After sensor nodes detect a target, they can collaboratively route data to a base station for analysis. Then, the base station can transmit data further to users through another communications infrastructure, for example, the Internet.</p><p>Despite the wide variety of potential applications, MANETs and WSNs often are deployed in adverse or even hostile environments. Therefore, they cannot be readily deployed without first addressing security challenges. Due to the features of an open medium, the low degree of physical security of mobile nodes, a dynamic topology, a limited power supply, and the absence of a central management point <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>, MANETs are more vulnerable to malicious attacks than traditional wired networks are. In WSNs, the lack of physical security combined with unattended operations make sensor nodes </p></div>

Therefore, they cannot be readily deployed without first addressing security challenges.</p><p>prone to a high risk of being captured and compromised, making WSNs vulnerable to a variety of attacks. So far, research to find security solutions for MANETs and WSNs has originated from the prevention point of view. For example, in both networks, there exist many key distribution and management schemes that can be built based on link-layer security architecture, prevention of denial of service attacks, and secure routing protocols. There is also research targeted to specific services and applications. For example, one of the most important purposes of deploying WSNs is to collect relevant data. In a data collection process, aggregation was required to save energy, thus prolonging the lifetime of a WSN. However, aggregation primitives are vulnerable to node compromise attacks. This leads to falsely aggregated results by a compromised aggregator. Hence, effective techniques are required to verify the integrity of aggregated results.</p><p>Prevention-based approaches can significantly reduce potential attacks. However, they cannot totally eliminate intrusions. After a node is compromised, all the secrets associated with the node are open to attacks. This renders prevention-based techniques less helpful for guarding against malicious insiders. In practice, insiders can cause much greater damage. Therefore, intrusion detection systems (IDSs), serving as the second line of defense, are indispensable in providing a highly-secured information system. By modeling behaviors of proper activities, an IDS can effectively identify potential intruders and thus provide in-depth protection.</p><p>In this article, we first provide a brief introduction to an IDS. Then, we present challenges in constructing IDSs for mobile ad hoc networks and wireless sensor networks and survey their existing intrusion detection techniques. Finally, we point out important future research directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRUSION DETECTION TECHNIQUES</head><p>An intrusion is defined as a set of actions that compromises confidentiality, availability, and integrity of a system. Intrusion detection is a security technology that attempts to identify those who are trying to break into and misuse a system without authorization and those who have legitimate access to the system but are abusing their privileges. The system can be a host computer, network equipment, a firewall, a router, a corporate network, or any information system being monitored by an intrusion detection system.</p><p>An IDS dynamically monitors a system and users' actions in the system to detect intrusions. Because an information system can suffer from various kinds of security vulnerabilities, it is both technically difficult and economically costly to build and maintain a system that is not susceptible to attacks. Experience teaches us never to rely on a single defensive technique. An IDS, by analyzing the system and users' operations, in search of undesirable and suspicious activities, may effectively monitor and protect against threats.</p><p>Generally, there are two types of intrusion detection: misuse-based detection and anomalybased detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>. A misuse-based detection technique encodes known attack signatures and system vulnerabilities and stores them in a database. If a deployed IDS finds a match between current activities and signatures, an alarm is generated. Misuse detection techniques are not effective to detect novel attacks because of the lack of corresponding signatures. An anomaly-based detection technique creates normal profiles of system states or user behaviors and compares them with current activities. If a significant deviation is observed, the IDS raises an alarm. Anomaly detection can detect unknown attacks. However, normal profiles are usually very difficult to build. For example, in a MANET, mobility-induced dynamics make it challenging to distinguish between normalcy and anomaly. It is, therefore, more challenging to distinguish between false alarms and real intrusions. The capability to establish normal profiles is crucial in designing an efficient, anomalybased IDS.</p><p>As a promising alternative, specificationbased detection techniques combine the advantages of misuse detection and anomaly detection by using manually developed specifications to characterize legitimate system behaviors. Specifi-I Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. An example of a wireless sensor network. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRUSION DETECTION IN A MANET ATTACK MODELS</head><p>It is very challenging to present a once-for-all detection approach. The analysis of existing attack models can facilitate the extraction of effective features, which turns out to be one of the most important steps in building an IDS.</p><p>The following are representative types of attacks in the context of a MANET IDS:</p><p>• Routing Logic Compromise: In routing protocols, typical attack scenarios include black hole, routing update storm, fabrication, and modification of various fields in routing control packets (for example, route request message, route reply message, route error message, etc.) during different phases of routing procedures. All these attacks can lead to serious dysfunction in a MANET. • Traffic Distortion: This includes attacks such as packet dropping, packet corruption, data flooding, and so on. Motivated by their different objectives, attackers may take different actions to manipulate packets. For example, attackers may randomly, periodically, or selectively drop received packets to selfishly save power or intentionally prevent other nodes from receiving data. In addition to these, attacks such as rushing, wormhole, and spoofing also have been discussed in the context of a MANET. Furthermore, it is not difficult to fabricate intrusions based on the combination of attacks mentioned previously.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXISTING RESEARCH</head><p>The pioneer ID research in the context of a MANET appears in a series of works in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In the system concept, an agent is attached to each node. Each node can perform intrusion detection and response functionality individually. One of the most important steps in IDS research is to construct effective features. Focusing on MANET routing protocols, Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref> use an unsupervised method to construct a feature set and select an essential set of features (e.g., distance to a destination, node moving velocity, the percentage of changed routes, the percentage of changes in the sum of hops of all routes, etc.) that have high information gain. Information gain is an important metric to measure the effectiveness of features. Features with high information gain can facilitate a constructed IDS to achieve desirable performance. Different routing protocols may result in different feature sets.</p><p>Intrusion detection can be formulated as a pattern classification problem, in which classifiers are designed to classify observed activities as normal or intrusive. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>, based on an identified feature set, Zhang et al. apply two wellknown classifiers, RIPPER and support vector machine (SVM) Light, to construct a suite of anomaly detection models. RIPPER is a decision-tree equivalent classifier for rule induction. By separating provided data into appropriate classes, RIPPER can compute rules for the system. SVM Light can produce a more accurate classifier when the data that is provided cannot be represented by the given set of features.</p><p>Because of the locality of one intrusion session, post-processing also is introduced to filter out false alarms. In post-processing, if there are more abnormal predictions than normal predictions in a predefined period of time, activities defined in this period of time are deemed abnormal. In this way, spurious errors that occur during normal sessions can be removed.</p><p>Because of the importance of feature selection in IDS research, Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> further introduce a new learning-based method to utilize cross-feature analysis to capture inter-feature correlation patterns. Suppose that L features, f 1 , f 2 , …, f L , are identified, where each f i denotes one feature characterizing either topology or route activities. The classification problem to be solved is to create a set of classification model</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C i : {f 1 , …, f i-1 , f i+1 , …, f L } → f i from the training pro- cess.</formula><p>Here one feature f i is chosen as the target to classify. Then, the classification model C i can be used to identify temporal correlation between one feature and all of the other features. The prediction of C i is very likely in normal situations. However, when there are malicious events, the prediction of C i becomes very unlikely. Based on this, normal events and abnormal events can be distinguished.</p><p>Local detection alone is not sufficient because of the distributed nature of a MANET. Huang and Lee <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> further elaborate on mechanisms in which one node can collaborate with its neighbors and initiate a detection process over a broader range. This can provide not only more accurate detection results, but also more information in terms of attack types and sources. After fairly and periodically electing a monitoring node in a cluster of neighboring MANET mobiles, a cluster-based detection scheme is proposed. <ref type="bibr">Each</ref>  Based on a specification-based approach to describe major functionality of Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing algorithms at data layers and routing layers, Huang and Lee <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> propose an extended finite state automaton (EFSA), where transitions and states can carry a finite set of parameters. In this way, the proposed EFSA can detect invalid state violations, incorrect transition violations, and unexpected action violations. The construction of EFSA can lead naturally to a specification-based approach. Based on a set of statistical features, statistic learning algorithms are then adopted to detect abnormal patterns from anomalous basic events.</p><p>Based on Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols, Marti et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> propose to install extra facilities, watchdog and pathrater, to identify and respond to routing misbehaviors in a MANET. In data transmission processes, a node may misbehave by agreeing to forward packets and then fail to do so. Consider the example illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> to understand the watchdog approach. Suppose a path exists from a source node S to a destination node D through intermediate nodes A, B, and C. Node A can overhear node B's transmissions. Node A cannot transmit directly to node C and must go through node B. To detect whether node B is misbehaving, node A can maintain a buffer of packets recently sent by node A. Node A then compares each overheard packet from node B with a buffered packet of node A to see if there is a match. A failure tally for node B increases if node A finds that node B is supposed to forward a packet but fails to do so. If the tally is above one threshold, node B is deemed to be misbehaving. Each node maintains a rating for each node it knows about in the network. Then, a path metric can be calculated by averaging the node ratings in the path. Pathrater <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> can then select the path with the highest metric. Marti et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> also discuss several limitations of this approach, including limitations resulting from packet collisions, false reports of node misbehavior, and potential watchdog circumvention mechanisms.</p><p>Focusing on AODV routing protocols, Tseng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> propose a specification-based ID technique. A finite state machine (FSM) is constructed to specify correct behaviors of AODV, that is, to maintain each branch of a route request/route reply (RREQ/RREP) flow by monitoring all of the RREQ and RREP messages from a source node to a destination node. Then, the constructed specification is compared with actual behaviors of monitored neighbors. The distributed network monitor passively listens to AODV routing protocols, captures RREQ and RREP messages, and detects run-time violations of the specifications. A tree data structure and a node coloring scheme also are proposed to detect most of the serious attacks.</p><p>Sun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> propose using a Markov chain Considering that one of the main challenges in building a MANET IDS is to integrate mobility with IDSs and to adjust IDS behavior, Sun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> demonstrate that a node's moving speed, a commonly used parameter in tuning MANET performance, is not an effective metric to tune IDS performance under different mobility models. Sun et al. then propose an adaptive scheme, in which suitable normal profiles and corresponding proper thresholds can be selected adaptively by each local IDS through periodically measuring its local link change rate, a proposed performance metric that can reflect mobility levels. The proposed scheme is less dependent on underlying mobility models and can further improve performance.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRUSION DETECTION IN A WSN</head><p>Similar to security research in a MANET, many prevention-based approaches in a WSN have been proposed. These approaches address challenges including key establishment, trust set up, privacy, authentication, secure routing, and highlevel security services. However, the large-scale decentralized deployment of a WSN and the lack of physical security make prevention-based schemes inadequate after sensor nodes have been compromised. Therefore, an IDS can also offer adequate security protection for a WSN.</p><p>In this section, we present a survey of existing IDS research in the context of a WSN. Compared with a MANET, a WSN provides a relatively newer communication paradigm. Therefore, there are fewer works that address the construction of a WSN IDS. Furthermore, different applications and services motivated by WSNs demonstrate different characteristics. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate ID approaches with corresponding applications because attacks targeted at different applications and services demonstrate different manifestations. In the following, we use two important services of a WSN, secure aggregation and secure localization, to illustrate current WSN IDS research efforts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHALLENGES</head><p>The unique characteristics of sensor nodes pose challenges to the construction of a WSN IDS. A WSN has a limited power supply, thus requiring energy-efficient protocols and applications to maximize the lifetime of sensor networks. Sensor nodes have stringent system resources in terms of memory and computational capabilities, making intensive calculations impractical. Sensor nodes are prone to failure. This results in frequent network topology changes. Also, a WSN usually is densely deployed, causing serious radio channel contention and scalability problems. The design of an effective WSN IDS must bear in mind all of these challenges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SECURE LOCALIZATION IN WSNS</head><p>Many WSN applications require that sensor nodes have location information. Due to cost considerations, it is still not practical to equip every sensor node with a global positioning system (GPS) receiver. Therefore, many localization protocols have been proposed to help sensor nodes to estimate their locations. To utilize localization protocols, some special nodes, called beacon nodes, often are used. These beacon nodes are assumed to know their locations and transmit their locations to other non-beacon nodes through beacon packets. Non-beacon nodes also estimate certain measurements (e.g., received signal strength indicator) based on received beacon packets. Such measurements and the location information contained in beacon packets usually are referred to as location references. After non-beacon nodes collect enough location references, these nodes can then estimate their locations.</p><p>Localization protocols may become vulnerable when a WSN is deployed in a hostile environment. For example, beacon nodes may be compromised, thus providing incorrect information to mislead location estimation at non-beacon nodes. Therefore, secure location discovery services are required to ensure the normal operation of a WSN.</p><p>Utilizing deployment knowledge of a WSN and based on the fact that probability distribution functions of sensor locations usually can be modeled prior to deployment, Du et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> propose that each non-beacon node can efficiently detect location anomalies by verifying whether estimated locations are consistent with the deployment knowledge. For example, if a group of sensor nodes are dropped out of an airplane sequentially as the plane flies forward, normal distributions can be used to model the deployment distribution of this group of sensor nodes. Each non-beacon node can compare its estimated locations with the deployment knowledge. If the level of inconsistency is above a predefined threshold, sensor nodes can decide that received location references are malicious.</p><p>Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> also propose a suite of approaches to filter out malicious location references. The first approach is based on minimum mean square error. Based on the observation that malicious location references and benign ones are usually inconsistent, non-beacon nodes can compute an inconsistency level of received location references. The inconsistency level is represented by a mean square error of estimation. If the mean square error is larger than a threshold, non-beacon nodes could think that the received set of location references is malicious. The second approach is the voting-based location estimation method. Specifically, the deployed area is divided into a grid of cells. The non-beacon node can then have every received location reference vote on the cells in which this node may reside and thus decide how likely this node is in each cell. After the voting process, the center of the cells with the highest votes may be used as the estimated location.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SECURE AGGREGATION IN WSNS</head><p>Aggregation has become one of the required operations for a WSN to save energy. One example of an aggregation tree is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. Nodes A, B, …, N denote different sensor nodes in WSNs, respectively. f denotes an aggregation function (average, sum, maximum, minimum, count, etc.). If node I is compromised, it can send false reports to node J. However, many existing schemes are designed without sufficient security in mind and cannot detect the above malicious behavior. Preventing this malicious behavior is the secure aggregation problem.</p><p>Based on statistical estimation theory, Wagner <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> introduces a theoretical framework to model and to analyze the resilient data aggregation problem. After concluding that commonly used aggregation functions are insecure, Wagner proposed using robust statistics for resilient aggregation. Finally, several general techniques, such as truncation (to place upper and lower bounds on an acceptable range of a sensor reading) and trimming (for instance, to ignore the highest 5 percent and the lowest 5 percent of sensor readings) are used to help improve the resilience of aggregation functions.</p><p>Due to cost considerations, it is still not practical to equip every sensor node with a global positioning system (GPS) receiver. Therefore, many localization protocols have been proposed to help sensor nodes to estimate their locations.</p><p>Combining prevention-based and detectionbased approaches, Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> propose a Secure Hop-by-Hop Data Aggregation Protocol (SDAP) for WSNs. The design of SDAP is based on divide-and-conquer and commit-and-attest principles. Specifically, a probabilistic grouping method is used to dynamically divide nodes into multiple logical groups of similar sizes. In each logical group, a hop-by-hop aggregation is performed and one aggregate is generated from each group. This hop-by-hop aggregation is enhanced to ensure that each group cannot deny its committed aggregate. After receiving all the group aggregates, the base station can apply an approach based on the Grubbs' test to identify suspicious groups. This approach can help expunge outliers from received aggregates. Finally, each group under study must participate in the attestation process and prove the correctness of its group aggregates. After the attestation process, the base station can calculate the final aggregate over all the group aggregates that are either normal or have passed the attestation process.</p><p>Motivated by research in computer vision and automated cartography, Buttyán et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> propose a random sample consensus (RANSAC) paradigm for resilient aggregation in a WSN. RANSAC is an outlier elimination technique that can handle a high percentage of outlier measurement data. Specifically, RANSAC uses as few non-attacked data as possible to determine an initial model. Assuming that the nonattacked data follow normal distributions, the RANSAC algorithm uses maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to estimate the parameters of the initial model. After the initial model is decided, RANSAC tries to enlarge the initial dataset with consistent data. Outlier measurements can then be filtered out, even if a large quantity of sensor nodes is compromised.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS</head><p>In this section, we discuss future research directions to construct IDSs for both MANETs and WSNs.</p><p>In the system concept, IDS research for both MANETs and WSNs requires a distributed architecture and the collaboration of a group of nodes to make accurate decisions. ID techniques also should be integrated with existing MANET and WSN applications. This requires an understanding of deployed applications and related attacks to deploy suitable ID mechanisms. Attack models must be carefully established to facilitate the deployment of ID strategies. Also, solutions must consider resource constraints in terms of computation, energy, communication, and memory. This is especially important in the context of a WSN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXTENDED KALMAN FILTER-BASED SECURE AGGREGATION FOR A WSN</head><p>In this section, we use secure in-network aggregation problems in a WSN as one example of how to create a lightweight ID mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In a WSN, consecutive observations of sensor nodes usually are highly correlated in time domains. This correlation, along with the collaborative nature of WSNs, makes it possible to predict future observed values based on previous values. Therefore, it is a viable approach to estimate aggregated in-network values, based on the normal profiles that can be constructed. However, in practice, due to high packet-loss rate, harsh environment, sensing uncertainty, and other issues, it is challenging to provide an accurate estimate for actual aggregated value. Also, the lack of time synchronization among children and parent nodes could make aggregation nodes use different sets of values for aggregation. The complexity of existing aggregation protocols also contributes to the challenges of modeling in-network aggregated values.</p><p>To construct normal profiles for aggregated in-network values in the face of the previously mentioned challenges, solutions based on statistical estimation theory can be applied. Suitable models must consider the requirement of service and the application environment. For example, suppose that we are interested in estimating temperature values, which are scalar variables. We may adopt an extended Kalman filter (EKF) because an EKF can provide an accurate and lightweight estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. By enabling neighbor-monitoring mechanisms, each node can use an EKF to monitor the behavior of one of its neighbors. An EKF-based mechanism is suitable for WSN nodes, because this mechanism can address those incurred uncertainties in a lightweight manner and compute relatively accurate estimates of aggregated values, which based upon a normal range can be approximated. Utilizing a threshold-based mechanism, a promiscuously overheard value then is compared with a locally computed normal range to decide whether they are significantly different.</p><p>Furthermore, the monitored environment demonstrates spatial and temporal characteristics. Therefore, it is promising to integrate these characteristics into ID model construction. For example, there are existing works that model spatial and temporal properties of correlated data in a WSN. It is, therefore, desirable to integrate these models into the construction of normal profiles for in-network aggregated values. In this way, an anomaly-based ID service can be provided for secure aggregation in a WSN.</p><p>A WSN often is deployed to monitor emergency phenomena (such as the outbreak of a forest fire), about which good nodes can trigger </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">V i C D E V 1 V 2 V 3 F I H Base station K f(V 1 ,V 2 , V 3 ) J L G M N</formula><p>important events and generate unusual yet important information. Node collaboration is necessary for sensor networks to make correct decisions about abnormal events. Therefore, for WSNs, intrusion detection modules (IDM) and system monitoring modules (SMM) must integrate with each other to work effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. When node A raises an alert on node B because of an event E, to decide whether E is malicious or emergent, node A may initiate a further investigation on E by collaborating with existing SMMs. WSNs usually are densely deployed to collaboratively monitor events. To save energy, some sensor nodes are periodically scheduled to sleep. Based on this, node A can wake up those sensor nodes (denoted as co-detectors in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) around node B and request from these nodes their opinions on the behavior of node B about event E. After node A collects the information from these nodes, if it finds that the majority of sensor nodes think that event E may happen, node A then makes a decision that E is triggered by some emergency events. On the other hand, if node A finds that the majority of sensor nodes think that event E should not happen, then node A thinks that E is triggered by either a malicious node or a faulty yet good node. To make a final decision, node A can continue to wake up those nodes around event E and request their opinions about event E. If node A finds that the majority of sensor nodes think that event E should not happen, node A then suspects that node B is malicious. scheme is demonstrated to be less dependent on underlying mobility models and can further reduce the false positive ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. However, the performance of the proposed adaptive scheme at high mobility levels still is not as good as expected. It also is very challenging to construct mobility-independent MANET IDSs because this requires the extraction of mobility-independent features. Furthermore, how to systematically test the performance of MANET IDSs is still an on-going work.</p></div>
