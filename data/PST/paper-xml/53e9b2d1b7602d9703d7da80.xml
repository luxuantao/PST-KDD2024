<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Online health information has become one of the most important information sources for people seeking health information in recent years. With the increasing availability of online medical information sources, as well as the desire to take more responsibility for health and controlling costs, a growing number of people are using the Internet to find health related information. According to Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project, 61% of the American adult Internet users searched for health information online and 60% of them said the information found online affects their health care decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The health information being searched includes advice and information regarding conditions, symptoms, and treatment options <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[61]</ref>. The advantages of using online health information include cost savings, privacy protection, lack of embarrassment, efficient and effective retrieval of information, and the ability to tailor information to meet one's needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">72]</ref>. Online health information searches could improve healthcare outcomes by reducing the health care disparity and encouraging patients' active interaction with doctors <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>An increasing number of papers on health information systems (IS) have recently been published in the IS field. Most existing IS studies, however, examine topics relating to the adoption and impact of health information technology (IT) from a healthcare provider perspective. IS literature on online health information usage from the patient's perceptive is scanty. Developing an understanding of online health information search behavior may assist government agencies in designing policies which improve the allocation of resources to better disseminate quality health information and to inform patients about its accuracy. In addition, it may provide insights into the design of online health information websites and increase the effectiveness of using online health information. In response to recent calls in the literature for more studies on users' online health information behavior and patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, this paper examines how IT and health factors affect people's online information search behavior. More specifically, we attempt to answer the following questions:</p><p>Q1 How can we characterize users' health care information search behavior? Q2 What factors could affect users' health care information search behavior?</p><p>This paper examines people's search for information regarding cancer in particular. Cancer has a high incidence rate (about 1.5 million new cases of cancer were diagnosed in 2010; about 457 per 100,000 people) and mortality rate (for the year 2010, 178.4 deaths per 100,000 people) in the U.S. and diagnosis could generate fear and distress in patients and family members. To cope with this life-threatening illness both physically and psychologically, people (both those who have cancer and those who do not) seek cancer related information, including emotional information, on the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>. Currently, a vast amount of information on all aspects of cancer is available online, which could be used by cancer patients for treatment decisions, medical consultations and social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[74]</ref>, as well as by non-cancer patients for prevention, screening and risk evaluation.</p><p>The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, our research contributes to online health information literature by proposing a framework to examine online health information search behavior. The paper also links digital inequality to health inequality and contributes to health communication literature by theorizing and testing how patient-physician communication affects patients' online health information usage. Second, our study examines users' online health information search behavior from three aspects: frequency of search, diversity of search, and preference of information search channel. It provides a more comprehensive view to understanding online health information search.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews prior research background and Section 3 proposes hypotheses. Data and results are presented in Section 4. The implications, limitations and future research are discussed in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Prior research background</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Health information seeking</head><p>Information seeking is motivated by information needs, which is the perception of knowledge insufficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19]</ref>. Health information needs include both cognitive needs, which include information for disease prevention and treatment, and affective needs, which include information for coping with illness emotionally <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">71]</ref>. Health information could be used by people with an illness in order to understand their diagnosis and treatment options as well as by healthy people for risk evaluation and disease prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Users' health information search are found to be related to their individual characteristics and situational factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. Individual characteristics include both socioeconomic and psychological characteristics. For example, a high-income, married and somewhat youthful female is more likely to be engaged in the search of health information <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. An individual with a higher health value and an internal health locus of control tends to search more for health information <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. O'Keefe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref> found personal health orientation could predict a person's preference toward health information channels. Wilkinson and Wilson <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[70]</ref> posited that prior knowledge could reduce the incentive to search for further health information. Anxiety was proposed to affect health information searches but the findings on this are mixed-while some studies suggested anxiety associated with diagnosis motivated patients to seek information <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>, other studies found patients may cope with the anxiety by avoiding additional information <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[70]</ref>.</p><p>Situational factors include the environment, the information source, and the information-seeking context <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. For example, area of residence, hospital visits, and disease-related factors have an impact on people's health information search behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Also, emotional and social support from family and friends as well as encouragement from physicians have positive effects on information searches <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Oetzel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref> proposed that a subject's culture, including self-construals, ethnic identity, and cultural health attributions, could affect preferences toward the information source, message, and channel.</p><p>Health information seeking behavior has been studied in public health literature and communication literature and has been interpreted in different theories: Johnson and Meischke <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> developed a comprehensive model of information seeking and posited that an individual's demographic, experience with cancer, salience of cancer information and belief in the efficacy of information, determines the utility of the information carrier he/she is using, which in turn affects his/her information search behavior. Griffin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> proposed a risk information seeking and processing (RISP) model where individual's relevant channel belief, perceived information gathering capacity and information sufficiency could affect information seeking and processing. Perceived information gathering capacity includes self-efficacy and perceived ability to carry out the search. Channel belief involves people's perceived trustworthiness and usefulness of the media they are using to seek for the information. Information sufficiency is the gap between the information people have and the information they need to deal with risks. When people perceive the discrepancy between desired knowledge and the knowledge they possess, they will tend to fill this gap by seeking new information. Similarly, Rimal and Real <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref> proposed that people's use of health information is affected by the interaction of perceived risk and self-efficacy. If the perceived risk and self-efficacy are high, people are motivated to search for risk information. In contrast, if the perceived risk and self-efficacy are low, people will tend to avoid the risk information.</p><p>Health information could be obtained through various channels that include face-to-face channels (e.g., health care providers and family) and mediated channels (e.g., mass media and the Internet). Traditional health information seeking literature has examined people's choices over different information channels. While interpersonal channels are deemed more effective in reducing uncertainty and suited for special information needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>, Dutta-Bergman <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> suggested that different information channels for health information are complementary rather than substitutable. He argued that a person's search for health information is determined by his/her health consciousness. Therefore, searched health information through one of the information channels indicates a high likelihood of searched information through other available channels as well. Other factors also could affect people's choices. For example, Wilson <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[71]</ref> posited that accessibility and credibility of information channels would affect searchers' channel choice.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a framework to study users' online health information seeking behavior. It departs from previous research in following ways: First, while previous research studies health information seeking in general, our paper focuses on health information seeking through a particular channel-the Internet. Second, while previous studies focus on one aspect of search behavior, our characterization includes frequency, diversity, and preference of search thereby providing a more comprehensive view of users' online health information search behavior. Third, our paper links both IT and heath related factors to online health information searches, which provides insight into the facilitating conditions and motivations of search behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Online health information</head><p>Online health information could empower patients by assisting in assessing their illness, coping with the associated pressure and stress, and facilitating their medical decision-making. Online health information is also found to be an effective tool to persuade people to adopt healthy behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">67]</ref>.</p><p>Despite the availability of extensive health related information on the Internet and despite the information's impact on public health, there has been limited attention toward users' online search behaviors in IS literature. There is, however, a vast extent of literature that investigates online search behaviors in other online markets, written from a variety of perspectives ranging from technical to behavioral. For example, Kuruzovich et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref> compared consumers' search for vehicles in the online and offline market. They found that more price information online leads to more physical dealer visits, whereas more product information leads to fewer physical dealer visits. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[73]</ref> examined household searches for products on e-commerce websites. Their results suggest that the depth of a search is affected by broadband Internet adoption, product price, household education and age. Johnson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> modeled the depth and dynamic of users' online search behaviors and they found that active shoppers tend to visit more websites in a given month. Although these studies improve our understanding of searches in online markets, the domain for health care introduces an environment that is very different from online e-commerce in general. First, the information asymmetry becomes more serious in online health information searches. While customers can get information on the products they are interested in, based on their previous purchases and opinions of others, health information is unique to each individual. For instance, when using online information to purchase products such as software and books, a user knows what to expect <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62]</ref>. In the case of healthcare, however, there is uncertainness as to the efficacy of the information that is received. Second, within the health care domain, some health related variables should be taken into account. For example, diseases can be characterized as being acute, chronic, terminal, etc., and patients' search behaviors may become more or less intensive based upon the condition and type of disease. Third, while the primary incentives for online searches in an online market are to reduce search costs and lower product prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[73]</ref>, online health information searches also involve strong emotions including fear, anxiety and hope. Therefore, not all findings relating to e-commerce or online behaviors in general could be generalized to the health care domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research model</head><p>In this paper, we develop a conceptual model based upon the theory of information foraging <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>. Information foraging theory studies users' search behaviors on the web and it posits that users' search is motivated by their information needs and the search persists if the new information is relevant and useful. Also, it suggests that searchers tend to maximize the information gained when facing multiple information sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51]</ref>. Searches for online health information differ from other searches in the information channel people use (Internet) and the information content people search for (health information). Therefore, an exploration of online health information searches needs to incorporate both IT and health factors. We argue that people's online health information searches are motivated by their health information needs and enabled by IT. People's health information needs arise if their health status worsens or there is an unsatisfactory level of communication with doctors. IT facilitates people's searches in that online health information is more relevant if people have access to the Internet and have a positive attitude towards online information. Based on information foraging theory, we propose our conceptual model depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> to examine the effect of IT and health related factors on search for online health information. In this model health motivators reflect the sources of search's information needs and IT enablers affect the accessibility and value of the information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Online health information search</head><p>We characterized users' online health information search behaviors along three dimensions: frequency of search, diversity of search, and preference of using the Internet for an initial search. Frequency of searches represents how often a user searches for health information online. It captures a user's effort and his/her tendency toward using the Internet for health information. More frequent searches will expose searchers to a larger amount of online health information.</p><p>Online health information exists in a variety of formats ranging from traditional web pages to emerging social media, including blogs and online communities. Users can not only access health information provided by government agencies and health care providers, but also interact with patients with similar medical conditions. In this paper, we define the diversity of online health information searches as the variety of health related online resources a user utilizes during the process of online health information seeking. A more diverse search indicates a user's engagement in multiple types of health related online activities and a broader scope of search (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p><p>People can obtain health information through a variety of information channels, including the Internet, healthcare providers, medical books and journals, newspapers and magazines, and family and friends. The availability, trustworthiness, costs and benefits associated with different information channels vary and could have an impact on a user's health information channel choices which, in turn, could affect the quality and timeliness of the information obtained and the subsequent decisions made based upon that information. While health care providers remain the primary, formal, and perhaps the most trustworthy information source to some searchers, the Internet is being increasingly employed by people to look for health information due to its convenience, flexibility, immediacy, and vast array of information. In this paper, we attempt to investigate users' preferences of information channels for health information searches. Particularly, we focus on whether the Internet will be used to conduct the initial search when people face a health related problem. The initial search will provide necessary knowledge and information for subsequent searches. It plays an important role in forming peoples' perceptions and thus will have a significant impact on decision-making and health outcomes. In addition, the preference of online information channels represents when the searchers use the Internet for health information and how they determine their choice of information channels for health information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Ease of access to the Internet</head><p>Internet access has been considered as a key factor in the adoption of online services and use of online technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref>. Although the Internet is transforming all aspects of our lives, the digital inequality of Internet access remains. While the speed of the Internet has increased and the cost of high-speed Internet has dropped, one-third of Americans still do not have broadband Internet access <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.  In this paper, access to the Internet refers to the extent to which a user has an easy and fast Internet connection. As health information is usually intimate and sensitive, most users prefer to search at home instead of at work or on other public settings in order to avoid the risk of privacy disclosure <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref>. Thus, consistent with previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref>) , we consider a user has more access to the Internet if he or she has Internet connectivity, especially broadband, at home. Users with a broadband Internet connection tend to perceive the Internet as useful; they spend more time online and are engaged in a variety of online activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">73]</ref>. In addition, users who have access to high-speed Internet are likely to have more computer skills, more online experiences and better self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref>. Therefore, they use more online services <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref>. On the other side of the spectrum, previous research has found that limited access to the Internet could be a barrier to adopting online services. Low or no Internet access may lead to users' inabilities, inefficiencies and lower propensities to search for information online <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In line with previous studies which showed that adoption of broadband Internet could lead to an increase in quantity and diversity of consumption of online content <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, we extend the logic to the arena of health information search and propose that:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Trust</head><p>The important role trust plays in the online context has been well documented in the IS literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49]</ref>. Trust is especially crucial where there is uncertainty and lack of regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>. Previous literature distinguishes between dispositional, institutional, and interpersonal trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. This paper focuses on institutional trust, particularly informational trust. We define trust as the users' beliefs in the accuracy of the online medical information content. The trust of online health information could be determined by users' personalities, their individual medical knowledge, past experiences and overall social norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Since the information users found on the Internet would be used in assessment and diagnosis of their diseases and also in the decisional process, inaccurate or misleading medical information would cause negative consequences to a user's health <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Therefore, the more trust the users have in the online health information, the more useful they perceive the information to be and, consequently, they will invest more time and effort toward seeking health information on the Internet and they will be more likely to use different types of online information.</p><p>In addition, trust can reduce the complexity and uncertainty associated with online health information seeking <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, it can increase perceived control during the process of seeking health information <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>, and it, therefore, increases users' intentions of using the Internet for health information. Conversely, a lack of trust will lead to users' needs for further validation of the quality of the information, which demands a significant amount of cognitive effort and knowledge, and therefore it creates a barrier for online medical information usage. Based on the discussion above, we propose that A user's trust toward online health information is positively related to (H2A) the frequency of using the Internet for health information, (H2B) the diversity of using the Internet for health information, and (H2C) the preference of using the Internet for health information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Perceived health status</head><p>Perceived health status refers to individuals' perceptions of the level of their overall health. Perceived health status is an accurate indicator of health status and health risk factors, and represents the physiological, behavioral, social, and psychological factors which other objective measures fail to capture <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. Perceived poor health status is associated with physical factors such as lack of fitness, chronic illnesses and mortality as well as physiological factors such as distress and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>. In order to cope with anxiety and reduce uncertainty, searchers tend to collect more information. In addition, people perceiving their health statuses are poor may have more physician visits <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>. Previous studies have shown patients tend to search for health information prior to or after their doctor visits <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Therefore, a poorly perceived health status is more likely to lead to exploration of medical information on the Internet. In summary, people who perceived their health statuses as poor may have stronger health information needs and may become more involved in searching health information, thus, they use the Internet more frequently and more diversely.</p><p>Evidence from previous surveys and studies has shown that a perceived poor health status leads to diversity and an increase in online health information searches. For example, using data from Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project, Houston and Allison <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> found that people with fair/poor health statuses look for health information more frequently and are more likely to participate in online chat rooms than those with good health statuses. Baker et al. 's <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> study suggests that people who report worse health statuses are more likely to use the Internet for health information. Powell and Clarke <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref> found searches for information related to mental health were more prevalent among those with mental-health problems and/or with psychological distress. Therefore we propose that A user's perceived health status is negatively related to (H3A) the frequency of using the Internet for health information and (H3B) the diversity of using the Internet for health information.</p><p>In addition, as searchers with low health statuses have a higher demand for health information, the advantages of the Internet, i.e. low cost and immediacy, cause it to appear more salient over other information channels. Also, searchers who perceive their health statuses to be low, especially those with chronic diseases, may have been paying more attention to their health and intentionally exposing themselves to health related information, therefore they have more knowledge about their conditions, which make their online searches more focused, efficient and accurate. In contrast, those who perceive their health statuses as good may have less medical knowledge and online health search experience. Therefore, traditional interactive information channels, such as face-to-face doctor visits, would be more suitable and generate more value than online searches. We hypothesize that (H3C) A user's perceived health status is negatively related to the preference of using the Internet for health information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Quality of communication with doctors</head><p>Patient-physician communication includes the information flow between a patient and a physician <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[65]</ref>. In this paper, we focus on the patient's perspective, which is the patient's perception of the quality of communication. Patients' perceptions of the quality of communication refer to the quality of information the patients gain from their interaction with doctors and their recollection and understanding of the information. The patient-physician communication could help the patient understand the severity and the nature of his/her illness and disease, understand his/her treatment options and help to make decisions about further visits <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47]</ref>. Previous studies have shown that high quality patient-physician communication could improve patient satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[64]</ref>, patient self-management <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, and healthcare outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[65]</ref>. It could also help reduce patient cost and the number of malpractice lawsuit claims <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47]</ref>.</p><p>Although doctors remain the most important information channel from which patients can obtain health information, patients may seek to use other information channels as complements if their information needs cannot be met. During the interaction with their doctors, patients attempt to seek "as much information as possible" <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref>. If the patients perceive the communication quality as low, or their information needs are unmet, leaving uncertainty high, they will rely on other information channels including the Internet. Moreover, they are more likely to use the Internet to validate the information they obtained during their encounters with doctors, or they may tend to collect more information online to improve the communication results before the next doctor's visit. Therefore, we hypothesize:</p><p>The perceived quality of the communication with doctors is negatively related to (H4A) the frequency of using the Internet for health information, (H4B) the diversity of using the Internet for health information, and (H4C) the preference for using the Internet for health information.</p><p>We summarize the above discussion in the following model:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Control variables</head><p>Demographic variables: Previous studies have shown that users' socio-economic statuses may affect their information technology usage especially online health information usages <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>. Thus, we included some demographic variables in our models to account for these effects. Those variables include age, income, gender, education and race.</p><p>Two other control variables are healthcare insurance and being a cancer patient. That is, whether or not a person possesses healthcare insurance will determine the extent to which a person can access affordable health care, which could, in turn, affect the way that person chooses and uses health care related resources, including online health information. Also, a patient who was diagnosed with cancer would have stronger information needs for cancer related information and therefore would be more likely to use cancer related or other online health information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Data</head><p>This study uses the 2003 health information national trends survey (HINTS) to test the hypotheses. HINTS is conducted by the National Cancer Institute to study people's health information behaviors (please see <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> for the details of the survey). HINTS data has been used in previous literature to examine a variety of issues related to people's health communications, disease prevention, patient behaviors and cancer education <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">60]</ref>.</p><p>Since the focus of this study is to investigate users' online health information behavior, our data analysis excludes those who have never used the Internet before. Second, since we attempted to examine how perceived communication quality with doctors would affect peoples' use of online health information, we exclude those respondents who did not provide this information. Also, we exclude the samples that have missing values on any of the variables in our model. The final sample size for our data analysis is 2806.</p><p>Of the 2806 respondents, 37.1% are male, 45.6% attended college, 54.5% have annual household incomes above $50,000 and the average age is 43 (SD = 14.3). 11% of the respondents have been diagnosed with cancer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Measurement</head><p>All measures in this study were extracted or constructed from items in HINTS data which can be found in Appendix Table <ref type="table">A1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Dependent variables</head><p>The frequency of using the Internet for health information: three items from HINTS were used to construct categorical variables.</p><p>Respondents were first asked when the last time they looked for online health information was. For those respondents who had looked for online health information before, they were further asked if they have specifically looked for cancer related information online. If they had, they were then asked how often they have done so. Respondents who have never searched for online health information were used as a reference (first) category. Respondents fell into the second category if they have searched for other online health information, but not cancer related information. The remaining respondents were put into the third to the sixth category based upon how often they searched for cancer related information online.</p><p>Diversity of using Internet for health information: Respondents were asked if they conducted the following activities on the Internet-(1) buying medicine or vitamins online, (2) participating in an on-line support group, (3) looking for health or medical information, and (4) other health related activities. We counted the total numbers of types of online health activities users engaged in as the measure for the diversity of using the Internet for health information.</p><p>Preference of using the Internet for health information: Respondents were asked to identify the communication channels they would use first if they need to look for information about cancer. 15 communication channels were listed and include the Internet, health care providers, family, books, television and so on. We code this variable as a "1" if the Internet was chosen first and 0 otherwise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Independent variables</head><p>Ease of access to Internet: Two items from the survey were used to construct a categorical variable. Respondents were first asked if they ever went online using the Internet from home. Those who used the Internet at home were then asked what type of Internet service they used. Respondents who did not have the Internet at home were used as the baseline category; respondents who had the Internet at homework but only used a low-speed connection such as dial-up were used as the second category; and respondents who had a broadband Internet connection (e.g., cable modem and DSL) at home were the third category.</p><p>Trust in online health information: Trust has been defined and measured in different ways in previous studies. In this paper, we are interested in the extent to which users trust online health information. The trust variable was measured by a single-item in HINTS from which the respondents were asked how much they trust cancer information received on the Internet. It was coded as 1(not at all) to 4 (a lot). A single-item measure is acceptable if the construct is unambiguous, unidimensional, and directly accessible to respondents <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref>. Previous studies have used single-item scales to measure the patients' trust in health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and health plans <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> as well as individual' trust in companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> and suppliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref>.</p><p>Perceived communication quality with doctors: This variable was measured by 5 items which asked the respondents the degree to which their doctor listened carefully to them, explained things in a way they could understand, showed respect for what they said, spent enough time with them, and involved them in decision making. The Cronbach's alpha for this measure is 0.86, which indicates the reliability is satisfactory.</p><p>Perceived health status: This variable was measured by a single item which asked respondents to rate their health in general using a 5-point Likert scale with anchors from 'excellent' to 'poor'. Accordingly, it was coded as 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).</p><p>The variables' names and measures are summarized in Appendix Table <ref type="table">A1</ref>. The descriptive statistics and correlations are summarized in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Analysis and results</head><p>We used three models to test the hypotheses. A multinomial logit model was used to estimate the model for frequency of search since the dependent variable is a categorical variable. Ordinary least squares (OLS) was used to estimate models for diversity of search. Logistic regression was used to estimate the model for preference for the Internet since the dependent variable is a binary variable.</p><p>We estimated all models in two steps: in the first step, only control variables were entered into the model; in the second step, all variables were entered into the model.</p><p>Results of the estimation are summarized in Tables 2,3 and 4 and the results of each hypothesis are summarized in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>.</p><p>The results for our control variables are consistent with previous studies. We found people with a younger age, a higher education and a higher income are more likely to seek health information from the Internet. Also, cancer patients tend to seek cancer information more intensively.</p><p>We hypothesize that ease of access to the Internet is positively related to the frequency of users' searches for online health information, diversities of online health information search activities, and the choices of information channels to do the initial searches when facing medical problems. Our results indicate that, compared with no Internet at home, accessing the Internet using low speeds or broadband have a positive and significant impact. Therefore, H1A, H1B and H1C are supported.</p><p>We hypothesize that trust in online health information will affect users online health information search behaviors. As we predicted, all three relationships are positive and significant across all models. Thus, H2A, H2B and H2C are supported.</p><p>H3A, H3B and H3C propose that people's perceived health statuses will negatively affect the frequency of their searches for online health information, the diversity of online health information search activity, and the choices of the information channel for the initial search. The results indicate that perceived health statuses have significant impacts on diversity of search (β = -.053, p b 0.001), which supports H3B. Perceived health statuses also were found to be significantly and negatively related to 4 out of 5 comparison categories of frequency of search (β category2 = -.177, p b 0.001; β category4 = -.281, p b 0.001; β category5 = -.214, p b 0.001; β category6 = -.300, p b 0.1). Therefore, H3A is partially supported. However, the effect of perceived health statuses on the preference of information channels is not significant (β = -.043, p = n.s.) and therefore H3C is not supported.</p><p>H4A, H4B and H4C predict that if people perceive the quality of their communication with their doctors as low, they are more likely to search for online health information more frequently, engage in more diverse online search activities, and more likely to prefer to use the Internet to do their initial search. The results show that diversity of searches and preference of search channels could be significantly affected by communication with doctors (β = -.049, p b 0.001; β = -.256, p b 0.001), which supports H4B and H4C. However, communication with doctors was found to have no impact on most of categories of the frequency of the search (β category2 = -.122, p =n.s.; β category3 = -.296, p b 0.01; β category4 = -.087, p = n.s.; β category5 = -.164, p = n.s.; β category6 = -.276, p = n.s.). Thus, H4A is not supported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>In this paper, we studied three aspects of online health information searches-frequency of search, diversity of search, and preference</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1</head><p>Descriptive statistics and correlation matrix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variable</head><p>Mean S.D  of information channels for the initial search. We attempted to examine the effects of information technology related factors, including access to the Internet and trust in online health information, and health factors, including perceived health status and perceived communication quality with physicians, on users' online health information searches. As summarized in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>, our hypotheses are generally supported. We found that Internet access and trust in online health information could affect all three aspects of online health information search behaviors. The perceived health status affects both frequency of search and diversity of search. However, we do not find perceived health status affects the preference of information channel choices. Several reasons may account for this. One explanation could be that people who perceived their health status as low may have already established long-term information channels through traditional media. For example, they might be aware where they can get the health information they need. Therefore, the advantage of the Internet may diminish and online information will be used only as a supplement. Another possibility is that people perceiving low health statuses are more likely to have chronic conditions, which may need periodical doctor visits for routine checks or medication; therefore, their online health information searches may occur after their doctor visits. Additionally, low health statuses may lead people to feel their health conditions are severe and complicated and feel online health information is insufficient to meet their needs. Also surprisingly, we found perceived communication with doctors has no impact on the frequency of online health information use. One possibility could be that when people are searching for online health information as a result of low-quality communication with doctors, they may conduct a more extensive search, thereby seeking more sources and spending more time on each search as opposed to increasing frequency. Another explanation may be that, rather than simply searching for online health information more frequently, people may change the way of they use the information they have already received. For example, online health information may be taken more seriously and play a more important role in the decision-making process. Also, patients frustrated by their communication with doctors may choose to expend and diversify their information channels by collecting information from other sources such as medical books and journals, while maintaining their online health information search frequency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Implications for theory</head><p>While health care providers remain the most trusted source for health information and could not be substituted by the Internet, our study shows that the Internet is a rich alternative for health care providers. Poor communication with physicians and patient-physician relationships may drive users to online channels. Patients could increase their use of a wider variety of online sources and rely on them more if they perceive their face-to-face communication with physicians as not meeting their information needs.</p><p>Our finding is also related to digital divide literature, which explicates that socio-economic inequality contributes to the digital divide including the disparity in adoption of information technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. Our studies provide evidence suggesting that access to the Internet could further affect access and usage of online health information, which implies that the digital divide could lead to a health divide. The expansion of broadband Internet services will not only benefit healthcare providers by facilitating the data transmission and data sharing, but it will also enable more users access to online health information.</p><p>Our results show that trust in online health information could affect users' frequencies and diversities of searches for online health information as well as choices of information channels from which to carry out their initial searches. It is consistent with previous literature which finds trust can affect the perceived usefulness and intention to use technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49]</ref>. Our study extends the findings of studies on trust in the online e-commerce environment to the online health information environment. While previous studies show trust will affect online transactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>, we show that trust determines the consumption of information content.</p><p>Our research proposes a framework to examine users' online health information search behaviors, which could be used to investigate searches for other information as well. In contrast to previous studies, which mostly focus on only one aspect of search behavior, we examine the search frequency, scope and information channels simultaneously. The results reveal that they are affected by IT and health factors differently. This suggests the need for the synthesis of previous studies to better understand people's online health information search.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Implications for practice</head><p>Prior to the discussion on the implications of our study to practice, we should point out that this paper focuses on the antecedents of online health information searches; how online health information will affect the health care outcomes is not examined in this study. While online health information searches are encouraged and literature suggests health information is largely beneficial to patients, inaccuracies and misuses of health information may have negative impacts to health care outcomes. Our discussion is based on the positive aspects of online health information search.</p><p>Our study underscores the impact of IT infrastructure on public health. Access to health related information has been considered by National Telecommunications and Information Administration as one of the major benefits for going online <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>. While high-speed Internet could benefit health care providers by facilitating the exchange of patients' information (e.g., health information exchange) and medical data (e.g., telemedicine), our study shows that ease of access to the Internet could increase users' utilization of online health information. People with low speed Internet or no Internet at home are more likely to use the Internet in very limited ways to seek health information, consequently diminishing their ability to take advantage of the abundance of online health information. More importantly, this group of people are more likely to be low-income, racial minorities, living in rural areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> which consequently causes a disadvantage in receiving high quality health care. Therefore, limited access to online health information may further exacerbate their situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref>. To address this gap, government agencies or health insurance companies may consider providing free or low-cost high speed Internet services or subsidies to low-income users in order to gain access to health information. Previous literature has shown such subsidies could be effective in increasing users' Internet usage including accessing online health information <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>Our results reveal that users' trust in online health information could lead to more search and use of online health information. On the contrary, a lack of trust may impede the use of online health information. To improve the utilization of their information resources, online health information websites may consider building users' trust through various mechanisms including revealing the sources of online health information, ensuring the information security, and protecting users' privacy. Also, more authoritative or official medical portals should be built to provide reliable, accurate, and recent medical information. In addition, government agencies or health care providers may consider certifying and recommending health information websites to ensure quality and facilitate users to identify more reliable online health information sources.</p><p>Our research reveals that, as a person perceives a poor health status, he/she is likely to search online health information more frequently and more broadly. It reveals the important role health information plays in the process of coping with health problems. In addition to normal treatment, providing sufficient information on their health conditions or communication with other patients with similar diseases may reduce patients' uncertainties and fears and benefit their recovery. Moreover, our results imply that, since people use online information more often when they already feel their health status has become bad, information on recovery and treatment may have a higher utilization rate than information on prevention given the potential higher demands. In addition, the Internet is increasingly being employed in health care campaigns to raise people's awareness of diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. However, our results imply that, although this information could benefit people regardless of their health status, such information may receive less attention from healthier people and thus reduce its effectiveness. How a person with good health can be exposed to online health information in a meaningful way needs future research.</p><p>The results also emphasize the importance of patient-physician communication. A lower quality of patient-physician communication may result in increased uncertainty and anxiety among patients, it may reduce their trust in healthcare providers, and it may force them to use more online health information. Searching for additional information may also cause confusion if the information on the Internet (such as online community) is inconsistent with what they learned from their doctors. In addition, simply relying on information from the Internet for self-diagnosis or self-treatment could lead to potential harm to patients' health <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. Therefore, the physicians should ensure patients' understandings of their conditions, medications, and treatment information during their visits. Healthcare providers should also provide assistance and guidance to patients on the usage of online health information to ensure they use it properly. Further, physicians may need to be prepared for questions patients may have found during their own online search. On the other hand, patients' extensive searches on the Internet for health information might be an indicator of their perception of low patient-physician communications. Physicians may be able to sense this and consequently take actions by improving the quality of interaction during patients' visits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Limitations and future research</head><p>This study has a few limitations. First, due to the constraints of HINTS data, some variables in this study used single-item measures. While multi-item measures are desirable, single-items are sufficient if the items are unambiguous for respondentswhich is the case in this survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref>. Nevertheless, future research can use multi-item measures to test our model. Second, this study used cross-sectional data. Therefore, the causality may not be inferred. Future research could use longitudinal data to further test our model. Furthermore, HINTS does not ask respondents about the average duration of online health information searches. We could not rule out the possibility that some people may search less frequently but spend a longer amount of time on each search. Future research could exam how the factors identified in this paper could affect search duration. Moreover, most of the questions in HINTs are cancer-related, so the generation of our results to other diseases should be cautious. Future studies could study users' searches for information about other diseases and examine how it varies as the prevalence and mortality of diseases change. In addition, HINTS data does not contain information on respondents' personalities and information search propensities, which may affect users' online health information search patterns. Lastly, this study focuses on the antecedents of patients' online health information search. The impact of searches on patients' health care outcomes needs to be further examined in future research.</p></div>
