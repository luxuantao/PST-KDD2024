<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Power-Efficient Design of Multicast</head><p>Wavelength-Routed Networks Maher Ali and Jitender S. Deogun</p><p>Abstract-In this paper, we introduce the power-efficient design space for multicast wavelength-routed networks. The power-efficient design space is based on the impact of power on the overall design of wavelength-routed networks. Two cross-connect architectures on this design concept are investigated. One is an existing architecture called splitter-and-delivery (SaD). The other is a new architecture called multicast-only splitter-and-delivery (MOSaD).</p><p>The MOSaD architecture uses power splitters for multicast connections only, allowing unicast connections to pass without enduring unnecessary power losses. Our cross-connect design provides a strictly nonblocking service for unicast connections while eliminating unnecessary power loss of the SaD cross-connect.</p><p>Experimental results demonstrate that the MOSaD architecture provides substantial savings in cost and reduction in signal power loss with minimal effects on the blocking performance of the network.</p><p>Index Terms-Multicasting, optical amplification, power budget, switch design, wavelength division multiplexing, wavelength-routed networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>T HE EXPLOSION in Internet traffic and the emergence of bandwidth-intensive delay-sensitive multimedia applications will have a significant influence on the design of next generation telecommunication networks. Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) offers the preeminent technology to take advantage of the enormous bandwidth of optical fibers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. WDM partitions the bandwidth of the fiber into many orthogonal channels where each channel is operated by an independent electronic device. An optical network consists of an interconnection of stations, cross-connects, and other devices using optical fiber. An optical network is called a wavelength-routed network if its cross-connects have the capability to switch connections based on the wavelength (or frequency) they are carried on. An all-optical network is an optical network where connections do not face new opto-electronic conversion within the network.</p><p>The traffic in all-optical networks is usually grouped into sessions. A session is defined as a set of stations engaged in some activity which requires transfer of data. Multicasting is a general term used to describe how data are transferred within a session. A session is described by a pair , where is the source and is a set of destinations corresponding to the source . The number of destinations is called the destination-degree of the session. The destination-degree can vary from 1 to , where is the number of stations in the network. When the destination-degree is equal to one, the session is called unicast; on the other hand, when the destination-degree equals , the session is referred to as broadcast.</p><p>A unicast session in all-optical wavelength-routed networks is carried on a lightpath <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. A lightpath between two stations is an available wavelength on a series of fiber links from source to destination such that the route is simple (i.e., no node or edge is traversed more than once) and the signal remains in the optical domain. A multicast session can be set up on a light-tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. A light-tree, realizing a session , is a tree rooted in that spans all nodes in . Such a tree may include nodes that are not members of . In graph-theoretic terminology, this type of tree is referred to as a Steiner tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>An important problem in all-optical networks is routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The RWA problem for unicast connections has been addressed in many studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. It involves selecting the best combination of path and wavelength for each connection (in a given demand matrix) such that the number of connections established is maximized and no two connections which share a common link use the same wavelength. The RWA problem for unicast connections has been found to be NP-complete <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. A natural extension to the unicast RWA problem is the multicast routing and wavelength assignment (MCRWA) problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows an example of an all-optical wavelength-routed network. Two multicast sessions and one unicast session are active in this network. The established connections can be represented by a set, , where each entry represents a multicast session between the source station and a nonempty set of destination stations. The set of established sessions defines a virtual topology embedded on the physical topology.</p><p>To implement multicasting, each node must have optical devices such as splitters or taps. In an optical network, a tap <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> is an optical device which taps a small amount of the power of the signal from an optical fiber, and allows the signal to continue with negligible power degradation. An -way splitter <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> is an optical devicewhichsplitsaninput signalamong outputs;thusreducing the power of each output to th of that of the original signal. The ability to split the signal without the knowledge of the signal's characteristics [e.g., its bit-error rate (BER) or its contents (digital versus analog)] allows an all-optical network to realize multicasting without the need for buffering. Therefore, all-optical networks are much more powerful than electronic networks where store-and-forward is necessary to achieve multicasting.</p><p>All-optical networking is expected to go through the following three phases. 1. Phase 1-Virtual Topology: A virtual topology is embedded on top of the physical topology. The virtual topology does not change frequently (e.g., change is on the order of hours). Higher layers (e.g., IP) use this virtual topology as a physical delivery mechanism. Advantages of this scheme over existing backbone networks with electronic switching include the exploitation of the enormous fiber bandwidth and the elimination of the electronic bottleneck. 2. Phase 2-Dynamic Connection Establishment: Calls are established on demand. Centralized or distributed algorithms are used to reserve wavelengths, and configure switches and devices. 3. Phase 3-Wavelength to the Desktop: This is the ultimate goal and does not seem to be feasible in the foreseeable future. Connection establishment algorithms in this paper address networks in the first phase. However, the design implications of power are still valid for other environments. Devices and switches in an all-optical network are assumed to be controlled by an out-of-band management network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Motivation</head><p>Recently proposed multicast cross-connect architectures [e.g., splitter-and-delivery (SaD)] <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> suffer from excessive power loss due to the indiscriminate power splitting (see Section III-A). Optical quality-of-service (QoS) research has gained a momentum in resent years. Power is one of the most important quantitative measures of optical QoS. To be detected, optical signals need to maintain a power level above some threshold. Optical amplification [e.g., erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA)] is used as a means to boost the signal's power level without conversion to electronics. Recent studies address the impact of power on the design optimization of optical local-area networks (LANs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and connection establishment in wide-area networks (WANs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>In optical multicasting, a splitter is the fundamental optical device contributing to power loss. Therefore, a design methodology is needed to reduce the number of splitters in an optical network with minimal effects on the network blocking performance. In this paper, we propose the concept of power-efficient design and introduce a new cross-connect architecture called multicast-only splitter and delivery (MOSaD). Our experiments show that MOSaD compares favorably to an existing architecture called splitter and delivery (SaD).</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. First, we introduce in Section II the power-efficient design space for multicast optical networks. Second, cross-connect architectures built using this design space are presented in Section III. Third, connection establishment algorithms are presented in Section IV. Then, simulation results and analysis of the performance of different cross-connect architectures using well-known real-life as well as randomly generated examples of all-optical networks are presented in Section V. Finally, conclusions and directions for future work are presented in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. POWER-EFFICIENT DESIGN SPACE</head><p>The power-efficient design space has two important dimensions: 1) splitter-sharing design and 2) splitter-tap continuum, as can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Splitter-sharing design focuses on minimizing the number of splitters inside the cross-connect itself. On the other hand, the splitter-tap continuum deals with minimizing the number of multicast-capable cross-connects in the overall network. In the following, we explain each dimension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Splitter-Sharing Design</head><p>Splitting light in itself can be achieved with negligible cost since it basically entails fusing fibers together. However, crossconnects with large number of splitters are expensive to build for the following two main reasons.</p><p>1) Large amount of amplification. Since the output power of an -way splitter is at most th of that of the input power, large number of splitters translates to large amount of optical amplification using optical amplifiers [e.g., semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs)] to counter the power loss. 2) Fabrication. The large number of splitters makes the fabrication process of the cross-connect difficult, and hence more expensive. Splitter sharing design philosophy comprises intelligent sharing of splitters inside a cross-connect in a way that significant power savings are achieved without noticeable effect on the blocking performance. The splitter-sharing design philosophy is based on our understanding of cost versus blocking performance tradeoff. It can be argued that with sharing of splitters inside the cross-connect, significant savings can be achieved with minimal effects on the blocking performance. However, with splitter sharing, a cross-connect might face a situation in which two sessions require the use of the same splitter. This situation is referred to as a session conflict. In the next section, we propose the multicast-only splitter-and-delivery cross-connect (MOSaD), an instance of this design concept, and demonstrate that the likelihood of session conflict can be minimized for a large class of network architectures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Splitter-Tap Continuum</head><p>The concept of splitter-tap continuum is based on the observation that all cross-connects need not have multicasting capability. This observation is motivated by recent empirical <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> as well as theoretical <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> studies demonstrating that only a subset of the cross-connects (found to be 50%) need to be equipped with multicasting capability. A network in which only a subset of the cross-connects employ multicasting (e.g., having an SaD cross-connect) and the rest employing tap and continue (TaC) cross-connects<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">1</ref> is referred to as a sparse-splitting network.</p><p>In this paper, we focus primarily on the splitter-sharing design concept and refer the interested reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> for an investigation of the splitter-tap continuum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. CROSS-CONNECT ARCHITECTURES</head><p>In this section, we first present a recently proposed multicastcapable cross-connect and analyze its power budget. Second, we present a new multicast-capable cross-connect with a low power Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Splitter-and-delivery switch which uses power splitters, amplifiers, photonic switches, and optical gates <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Optical amplifiers were not shown in the original figure . 

budget developed using the splitter-sharing concept. Finally, we provide a comparison between the two cross-connects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Splitter-and-Delivery Cross-Connect</head><p>The splitter-and-delivery (SaD) (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) is a multicastcapable cross-connect that is proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. An SaD cross-connect consists of a set of splitter-and-delivery (SaD) switches (see Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>), one for each wavelength. In addition to the SaD switches, demultiplexers (multiplexers) are used to extract (combine) individual wavelengths. An SaD switch consists of an interconnection of power splitters, optical gates (to reduce the excessive crosstalk), and photonic switches.</p><p>Due to the nonideal behavior of optical devices, a signal encounters different power losses when propagating through various devices. The power loss formula for an SaD-based cross-connect is given by SaD</p><p>(1) where demultiplexing loss; multiplexing loss; , insertion and coupling losses of the switch elements (e.g., directional coupler), respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. A significant shortcoming of the SaD architecture is that all signals face power splitting regardless of their type. A unicast signal, for example, faces an -way splitting even though it will not be carried to more than one outgoing fiber. This indiscriminate power loss imposes unnecessary amplification and complicates the network's control and management.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Multicast-Only Splitter-and-Delivery Cross-Connect</head><p>In this subsection, we propose a new architecture that is motivated by the splitter-sharing design concept. The MOSaD architecture provides strictly nonblocking operation for unicast connections and imposes only minimal limitations on multicasting. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> shows the proposed architecture for multicast-capable wavelength-routing cross-connect. An MOSaD cross-connect supporting wavelengths consists of demultiplexers to extract individual channels, space switches to perform the actual switching, multiplexers to aggregate the individual signals on fiber, split-switch (SS) banks (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>), lightwave switches (e.g., directional couplers), a transmitter array for each local station capable of transmitting on all wavelengths at the same time, and a receiver array for each local station capable of tuning into all wavelengths at the same time.</p><p>This cross-connect provides strictly nonblocking service for all unicast connections. A multicast connection, however, is treated differently. The proposed cross-connect can provide up to concurrent multicast sessions. The only restriction is that the cross-connect cannot resolve multicast session conflicts. A multicast session conflict is formally captured in the following definition.</p><p>Definition 1 (Multicast Session Conflict): Two multicast sessions, and , are said to be in multicast session conflict with each other if the following three conditions hold.</p><p>1) Both sessions use the same cross-connect .</p><p>2) There exist at least two different links (e.g., ) for session , and at least two different links (e.g.,</p><p>) for session such that is the source of all four links. The links need not be disjoint.</p><p>3) The same wavelength is used for both sessions. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> shows an example of a session conflict in an MOSaD cross-connect. In this example, two multicast session are carried on the same wavelength, . The first session is destined to the local station and output port 1. The second session is destined to output ports 2 and 3. Although their output sets are disjoined, the MOSaD switching fabric cannot realize this demand. It may be noted that this problem can be easily handled at the time of routing and wavelength assignment.</p><p>The amount of power loss for a unicast connection using an MOSaD cross-connects is given by MOSaD <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> and that for multicast</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">MOSaD (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>Note the extra splitting factor is only applied for multicast connections. A cross-connect, , treats a connection as multicast if and only if the connection requires light splitting from switch , otherwise, it treats it as a unicast as far as the cross-connect is concerned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. A Comparison Between SaD and MOSaD Architectures</head><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>, we provide a comparison between the SaD and MOSaD architectures. Since an SaD cross-connect can realize any permutation of connections, it utilizes power splitters, where 2 denotes the number of input ports (i.e., fibers) of a cross-connect, and</p><p>is the number of wavelengths 2 Current technology allows for up to 432 fibers in a single fiber cable <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>supported. The MOSaD cross-connect, on the other hand, only uses power splitters. Each power splitter is shared among connections. The large number of power splitters in the SaD architecture makes it very difficult to fabricate. In addition, all signals encounter power splitting regardless of their class. This mandates the need for large amount of amplification which has the negative side effect on the power budget and the management of the network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONNECTION ESTABLISHMENT</head><p>We assume that the routing information has been previously stored for each multicast session. The routing information for a multicast session is basically a set of candidate trees. Each tree in the set is rooted at the session's source node and spans all the destinations in that session. Obviously, to conserve resources, the tree should use the minimum number of fiber links. Unfortunately, finding the minimum multicast tree for a session is the classical Steiner tree problem and is known to be NP-complete <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. To overcome the complexity of the problem, we use a two-approximation algorithm which was first proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The minimum path heuristic (MPH) generates a Steiner tree for a multicast session with a guaranteed cost of up to twice the optimal and gives good performance in practice. MPH assumes that the shortest-path from every node, , to every destination node, , in the graph is precomputed.</p><p>MPH is a greedy algorithm since it proceeds by expanding the Steiner tree making only local decisions without backtracking. Initially, only the source node is in the tree. In each iteration, the tree is extended by including one new destination that has the smallest shortest-path to some node in the tree. The process is repeated until all destinations are included. The complexity of MPH is . It is worth noting that a new iterative algorithm has been reported which gives a bound of 1.598 of the optimal using up to 11 iterations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, connection establishment of multicast sessions is achieved by solving an ILP model of the MCRWA problem.</p><p>In the next section we present the notation and formulations for the MCRWA problem for both SaD and MOSaD networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. MCRWA Problem Formulations</head><p>Table II lists the variables and constants used in this paper. The network is modeled as a directed graph , where is the set of nodes (stations and cross-connects) in the network and is the set of bidirectional links. The multicast sessions input to the problem are represented by the set, , where is a multicast session with as the source station and the set as set of destinations. Associated with each multicast session, , is , the set of trees. Having a set of alternate trees for each session rather than one fixed predetermined tree allows the ILP solver to find better solutions. The set of trees for session is found as follows. First, the minimum-cost tree, , is found using the MPH heuristic. Next, at Step , the th link in is deleted and the MPH is run to find tree . In the following, we first present the integer-linear program used for solving the MCRWA problem for networks employing SaD cross-connects. A profit (priority), , is associated with each session . The ILP formulation is as follows.</p><p>ILP-SaD: For each session , the objective is to chose one of the trees from the set so that the overall profit is maximized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maximize</head><p>(4)</p><p>The following constraint ensures that a wavelength is used by at most trees, where is the number of fiber links on the logical link (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> Constraints ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) force the problem variables to be binary (6) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> Finally, the solver must use at most one tree for each session <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> The formulation for the MCRWA problem in a network using only MOSaD cross-connects (ILP-MOSaD) is similar to the ILP-SaD formulation except that the following constraint is added <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> Constraint ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) incorporates the organization of the MOSaD cross-connect. Mainly, it resolves session conflicts. The formulations for both the SaD and MOSaD cross-connects will be used in the next section to compare their blocking performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>In this section, we provide numerical examples comparing the performance of the two cross-connect architectures, In Subsection A, we describe the performance metrics. The simulation settings used are discussed in Subsection B. An analysis of the simulation results is presented in Subsection C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Performance Metrics</head><p>Two sets of performance metrics are considered: blocking probability metric and power metrics. The blocking probability metric evaluates the blocking behavior of the different networks employing various cross-connect architectures. Power metrics evaluates the degradation of signal power due to the splitting and switching losses and thus help us in the analysis of the power budget of the two cross-connect architectures.</p><p>1) Blocking Probability: The blocking probability, , for a set of sessions, , is defined as of blocked sessions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> The blocking probability will measure the performance of the two cross-connects; thus helping in estimating the impact of the splitter-sharing in the MOSaD cross-connect.</p><p>2) Power Considerations: Every optical device contributes to the signal power either by a loss or by a gain. An -way splitter, for example, takes an input signal and divides its power among all outputs; thus reducing the effective power of the signal to th of the original signal power. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> Here, we present those metrics which help us evaluate the power budget requirements of the two cross-connect architectures.</p><p>i) Splitter Ratio, : It can be observed that in a Steiner tree, not all the nodes may have multiple branches. For each session, only a subset of the cross-connects may be required to have splitting capability. Therefore, for a given set of sessions, , the value gives the average percentage of the cross-connects that actually need multicast capability. Let us first define to be the total number of nodes in the Steiner tree for multicast session which have two or more branches. Similarly, we denote by the total number of nodes in the Steiner tree for multicast session . Given a set of sessions, , the value is given by the following: <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> ii) Power Loss Ratio: The MOSaD architecture allows unicast or multicast connections that do not require splitting in a cross-connect to bypass the splitters in that cross-connect without enduring unnecessary power loss. We present a metric which gives a comparison between the total loss in both networks. Let be the amount of power loss from the source of session to destination . The SaD total loss, , for a set of multicast sessions, , is given by the following:</p><p>The MOSaD total loss, , is defined in a similar way. The power loss ratio is simply .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Experimental Setting</head><p>Experiments were carried out using the 21-node high-speed Italian network <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, a 16-node hypercube, and a 12-node bidirectional ring. The Italian network was chosen as an example of a real-world wavelength-routed optical network. The other two networks were chosen because of their characteristic topological features and popular use in real life. In addition, to ensure the validity of the findings, random graphs were generated using the rectangular-grid method <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The nodes are randomly placed over a rectangular coordinate grid. A bidirectional link between two nodes , and , is added with probability , where is the maximum distance between any pair of nodes, and is the Manhattan distance between and . Increasing increases the ratio of longer to shorter edges. Increasing increases the node degree. A session for a network of stations is randomly generated given the session participation probability, . First, a random node is chosen as a source. After that, the rest of the nodes are chosen as destinations in this session with probability . All experiments were coded in C and run on a lightly loaded Sun Ultra60 workstation. Integer-linear programs were solved using the CPLEX linear solver <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Analysis</head><p>In this subsection, we analyze the performance of the bidirectional ring, the hypercube, the Italian network, and random network topologies.</p><p>1) Blocking Performance: It is observed that the impact of the reduction in the number of splitters in the MOSaD architecture on the blocking probability is negligible. This is especially true for networks with low node degree and a relatively large number of available wavelengths. In the following we give detailed analysis of different experiments.</p><p>a) 12-node bidirectional ring: Let us first analyze the performance of a 12-node bidirectional ring network. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> compares the number of sessions established for the two cross-connect architectures discussed in this paper. We notice that there is no difference between the performance of SaD and the MOSaD networks. This can explained by the fact that the node degree in a bidirectional ring (where each cross-connect has one local station) is equal to three; hence, no more multicast session conflicts occur in the MOSaD than in the SaD networks (see Section III-B for more information on the multicast session conflicts in the MOSaD architecture).</p><p>b) Three-dimensional hypercube: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref> shows the number of sessions established as a function of session participation probability . We notice that the SaD and MOSaD networks have the same blocking probability. This can be easily seen since all the nodes in a 3-D hypercube have node degree of four. This makes session conflicts less likely to occur especially with relatively large number of wavelengths of 8.</p><p>c) The high-speed italian network: The high-speed Italian network <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">15</ref>) was used in this study as an example of a real-life all-optical network. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref> shows the number of established sessions as a function of session size. We notice that the MOSaD performance is almost identical to that of SaD. We also notice that beyond 0.5 session participation  probability, both network architectures give the natural bound, i.e., the number of wavelengths . d) A 30-node random network: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref> shows the blocking performance of the MOSaD cross-connect relative to that of the SaD cross-connect. The comparison uses a 30-node random network. Different session sizes are used while varying the number of available wavelengths. We notice that the blocking performance of MOSaD compares well to that of SaD. In fact, the blocking performance of MOSaD converges quickly to that of SaD as the number of wavelengths increases. Moreover, at worse, the blocking performance for MOSaD is no more worse than 7%.</p><p>2) Power-Budget Analysis: Our simulation results show that, on the average, only 50% of the total splitters in the network are utilized at any time. The power loss ratio is one-third for networks with low nodal degree, and it is a decreasing function of the nodal degree. In the following, we give detailed analysis of the simulation results.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref> shows the value for three different network topologies (21-node high-speed Italian network, 3-D hypercube, and 12-node bidirectional ring). From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref> we  observe that as the multicast group size grows to broadcast, the value for a ring increases to about 84%. This can be explained by the fact that only two nodes terminate the connection in a ring broadcast and all other nodes do require splitting capability. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">13</ref> shows the value obtained on randomly generated networks. The node degree parameter, , is varied from 0.2 to 1.0 (i.e., clique) while fixing to 1.0. We notice that as the network grows from sparse to a complete graph, the value decreases. This is due to the fact that the number of intermediate nodes in a sparsely connected graph is larger than that of a densely connected graph which gives rise to excessive unnecessary splitting.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">14</ref> shows the power loss ratio using the Italian network while varying the session participation probability. In the figure, we show the power loss ratio using different number of fibers in each cable. This figure is generated assuming , , , and to be equal to 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.2 dB, respectively. The number of sessions used is 100. We notice that the amount of loss using SaD-based cross-connects is always higher than that for MOSaD cross-connects. In particular, for moderate sessions sizes and networks employing one fiber, the power loss in MOSaD is one-third of that of SaD. As the number of fibers in  the cable increases, the power loss ratio decreases, which amplifies the importance of the MOSaD architecture in multifiber networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>Current multicast-capable cross-connect architectures [e.g., splitter-and-delivery (SaD)] have two major problems: 1) they require the use of a large number of optical power splitters (hence, they are difficult and expensive to fabricate); and 2) they have a high power budget requiring a all signals to endure unnecessary power loss.</p><p>In this paper, we introduced the power-efficient design space for multicast wavelength-routed networks. The power-efficient design space considers the impact of power on the overall design of wavelength-routed networks. Two dimensions of this design space are: 1) splitter-sharing design and 2) splitter-tap continuum. In this work, we focused primarily on the splittersharing design concept.</p><p>Simulation results using a wide variety of traffic patterns performed on a set of well-known real-life as well as randomly generated optical networks demonstrate the following. Design optimization problems on the power-efficient design space offer an excellent area for future research projects. Depending on the granularity, one can think of two kinds of design problems: coarse-grain and fine-grain. In the coarse-grain version, we have a limited number of SaD cross-connects, and the problem is to optimally allocate these SaD cross-connects to a subset of the network nodes. All other nodes are assigned TaC cross-connects. The fine-grain version involves the allocation of individual splitters within the cross-connects such that the overall number of splitters is minimized and the network behaves within acceptable blocking performance. We believe that the splitter allocation problem will enjoy the same level of in-terest in the area of all-optical networking as the wavelength converter placement problem once did.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
