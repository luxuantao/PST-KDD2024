<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION 1.1 Motivation</head><p>Although the information in large textual collections such as the Web is available in the form of individual textual documents, the human knowledge encoded within the documents can be seen as a hidden, implicit Web of classes of instances (e.g., named entities), interconnected by relations applying to those instances (e.g., facts). The accurate identification of named entities pertaining to diverse classes is an essential step towards automatically constructing knowledge bases from unstructured text <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, particularly in the case of the acquisition of large fact repositories from Web documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>. Besides their role in populating larger repositories of human knowledge, named entities constitute a significant fraction of the queries submitted as part of an activity that permeates modern societies and is undertaken by millions of people every day, namely Web search. A variety of natural language processing tasks, including parsing, prepositional attachment <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref> and coreference resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>, also benefit from the availability of information about named entities. Similarly, the performance of named entity recognizers improves when the systems have access to lists of accurate named entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, even with state of the art statistical recognizers <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. Named entity discovery is also a powerful tool in building new verticals in Web search semi-automatically, for example to improve or provide alternative views of search results for popular classes such as Drug, VideoGame etc.</p><p>In a formal acknowledgment of the importance of named entities in Web search in particular, and text processing in general, numerous previous studies address the task of acquiring clean lists of named entities occurring within unstructured text. Traditionally, the recognition of names and their associated categories within unstructured text relies on manually compiled semantic lexicons and gazetteers. The amount of effort required to assemble large lexicons sometimes confines the recognition to a limited domain (e.g., medical imaging) for which large-coverage resources already exist. It is also possible to build recognizers that identify names automatically in text <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18]</ref>, although the targeted named entities are usually limited to a small set of coarsegrained classes, e.g. Person or Location. Recent work on large-scale information extraction holds much promise, as it scales well to Web-sized collections through an emphasis on lightweight extraction methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>. In particular, a few studies take advantage of non-traditional document collections for the purpose of mining named entities, in the form of comparable news articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> or multilingual corpora <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Contributions</head><p>In a departure from previous work on named entity discovery from unstructured text, this paper introduces a weakly supervised method for mining Web search queries in order to explicitly extract named entities that are expected to be relevant and suitable for later use. The method is inspired by recent work on weakly supervised acquisition of class attributes from query logs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. In contrast, previous work that looks at query logs as a data resource does so only to implic-  itly derive signals improving the quality of various tasks such as information retrieval, whether through re-ranking of the retrieved documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, query expansion <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>, or the development of spelling correction models <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. Conversely, previous studies in large-scale information extraction, including named entity discovery, uniformly choose to capitalize on document collections <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref> rather than queries as preferred data source, thus failing to take advantage of the collective knowledge embedded haphazardly within noisy search queries.</p><p>The proposed extraction method is guided by a small set of seed instances, without any need for handcrafted extraction patterns or further domain-specific knowledge. To ensure varied experimentation on several dimensions despite the burden of manually assessing the correctness of the output, the evaluation computes the precision of instances extracted for ten different target classes (City, Drug etc.). The classes constitute a realistic sample of the wide range of domains of interest to Web search users. One of the prerequisites of the evaluation, illustrating its scope and timeintensive nature, is the manual assessment of the correctness of more than 4,000 candidate instances. The resulting precision scores are significant both in absolute value (0.96 for prec@50, 0.90 for prec@150, and 0.80 for prec@250), and relative to the quality of instances extracted from Web documents based on handcrafted patterns (with precision improving by 29% for prec@50, 26% for prec@150, and 15% for prec@250).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">EXTRACTION FROM QUERY LOGS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Selection of Candidate Instances</head><p>Given a set of target classes and a set of seed instances for each class, the goal is to extract relevant class instances from query logs, without any further domain knowledge.</p><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the extraction method consists of five stages: identification of query templates that match the seed instances (Step 1); identification of candidate instances (Step 2); internal representation of candidate instances (Step 3) and seed instances (Step 4); and instance ranking (Step 5).</p><p>A target class (e.g., Drug), for which instances need to be extracted, is available in the form of a set of representative instances (e.g., phentermine and vioxx). In Step 1, each query that contains a seed instance generates a query template composed of the remainder of the query, that is, the prefix and the postfix around the matched instance. For example, the occurrence of the instance vioxx in the query "long term vioxx use" corresponds to the query template [long term] pref ix [use] postf ix . During matching, all string comparisons are case-insensitive.</p><p>In another pass over the query logs, Step 2 collects a very large (and noisy) pool of candidate instances, by identifying the queries (e.g., "long term xanax use") which match any of the query templates generated in the previous step, and collecting the query infixes (e.g., xanax) as candidate instances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Representation through Search Signatures</head><p>Step 3 (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) builds an internal representation of each candidate instance. Whenever a query contains a candidate instance collected in Step 2, the remainder of the query, that is, the concatenation of the remaining prefix and postfix, becomes an entry in a query template vector that acts as a search signature of the candidate instance with respect to the class. The weight of each entry in a vector is the frequency of occurrence of the contributing query in the query logs. For instance, the query "can lamictal be crushed" results in a new entry being added to the searchsignature vector of lamictal with respect to the class Drug. Step 4 of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> injects weak supervision in the extraction process, through the small input set of per-class instances. For each class (e.g., Drug), the vectors generated in Step 3 are inspected to identify those associated to a seed instance (e.g., xanax and vioxx), rather than any other candidate instance. The vectors thus selected are added together, forming a reference search-signature vector. Whereas Step 3 generates a vector for each candidate instance of each class, Step 4 produces one reference search-signature vector for each class. A reference vector can be thought of as a loose search fingerprint of the desired output type with respect to the class <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</p><p>In Step 5, the similarity scores among the search-signature vector of each candidate instance, on one hand, and the reference search-signature vector of the class, on the other hand, determine the ordered list of candidate instances along with their ranking. The similarity scores are computed based on a similarity function, namely Jensen-Shannon, that is used frequently in text processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>.</p><p>One of the possible interpretations of the reference searchsignature vectors of a class is to view them as a series of queries (or questions, when formulated in natural language) that can be asked about the instances in the class. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> shows some of the query templates in the reference searchsignature vectors collected during named entity discovery for a sample of the target classes. Note how it is incrementally easier to guess to which class an instance belongs, solely by inspecting more questions that various people (users) ask about the instance. For example, if valid questions about an instance I include "what type of government does I have" and "what do people in I eat", then it is relatively easy for people to guess that I must be a geopolitical entity of some sort, and later refine that guess as they are presented with more questions about the instance. The intuition behind named entity discovery from query logs is similar: given a set of candidate phrases, the system must guess which of the candidate phrases are more likely to belong to the target class, by looking at queries that can be asked about the candidate phrase, and more generally about all instances in the target class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">EXPERIMENTAL SETTING</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data</head><p>The input to the experiments is a random sample of around 50 million unique, fully-anonymized queries in English sub-mitted by Web users to the Google search engine in 2006. All queries are considered independently of one another, whether they were submitted by the same user or different users, within the same or different search sessions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Target Classes</head><p>To better test the ability of the extraction method to discover useful named entities, each target class is specified through only five seed instances, which are case-insensitive:</p><p>• City: {london, paris, san francisco, tokyo, toronto};</p><p>• Country: {argentina, china, costa rica, france, germany};</p><p>• Drug: {phentermine, viagra, vicodin, vioxx, xanax};</p><p>• Food: {chicken, fish, milk, tomatoes, wheat};</p><p>• Location: {argentina, china, france, san francisco, tokyo};</p><p>• Movie: {die hard, sin city, star trek, star wars, the ma-trix};</p><p>• Newspaper: {le monde, new york times, usa today, wall street journal, washington post};</p><p>• Person: {mel gibson, leonardo da vinci, jennifer lopez, pablo picasso, vincent van gogh};</p><p>• University: {columbia university, stanford university, university of chicago, university of pennsylvania, university of texas at austin};</p><p>• VideoGame: {grand theft auto, need for speed, quake, super mario bros., warcraft}.</p><p>The resulting set of ten target classes is a mix of coarsegrained classes (Person and Location) used heavily in literature on named entity discovery and extraction, and finergrained classes (e.g., Drug and VideoGame) that more realistically model the inherent diversity of Web documents and queries. Furthermore, the classes differ from one another with respect to domains of interest (e.g., Health for Drug vs. Entertainment for Movie). Overall, the target classes provide varied experimentation on several dimensions, while taking into account the time intensive nature of manual accuracy judgments often required in the evaluation of information extraction systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Evaluation Procedure</head><p>Multiple lists of candidate instances (named entities) are evaluated for each class. The top 250 elements of each output list to be evaluated are sorted alphabetically into a merged list. Each instance of the merged list is manually assigned a correctness label with two possible values (correct or incorrect) within its respective class. Thus, a correctness label is manually assigned to a total of 4,468 instances extracted for the ten target classes, in a process that once again confirms that evaluation of information extraction methods can be quite time consuming. To compute the precision score over a ranked list of extracted instances, the correctness labels are converted to numeric values: correct to 1, and incorrect to 0. Precision at some rank N in the list is thus measured as the sum of the assigned values of the first N candidate instances, divided by N .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">EVALUATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Quality of the Extracted Instances</head><p>Using only the five seed instances per class and no further domain knowledge, the extraction method proposed in this paper (denoted Q seed ) mines the query logs for other useful instances, some of which are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. As expected, not all extracted instances are correct; for example, europe is an incorrect extraction in the case of the class Country. In a more rigorous analysis, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> captures precision numbers at various ranks for each of the target classes. The top 250 instances extracted for both Location and Person contain no erroneous instances. For other classes, the accuracy of the extracted instances is quite good, at least at lower ranks (up to rank 50) regardless of the class. The variation in precision across different classes is more pronounced further down in the ranked lists of instances. In particular, the precision at rank 250 varies from a minimum of 0.54 for Newspaper, to a maximum of 1.00 for Location and Person, with a precision of 0.80 as an average over all target classes.</p><p>One may argue that the more queries contain any of the seed instances of a given target class, the better the internal representation (that is, reference search-signature vector) of that target class would be. In turn, better internal repre-   <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>), and the corresponding number of all queries (top graph) and unique queries (bottom graph) containing any of the five seed instances of the target class sentations could lead to more accurate scoring, and hence to higher-quality lists of extracted instances. In other words, the extracted instances are more likely to be accurate, if the seed instances that define the class occur more frequently in the query logs. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> illustrates the correlation between the precision score of an individual target class, and the total number of all queries (top graph) or unique queries (bottom graph) that contain any of the five seed instances of the class.</p><p>The corresponding correlation values between the precision of a class, on one hand, and the number of queries containing some seed instance of the class, on the other hand, is -0.17 when computed over all queries, or -0.19 when computed over unique queries. Both values show that, in fact, precision scores are not correlated with the popularity of the seed instances in the query logs. For instance, in the top graph of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, a total of more than 21 million queries contain seeds (london, paris, san francisco, tokyo or toronto) of the class City, whose list of extracted instances has prec@250 of 0.75. Comparatively, a lower number of queries, that is, around 4 million, contain seeds of the class VideoGame, yet the prec@250 score for that class is 0.98. At ranks 250 and higher, lower precision numbers for classes such as Country are not necessarily meaningful, since there cannot be that many correct instances in those classes in the first place. On the other hand, we feel that it is not unrealistic to expect precision levels in excess of 0.90 at rank 250 and even higher, for the extraction method to be truly useful in accurately collecting large instance sets, in the order of thousands or even tens of thousands of instances (e.g., for VideoGame and Movie, not to mention Person and Location). With such an aggressive goal in mind, the current precision value of 0.80 at rank 250 is encouraging, but leaves room for improvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Comparison to Previous Results</head><p>A large body of previous work focuses on compiling lists of named entities exclusively from document collections, either iteratively by starting from a few seed extraction rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>, or by mining named entities from comparable news articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> or from multilingual corpora <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. In comparison, our paper is the first endeavor in named entity discovery from inherentlynoisy Web search queries.</p><p>A set of extraction patterns relying on syntactically parsed text (e.g., &lt;subj&gt; was kidnapped) are acquired automatically from unstructured text in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. After manual postfiltering, the patterns extract relations in the terrorism domain (perpetrator, victim, target of a terrorist event) from a set of 100 annotated documents, with an average precision of 58%. A more sophisticated bootstrapping method <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> cautiously grows very small seed sets of five items, to less than 300 items after 50 consecutive iterations, with a final precision varying between 46% and 76% depending on the type of semantic lexicon. By adding the five best items extracted from 1700 text documents to the seed set after each iteration, 1000 semantic lexicon entries are collected after 200 iterations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, at precision between 4.5% and 82.9%, again as a function of the target semantic type.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>, handcrafted extraction patterns are applied to a collection of 60 million Web documents to extract instances of the classes Company and Country. Based on the manual evaluation of samples of extracted instances, the authors indicate that an estimated number of 1,116 instances of Company are extracted at a precision score of 0.90. Although these numbers are indicative of the quality of previous methods designed for Web documents, they are not directly comparable to the scores from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> for two reasons. First, the numbers reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref> are computed from a sample of larger lists of extracted named entities, whereas the precision scores in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> assume the systematic assessment of consecutive named entities from the extracted lists. Second, a detailed comparison of precision scores at various ranks cannot be obtained, unless the actual lists of named entities extracted from Web documents in previous studies are also already available, for each of the ten target classes. Naturally, this is not the case for <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>, and in general for most In an effort to comparatively assess the usefulness of query logs versus Web documents in the task of named entity discovery, the evaluation takes advantage of lists of instances as they were extracted in an earlier experiment on the acquisition of categorized named entities from Web documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. As opposed to other previous work, the set of target classes in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> is not specified in advance. Instead, it is incrementally acquired from Web documents along with the respective instances, based on handcrafted extraction patterns (denoted Dpatt). For simplicity and similarly to previous studies on acquiring instances of arbitrary classes from textual documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2]</ref>, the extraction patterns can be summarized as C [such as|including] I , where I is a candidate instance and C is the corresponding class label, as found in a document fragment that matches the patterns (e.g., "[..] drugs such as Vioxx [..]").</p><p>A large number of class labels (e.g., drugs) are thus each associated with a ranked list of candidate instances, in the lists extracted with Dpatt in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. As shown in the two leftmost columns of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, it is trivial to map a class label derived in Dpatt from Web documents, into exactly one target class deemed as lexically equivalent. Most mappings simply involve plural forms (e.g., cities) of the abstract target classes (e.g., City), with two exceptions dictated by the availability of a better mapping in the case of Person (mapped to people as a more natural alternative to the initial choice persons) and VideoGame (mapped logically to the phrase video games). The right column in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> indicates the rank of each class label C among all class labels acquired in Dpatt, when the ranking criterion is the frequency of occurrence of the class label C across all document fragments matching the extraction patterns. The values in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> confirm that the chosen set of target classes provides varied experimentation, with ranks varying from 1 for people (corresponding to Person) to 1532 for video games (corresponding to VideoGame).</p><p>The instances extracted from Web documents (Dpatt) are manually evaluated as correct or incorrect, following the same evaluation procedure used earlier for the instances acquired from query logs (Q seed ). The resulting precision scores exhibit a larger variation across target classes when compared to Q seed . At rank 50, the minimum and maximum scores with Dpatt are 0.30 and 0.98 (for Food and Country  respectively). In contrast, the scores at the same rank 50 vary between 0.86 and 1.00 in the case of Q seed , as shown earlier in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> plots precision values for ranks 1 through 250 for pattern-based extraction from Web documents (Dpatt) against seed-based extraction from search queries (Q seed ). The first ten graphs correspond to each of the ten target classes. The output of Q seed is better for most target classes, with the exception of the classes City and Newspaper for which Dpatt gives better precision at higher ranks, and Country for which Dpatt is better across all ranks. The last graph in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> shows the comparative precision as an average over all target classes. Overall, the Q seed method proposed in this paper outperforms Dpatt, with relative precision score illustrates the usefulness of a weakly-supervised extraction framework for mining named entities from query logs, rather than Web documents. Since the extracted instances relate to one another through various types of facts, they constitute a building block towards acquiring large sets of relations connecting named entities. Next steps include the acquisition of named entities for languages other than English and for target classes organized hierarchically (e.g., Impressionist, Painter, Artist and Person), as well as the exploitation of Web documents in general and Web search results in particular for additional extraction clues in conjunction with those derived from query logs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Overview of data flow during weakly supervised extraction of named entities from query logs</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The extracted instances sometimes capture condensed variants that would otherwise be difficult to collect since they are rarely available in unstructured text, even within Web documents. For example, a variant such as nfsmw, which is actually extracted from search queries, may be less formal than its equivalent Need for Speed: Most Wanted mentioned on the official Web site of the game developer, but nfsmw is certainly quite popular among avid users searching for a VideoGame.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSION</head><p>Traditional wisdom suggests that textual documents tend to assert information (statements or facts) about the world in the form of expository text. Comparatively, search queries can be thought of as being nothing more than noisy, keywordbased approximations of often-underspecified user information needs (interrogations). Despite this apparent disadvantage, and in a departure from previous approaches to largescale acquisition of named entities from the Web, this paper</p></div>			</div>
