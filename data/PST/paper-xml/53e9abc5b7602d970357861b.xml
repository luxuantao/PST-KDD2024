<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The topological design of distributed packet switched networks consists of finding a topology that minimizes the communication costs by taking into account a certain number of constraints such as the delay and the reliability.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This article has studied the motion control of a statically stable biped walking robot on sloping surfaces and stairs. The main point of the biped robot is that a balance weight functions as a movable stable base. The effectiveness of the biped walking on the sloped surfaces and stairs proposed and the developed motion control system have been experimentally supported. Because all derivations and developments are done in the cg coordinate, it is expected that the same methodology could be applied to a biped robot having different joint and/or link structure, such as one with rotational knee joints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>A computer network consists of nodes or stations representing computers, switches, terminals, or printers, and edges denoting communication links <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. These links can be conventional telephone lines, optical fiber cables or microwave channels. The challenge in the area of network design is to determine the most economic way to interconnect nodes, while satisfying some reliability and quality of service constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[37]</ref>. By reliability, we mean the probability of reaching other stations, despite the breakdown of one or several stations <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[48]</ref>. Intuitively, we note that more links between stations imply different routes between each node pair, and consequently the network is more reliable; on the other hand, the network is more expensive.</p><p>Stations that wish to send messages must respect certain protocols so as to avoid network congestion. This leads to two distinct types of networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[36]</ref>:</p><p>1) the centralized network where a controller node, commonly called a server, distributes transmission and resource access permissions to all other nodes of the network; 2) the distributed network where, collectively, stations determine the order in which they can send information, by taking into account the multiplicity of available routes. The information emitted by a source is forwarded to the destination node of the network according to the packet switching technique. In this way, messages are broken into blocks of a certain size called packets; the packets, when they contain the destination address, can follow different routes toward their destination. In this paper, we are interested in distributed packet switched networks.</p><p>In the design of distributed packet switched networks, the aspects to be taken into account can be listed as follows <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[43]</ref>:</p><p>1) the topological configuration that refers to the set of links connecting nodes together; 2) the traffic that corresponds to the number of packets exchanged per second between each node pair of the network to be designed; 3) the capacity assignment that consists of determining the maximum number of bits per second (bps) that can be transmitted by each communication link of a given topological configuration; 4) the routing scheme that allows selection of the best among the multiple routes connecting each node pair; 5) the flow control procedures which assure that the quantity of information sent by the emitter does not overwhelm the receiver. We must also meet performance criteria relative to the average delay and the reliability of the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[39]</ref>. As an index of quality of service, average packet delay in a network can be defined as the mean time taken by a packet to travel from a source to a destination node. The reliability is measured in terms of kconnectivity: a network that remains functional despite one link or node failure is said to be 2-connected. In the case of a 3-connectivity, the network has to resist a breakdown of two links or nodes <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[28]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[48]</ref>.</p><p>Topological design of distributed packet switched networks can be viewed as a search for topologies that minimize communication costs by taking into account delay and reliability constraints. This is a very hard optimization problem which is usually solved by means of heuristic approaches. There exist a number of papers which deal with such approaches <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[38]</ref>. For example, Davis and Coombs <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> have used genetic algorithms (GA's) to determine the link capacities of a network initially generated by the software called DESIGNet. Pierre et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[34]</ref> have proposed the sys-tem called SIDRO using artificial intelligence techniques for the topological design of packet switched networks. Dutta and Mitra <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref> have proposed a hybrid method integrating both an algorithmic approach and a heuristic knowledge-based system. Finally, several papers have used the simulated annealing (SA) method <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[47]</ref>.</p><p>This paper proposes a GA to deal with the topological design of distributed computer networks. Such an approach is inspired by biology and mainly Darwin's theory of evolution according to which the strongest species survive, and thus reproduce themselves, creating more outstanding offspring <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[42]</ref>. Indeed, our GA attempts to cross two topologies evaluated as good in order to create some others that, hopefully, will inherit the properties of their parents.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II outlines basic concepts used in the design and analysis of computer networks; it also presents essential tools and mathematical relations that will serve to evaluate the quality of the solution with regard to average delay and total link cost of a network. Section III describes fundamentals of GA's, as well as their operating techniques; it also elaborates on two applications of GA's in the area of telecommunications, one specifically deals with the choice of link capacities in a network. Section IV synthesizes the adaptation and implementation details of the GA applied to the topological design problem; it also presents and analyzes computational results. Finally, Section V summarizes the main results obtained in this research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. NETWORK ANALYSIS AND RELATED WORKS</head><p>A typical distributed computer network can be viewed as a two level hierarchical structure. First level consists of the communication subnetwork, also called the backbone. It is comprised of linked switching nodes and has as its main function the end-toend transportation of information. The second level consists of terminals, workstations, concentrators/multiplexers, printers, and so on. Concentrators/multiplexers are devices that give the ability to share data coming from several terminals having lower bit rates on a single high capacity link. This paper focuses on the backbone design.</p><p>Each network link is characterized by a set of attributes which principally are the flow and the capacity. For a given link i, the flow fi is defined as the effective quantity of information transported by this link, while its capacity C i is a measure of the maximal quantity of information that it can transmit. Flow and capacity are both expressed in bits/s (bps). Capacity options are only available on the market in discrete or modular options <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. The traffic ij between a node pair (i; j) represents the average number of packets/s sent from source i to destination j. The flow of each link that composes the topological configuration depends on the traffic matrix. Indeed, this matrix varies according to the time, the day and applications used <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[22]</ref>. Some designs are based on the rush hour traffic between two nodes <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. In the framework of our research, we have used the average traffic.</p><p>The topological design of distributed networks can be formulated as follows: given the geographical location of nodes (X i ; Y i ), the traffic matrix R = ( ij ), the capacity options and their cost, the maximum average delay Tmax, minimize the total link cost D, over topological configuration together with flow and capacity assignment, subject to delay and reliability constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[40]</ref>. Some formulations associate a cost with the waiting time of a packet in the network, or seek to optimize the cost and the average delay by making abstraction of the reliability constraint <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>. Others seek to minimize the cost under delay and flow constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[46]</ref>. The delay constraint is expressed as follows: T &lt; T max .</p><p>The flow and capacity assignments depend on the traffic and the average length of packets. The optimum capacity assignment can be obtained by minimizing the average delay <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[40]</ref>.</p><p>In the problem of capacity assignment, the link flows are given, and one seeks to optimize capacities. In the case of flow assignment, link capacities and the topological configuration are given; then the problem is one of determining the link flows that minimize the mean delay of the network. The traffic ij is a unique commodity that displaces itself from node i to node j of the network. The routing and the traffic determine the vector f 1 = (f1; f2; 111 ; fm): f is a multicommodity flow for the traffic matrix R; it must obey the law of flow conservation.</p><p>A method of flow assignment commonly used is the method of flow deviation <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>. This algorithm associates with each link i a length l i defined as @T =@f i . With this metric, the length of a link i corresponds to the linear rate to which the mean delay T of the network increases when there is an increase of the flow on ith link.</p><p>Given that the distributed network reliability depends on that of their material components, it is necessary to consider the breakdown of one or several components in the design of such networks. In this paper, the concept of k-connectivity is used as a reliability measure.</p><p>There exist other approaches to evaluate the reliability of a distributed network <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[48]</ref>. When there is a component failure, the traffic is rerouted on other operational links which consequently become congested, leading to a deterioration of network delay. As a result, the choice of link capacities must be based on the failure probabilities of components. For networks with fixed routing, Gavish and Neuman <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref> propose the initial elaboration of two distinct routes for each source|destination pair: a first route that will be used under normal network conditions, and a second that will be used when the first becomes inoperable as a result of a node or link failure, in the case where only a link breaks down. Yokohira et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[48]</ref> consider not only the case where there are several link failures, but also the cases where the traffic requirements evolve and the technological components of the network change. They proposed to calculate link capacities according to the failure of one or several links, from a table of possible states. The number of states to consider rests at the discretion of the designer, but the more the number of states, the more robust will be the network. The choice of each link capacity takes into account the ideal capacity for each state considered. Some heuristic approaches introducing the artificial intelligence concept of knowledge-based system have been proposed <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[30]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[44]</ref>. For instance, SIDRO, the system proposed by Pierre et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[32]</ref>, generates an initial topology according to specifications provided by the user. This initial topology is then submitted to a set of rules that will determine the choice of perturbations. As a result of this choice, the system will apply perturbation rules to generate topologies, called examples for machine learning purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[31]</ref>. Another example is the system developed by Dutta and Mitra <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, integrating both the algorithmic approach and a heuristic knowledge-based system. This hybrid method builds a solution by decomposing the design problem into sub-problems that can be solved by applying either optimization models or heuristic methods. In addition, this system integrates partial solutions to obtain a global solution of the overall design problem. The network is essentially made of independent modules that share a common blackboard type data structure. This system allows easy addition or removal of constraints, since all modules are independent and never interact directly among themselves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. CHARACTERIZATION OF GENETIC ALGORITHMS</head><p>GA introduced and formalized by Holland <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[17]</ref>, are inspired by Darwin's theory of evolution which is based on the survival of the fittest species. According to this theory, species judged stronger are reproduced at a more rapid rate. With GA, genetic operations are undertaken on two parents in order to produce two children which, hopefully, will inherit the good genes of each parent. This section presents an overview of GA's and some applications related to telecommunication networks. Readers interested in a detailed development of GA are referred to <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[17]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. GA Principles</head><p>GA's rely on biological gene and chromosomes concepts. They proceed by encoding problems and solutions, generally by taking the form of strings of bits comparable with the chromosomes of the biological systems. Characters or bits that compose strings are comparable with genes. The set of strings forms a structure. Candidates for reproduction are chosen in a probabilistic manner, and the genes of each parent are proliferated at random in the offspring. A GA is characterized therefore by a certain number of aspects that are: the coding of problem parameters, the solution search space and the evaluation function serving to select parent chromosomes. The problem parameters are coded in the form of finite length strings built from a finite alphabet. In practice, from a generation to the next, chromosomes that form the population have an increasingly higher aptitude value, and especially have genes of similar value at the same positions in the string.</p><p>The initial search space of a GA usually consists of a population of randomly generated strings. This population contains two types of candidates: some are highly productive and the others are less productive. A diversified initial population is a prerequisite to good solutions, otherwise one risks the possibility of degenerating species that would never be able to approach the optimal solution. The search for more productive structures is based on values of an objective function that allows the selection of individual strings suitable for reproduction.</p><p>Genetic operators are applied to an initial population in order to produce successive populations of good quality. There are four basic genetic operators: reproduction, crossover, mutation, and inversion. Reproduction is the process by which strings of the global population are chosen depending on the value of their objective function f to be maximized. The higher the value of the objective function of a string, the higher is the chance of this string being chosen for reproduction.</p><p>The reproduction operator is an artificial version of the natural selection which is based on the survival of the strongest strings. The objective function plays the role of a referee in that it has rights of life or death on the strings. If a string does not have a high enough objective function value, it has little chance of being chosen for reproduction. Thus, it will die, since its genes will not be found in the next generation. Once a string is chosen for reproduction, an exact replica of the former is created and then integrated with a mating pool.</p><p>Crossover is the process by which two chosen string genes are interchanged. To execute the crossover, strings of the mating pool are coupled at random. The crossover of a string pair of length l is performed as follows: a position k is chosen uniformly between 1 and (l 0 1), then two new strings are created by exchanging all characters between positions (k + 1) and l of each string of the pair considered. The new strings can be totally different from their parents. A crossover will have no consequence on a bit whose parents have the same value at the same position.</p><p>On the other hand, some crossovers use two crossover places. In this case, the genes between these crossover places are exchanged. Syswerda <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[45]</ref> has also introduced the uniform crossover according to which, for each bit of the two children, the parent who will contribute its binary value to a child is chosen at random. Mutation is the process by which a randomly chosen bit in a chromosome is permutated. It plays a rather secondary role in GA and is activated only occasionally. One has to choose the mutation frequency. For instance, if a probability of 0.005 is associated with a mutation, a chromosome will have five chances in a thousand of being transferred. The mutation randomly modifies the value of a position in a string. It is useful in returning the genetic material that would have otherwise been lost after reproduction and crossover operations. Some implementations automatically change the value of the chosen bit <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>, others randomly generate a new binary value, which at times does not entail a mutation <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Inversion is an operator which can be used for reversing a chromosome: the gene at position 1 is transferred to position l (length of the chromosome), while the gene at position l replaces gene 1; the gene at position 2 is transferred to position l 0 1, and the gene in position l01 is transferred to position 2, and so on. Before crossover, parents are inverted according to a probability pi.</p><p>A typical GA can be defined by the following general steps.</p><p>Step 1: An initial population of size v representing the number of chromosomes is generated. Then one chooses randomly the genes that will compose each chromosome: this is the first generation of chromosomes, called population.</p><p>Step 2: Each chromosome is evaluated by means of the objective function, that allows one to deduce its aptitude value.</p><p>Step 3: Then start cycles of population generation, each new one replacing the previous. The number of cycles x is determined at the start. In each cycle, chromosomes are chosen for reproduction and crossover. After each cycle, the n newly created chromosomes will replace the preceding generation. Hopefully, after the creation of the xth population, chromosomes have evolved such that this last generation contains chromosomes that are better than those of the previous generations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Some Applications of GA's in Telecommunications</head><p>GA's have been applied to many areas of research <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[42]</ref>. In telecommunications, they have been used for optimizing link capacities of a network <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>, and for solving the problem of dynamic routing anticipated in a circuit switched network <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>.</p><p>DESIGNet is an interactive system developed by BBN Communications for optimizing link capacities of a network <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>. It is a design system that simulates the traffic propagation as well as evaluates the cost and utilization of links. The network topology thus generated meets a set of performance criteria and makes an abstraction of the terminals and concentrators: it represents the backbone of the network. In this context, the application of GA's has the sole purpose of modifying the link capacities of a topological configuration considered, so as to render them optimal. The algorithm does not consider neither the addition, nor the suppression of links. Thus, the connectivity is always preserved.</p><p>For the implementation of GA, networks are modeled in the form of chromosomes. This chromosome is a list of m capacities, each capacity being associated with a link composing the network. Capacities belong to the list of commercially available capacity options. The initial population is composed of chromosomes where each gene is a capacity and is chosen randomly among available capacities. If available capacities are 1.54, 3.15, 6.31, and 44.73 Mbps, then one of the possible chromosomes representing a network of three links can be (3.15, 3.15, 1.54). The first generations essentially seek lists that satisfy client demands, subsequent generations seek to optimize these results.</p><p>On the other hand, GA has been also used to deal with the dynamic routing in a circuit switched network. The telecommunications industry offers new services such as videoconferencing or periodic data transfer calls. These services can be anticipated and planned in advance. There are distributed and centralized systems that adapt their routing strategies as a function of the present state of the network which evolves continually and a rapid response is necessary. The time spent by the system for optimizing a solution is time lost in supervision, whereas the found solution risks not satisfying the new state of the network. The organization module of a telecommunications network corresponds to this type of adaptive system that can be used to respond to needs of the new telematic services.</p><p>Call requests on a telecommunications network arrive randomly at different nodes of the network. A plan assigns to each request a route from the source node to the destination node during the required time interval. A plan is feasible if the sum of all requests assigned to a link is never greater than the capacity of this link. One considers the cost of the network for a feasible plan as being the cost of forwarded calls and penalties associated with blocked calls. The problem consists of finding a dynamic routing that minimizes the average number of blocked calls by time units, given the network configuration, the distribution describing the arrival of requests (a nonhomogeneous Poisson's process), a call table containing calls and their attributes such as the source, the destination, the bandwidth required for the call, the start time, the duration and a priority class, and finally, a loss function associated with each type of call.</p><p>The approach used by Cox et al. <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> to solve the routing problem and to draw the plan of call requests in real time is called dynamic anticipatory routing. Their algorithm takes into consideration the current state of the network, a call requests waiting list, as well as the traffic. The GA is used in the second part of the dynamic anticipatory routing, that is the bandwidth-packing. The search space considers all permutations of the call requests list to be added to the plan. For each permutation, the algorithm assigns in turn the shortest route for each call. The algorithm adjusts the bandwidths of the links defining a route as needed, and does this until there is no more call or until the calls can not be forwarded, for lack of space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS AND NUMERICAL RESULTS</head><p>The implementation of the GA proposed to solve the topological design problem is characterized by a phase of initial population generation, followed by phases of population regeneration. Solutions are coded in the form of chromosomes made up of a sequence of 1s and 0s that symbolize the existence or nonexistence of a link. The length of chromosomes is directly linked to the number of nodes in the network. Thus, a network composed of n nodes will be represented by chromosomes of length n(n 0 1)=2, that is the maximum number of links that compose a network of n nodes. For example, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows a 3-node-connected topology, with its associated chromosome, for a random network. In this figure, the number of nodes is n = 8. Hence, the maximum number of links is 28, such that the links of resulting topologies are numbered from 1 to 28. This is the basis of the chromosome ordering. For instance, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, the reading of a chromosome is from left to right. The first value is associated with link 1 which connects nodes 1 and 2, the second value is associated with link 2 which connects nodes 1 and 3, and so forth. The chromosome of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> can be interpreted as follows: links 1 and 2 exist; links 3 and 4 do not exist; link 5 exists; links 6 and 7 do not exist, and so on; the numbers in bold represent the link lengths in kilometers.</p><p>The initial population is generated in two phases. In a first phase, an initial topology of degree k is produced, then other chromosomes are created by modifying the initial topology. The creation of the initial topology is done deterministically. The link selection criterion is based on Euclidean distances between nodes. We will first choose links whose distance between nodes is the shortest. We add links to our chromosome until all nodes have at least k incident links. If the resulting topology is not k-connected, a completion cycle is undertaken in order to make it k-connected. During the creation of generations, the first chromosome to be chosen for procreation is the best chromosome of the parent generation. The other chromosomes are chosen for procreation according to the principle of roulette wheel selection <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. The inversion operator is inserted into the crossover operator and applies to the second phase of crossover.</p><p>To measure the efficiency of the algorithm and the quality of solutions that it provides, we have subjected our implementation to a sequence of tests. We have undertaken relative sensitivity analyzes to the intrinsic parameters of the GA, then measured the evolution of the performance as a function of variations of these parameters. These experiments have been performed on a 33 MHz 486 IBM PC. For the computational experiments (reference case), the parameter values used are the following: average packet size: 1000 bits; uniform traffic of 5 packets/s; degree of connectivity: 3; size of the population: 80 chromosomes; crossover probability: 0.95; mutation probability: 0.12; inversion probability: 0.23; number of generations: 40.</p><p>Capacity options and their costs are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> which gives the leasing costs of different types of links available in some marketplace. For purposes of calculation, if a flow is greater than all available capacities, then we double the maximal capacity until we have reached a feasible capacity. The average delay is computed as <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[25]</ref> T = 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">m i=1 f i C i 0 f i (1)</formula><p>where f i denotes the flow of link i; C i its capacity, the total traffic, and m the number of links of the network. The cost of a link comprises two components: a permanent cost related to the capacity of link, and a variable cost related to the physical length of this link. Let di(li; Ci) the leasing cost of a link i of capacity Ci and of length l i , the total link cost D of a network of m links is calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D = m i=1 di(li; Ci):<label>(2)</label></formula><p>All these experiments have been carried out on the basis of mean delay and total link cost computation. Consequently, the main details   needed for testing, except for simulation results, are the following: the link lengths, the average packet size (1000 bits), the traffic requirements ( ij = 5 packets/s), given that mean delay and total link cost can be computed using ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> provides the values required for calculating di(li; Ci). For example, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref> shows the link flows and capacities associated with the topology of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, where the numbers in bold represent the link lengths in kilometers. Calculated according to ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>), the average delay and the cost of this topology are T = 89:1 ms and D = $2612/month, respectively.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref> provides the Cartesian coordinates of 20 nodes defining a reference network. The initial generation is produced partly randomly.  Chance also affects genetic operators: choice of parents, crossover place, choice of the transfer bit or probability of implementing these operators. We have repeated the same problem 200 times with fixed parameters defined previously and have analyzed results obtained at the 40th generation considered for all practical purposes as a stop or convergence threshold. In other words, the choice of settling on the 40th generation is only led by CPU time consideration. Obtained solutions are chromosomes having the best evaluation of their generations. The solutions have been obtained within CPU times ranged from 3 mn, 2 s to 25 mn, and 40 s for small and medium-sized networks <ref type="bibr">(10-25 nodes)</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">IV</ref> presents the absolute frequencies of costs obtained per interval, at the 40th generation of each of 200 experiments. The minimal cost value obtained is $124 000, the maximal value is $168 291. The median cost is $141 856 and the average cost is $142 096. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, the solutions obtained follow a normal law. Based on Wilk's test of normality <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[41]</ref>, we do not reject h h h0, the normality hypothesis with W W W = 0:977 661 and P P P &lt;W W W = 0:1936 with a threshold = 0:05: Solutions obtained at each generation have been analyzed. It results that the set of solutions obtained at each generation followed a normal law, except for three generations.</p><p>Based on Table <ref type="table">V</ref>, the GA appears to work better on the average for networks of 15 nodes (n = 15) or more. For networks with less than 15 nodes, the method improves the solutions only very slightly; we can even notice a deterioration of the solution of problem 2. This is explained partly by particularities of the initial population generated. Indeed, a network of six nodes has a minimum of 15 links. As a necessary condition, a network will be of degree k = 3 if it has at least dkn=2e or nine links: our first chromosome is obtained from the initial generation in this way. According to our initial generation scheme, new chromosomes having between 1 and p 15 new links were created. Since the network is strongly connected, adding new links does not redistribute more equitably the total traffic of the network. This only contributes to increased cost. On the other hand, Topological design, being an NP-hard problem, is very difficult to solve in an optimal manner, particularly when the size of the network is large. In order to provide some information on deviation from optimal for small problems, the first problem of Table V has been also solved optimally. The optimal cost was $19 827/month, in comparison with $20 733/month obtained with a GA (4.3% of deviation). Unfortunately, this experiment cannot be carried out with greater-sized networks, such that in general deviation from optimal cannot be obtained.</p><p>Experiments have also been conducted to study the influence of probability variations associated with genetic operators. For all practical purposes, all these experiments have been undertaken on networks of 20 nodes, over 40 generations used, and with populations of 80 chromosomes. For each operator, we have repeated each problem ten times (ten cycles), the average costs were determined on the basis of these ten cycles. First, we have varied the crossover probability, while keeping the mutation and inversion probabilities fixed.  reports experiments with crossover probabilities of 0.6, 0.8, and 0.95. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> displays the spreading of results provided by the two series of experiments (with crossover probabilities of 60% and 80%), in comparison with our reference case which has a crossover probability of 95%. We noticed a phenomenon similar to that observed at the time varying the number of chromosomes, that is, the more the crossover probability increases, the more results are dispersed.</p><p>We have also studied the possibility of the best cost-effective mutation within the condition of a crossover probability of 0.95 and an inversion probability of 0.23 under which we have conducted several experiments. The average costs and the crossover probabilities are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">VII</ref>. By making abstraction of the extreme values of both a twenty node network and a population size of 80 chromosomes, experiment reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> shows that mutation probabilities of 5%, 12%, and 20% generate results usually situated in the same range of values.</p><p>Third, to complete our experiments, we have varied the inversion probability. Table VIII compares, under similar conditions, the values obtained for inversion probabilities of 10% and 30% with results obtained by the reference case whose inversion probability is 23%. The purpose of the inversion operator is to bring a little diversity into the population, just as the mutation operator. However, contrary to this operator where only one bit changes, here all bits change since  the chromosome is completely inverted. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>, results obtained with a mutation probability of 10% are well grouped and homogeneous. We observed, on the other hand, that a spreading of values could be obtained with a probability of 23% and 30%. The inversion operator is partially responsible for the extreme values that we could not obtain otherwise.</p><p>On the other hand, in order to see if the GA approach is relevant to this type of problem, results provided by GA are compared to those produced by the SA method, on k-connected networks, k = 3; 4; 5.</p><p>The SA method consists of finding in the neighborhood of a given initial configuration, a new configuration that will be, hopefully, better than the current one. In the case where this new configuration improves the current solution, it is chosen as new initial configuration to continue the perturbation process; in the opposite case, it is maintained with a probability p which decreases in time <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[35]</ref>. Readers interested in more details about theoretical foundations of SA are referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[47]</ref>.</p><p>For this computational experiment, the configuration perturbations in SA are based on link utilization (fi=Ci), and the parameters of the GA are fixed as follows: uniform traffic of 5 packets/s; size of packets: 1000 bits; size of the population: 80 chromosomes; number of generations: 25; crossover probability: 0.80; mutation probability:   <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">IX</ref>; the last two columns represent the improvement in percentage of costs and the average delay due to GA, in comparison with those provided by SA. The experiment has focused on topologies composed of 15, 18, 20, and 25 nodes. Because of hardware limitations, it was impossible to extend our research to more than 25 nodes. In almost all cases, the GA offers better solutions, both in terms of network cost D and average delay T.</p><p>Furthermore, with these same parameters, we have compared GA with the well-known cut saturation (CS) algorithm <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>, on 2connected networks whose size ranged from 10 to 25 nodes. The maximum delay Tmax was kept equal to 120 ms. Table X reports the comparative results obtained for ten problem cases; the last column shows the improvement percentage of the cost due to GA, in comparison with those provided by CS. As shown in Table X, the average delays T obtained with the CS algorithm are generally less than those provided by GA, even if in both cases these average delays satisfy the delay constraint (T &lt;Tmax). We can explain this result by the fact that CS assigns uniform capacities to communication links. Such a capacity assignment procedure consists of allocating to any link of a network topology the capacity value of the link carrying the greatest flow value. The result is an overvaluation of the residual capacities (Ci 0fi), and therefore a lowering of the average delay T.</p><p>In general, the costs obtained with GA are better than those provided by CS, for medium-sized networks (15 nodes or more). Therefore, GA appears to be more effective when the size of the network increases. However, we observed that CS generally takes less running time than GA for converging to a good solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have used a GA to solve the topological design problem of distributed packet switched networks. Experiments have been conducted to measure the quality and sensitivity of solutions provided by this algorithm. The results have shown that the set of solutions obtained at each generation followed a normal law, based on Wilk's test for normality <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[41]</ref>. Furthermore, other experiments undertaken to study the influence of probability variations associated with genetic operators have shown that a crossover of 60% generated, in general, better solutions in terms of network cost. In the same vein, it appeared that higher the crossover probability, the greater is the dispersion of results. On the other hand, a low inversion probability, that is, in the other of 10%, seemed more beneficial than a higher one.</p><p>In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the GA for solving this problem, we have compared results against SA. In almost all cases, GA led to better solutions than SA, both in terms of network cost and average delay. We have also compared the GA with the cut saturation algorithm on 2-connected networks whose sizes ranged from 10 to 25 nodes. The costs provided by the GA appeared better than those obtained with cut saturation on medium-size networks. However, the cut saturation algorithm generally takes less running time than the GA for converging to a good solution.</p><p>In summary, the numerical results have shown that the GA can solve this complicated problem. They have also confirmed the efficiency of this algorithm to produce good solutions for mediumsized networks. However, for small networks (less than 15 nodes), it appeared preferable to use other conventional methods, such as SA, or even cut saturation for 2-connected networks.</p><p>Further research is required to find a chromosome representation which takes into account not only the topological configuration, but also link attributes such as flow and capacity in a high-speed network context. It is also desirable to integrate in this representation the basic constraints of the problem, together with some specific constraints related to the quality of service. Finally, extensions to large scale networks (more than 100 nodes) could be envisioned, which would require a more compact chromosome representation in order to prevent the risk of combinatorial explosion. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Motivation</head><p>Many computer vision problems that are ill-posed, nonlinear, or unstable for a passive observer become well-posed, linear, or stable for an active observer <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Since it is able to acquire information actively, the active vision system has more potential applications than a passive one has. In an active stereo vision system, the cameras are able to perform functions such as gazing, panning, and tilting. To  perform experiments on active vision, we have built a binocular head (referred to as the IIS head). The IIS head has four revolute joints and two prismatic joints, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The two joints on top of the IIS head are for camera vergence or gazing (referred to as joint 5L and joint 5R). The next two joints below them are for tilting and panning the stereo cameras (referred to as joint 4 and joint 3). All of the above four joints are revolute, and are mounted on an X-Y table which is composed of two prismatic joints (referred to as joint 2 and joint 1). To control this head, we need to calibrate its kinematic model in advance. Because kinematic calibration is quite tedious, many researchers tend to avoid it. For example, Deriche et al. <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> have shown how to recover the epipolar geometry using an uncalibrated stereo rig. Krotkov <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> used a simplified model, namely the calibrated stereo disparity, and achieved the accuracy of about one part in 100 in estimating three-dimensional (3-D) depth. Our interest is to accurately control the stereo head for 3-D tracking and 3-D reconstruction. While the kinematic model is not an indispensable requirement, it can definitely simplify our task if we have a good estimate of the kinematic parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Why Closed-Form Solutions?</head><p>In this paper, our goal is to calibrate the kinematic parameters of the IIS head for controlling the orientations and positions of the stereo cameras. Since the IIS head was built with off-the-shelf components, its kinematic parameters are unknown. Therefore, we cannot directly apply those existing nonlinear optimization methods, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>, which all require good initial values. Even if we want to use the nonlinear optimization methods, a closed-form solution can be first applied to obtain accurate enough initial values. Theoretically, when using a nonlinear optimization technique, the initial values of the kinematic parameters must be as accurate as possible in order to obtain reliable calibration results.</p></div>

Since this binocular head is composed of off-the-shelf components, its kinematic parameters are unknown. Therefore, we can not directly apply those existing nonlinear optimization methods. Even if we want to use the nonlinear optimization methods, a closed-form solution can be first applied to obtain accurate enough initial values. Hence, this paper considers only methods that provide closed-form solutions, i.e., those requiring no initial estimates. Notice that most existing closed-form solutions require pose (i.e., both position and orientation) measurements. However, as far as we know, there is no inexpensive technique which can provide accurate pose measurements. Therefore, existing closed-form solutions based on pose measurements can not give us the required accuracy. As a result, we have developed a new method that does not require orientation measurements and can use only the position measurements of a calibration point to obtain highly accurate estimates of kinematic parameters using closed-form solutions. The proposed method is based on the complete and parametrically continuous (CPC) kinematic model, and can be applied to any kind of kinematic parameter identification problems with or without multiple end-effectors, providing that the links are rigid, the joints are either revolute or prismatic and no closed-loop kinematic chain is included. Simulations and real experiments have shown that the proposed method of using only point measurements is more robust against noise than those existing closed-form solutions using both position and orientation measurements when calibrating our binocular head.
