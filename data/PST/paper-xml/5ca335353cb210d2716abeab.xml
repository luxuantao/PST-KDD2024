<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Background</head><p>The great amount and variety of gene expression information generated in the last few years, have led to the need for processing and interpreting such information. In this sense, Gene Networks (GNs) have become a key tool for the understanding and modelling of complex biological processes. The term Gene Network, also called, Gene Regulatory Network (GRN), is used to describe complicated functional pathways in a given cell or tissue, which represent living processes such as metabolism, gene regulation, transport mechanisms or signal transduction.</p><p>GRNs are models used to describe and predict dependencies between molecular entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. These are composed of nodes, representing genes, proteins, metabolites or RNA; and edges, which represent molecular relations, e.g. protein-DNA, protein-protein interactions or other relationships of several kind <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, a schematic representation of how the abstraction in the modelling process looks like, is shown.</p><p>GRNs are a ground-breaking tool for the discovery of new interactions between biological entities, helping scientists in research and making easier hypotheses formulation. They have been successfully used in diagnostics, as in the case of Liang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Many predicted interactions have been confirmed experimentally, which confirms GRN's reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The inference of GRNs has also been proven to be relevant in the study of fundamental processes occurring in living organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, ranging from development to nutrition and metabolic coordination. Multiple applications in fields such as human health or agronomy have been developed thanks to the implementation of GRN models. Moreover, GRNs make easier the manipulation, control and coordination of cell physiologic events related to GRN activity: diseases, biotechnological applications or crop production among others. For example in Yan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, advances on network reconstruction, analysis and interpretation of GRN reliably allowed the identification of molecular biomarkers for monitoring cancer progression and treatment. Also, GRNs have contributed to the representation of developmental processes, as they can generate developmental patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Reverse Engineering deals with the process of network inference or GRN reconstruction out of experimental results. In particular, computational GRN inference process relies on the well-known Knowledge Database Discovery (KDD) workflow. KDD goes from input data preprocessing to the validation of generated models, often performed by data base search and comparison with prior experimental data (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</p><p>The process starts with the input data. This usually consists of gene expression datasets, which can be obtained either experimentally or from databases such as NCBI GEO <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> (Step 1 of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). After the input dataset is selected, it may be preprocessed by any computational method in order to improve the quality of the study, either because it does not affect the intended network, or because it shows bad quality (Step 2 of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). Then, the preprocessed data is used as input for a computational inference algorithm, which provides the resulting network <ref type="bibr">(</ref>Step 3 of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). Used algorithms may be based on different machine learning approaches. Finally, the obtained model (network) is optimized and validated so true biological insights can be obtained from it, by a comparison with real biological knowledge (Steps 4 and 5 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</p><p>In this work, we present a review of the whole process of GRN reconstruction, based on the KDD workflow (steps in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>), in an attempt to address the latest and most relevant advances in the field of computational-based GRNs reconstruction. Aiming to offer the most reliable and relevant review, works cited in this paper were classified according to the main taxonomies presented in the field, e.g. the works by Hecker et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> or Dougherty <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and selected from the main repositories such as Scopus, PubMed or Google Scholar. Besides, most relevant papers, based on citations, presented results and impact of the publication, were given additional priority.</p><p>The rest of the paper follows the description of each step of the GRN reconstruction workflow (KDD process). In Section 2, the kind of data and computational methods for data preprocessing used for GRN inference are described (Steps 1 and 2, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). Section 3 introduces the main computational approaches for network inference (Step 3). Next, in Section 4, optimisation proposals for the inferred networks are described (Step 4). In Section 5, the different GRNs validation approaches are described (Step 5). Last, final considerations are shown in the Conclusions section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Biological data: basic input for GRN inference</head><p>The rapid development of GRNs is linked to the increasing amount of high-throughput technologies, which provide with huge data sets to be managed. These constantly-updated technologies, like Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, which has acquired significant quality, robustness and low noise during the last decade, allow a leader view into RNA and DNA samples. Then, sequencing has become a standard approach, since the Genome is often considered the cornerstone in the study of organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Although GRNs have traditionally based on microarray technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, depending on the case, NGS may be more efficient than these as a primary source of expression data <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Novel techniques like RNA-Seq (RNA sequencing) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, use NGS to reveal the presence and quantity of RNA in a biological sample at a given moment. RNA-Seq is then used to analyse the continuously-changing cell transcriptome and facilitates the quest for alternatively-spliced transcripts, post-transcriptional modifications, gene fusions, mutations/SNPs and a sort of changes in gene expression. Additionally, RNA-Seq is able to look at different RNA populations including small RNAs (like miRNAs), tRNAs, and ribosomal profiling, thus providing a quite complete overview of the cell state.</p><p>Another powerful application of NGS is the study of protein-DNA interactions by looking at protein binding sites in the Genome. This is especially useful in the case of transcription factors (TFs), for which Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) techniques are used.</p><p>The integration of heterogeneous biological information, e.g. multiple omics, may enhance the capabilities of GRN inference. Prior to this points, one needs to know the basics on main omics, which are outlined in the following subsection. A general scheme of the process of GRN inference is shown on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Omics and related technology</head><p>Although genes can be regulated at several levels of integration (transcription factors, co-factors, post-translational modifications of proteins, proteins and transcripts degradation or epigenetics among others), a key step is gene transcription <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Then, the choice of expression data for GRN reconstruction is often considered of preference. This is why many GRN approaches, termed influential GRNs, only consider transcript levels and try to establish direct or indirect relations between them. Ideally, a robust model, closest to the actual biological system, could be created by the integration of omics data sets (wholegenome data sets, transcriptomics, proteomics, interactomics, metabolomics, epigenomics or exomics among others) together with other previous biological knowledge.</p><p>In this subsection, the two main data sources for GRN reconstruction, Genome and Transcriptome, are addressed. Nevertheless, GRN inference is shifting towards the integration of heterogeneous data, and models become more complex and closer to reality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">The Genome</head><p>The term Genome refers to the collection of genes comprised in a biological system. In the past, these collections were limited to proteincoding genes, but the field has been extended to many other elements such as TF-binding regions, microRNAs, or evolutionarily-conserved regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In the case of TF, the goal is to detect potential links between these and differential gene expression in the cell/tissue.</p><p>At the primary archives level, the most important nucleotide sequence databases are: GenBank (USA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, EMBL (Europe) and Data Bank of Japan Center, DDBJ <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Also, ENSEMBL database reunites information related to mammals' genomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and seeks for a centralized resource for geneticists, molecular biologists and other genomes researchers studying of our own species and other vertebrates and model organisms.</p><p>Furthermore, fields like Epigenetics (i.e. the study of influential factors out of classic genetics) enlarge our understanding of the Genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. As an example, in Ramsey et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the available public data stored at The Cancer Genome Atlas, an important database for human cancer research, is used to construct the underlying GRN and to identify the key role of the RUNX-1 transcription factor in adenocarcinoma.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">The Transcriptome</head><p>Functional Genomics or Transcriptomics refers to the analysis of gene expression patterns and tries to find relationships between them and their biological background <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Transcription is considered the main control mechanism in gene expression, so GRN reconstruction using expression levels is generally of preference <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, a lot of RNA transcripts do not code for proteins (noncoding RNA, ncRNA), e.g. tRNA. On the other hand, ncRNA play a key role in multiple processes, including gene regulation. These transcripts are single-stranded RNA folded into structured molecule. Prediction of ncRNA (secondary) structure is possible as well as predicting where such ncRNA genes are located in the genome. Microarray-obtained Gene Expression data can be found at databases like Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> or ArrayExpress <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>As an example of this, Kang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> used genome-wide expression data to generate a model able to predict acute rejection responses in kidney transplantation, using clinical trial data as an input. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.">Reading software for the collection of prior available knowledge</head><p>Aside from the huge amount of data stored in databases, there is knowledge generated experimentally which can also be integrated into the process of GRN reconstruction. Latest findings in biological data are directly incorporated to databases as mentioned above, some others are described in the literature. For this reason, software has been developed to automatically and reliably extract pieces of information about relationships between molecular elements from the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>This section does not intend to provide a complete and detailed description of the diversity of available biological data. Additionally, it illustrates the potential benefit as well as the challenge of integrating such diverse and complementary types of biological information to reliably infer GRNs. In the following subsections, some indications on experimental set-up for the obtaining of experimental data are addressed.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The main goal in GRNs inference is to generate abstract models for actual biological processes. These models tries to represent complex interactions between molecular entities such as gene activation, inhibition or feedback loops.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Experimental design to obtain biological data for GRN inference</head><p>On a frequent basis, gene expression experiments are performed for GRN reconstruction. Depending on the used approach, quality and quantity of the generated data may vary. Upon the performance of these experiments, two aspects must be taken into account: perturbation and observation of the biological system.</p><p>Experimental design includes usually systematic perturbations e.g. shift between different environmental conditions, interventions at the genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic or metabolomic level. As a result, differential expression patterns can be found under imposed conditions. Resultant gene expression patterns can be compared to a non-perturbed profile provided by a presumed model of the network. Thus, estimated goodness of the model can be then assessed <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Transcriptome level perturbations can also be used for GRN inference, for this, molecular techniques are often applied, e.g. RNA interference (iRNA) can knock-down other RNAs to their degradation in order to study the effect of their loss. Measuring altered gene expression levels provides some insight on the influence of the molecular elements involved, and it is key to model construction. For example, REDuction of UnCertain Edges (REDUCE) algorithm finds optimal gene knock-out experiment for inferring directed graphs of GRNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>Measurements on perturbation experiments can be performed in a static (steady state) or time-course situation, the latter involves the use of dynamic programming. Depending on the knowledge to be achieved, the experimental set-up will vary and so will the choice between a static or a dynamic GRN architecture:</p><p>• Generation of static data comes with the assumption of an equili- brium or steady-state situation of the biological system. Depending on the case, the steady-state choice may miss critical dynamic events for reliable GRN construction i.e. dynamic changes occurring with time, as in Kim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>• On the other hand, time-series experiments, where samples are taken in a series of time-points after perturbation, constitute the dynamic approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The experimental set-up determines the number of time-point measurements, thus, the data amount.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Data requirements</head><p>Reliable GRN reconstruction requires a considerable minimum quantity of accurate data. On the other hand, experimental costs and efforts also need to be minimized. Generally, the more nodes involved in the network, the more data will be needed.</p><p>In order to provide real biological insights, networks are conventionally based on experimental data. However, experimental data may not be useful for this aim for two main reasons: (i) The data collected from the experiment shows bad quality and (ii) data is unavailable.</p><p>Regarding the first case, model quality is proportional to biological data set quality. Alterations on the biological input (measurement noise or inappropriate experimental design) may lead to unreliable GRNs. Models could either estimate high-confidence gene regulatory interactions or just speculative dependencies, but depending on the complexity of the model, they may consist of many parameters and be more datademanding. However, depending on the information one aims to obtain from the model, the precision required for the data may vary <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. To cope with this, the inference strategy may use external prior knowledge from databases and literature, so experimental data required will depend on this knowledge and the ability of the used algorithm to integrate this information in the modelling process.</p><p>If data is not available, e.g. it is not possible or difficult to obtain, some approaches make use of fuzzy logic to infer missing data. In Bordon et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, fuzzy logic is applied to assess quantitative values to an incomplete kinetic dataset for gene repression. Besides, GRN can still be reconstructed out of in silico generated data. For example, SiGNet (Signal Generator for Networks) is a Cytoscape app that simulates experimental data for a signalling network of known structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Despite not providing biologically-meaningful networks, this approach is often used for algorithm testing and training, so it can be put to work on an actual database afterwards.</p><p>Furthermore, model quality does not only depend on data quality, but also on the inference algorithm, which could vary the efficiency of GRN inference out of the same data set. It is necessary to find precise model parameters using heuristic approaches, which may perform suboptimally.</p><p>As explained before, there is a direct relation between the complexity of the model and the required amount of data, but this certainly has a limit. Dimensionality problems come with difficulty of finding an accurate model (dynamic, large-scale, complex), when the size of the search space increases dramatically <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Data pre-processing</head><p>Data pre-processing, prior to GRN inference, is a key step for GRN reconstruction and quality of outcome. Methods for this aim will depend on the type of data and the experimental design.</p><p>As mentioned by Hecker et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, there are two main sources of variability in GRN reconstruction: systematic errors (bias) and stochastic effects (noise). To ensure quality of the data and GRN outcome, fundamental analysis is applied, including noise filtering, system affect detection, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>Systematic effects can be nearly removed through data normalization, since some genes expression can be very variable in one cell/ tissue type. For this, housekeeping genes (relativity constant expression patterns) are often taken into account <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. On the other hand, replicates performance provides with repeated measurements to reduce stochastic effects.</p><p>Finally, further data manipulation may be necessary, whose specificity will depend on the network inference methods e.g. dynamic programming requires the estimation of time derivatives for each measurement point of the time-series. Another example is the case of Boolean networks (see Section 3), which needs the conversion of measured expression levels into binary data prior to network inference. In the following section, the main algorithms for GRN reconstruction are explained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Computational approaches for GRN construction</head><p>The term model architecture refers to the logical thinking underneath the GRN reconstruction. In the form of an algorithm, model architecture describes the behaviour of the regulatory dependencies between the biological components involved, basing on multiple other parameters.</p><p>The choice of a certain model architecture will shape the resulting GRN. Biological data has to be analysed so network structure (interactions between components) and model parameters (intensity and type of interaction) can be learned from it. Together with the increasing amount of biological data, the needs of analysis have led to the proposition of novel algorithms for GRN reconstruction.</p><p>In the following subsections, the main GRN inference methods are exposed, in an attempt to explain the basic thinking underneath each approach. Main GRN inference methods can be summarized in: (a) Information theory, (b) Boolean networks, (c) Differential equations models, (d) Bayesian and (e) Neural models. Also, a comparison between these methods is shown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Information theory models</head><p>Information theory-based networks are the most common type of networks due to their computational simplicity. They are also called coexpression networks since they establish gene-gene relationships if the dependence level between both gene is above a threshold set in advance. The higher the threshold, the sparser inferred GRN <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. The main measures to determine the dependencies between genes are the correlation coefficients like Pearson, Spearman or Kendall coefficients. However, different measures like Euclidean distances or mutual information, were also applied for the inference of GRN. These models are suitable to cover different aspects of cells, which are here understood as time-varying living systems which perform complicated processes inside and between them.</p><p>An advantage of information theory models is the discovery of large GRN from low expression data due to their low computational cost. Among the main proposals based on this model for GRN reconstruction we can highlight: REVEAL (The REVerse Engineering ALgorithm) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>; RELEVANCE <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>; ARACNE (Algorithm for the Reverse engineering of Accurate Cellular Network) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> or ARACNE-based algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>; CLR (Context Likelihood of Relatedness) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>; MRNET (based on the maximum relevance/minimum redundancy) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> or FyNE <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. These approaches apply correlation coefficients, Euclidean distances or information theory scores such as mutual information and conditional mutual information for the identification of gene interactions. Also, supervised-DTI and non-supervised-DTI approaches, based on the directed information (DTI) metric, are used <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Other algorithms use the minimum description length (best explanation of the data gathered with limited number of observations) to determine a threshold value <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p><p>Algorithms often undergo an improvement process for a more precise data analysis. This is how novel algorithms work, as: MI3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, based on three-way mutual information; SRI-CLR <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> adding the synergy index to CLR algorithms; MRNETB <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> combination of backward selection and sequential search; C3NET <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> which selects the highest mutual information value among the neighbors of each gene; or CMIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, which applies conditional mutual information from the lower order to the higher order.</p><p>Analogously, graphical Gaussian models (GGMs) are used to represent conditional dependencies between variables and allow distinguishing direct form indirect associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Also, mutual information models infer regulatory gene interactions basing on pairwise mutual information <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. Two algorithms commonly used for network inference based on pairwise mutual information are ARACNe <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> and CLR <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p><p>Overall, main advantages of these models are the simplicity, low computational complexity and low number of required samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Therefore, this kind of network fits perfectly with the construction of large gene networks. On the other hand, these models are static and do not take into account multiple genes participating in a regulation. As an example, in Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, a total of 14 genes were identified as hubs/nodes in the regulation of postmenopausal osteoporosis disease, by means of an information theory-based approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Boolean networks</head><p>Boolean networks are easy to implement and allow capturing the actual dynamical behaviour of GRN. They are able to describe biological phenomena such as oscillations, multi-stationary events, longrange correlations, switch-like behaviour stability and hysteresis <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</p><p>Boolean networks represent genes by variables and their expression level is discretized into Boolean binary values (by clustering and thresholding <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>): '0' for low values (silenced or nearly-silenced genes) or '1' for high values (activated genes) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Thus, a gene i is represented by on/off expression values. Operators of logic (and, ∧; or, ∨; and not, ¬), link Boolean variables in a Boolean function.</p><p>Boolean functions reconstructing the network compose directed graphs G(X, F), where X represents a variable, which is associated to other variables by means of the function F <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. The so-called state of the network (S) for a time t is represented by the values of all different nodes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= … S t t t t ( ) xi ( ), xi ( ), xi ( ) n 1 2</formula><p>Although straightforward and simple, Boolean networks find their main limitation in the discretization step. Gene expression is rarely a matter of fully-activation or fully-silencing, since there are often uncountable different gene states in between. Thus, important details of system behaviour might be lost. Boolean networks also need to cope with noisy data problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, as the accuracy of thresholding will certainly determine network topology. Nevertheless, Boolean networks are easy to interpret and they offer a simple dynamic approach for GRN.</p><p>Considered as the simplest GRN inference approach, Boolean networks have been proven useful in many cases. In Simak et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, regulatory relations and potential candidate biological functions are explored from Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptomic data. Boolean network function performance was validated using Saccharomyces cerevisiae time course data, and its outcome was consistent with all different cell cycle stages. Also, in Claussen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> a dynamic Boolean network model is used to infer interactions between low-abundance species in human gut microbiome, which are often overlooked. The model uncovered synergistic and competitive interactions between these species. In Polak et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, regulation of immune responses in primary Langerhans cells were analysed using a Boolean GRN model, whose predictions were experimentally validated afterwards. In Moignard et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, a GRN model for blood development was reconstructed and used to predict the role of some transcription factors, later validated experimentally. Finally in Orlando et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, a Boolean network is used to model yeast cell cycle. This model works as an oscillator reflecting a sequenced transcriptional program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Differential equations models</head><p>Ordinary differential equation (ODE) approaches use continuous instead of discrete variables. This leads to a more accurate model, and enables the dynamic modelling of gene regulation. Differential equations will then represent changes in gene expression as a function of other genes expression and taking into account environmental factors, allowing a quantitative modelling (closer to actual behaviour of the biological system) <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</p><p>Modelling of gene expression dynamics through ODE often can be represented by the equation: <ref type="figure">,</ref><ref type="figure">,</ref><ref type="figure">,</ref><ref type="figure">,</ref><ref type="figure"></ref> )</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= … f x x x p u dx dt ( ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">i i N 1 2</formula><p>where x represents the expression level of a certain gene i at a given time t. N represents the number of genes involved, u refers to external perturbations of the system and p to the parameter set of that system. Then, f is the function, which describes the change rate of the state variables x 1-n depending on p. In ODE models, continuous-time variables with constraints are used, and negative values are not allowed, i.e. the assumption of protein and mRNA molecules degradation being unregulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</p><p>There are multiple solutions to ODE systems if no constraints are assessed. This is why, specifications of the f function and constraints representing prior knowledge (simplification, approximations or educated guesses among others) are required for the identification of model structure and parameters. A disadvantage of many ODE models is that these consider only linear models or just specific types of non-linear functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, while regulatory processes are often characterized by complex non-linear dynamics. More complex variants of ODE-based models are stochastic differential equations models which take into account the stochastic nature of GRNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. Moreover, ODE models cannot cope with large GRN modelling and value estimation for model parameters results hard in some cases due to their computational complexity.</p><p>ODE-based models have provided outstanding results in GRN inference. As an example, in Matsumoto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, SCODE algorithm (Single Cell Ordinary Differential Equation) was applied to provide some insight in GRNs related to differentiation processes. Single cell RNA-Seq is performed on individual cells so differences on their expression patterns can be evaluated. Deng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, proved the efficiency of ODE models in dynamic GRNs reconstruction. Improvement on calculation scheme of the derivatives and data pre-filtration lead to improved scalability to large GRNs. However, combinations between different methods have been proven to be useful depending on the case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Bayesian networks</head><p>Bayesian networks are one of the most used GRN inference architectures. They make use of the Bayes theorem of probability, then combining probability and graph theory to qualitatively model the properties of GRNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</p><p>Bayesian networks are generally directed and acyclic graphs (DAGs) G = (X, A) <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>, which characterize the joint distribution of nodes as a series of local probability distributions (P). X represents genes/nodes (x 1 , x 2 , …, x n ), or gene variables and A refers to the directed rod corresponding to probabilistic dependency interactions between these genes. The joint distribution of the variables in a Bayesian network is described in Chai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">∏ = = P x x x P x x t ( , , ) ( |parents( )) n i n i i 1 2 1</formula><p>where x i is a node, n refers to the total number of involved genes, Parents (x i ) are all parent genes regulating the child node (gene x i ).</p><p>Parameter P describes the Conditional Probability Distribution (CPD) or local distribution for the node i. Bayesian networks make use of the Markov assumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>, which refers to the memoryless property of a stochastic process: given its parents, each node is independent of its non-descendants. Bayesian networks imply a set of conditional dependencies so the algorithm is able to infer a DAG from them. Since many DAGs can be inferred from the data set (D), the algorithm has to find the best DAG (G) describing the data set and each graph (G) is evaluated through a Bayesian score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>= + + S G D P G D P G ( : ) log ( | ) log ( ) constant</head><p>In Larjo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, methods for learning Bayesian networks are detailed, having this learning three essential parts: (i) Model Selection, DAGs evaluation as candidate graphs of relationships; (ii) Parameter Fitting: given graphs and experimental data sets, find the best conditional probabilities for each node; (iii) Fitness Rating: scoring of each candidate model so the higher the score, the better the model fits to the data. The model with the highest score represents the GRN resulting from the inference. Learning of Bayesian networks can be based either on discrete (often Boolean) or continuous expression levels. Thus, the probabilistic model underneath could be a multinomial or a Gaussian distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. Multinomial variables take a finite number of possible values but in the case of continuous variables, in a classical approach, data would be discretized. Bayesian networks are hard to infer from continuous data since it requires large computational power. On the other hand, data does not require discretization.</p><p>Flexibility is the main advantage for Bayesian networks, since they combine different types of data as well as prior knowledge for reliable GRN inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. Bayesian approaches are often considered of preference while inferring dynamic GRNs and have shed some light in many fields ranging from evolutionary-development to medicine. In Acerbi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, continuous time Bayesian networks were used for the successful revelation of well-known regulatory mechanisms in Th17 cells differentiation, also providing some new biological insights. Chekouo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, proposed a Bayesian model to identify micro RNAs and their target genes obtaining a valid algorithm for kidney cancer biomarkers identification. Also in Chudasama et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>, novel cancer biomarkers were identified thanks to Bayesian networks, which may support clinical practice and improve long term outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Neural networks</head><p>Inspired by animal central nervous systems, these models comprise two main approaches: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The first is purely neural, whereas the second also involves fuzzy logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. RNN is a successful method for GRN inference, since it enables modelling of non-linear and dynamic interaction among genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>. Neural models allow continuous variables and their outcome looks similar to the neural connections observed in natural processes.</p><p>As described in Chai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, neural network models can be represented by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">∑ = ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ + ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ - ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ = τ g w e β λe de dt 1 i i j N j i i i 1 ij</formula><p>where w ij refers to the type and concentration of the relation between genes at the ith and jth position. The reaction decay rate parameter is represented by λ i , the basal expression level is indicated by β i and e i represents the gene expression level for the ith gene. Function g indicates the regulatory effect on each involved gene, defined by a set of weights such as w ij . The computed weighted sum of all potential reg- ulating genes is considered as the regulatory effect on a particular gene. A scoring function is also applied for evaluation of the outcomes, network performance optimization and error minimization.</p><p>In Ling et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>, a RNN was used to study p53/Mdm2-mediated response to DNA damage. Tong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>, used ANNs to study gene-gene interactions for biomarkers in childhood sarcomas. Siddens et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>, used fuzzy neural network models to predict polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-mediated perturbations of the Cyp1b1 transcriptional regulatory network in mouse skin. Finally, in Rubiolo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>, a supervised neural model called Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) was successfully used to reconstruct GRNs, even surpassing many commonly-used approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Additional network architectures</head><p>Although GRN reconstruction is usually tackled by means of one of the models above (or a combination of them), there are some other GRN inference approaches that clearly differ from these methods. As an example of this, in Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>, fuzzy cognitive maps and a dynamical multi-agent genetic algorithm with the decomposition-based model were used to deal with large-scale GRN inference. Also in Thiagarajan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>, the power of Graphics Processing Units and parallel reverse engineering algorithm was used for the identification and simulation of genome-scale GRN, which pose computer intensive problems. Finally in Ud-Dean et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>, an algorithm called TRaCE+ is used for GRN reconstruction, being able to indicate positive or negative regulations, and reduce uncertain edges.</p><p>To sum up for this section, a comparison between all 5 exposed inference methods is shown on Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>In Section 4, some important issues on the application of the inference algorithm are explained such as: feature selection, parameter estimation, structure optimization and integration of prior knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Network optimization based on machine learning algorithms</head><p>A naïve approach upon the GRN inference process would be the one of enumerating all possible DAGs for a given number of nodes, which is deemed brute-force search. However, the amount of possible DAGs for a given number of nodes grows exponentially, making this search problematic. Therefore, heuristics or/and constraints need to be applied to make the process more efficient.</p><p>Leaving the model algorithm aside, the inference approach needs further adjustment for reliable network reconstruction. First, a dimensionality reduction has to be performed on the large gene expression data in order to reduce computational cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">92]</ref>. The term curse of dimensionality was introduced by Bellman <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref> to refer to the exponential growth of required amount of data to provide a reliable analysis. Some strategies to face this issue are:</p><p>• Reducing the number of nodes focusing only on features like genes or proteins of interest employing feature selection or feature mapping methods.</p><p>• Restricting the number of model parameters: using simple models and network connectivity constraints such as sparseness. This minimizes the number of edges in the network thus reducing the number of model parameters.</p><p>• Integrating specific prior knowledge about network structure which increases the model and provides higher quality results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Feature selection and feature mapping</head><p>Modelling biological system requires assumption-making to focus only on those specific aspects which are important for aim of the study. Feature selection and feature mapping help reducing model complexity by excluding non-relevant features in GRN inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</p><p>Upon feature selection, non-responsive or not well measured genes are removed from the data. Machine learning algorithms are often affected by data noise, which should also be reduced to avoid unnecessary model complexity. On the other hand, in feature mapping redundant information is removed. For this, different molecular entities in a functional element are combined when they represent the common behaviour that reflects a particular biological function, thus clustering nodes and reducing complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>.</p><p>Dimensionality has to be decreased using an appropriate approach so the network is still large enough to provide a significant result on the biological phenomena under study. Some of the approaches consist in the filtering of differentially expressed genes and the clustering those genes that are co-expressed. Differentially expressed genes, are often the only ones considered in some experiments, and are identified thanks to methods like DESeq2 (Love et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>) or Limma (Ritchie et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>). Moreover, these techniques try to reduce the number of model variables.</p><p>Feature selection seeks for the minimization of the number of estimated parameters in order to improve performance and generalizability of GRNs, solely using the data to deduce dependencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>. A general approach is to consider only genes showing significant expression changes under the studied experimental conditions.</p><p>According to Hira and Gillies <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref>, there are three main categories of feature selection strategies to be considered: (i) filters, which extract features from the data (without any involved learning); (ii) wrappers, which select useful features through learning techniques; and (iii) embedded techniques, combining feature selection and classifier construction. Clustering of co-expressed and/or co-regulated genes or proteins has been conventionally used for the reduction of network components. These are ultimately genes or proteins showing similar expression patterns or genes belonging to the same pathway or biological function.</p><p>As stated before, experimental gene expression data is often complemented with prior knowledge obtained from biological databases. In this enrichment analysis, genes are selected and compared with previously-determined functional gene groups. Enrichment analyses normally make use of GO terms, Gene Ontology Annotations (GOA) and databases like KEGG Pathways, OMIM and Gene Prospector <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>.</p><p>Alternatively, Knowledge Driven Variable Selection (KDVS), performs discovery methods and enrichment analyses at the same time, thus enhancing results interpretability.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Biological network parameters</head><p>GRN structure has been proven to be sparse, and following a scalefree topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>. The latter means that nodal degree distribution of the GRN is a power law distribution.</p><p>Model structure and model parameters estimation are two main tasks of network inference. The idea behind these tasks is to apply a learning algorithm to fit the output of the mathematical model to the provided experimental data <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The choice of a network topology is another important step in GRN reconstruction. Herein, Radcliffe <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref> studied the application of form analyses to GRN topology related problems.</p><p>Structure optimization is thus the process which finds the network topology (connectivity) that best explains the experimental data, taking into account constraints imposed by the available knowledge. A key point here is network sparseness. On the other hand, parameter optimization seeks for the identification of the best model parameters for a given model structure. As detailed in Valverde et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>, several GRN properties have to be taken into account for network reconstruction:</p><p>1 Sparseness: a gene is usually regulated by a small and limited number of genes. Then, regulatory inputs per node are limited. Exceptionally, the so-called master genes control large parts of the network (high out-degree) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">101]</ref>. Generally, as network connectivity increases, the data will be better fitted by the model. Nevertheless, higher-connected networks bring several difficulties. Thus, there is a compromise between model quality and model complexity. Sparseness helps finding the most likely combination of regulators <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref>. 2 Scale-freeness: the distribution of node degrees in a GRN tends to have the form of a power law. In those scale-free networks most genes are sparsely connected whereas a few are highly connected. 3 Highly-structured: networks can be decomposed in modular components that consist of only a few genes, which follow regular hierarchies. 4 Modularity: this means, when an ensemble of genes cooperates within a same specific function <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref>. This can be observed by clustering co-expressed genes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Scoring functions for structure optimization</head><p>Explicit structure optimization methods compare different topologies of GRN models by means of a scoring function, which helps achieving network sparseness. Several scoring criteria have been developed for the different inference methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. Gene interactions are added or removed in order to obtain a better-scored topology.</p><p>Brute-force search, where all possible combinations of interactions are tested, is only possible for small networks, on which strong restrictions are also applied. The total number of combinations for each node can be estimated as 2 n -1, where n is the number of involved nodes. A different optimization strategy has to be applied if this is not the case.</p><p>Heuristic methods apply educated guesses to lead the search to the most likely solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. Some examples of search techniques are: breadth first search <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref>, beam search <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref> and hill-climbing <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>. Search techniques add or remove connections in the network. The three main search techniques are: Forward Selection (Growing), which starts from a simple model and most important interactions are added first up to a certain limit; Backward Elimination (pruning), which starts from a highly connected model and less significant interactions are removed; and Stepwise Selection, which combines both previous approaches. As an example, in Gómez-Vela et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>, a greedy approach is used for structure optimization of densely-connected networks.</p><p>Finally, for a given modelling architecture and a network structure optimization strategy, one can infer the model from the data. Besides, the optimization strategy may be supported by prior knowledge (see Section 4.4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Integration of diverse biological information</head><p>Modelling of GRNs has to be comprehensive and integrative, thus, as repeated throughout this review, the use of prior available knowledge (other experiments, databases, scientific literature, etc.) is a key step to reduce combinatorial complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Knowledge-based modelling approaches are the most robust for realistic GRN inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Prior biological knowledge hampers biologically plausible assumptions, supporting the reverse engineering process. For example, many inference algorithms make use of the publicly-available data stored at GO and/or KEGG databases, as in the case of Zhu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>.</p><p>Biological knowledge can be integrated into mathematical modelling and taken into account for network reconstruction, thus providing accuracy to the process. Methods integrating information from ChIP, microarrays or RNA-Seq experiments are considered of preference. There are ChIP-Seq databases from specific cell types providing with information about transcription factors or epigenetic and transcriptional landscapes. DNA data sets providing with DNA structures, sequence conservation and patterns can also be integrated in GRN inference. Most biological processes involve combinatorial contributions of transcriptional regulation, alternative splicing, post-translational modifications or protein-protein interactions. The Biological General Repository for Interaction Data sets (BioGRID) is a database of reference aiming to annotate protein, genetic and chemical interactions for all model organism species and humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>.</p><p>However, this is a challenging process and the comprehensive integration of the available heterogeneous data may turn into a complex horizon. One of the attempts for this aim is The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which catalogues and discover major cancer-causing genomic alterations <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>. This platform is based on microarrays and NGS methods such as: RNAseq, MicroRNAseq, DNAseq, SNP-based platforms, array-based DNA methylation sequencing or reverse-phase protein array. As expected, for the integrated-multi-dimensional data analysis, comprehensive exploration is required, for which promising tools are arising. In Pineda et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref>, several omics data are merged in an integrative analysis for a more comprehensive study of bladder cancer, by using a Global-LASSO. Also in the work by Salehzadeh-Yazdi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>, metabolomic and epigenetic data are integrated in GRN modelling. Finally, in the work by Sinha <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref> an improvement on inference accuracy is shown when integrating epigenetic information on a Bayesian model.</p><p>Integrative learning approaches start from a template network built out of databases and literature (real network topology) and then, an inference strategy is applied fitting the model to the data and taking into account the template <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The template information also known as training data can also be incorporated into the GRN inference process, and it can also be used to constrain explicit search methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Learning models use training data sets in order to build generalizable models. However, an important parameter to take into account is the data set shift, since most algorithms assume training and test data to be drawn from the same distribution. Data set shift may result in suboptimal fitting of the model. Data normalization and batch correction techniques help to cope with data set shifts. To make sure that two data sets are drawn from the same distribution, quantile normalization is applied, which normalizes target distributions to a reference distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">GRN validation and appraisal of inference methods</head><p>Once the final network is obtained, its biological significance has to be tested. Not all GRN-predicted interactions are biologically meaningful. In general terms, an interaction between a gene and its presumed regulator is considered biologically meaningful when the disruption of one or both of these elements triggers a change on gene expression. The identification of meaningful interactions requires network validation, so further support can be obtained for them <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>. Also the other way round, models should be predictive, meaning this able to generate plausible biological interactions which may be afterwards proved right <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. However, lack of validation does not necessarily mean 'not-biologically-meaningful' interactions, since the validation methodology plays a crucial role and/or many interactions may have not been described yet.</p><p>According to Dougherty and Qian <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref>, there are two main issues regarding network validation: (i) whether the inferred network provides good predictions on the experimental data (scientific validation) and (ii) whether the applied inference algorithm within a certain network model framework yields networks that are accurate relative to some criterion of goodness (inference validation). The boundaries between both approaches actually blur in practice, since validation of an inference model requires then scientific validation of the inference, and results of the later may be used to improve the inference method <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Network validation assesses the quality of the inferred GRN supporting on available knowledge. For this aim, scoring methodologies are often applied to obtain a quantitative evaluation of the model with respect to the information used for its generation (internal validation) and other information (external validation). Also, web-based frameworks have been developed to support GRN validation, as in the case of Genotet <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Quantitative evaluation of inference performance</head><p>GRNs can be evaluated using scoring methodologies which allow the comparison between different networks. The process is described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>, where the inferred network is compared with a reference network (Gold-Standard, closest to reality to the general knowledge) obtaining a quality measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">118]</ref>. A Gold Standard enables the estimation of several metrics which would jointly provide an evaluation of model's goodness. This is certainly a key point in GRN inference, since data may provide a massive amount of possible interaction and only a few of them are deemed true <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119]</ref>.</p><p>GRN inference relies on the data set handling method, which often cannot depict all interactions. For example, ChIP techniques may cause only the strongest (or most represented) interactions to be considered in the model, leaving many (less represented) others behind. Aside from the experimental techniques limitation, relationships may be missed due to high thresholding, but also due to low expression levels or nonvariant behaviour with respect to target genes. Thus, many equallybiologically-meaningful interactions are missed, false negatives (FN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>.</p><p>Conversely, false positives (FP) are also incorporated into GRNs. FPs are deemed technical when the inferred interaction is just sporadic in nature and it is not retrieved even with the same assay and conditions. Technical FPs, depend on assay robustness so the used approach has to be optimized. FPs are deemed biological in case of not biologically meaningful interactions, which are robustly detected. This can be the case of both a TF and its target being regulated by another TF which does not change its expression. Sub-optimal specificity of antibodies in ChIP experiments, which results in binding to lower affinity or nonspecific sites, may also result in a FPs gain.</p><p>Finally, true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) are described according to previous knowledge, since these are only considered when a particular interaction has been proved experimentally.</p><p>In order to evaluate model quality, it is necessary to analyse if the model correctly predicts the GRN behaviour or if the model represents the true structure of the system. Statistical measurements are used to compare inferred models with the actual behaviour of the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[120]</ref>. This is the case of supervised network inference, where part of the actual network is used for model training and optimization.</p><p>According to Schrynemackers et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref>, when the true Gold Standard is known, the inferred networks structure is compared to the first one using several metrics:  • True positive rate (TPR), sensitivity or recall is the number of TP di- vided by the actual number of positives: TP/(TP + FN).</p><p>• True negative rate (TNR) or specificity is the number of true negatives (TNs) divided by the actual number of negatives: TN/(TN + FP).</p><p>• False positive rate (FPR) also deemed as 1 -specificity is the number of FP divided by the number of actual negatives: FP/(FP + TN).</p><p>• False negative rate (FNR) or miss is FN divided by the number of actual negatives: FN/(FN + TP).</p><p>• Precision is the number of TP divided by the number of predicted positives: TP/(TP + FP).</p><p>• Rate of positive predictions (RPP) is the number of predicted positives divided by the total number of negatives and positives: (FP + TP)/ (N + P).</p><p>• F-score is a measure of model's accuracy, and it is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">= × × + F 2</formula></div>

For network comparison, ROC curves are integrated single real number by measuring the area under the ROC curve (AUROC). AUROC directly compares the inference quality against a random prediction.

As an example, input data may vary between them (time series, large microarray or subset of gene expression levels datasets among others), thus impeding a standardized comparison methodology.</p><p>However, important contributions have been made in the literature in order to provide a reliable comparison between different inference methods. For example, in Bellot et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref>, a good part of the above GRN inference methods are compared. In this work the authors present a software (a Bioconductor package called netbenchmark) that is able to carry out comparative between different inference methods. Despite this, they found that no single method is the best across different sources of data as mentioned above.</p><p>Also in Chen and Mar <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref>, a comparison between several GRN inference methods is performed demonstrating these methods, which were originally designed for bulk samples, do not suit biological relating when dealing with single cell expression data. Finally in Marbach et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref>, the performance of different inference approaches was also analysed, revealing differences between model architectures depending on the case.</p><p>There are also worth to mention the DREAM (Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods) challenges 3-5. In Marbach et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[131]</ref>, the authors present a method for the realistic performance assessment of GRN inference methods. Also in Prill et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[127]</ref>, an evaluation of GRN inference methods performance is carried out highlighting best strategies. Another interesting result is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[132]</ref> where the authors present a method and tool for generating in silico benchmark and performance profiling of GRN inference methods called GeneNetWeaver. Finally in Marbach et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref>, it is shown that single GRN inference methods perform sub-optimally across multiple data sets, when compared to the integration multiple GRN inference methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Synthetic data validation</head><p>Some techniques consider the generation of synthetic data, also used to analyse GRN inference algorithm performance like the afore mentioned GeneNetWeaver. Gene expression values are simulated and then used as input for the GRN inference algorithm. The performance of the algorithm is tested by comparing the output network with the actual network inferred from the literature. However, this approach has some drawbacks since it cannot be used to assess biological significance, which requires making use of actual prior knowledge. Novel multimodel approaches integrate experiments based on both real-life biological and synthetic data sets which provide a higher precision for the inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. Some examples of these tools are RegNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133]</ref> or SynTReN <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref> are used for this aim.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Biological data validation</head><p>Model predictions are subjected to external information that was not used in the modelling process, which can be found in the literature and databases. External validation often employs text-mining approaches and it is used to compare different network inference methods. Some tools like GeneNetVal <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref>, GNC <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136]</ref>, GFD-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[137]</ref> or RefNet Builder <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[138]</ref> use the biological information stored in databases like KEGG Biogrid or GO to assess the model goodness through a direct comparison between the computed network with a gold-standard.</p><p>However, GRN predictive capability, can be influenced by experimentally-found interactions that are retrieved <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>. Frequently, several interactions would not have been described yet. Thus, experimental approaches for verification should be taken into account, since these have some limitations and scientists need to design a method for a particular interaction to be verified <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>As discussed throughout this manuscript, GRN inference basing on large-scale data is a major challenge for systems biology which has gained relevance over the recent past years. More complete biological insight will be gained in the upcoming years, when new techniques are developed for the integration of complex omics such as the epigenome or microbiome, which are trends of current research.</p><p>There is a huge variety of approaches, inference methods and evaluation metrics for reliable GRN reconstruction. Even if modelling architectures rely on different mathematical formalisms, they all provide similar networks which require some simplifications. Notably, usefulness of GRN reconstruction depends on both its application and the available data. GRN inference methods have their own advantages and disadvantages depending on the available data and the purpose of the inference. Many efforts have been made for their comparison by using these algorithms to infer a GRN from a single data set and then assessing their validity. These comparisons require appropriate evaluation methods to satisfactorily determine algorithm performance.</p><p>The curse of dimensionality still makes suffer inference methods dealing with large data sets, thus novel and more efficient algorithms that are highly-scalable are still required. Dimensionality problems usually come with the integration of large prior biological knowledge, and model parameters such as sparseness do little to solve these problems. Together with sparseness, feature selection is important for the inference of GRN from large data sets. These parameters limit the number of regulators per gene and penalize model complexity.</p><p>Also, the integration of omics data from single cells is still challenging, so there is a need for standardized methods. Besides this, the integration of multiple-source biological knowledge makes easier data insufficiency problems, and it is a major focus in GRN research.</p><p>To sum up, GRN models are certainly a powerful tool for the understanding of biological systems, and their improve is ligated to the advances in biotechnology and bioinformatics, which will enable the characterization of complex relations between biological entities.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
