<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>One of the main building blocks and major challenges for 5G cellular systems is the design of flexible network architectures which can be realized by the software defined networking paradigm. Existing commercial cellular systems rely on closed and inflexible hardware-based architectures both at the radio frontend and in the core network. These problems significantly delay the adoption and deployment of new standards, impose significant challenges in implementing and innovation of new techniques to maximize the network capacity and accordingly the coverage, and prevent provisioning of truly-differentiated services which are able to adapt to growing and uneven and highly variable traffic patterns. In this paper, a new softwaredefined architecture, called SoftAir, for next generation (5G) wireless systems, is introduced. Specifically, the novel ideas of network function cloudification and network virtualization are exploited to provide a scalable, flexible and resilient network architecture. Moreover, the essential enabling technologies to support and manage the proposed architecture are discussed in details, including fine-grained base station decomposition, seamless incorporation of Openflow, mobility-aware control traffic balancing, resource-efficient network virtualization, and distributed and collaborative traffic classification. Furthermore, the major benefits of SoftAir architecture with its enabling technologies are showcased by introducing software-defined traffic engineering solutions. The challenging issues for realizing SoftAir are also discussed in details.</p></div>

In particular, for 5G cellular system requirements, the ultra high capacity should have 1000-fold capacity/km 2 compared to LTE, the user-plane latency should be less than 1 ms over the radio access network, and the ultra high data rates should provide 100-fold increase in userexperienced throughput (targeting 1 Gbps experienced user throughput everywhere). The challenges faced by the current network architectures cannot be solved without a radical paradigm shift in the design of next-generation wireless networks.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTICLE IN PRESS</head><p>JID: COMPNW [m3Gdc; <ref type="bibr">May 22, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">16:16]</ref> present solutions and challenges for related research in this domain.</p><p>SDN has been recently introduced primarily for data center networks and for the next-generation Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">25]</ref>. The main ideas are (i) to separate the data plane from the control plane, and (ii) to introduce novel network control functionalities based on an abstract representation of the network. In current instantiations of this idea, these are realized by (i) removing control decisions from the hardware, e.g., switches, (ii) enabling the hardware to be programmable through an open and standardized interface, e.g., Openflow <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[37]</ref>, and (iii) using a network controller to define the behavior and operation of the network forwarding infrastructure. SDN makes it easier to introduce and deploy new applications and services than the classical hardware-dependent standards. So far, the majority of SDN developments has concentrated on wired networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[6]</ref>. In this paper, we propose the utilization of SDNs for next generation (5G) wireless networks and present a new architecture for wireless SDNs, called SoftAir, and the solutions and challenges for related research in this domain.</p><p>In our proposed SoftAir architecture, the control plane consists of network management and optimization tools and is implemented on the network servers. The data plane consists of software-defined base stations (SD-BSs) in the radio access network (RAN) and software-defined switches (SDswitches) in the cellular core network. Their control logic, e.g., physical/MAC/network functions, are implemented in software on general purpose computers and remote data centers.</p><p>Our proposed SoftAir architecture offers five core properties: (i) programmability, i.e., SDN nodes (e.g., SD-BSs and SD-switches) can be reprogrammed on-the-fly by dynamically associating with different network resources and networking algorithms; (ii) cooperativeness, i.e., SDN nodes can be implemented and aggregated at data centers for joint control and optimization to enhance the global network performance; (iii) virtualizability, i.e., multiple virtual wireless networks can be created on a single SoftAir, each of which operates under its own independent network protocols with network resources allocated based on demand; (iv) openness, i.e., data plane elements (i.e., BSs and switches), regardless of the underlying forwarding technologies and vendors, have unified data/control interfaces, e.g., CPRI and OpenFlow <ref type="bibr">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">38]</ref>, thus significantly simplifying the data plane monitoring and management; and (v) visibility, i.e., centralized controllers have a global view of the network status collected from BSs and switches.</p><p>The above five properties provide functionalities that are essential to enable 5G wireless communication networks to possess the following promising features:</p><p>• Evolvability and adaptiveness: Because of the inherent separation between data plane and control plane, in SoftAir, both hardware forwarding infrastructure and software networking algorithms can easily, continuously and independently be upgraded quickly, which allows to timely adopt emerging radio technologies (e.g., millimeter wave (mm Wave), full-duplex, massive MIMO, and TeraHertz <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">29]</ref>) in the hardware infrastructure, while deploying novel traffic engineering, network management, and network optimization solutions at controllers. Moreover, the programmable data plane allows controllers to dynami-84 cally allocate network resources and adopt new network-85 ing solutions, according to the highly variable traffic pat-86 terns, unexpected network failures, and diverse quality of 87 service (QoS) requirements of traffic flows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>88</head><p>• Infrastructure-as-a-service: Emerging network services, 89 such as machine-to-machine communications, smart grid 90 applications, mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), 91 and over-the-top content services (e.g., Netflix video 92 streaming), require highly differentiated networking ca-93 pabilities to be integrated and deployed over the same 94 network infrastructure. The network virtualizability of 95 SoftAir allows the wireless hardware infrastructure to be 96 offered as a service rather than as a physical asset. Specif-97 ically, in SoftAir, the service providers are provided with 98 the ability to control, optimize, and customize the under-99 lying infrastructure without owning it and without in-100 terfering with the operations and performance of other 101 service providers, thus leading to more cost-efficient op-102 erations and enhanced QoS. Moreover, thanks to the 103 programmable data plane, the network resources, e.g., 104 spectrum, can be dynamically shared among the service 105 providers, e.g., MVNOs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>106</head><p>• Maximal spectral efficiency: In SoftAir, SD-BSs (e.g., both 107 macro and small-cell base stations) can be implemented 108 and aggregated at a server or a data center. There, they 109 can easily share control information, mobile data and 110 channel state information (CSI) associated with different 111 active users in the system. Therefore, with SoftAir, it is 112 much easier to implement algorithms to mitigate or ex-113 ploit inter-cell interference towards universal frequency 114 reuse, i.e., achieving frequency reuse factor 1 in the entire 115 network.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work</head><p>In literature, the software-defined architectures are well-studied in wired networks. For example, in data center networks and campus Local Area Networks (LANs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">37,</ref><ref type="bibr">54</ref> Recently, few SDN architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr">14,</ref><ref type="bibr">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">48,</ref><ref type="bibr">53]</ref> are exploited in wireless networks. <ref type="bibr">OpenRoads [53]</ref> is mainly targeted at WiFi networks with little support for cellular networks. OpenRadio <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[9]</ref> proposes a novel programmable wireless data plane that provides modular programming capability for the entire wireless stack. However, OpenRadio does not provide any network controller that take advantage of such programmable data plane.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ADRENALINE [14] provides an industrial solution of SD-CN</head><p>for 5G cellular systems with optical OFDM. However, these architectures neither consider the scalability issue of SD-CN nor the incorporation of CN with RAN. On the other hand, SoftRAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[22]</ref> attempts to restructure the control plane of RAN in a software-defined manner. An emerging distributed RANs, called Cloud-RAN [18], proposes SD-RAN architecture that connects SD-RANs to virtual BS pool through fibers and provides centralized control solution upon the BS pool. However, its coarse-grained BS decoupling limits the scalability and evolvability of such distributed RANs due to the excessive (and redundant) I-Q transmissions. DOCOMO <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[42]</ref> and SK Telecom <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[48]</ref> also provide their own industrial SD-RAN solution for 5G systems, respectively. Similar to Cloud-RAN, these solutions adopt coarse-grained decoupling and thus, bring bottlenecks to fronthaul fiber networks. Different from our proposed SoftAir architecture, all of the above architectures lack a coherent framework that integrates cellular core network and radio access network in a software-defined manner. What is more important, these solutions lack underlying concrete algorithms that leverage the promising properties of software-defined wireless network architecture. In addition, network virtualization, serving as a key building block to enable the sharing of (mobile) carrier networks for enhanced spatio-temporal spectrum utilization <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>, is omitted by all existing software-defined architectures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">SoftAir architecture design</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>203</head><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>, the architecture of SoftAir consists 204 of a data plane and a control plane. The data plane is an 205 open, programmable, and virtualizable network forwarding 206 infrastructure, which consists of software-defined radio ac-207 cess network (SD-RAN) and software-defined core network 208 (SD-CN). The SD-RAN consists of a set of SD-BSs, while the 209 SD-CN is composed of a collection of SD-switches. The con-210 trol plane mainly consists of two components: (1) network 211 management tools, and (2) customized applications of ser-212 vice providers or virtual network operators. In the following, 213 we present the scalable SoftAir architecture in detail, explain 214 the network virtualization, and introduce three essential 215 management tools, namely mobility-aware control traffic 216 balancing, resource-efficient network virtualization, and 217 distributed and collaborative traffic classifier. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>233</head><p>(1) Scalable SD-CN design: To provide the cellular core 234 network with high flexibility, our proposed SoftAir adopts 235 SD-switches to form the SD-CNs as shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>. 236 By SD-CNs, the customized SDN applications, e.g., mobility 237 management, QoS routing, and billing policies; as well 238 as global management tools, e.g., traffic classification and 239 network virtualization, can be designed, deployed and up-240 dated on the network controller to fit the specific and ever-241 changing needs. The practicality of SD-CN can be envisioned 242 because of the successful field deployment of SDNs, e.g., B4 243 from Google <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[25]</ref>, SWAN from Microsoft <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[23]</ref>, and ADMCF 244 from Huawei <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. The recent deployments of software-245 defined WANs, e.g., B4 from Google <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[25]</ref>, has successfully 246 demonstrated the promising performance of SDNs by boost-247 ing the average link utilization from 30-40% to over 70%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>248</head><p>The scalability of SD-CN can be greatly improved by lever-249 aging high-performance controllers and optimized network 250 management schemes. For example, with the current SDN 251 technology, one single controller can achieve 12 million re-252 quests per second processing speed for the control messages 253 between the switches and the controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[6]</ref>. Such high pro-254 cessing capacity has been further enhanced by the adop-255 tion of controller clusters and advances in multi-threading 256 technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[6]</ref>. More importantly, our recent research on 257 the scalability of SDNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[32]</ref> has shown that even in large-258 scale SDNs with practical in-band control channels, the con-259 trol message forwarding delay between the controllers and 260</p><p>Please cite this article as: I.F. <ref type="bibr">Akyildiz</ref>    incorporating the historical mobility pattern of the mobile users. On the other hand, real-time control traffic forwarding rules, empowered by the fast-converging optimization solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[32]</ref>, will be enforced to address the dramatic and unexpected control traffic changes in both SD-CN and SD-RAN.</p><p>(2) Scalable SD-RAN design: to further enhance the network flexibility, we simultaneously realize the physical-, MAC-, and network-layer function cloudification for RAN, thus forming the SD-RAN. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>, the proposed SD-RAN follows a distributed RAN architecture. Here, each SD-BS is split into hardware-only radio head(s) and software-implemented baseband units -these two components are not necessarily co-located. In particular Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) are connected to the baseband units on baseband servers (BBS) through fronthaul network (fiber or microwave) using standardized interfaces, such as CPRI Please cite this article as: I.F. <ref type="bibr">Akyildiz</ref>   partial baseband processing at the RRH (e.g., modem), while implementing the remaining baseband functions, e.g., MIMO coding, source coding, and MAC, at the BBS, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>. Such function splitting is convenient because CPRI, which is not only defined for I-Q sample transport, can still be adopted without designing new interfaces and can lead to considerably reduced data rate requirements between BBS and RRHs. In addition, our decomposition still preserves sufficient flexibility offered by the distributed RAN architecture. More specifically, by this new decomposition method, the data rate requirement R I of transporting the information bits conveyed by a waveform can be flexibly adjusted by moving the partial baseband functionalities to the BBS. In summary, with reduced data rate requirements, our SD-RAN offers excellent scalability, cooperative gain, and evolvability to nextgeneration wireless networks by allowing the aggregation of a large number of technology-evolving RRHs at BBS through the diverse, cost-efficient, CPRI-supported fronthaul network topologies, and over different fronthaul mediums.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">dio head (R IQ (B, A, D m ) = 2 × W × r × Q r × D m × A.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Seamless incorporation of OpenFlow:</head><p>Different from the existing distributed RAN [18], our proposed SD-RAN, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>, incorporates OpenFlow into the softwaredefined Base Station (SD-BS). In our SD-RAN design, we implement an OpenFlow interface for each SD-BS by utilizing Open vSwitch (OVS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[43]</ref>, which is an OpenFlow-capable software switch that can easily be realized in BBS. With OVS, each SD-BS will be able to interpret, exchange, and respond to the OpenFlow protocol messages. Equipping SD-BSs with OpenFlow capabilities provides a unified interface to control and manage base stations with different wireless standards, thus leading to a multi-technology converged RAN that allows smooth transitions among different radio access technologies. For example, with OpenFlow-capable SD-BSs, seamless vertical mobility can be easily achieved, which allows mobile users to transparently roam among BSs with different wireless standards, without experiencing disruptions in network services. This can be done by simply re-routing the traffic flows through the core network over the best paths to different BSs via the technology-independent OpenFlow interface enabled on both core network switches and BSs. Moreover, adopting the common OpenFlow interface on both SD-switches and SD-BSs promises the transparent interconnections between SD-CNs and SD-RANs and allows the unified management of the entire SoftAir.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Network virtualization capability</head><p>The network virtualization enables multiple isolated virtual networks, e.g., M2M, smar grid, over-the-top service provider, cellular provider, to share the same physical network infrastructure, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. That means it focuses on slicing network resources for multiple virtual networks so that they can simultaneously share the same physical network architecture. More specifically, each virtual network can adopt its customized PHY/MAC/NET layer protocols, without interrupting the operations and performance of other virtual networks. These virtual networks can also be deployed on demand and dynamically allocated. Our proposed SoftAir with network virtualization capability enables a wide range of emerging applications, e.g. <ref type="bibr">(</ref>  To realize these isolated virtual networks, SoftAir implements three functions as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>: network hypervisor for high-level virtualization as well as wireless hypervisor and switch hypervisor for low-level virtualization.</p><p>• The network hypervisor is a high-level resource management framework, which adaptively allocates nonconflicting multi-dimensional network resources to service providers or virtual network operators.</p><p>• The wireless hypervisor is a low-level resource scheduler that enforces or executes the resource management polices determined by network hybervisor by employing a variety of wireless resource dimensioning schemes, e.g., OFDMA or wireless scheduling, so that isolation among virtual networks are guaranteed.</p><p>• The switch hypervisor focuses on bandwidth management in a single SD-switch. In particular, bandwidth provisioning on switches offers bandwidth assurance for the designated virtual network.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">SoftAir management tools</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>447</head><p>Cloud orchestration aims to automate the configuration, 448 coordination and management of software and software in-449 teractions in the cloud environment. To support cloud or-450 chestration in SoftAir, to enable the promising features and 451 to maximize the overall performance of SoftAir, as shown in 452 Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>, three essential and general management tools need be 453 developed: (1) mobility-aware control traffic balancing, (2) 454 resource-efficient network virtualization, and (3) distributed 455 and collaborative traffic classifier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>456</head><p>• Mobility-aware control traffic balancing: To promise 457 on-line and adaptive traffic engineering in SoftAir, the 458 control messages should be forwarded from SD-switches 459 or SD-BSs to the controller(s) in a fast and robust manner. 460 While out-band control channel is cost-prohibitive, the 461 usage of in-band control channel imposes a great chal-462 lenge into timely and reliable transmissions of control 463 traffic. Moreover, due to mobile users, the unique mobile 464 traffic features in SD-RANs should be examinedfor con-465 trol traffic balancing. More specifically, considering users' 466 mobility, a nonlinear optimization framework is proposed 467 with an objective to find the optimal control traffic for-468 warding paths for each SD-switch and SD-BS to the con-469 troller in such a way the average control traffic delay in 470 the whole network is minimized.  from switches or BSs to the controller, control traffic balancing faces several challenges including: (i) the need of fast balancing algorithm that provides the required system QoS as well as guarantees link capacity in a timely manner; (ii) the decision of optimal controller locations that should be driven by the proposed balancing algorithm; and (iii) the unique mobile features from SD-RAN should be reflected into the balancing design for accurate traffic modeling and better system performance.</p><p>To address these challenges, inspired by our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[32]</ref>, SoftAir provides a novel mobility-aware control traffic balancing that decides the optimal controller locations and optimal forwarding paths of control flows with respect to the mobile traffic. First, through the unique features of Soft-Air, users' mobility pattern as well as the corresponding traffic model are well characterized by the derivation of mobile traffic distribution. Moreover, while the placement of large numbers of controllers is a NP hard problem, the feasible placement set can be illustrated via the development of approximation algorithms. Next, regarding the modeled traffic distribution and a feasible solution of controller placement, a nonlinear optimization framework for control traffic balancing is formulated to find the optimal forwarding paths from SD-switch and SD-BS to the controller in such a way the average control traffic delay in the whole network is minimized. Following the proposed framework, several well-known fast algorithms, e.g. ADMM <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[11]</ref>, might be exploited to provide the optimal solution within few milliseconds. Finally, the obtained delay results are further feedback to the placement decision, and trigger the adaptive control for better controller placement with the fulfillment of timely control message delivery in SoftAir.</p><p>(1) Research challenges:</p><p>• Mobile feature extraction of SD-RAN: to provide mobilityaware design, users' movement should be characterized by suitable mobility models such as random walk, random waypoint, etc.. Moreover, users' transmission behaviors from their applications should also be identified , e.g., Poisson or Pareto traffic arrival. Based on these info, the mobile traffic distribution can be well established to capture the unique mobile feature of traffic in SD-RAN. The derived traffic distribution thus serves as an accurate mobile traffic model and will be used in the control traffic balancing design.</p><p>• Optimal placement of controller clusters: multicontrollers placement problem will decide the minimum required number of controllers, the controllers' locations, and control domain assignments between SD-switch (SD-BS) and controllers. In addition to the planar placement of multiple controllers, more complicated placement problem can be considered including controller clustering and multi-threading technologies. In particular, several controllers can form a cluster and several clusters can follow the hierarchical management structure. Moreover, multi-threading methods can be further adopted to enhance the task managements among many controllers, realizing a centralized control plane. To realize these isolated virtual networks, two functions are proposed as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>: the network hypervisor for highlevel virtualization, and the wireless hypervisor and switch hypervisor for low-level virtualization.</p><p>(1) Network hypervisor: It focuses on high-level resource management as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>, which determines how to distribute non-conflicting network resource blocks among virtual network operators based on their demands. A utilization-optimal network hypervisor is proposed to maximize the global resource utilization, while guaranteeing the data rate requirements demanded by each virtual operators. In SoftAir, network resources include (1) wireless spectrum resources consisting of time slots and frequency channels, (2) wireless infrastructure resources, including SD-BSs and maximum power of each SD-BS, and (3) radio access technology options. Given a set of virtual operators, the data rate required by a virtual network can be formulated, which means that within the coverage area of each SD-BS, the virtual network needs to offer a certain average data rate for its users with certain spatial distribution and density. Then, at each SD-BS, we can assign the wireless resource blocks (RBs) to the virtual network. In particularly, for each channel, there is a corresponding weight parameter, which defines the percentage of time the virtual operator can exclusively use the channel. Moreover, we can further allocate the power and radio access technology at the SD-BS for the virtual network. With the allocated resource blocks, power, and radio access technology, the average data rate that this SD-BS can offer to the virtual network is thus obtained, where users follow certain spatial distribution. This average data rate relates to the effective SINR at an arbitrary user of the SD-BS and the distance vectors from each user to each RRH within the considered SD-BS.</p><p>(2) Wireless hypervisor: It is a low-level resource scheduler as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> that enforces or executes the resource management policies determined by the network hypervisor by employing a variety of wireless resource dimensioning schemes, e.g., OFDMA or wireless scheduling, so that 100% isolation among virtual networks is guaranteed. As a consequence, each virtual network can implement and adopt its own and customized NET/MAC/PHY layer protocols. Besides providing 100% isolation between the virtual networks, the wireless hypervisor has to ensure efficient utilization of the limited spectrum resources, which exhibit inherent channel (3) Switch hypervisor: Enabled by OpenFlow protocol, switch hypervisor (or switch fabric) focuses on bandwidth partitioning in a single SD-switch. In particular, bandwidth provisioning on switches aims to offer predefined bandwidth for any specific traffic flow or virtual network. An well-known OpenFlow(-based) virtualization, called FlowVisor, is an layer responsible for the isolation among slices of the virtualized infrastructure and employs leaky-bucket scheme for bandwidth provisioning, which however, is not a work-conserving policy and thus can not guarantee full bandwidth utilization. To solve this issue, the recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[26]</ref> exploits GPS models upon Combined Input Cross-point Queued (CICQ) switches, which ensures full bandwidth utilization while providing accurate bandwidth provision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Wireless / Switch Hypervisor</head><p>(4) Research challenges:</p><p>• Utilization-optimal network hypervisor: To facilitate network hypervisor, the distance vectors that depend on the user spatial distribution of the virtual network are first investigated based on the random graph theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[40]</ref>. The utilization-optimal network hypervisor then aims at finding the optimal resource allocation for each virtual network, in terms of resource blocks, power levels, and radio access technologies so that the data rate requested by each virtual network at every SD-BS is guaranteed, and the total data rate of all the virtual networks is maximized. This problem is a nonseparable non-quadratic problem, which is NP hard. Also, a huge parameter set brings a multidimensional data decision problem. To encounter these difficulties, three algorithms can be implemented, including dimensional reduction via kernel principal component analysis (PCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[46]</ref>, convex opti-683 mization for big data <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[15]</ref>, and randomized matrix algo-684 rithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[36]</ref>, which have been known to be effective for big 685 data processing. Moreover, the performance and the com-686 plexity of the above three algorithms will be compared to 687 obtain the optimal solving strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>688</head><p>• Throughput-efficient and flow-based wireless hypervisor: To 689 enable flow-based wireless hypervisor, the generalized 690 processor sharing solution (GPS) can be applied so that 691 each virtual network or network flow has the exclusive 692 usage of wireless resources (e.g., channels) for a certain 693 percentage of time. Since the conventional GPS enables 694 each virtual network or flow to exclusively own the net-695 work resources with the assigned time duration, it allows 696 each network virtual operator to apply the customized 697 MAC and Physical layer algorithms (e.g., the one proposed 698 in section V-B) independent of other virtual network op-699 erators. However, the conventional GPS does not provide 700 throughput efficiency in reallocating unused network re-701 sources (e.g., channels) when some virtual networks are 702 temporally idle i.e., having all flow queues empty. This 703 is because the weight calculation of conventional GPS is 704 insensitive to the channel and queue-length conditions. 705 Inspired by the throughput-optimal property of maxi-706 mum weight scheduling, the queue-length based GPS 707 (Q-GPS) can be developed, which assigns weights pro-708 portional to the product of queue length and channel 709 rate. Towards this, the theoretical performance bounds of 710 Q-GPS in terms of fairness and throughput enhancements 711 need to be investigated. The third enabling tool that will be developed is a dis-714 tributed traffic classifier (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>) . Traffic classification is the To address these challenges, SoftAir adopts a distributed and collaborative traffic classification system <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[24]</ref>, which will leverage the unique features of SoftAir to achieve fast, finegrained and accurate traffic QoS classification i.e., inferring which QoS class a traffic flow belongs to. Our proposed system will take advantages of the centralized and computationally powerful network controller to jointly exploit the advantages of deep package inspection (DPI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[39]</ref> and semi-supervised machine learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[34]</ref>. and Youtube. Then, based on a set of historical traffic traces, 780 e.g., training data, the global traffic learner will apply highly 781 accurate but time-consuming DPI or stochastic packet in-782 spection (SPI) to label or detect a portion of the traffic flows 783 that are generated from the reference applications in each 784 QoS class. As a consequence, each QoS class will be naturally 785 associated with a set of features (feature vector) that are re-786 lated to the labeled flows. For example, one feature of the 787 streaming video QoS class will be Hurst parameter, which is 788 a stochastic feature of the labeled or detected Netflix flows 789 and used to characterize the long-range dependent nature 790 of variable-bit-rate video traffic <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[21]</ref>. Next, semi-supervised 791 machine learning will be applied, which utilizes the feature 792 vector to group the statistically similar unlabeled and labeled 793 flows into the same cluster, i.e., the same reference applica-794 tion. In this way, the mapping function between the feature 795 vectors and the corresponding QoS classes will be trained, re-796 fined, and established through a large and adjustable volume 797 of real-time traffic traces collected at the network controller. 798</p><p>(3) Research challenges:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>799</head><p>• Complexity reduction of the mapping function: To further 800 reduce the complexity of the mapping function, it is nec-801 essary to apply and study the dimensionality reduction 802 approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[16]</ref>, which is the technique of combining non-803 linearly the features in order to represent the feature vec-804 tor in a lower-dimensional space.

Therefore, it is of great importance to 813 choose a suitable set of features, which can characterize 814 the most dominant behaviors of the traffic flows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>815</head><p>• Adaptive feature vector training: Obtaining the accurate 816 statistical features of the traffic flows can help to increase 817 the classification accuracy.

There-820 fore, the optimal tradeoff between classification accuracy 821 and control overheads has to be investigated. Accordingly, 822 the adaptive feature vector training need be developed to 823 cope with current network congestion conditions, while 824 satisfying the desired classification accuracy. In this section, we propose new traffic engineering 827 solutions designed to leverage the full potential of the 828 SoftAir architecture. Specifically, BS clustering, collaborative 829 scheduling and rerouting solutions proposed in this section 830 are directly supported by the enabling tools discussed in 831 Section 3. In particular, the distributed traffic classification 832 solutions in Section 3.  The throughput-optimal collaborative scheduling algorithm to be proposed in this section can achieve its theoretical performance limits, since the largest possible network capacity region is provided by dynamic SD-BS formation. Last but not the least, the network virtualization algorithms in Section 3.2 enable hybrid routing algorithms, e.g., QoS-guaranteed handover rerouting, that can simultaneously offer the best QoS performance for fundamentally different traffic flows.</p></div>

Network MU-MIMO is realized by BS coordination or clustering, where the transmitting antennas of a cluster of BSs cooperatively act as a single antenna array. Despite its great potential, the realization of network MU-MIMO in current wireless network architectures is facing fundamental challenges because of limitations in finegrained synchronization among BSs, low-cost and low-delay chan-nel/user information sharing, and the ''cluster edge" effect, where the users at the edge of a cluster suffer from severe out-of-cluster interference.</p><p>In SoftAir, our novel SD-RAN design in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>  RANs, e.g., Cloud-RAN, our SD-RAN employs an innovative fine-grained BS decomposition, which significantly reduces 876 the bandwidth burden on the fronthaul networks, thus en-877 abling highly scalable and flexible cooperation among a large 878 number of RRHs. In summary, our proposed SoftAir archi-879 tecture can allow next-generation wireless networks to ap-880 proach the economic and theoretically-optimal linear scal-881 ing of network capacity by aggressively deploying a large 882 number of low-cost RRHs and facilitating diverse cooperation 883 modes among them. Ideally, by forming a single giant SD-BS 884 that incorporates all RRHs for full cooperation, the inter-cell 885 interference in SoftAir can be mitigated, enabling an optimal 886 and universal frequency reuse factor of one. However, real-887 izing such a fully cooperative system needs to face the real-888 istic network conditions. An immediate new problem arises 889 in SoftAir: how much cooperation gain can be achieved by 890 dynamically forming the SD-BSs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>891</head><p>Dynamic software-defined base station formation: We 892 introduce a generic clustering optimization framework for 893 dynamic SD-BS formation with the objective to maximize the 894 spectral efficiency, while considering the specific coopera-895 tion costs in SoftAir and extend this for high density RRH de-896 ployments. More specifically, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">8</ref>, the proposed 897 framework aims at finding optimal associations between SD-898 BSs and RHHs, according to the dynamic user distribution in 899 such a way that the network capacity is maximized by jointly 900 mitigating the impact of the fronthaul delay, the inter SD-BS 901 interference, and the channel estimation cost. To formulate 902 the dynamic SD-BS formation problem, we consider a cel-903 lular network with a set of RRHs. Here, the objective is to 904 maximize the overall capacity by forming several clusters or 905 SD-BSs, while considering the cooperation cost induced by 906 the fronthaul network. In particular, given the distances be-907 tween SD-BSs and RHHs, the fronthaul delays can be easily 908 obtained as the distances divide the speed of light.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> Then, 909 the cluster-specific maximum fronthaul delay is given as the 910 To further examine practical aspects of SD-BS formation, we consider explicit channel estimation followed by coherent detection of payload data. Specifically, pilot-assisted channel estimation is exploited as follows. For a specific cluster, the share of symbols reserved for pilots for users and for payload data consist the entire transmissions. The pilot transmissions should be orthogonally multiplexed from each of the transmissions. Thus, each receiver's estimation of the channel coefficients corresponding to in-cluster RRH transmitters shares the pilot symbols. Moreover, the fading channel coefficients now consist two uncorrelated terms: the channel estimations and the corresponding estimation errors. Therefore, we can formulate the minimum mean square error and rewrite the observation for each user. The mobile users customarily utilize the channel estimates as if they were correct, in which case the estimation errors play the role of additional Gaussian noise. Accordingly, the effective SINR at the user upon payload data detection is then given, and the average spectral efficiency (bits/Hz/user) of the cluster is derived, which depends on the type of cooperation among the users in the cluster.</p><p>(</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Network massive MU-MIMO (Cooperation mode):</head><p>The SD-BS clustering problem can be formulated as a capacity maximization problem based on the entire average spectral efficiency from the given clustering assignment constrained 962 such that each RRH is covered by one cluster set. Through 963 the proposed Dynamic Software-Defined Base Station For-964 mation, multiuser multiplexing gains of network MU-MIMO 965 can be leveraged to improve global spectral efficiency and 966 network capacity; by optimally managing the inter-cluster 967 interference, the fronthaul network delay, and cluster edge 968 effects. First, a fast algorithm will be investigated to solve the 969 proposed BS formation problem through Fully Polynomial 970 Time Approximation Schemes (FPTAS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[28]</ref> or ADMM <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[11]</ref>. 971 Such a fast algorithm is of significant importance to ensure 972 the adaptability of the SD-BS formation to the dynamic user 973 distribution. Then, the superior spectrum efficiency will be 974 demonstrated of SoftAir by advancing the concept of network 975 MU-MIMO to network massive MIMO as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">9</ref>, 976 which aims at enhancing the network capacity by forming 977 virtual directional antenna via the very large antenna array 978 offered by the network MIMO. In particular, through the co-979 operation among RRHs via the BBS, the pilot contamination 980 in massive MIMO can be completely eliminated. This means 981 in the asymptotic regime, the interference free systems can 982 be realized from some simple pre-coding schemes as the 983 number of cooperated RRHs (i.e., the size of antenna array) 984 goes to infinity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>985</head><p>(2) Millimeter wave usage (Coordination mode): Comparing 986 to rough 600 MHz available spectrum in conventional mi-987 crowave cellular systems, millimeter wave (mmWave) pro-988 vides enormous amounts of spectrum at frequencies rang-989 ing from 3 to 300 GHz. Such a plentiful resource in mmWave 990 leads many researches with diverse backgrounds, from hard-991 ware component to system processing algorithm designs, to 992 study mmWave transmissions in different aspects. The ma-993 jor difference between mmWave and microwave frequencies, 994 also being the most challenging problem, is the sensitively to 995 blockages. In particular, the path loss exponent for non-line-996 of-sight propagation is double than the one for line-of-sight 997 case, making the channel modeling very complicated. This 998 challenge becomes even more pronounced when the chan-999 nel changes rapidly due to mobility and high Doppler shifts at 1000 mmWave frequencies. To deal with the mentioned difficulty, 1001 in SoftAir architecture, SD-BSs provide an effective solution 1002 through the operations with RRHs as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref>. That 1003 is, SD-BSs simply enable the adaptive antenna arrays for net 1004 array gain and interference mitigation via the coordinations 1005 of RRHs' orientations and functionalities. It thus supports the 1006 ubiquitously good channel qualities in the entire geographic 1007 area. Toward this, two essential functionalities should be in-1008 volved to realize this ubiquitous coverage as: (1) the adap-1009 tive hosting scheme among SD-BSs (i.e., the changing of the 1010 supporting RRHs) and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref> tion among SD-BSs (and RRHs) should also be determined at the same time. These considerations bring out the coordination problem of virtual directional antennas. In particular, the dynamic SD-BS formation solutions with hybrid network MIMO modes should be supported, which optimally configure the cooperation strategies of RRHs to maximize the joint gain of performing the multiuser multiplexing at the center of the RRH cluster and the beamforming at the edge of the RRH cluster.</p><p>• Ubiquitous millimeter wave covering: To enable the ubiquitous covering whenever the user with mmWave transmissions moves, the entire optimal planning of transmission techniques can be formulated. Specifically, while there are two options, i.e., adaptive SD-BSs and coordination transmissions, for each user in any specific location, the optimization objective can be set as the minimum signaling overheads. And it should subject to the required data rates, which will be the function of SD-BSs' set, RRHs' operations, and the available combinations of joint microwave and mmWave transmissions. As this planning problem might be NP-complete (NPC), the randomized approximation algorithm can be applied to obtain a workable solution within few rounds, i.e., very less time for the calculations. Then, based on this solution as the staring point, several fast optimal searching algorithms can be further applied to approach the suboptimal solution for the original complicated problem.</p></div>

Consequently, the SD-BS has a set L of antennas, where The solution of the throughput-optimal collaborative resource provisioning problem depends on the stochastic properties of the traffic flows. Based on the burstiness level, network traffic can be classified into two categories: heavytailed (HT) flows and light-tailed (LT) flows. Specifically, a traffic flow is heavy-tailed if its traffic arrivals follow heavy-tailed distribution. Otherwise, the traffic flow is lighttailed. Specifically, a random variable X follows heavy-tail distribution if its tail distribution decreases slower than exponentially. Recent significant empirical results collected from commercially operated wireless networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">45]</ref> show that the mobile data traffic on WiFi networks and cellular networks is heavy-tailed, thus extremely bursty nature. The observed heavy-tailed behavior in mobile traffic is largely departing from the conventional light-tailed traffic assumptions in wireless network research, e.g., Poisson and Markovian traffic. However, this phenomenon is highly consistent with the current trend that the web and video traffic, which is inherently heavy tailed, is dominating wireless networks.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">|L| = M × d,</formula><p>Because of the heavy-tailed nature of mobile traffic, solving the throughput-optimal collaborative scheduling problem is very challenging.

Location 1169 management enables the system to track the locations of mo-1170 bile users between consecutive communications. Location 1171 management consists of registration and paging. Registration 1172 is performed by a mobile user to update its current location 1173 with the system when leaving a registration area, where the 1174 registration area is a group of cells within which the user is 1175 allowed to move without updating its location.

(1) Minimum-cost location management via Virtual registration areas: In SoftAir, each SD-BS is a multi technology converged platform, i.e., through the OpenFlow interface homogeneous control can be applied to the SD-BSs independently of their underlying radio access technologies. Such features can enable unified and seamless registration and paging in the heterogeneous networks, thus avoiding the need for deploying inter-networking functions that can induce high signaling costs. Moreover, by exploiting the multi-technology convergence feature of SD-BSs, we can further reduce the signaling cost and increase the paging efficiency by proposing the concept of virtual registration area (VRA), which is a group of cells with different access technologies, within which the mobile user does not need to update or register its location with the cellular BSs. The key advantage of the virtual registration area is to exploit the asymmetric features of different radio access technologies. On one hand, the frequent location registration with macro-cell cellular BSs will reduce the spectrum efficiency of the already limited cellular bands. On the other hand, updating locations with the high data rate WiFi or small-cell BSs will not evidently degrade the spectrum efficiency, while enhancing the paging accuracy by providing additional location updates of the mobile users.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_10"><head>( 1 )</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The proposed system will consist of two components: (i) the local traffic classifiers in SD-BSs at the network edge and (ii) the global traffic learner at the network controller located at the core network. The local traffic classifier will be responsible for identifying the QoS class of a traffic flow through a mapping function. The mapping function is simply a function that takes a few features of the traffic flow, e.g., the average packet interarrival time, Hurst parameter and port number, as the inputs and gives the QoS class of the traffic flow as the output. The global traffic learner at the controller is responsible for learning, building and refining the mapping function based on the historical traffic information. The proposed traffic classification system has two advantages. First, the light-weight and fast traffic classifier can be easily implemented as a mapping function and seamlessly integrated with the SD-BS, as shown in Fig. 2. Second, the accuracy and the adaptability of such low-complexity traffic classifier can be guaranteed by the network controller, which can utilize the global view of the network flows to build the accurate mapping functions through timeconsuming computationally intensive DPI and machine learning. In particular, our system employs a publish-subscribe event system (i.e. client-server model) to let the controller proactively send the updated mapping functions to the local traffic classifier. Local traffic classifier: In our design, the local traffic classifier will be implemented as a set of mini-classifiers connected in a parallel structure. Each mini-classifier is responsible for checking one feature of the traffic flow, e.g., port number [30]. The mapping function of the local classifier defines the combination pattern of the traffic classifiers. In this way, the local classifier will be dynamically refined or rebuilt by the global traffic learner at the network controller. (2) Global traffic learner: The global traffic learner will first define the QoS classes by associating the reference or training applications with each QoS class. The reference applications of the QoS class can be defined arbitrarily as needed and updated as time proceeds. For example, the reference applications in the streaming video QoS class can include some popular and representative applications, e.g., Netflix</figDesc></figure>

Dynamic SD-BS formation (cooperation mode): massive MIMO.maximum delay in a considered cluster. In order to achieve the maximum capacity, the RRHs of an SD-BS need to transmit the precoded data at the right phase to minimize symbol timing offsets at the mobile users. It means that at each time slot, this cluster delay is needed at most to synchronize the transmissions of the RRHs, which leads to a channel utilization ratio of the corresponding SD-BS as the ratio of the slot duration to the total time duration, i.e., slot duration pluses the cluster delay. Moreover, considering a set of mobile users served by this specific SD-BS, the signal-to-(outof-cluster)-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) received by a mobile user is a function of channel gain (including distance decay, shadowing, building penetration losses, and antenna patterns) from each RRH to the mobile user, the noise spectral density, and the transmitted bandwidth. Therefore the observation at the user can be formulated including three terms: the noise, the out-of-cluster interferences, and the aggregated strength from each RRH in the cluster, where fading channel coefficients are assumed mutually independent random variables with unit-variance. Note that since the Gaussian distribution correctly models thermal noise and the interference is made up of a large number of independent terms, the aggregate interference-plus-noise is approximately Gaussian with unit variance. Also the out-of-cluster interference (and thus the received signal quality) now scales not only with the power levels of out-of-cluster RRHs, but with other parameters such as cell size or noise variance.</figDesc><graphic coords="12,136.04,55.68,276.72,71.59" type="bitmap" /></figure>

More specifically, the proposed framework consists of two components: minimum-cost location management and QoS-guaranteed handoff rerouting.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_17"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>First, by grouping the cellular cells with high cellular road-traffic into the same VRA, we can decrease the inter-VRA cellular road-traffic (i.e., road traffic across the boundaries of two VRAs). This can considerably reduce registration overheads in cellular system since only inter-VRA cellular road-traffic will trigger registration signaling between cellular BSs and mobile users.Second, by grouping the cellular cells that have low WiFi road-traffic into the same VRA, we can increase the inter-VRA WiFi road-traffic, which can improve the location registration frequencies over high-bandwidth WiFi access points, thus allowing cost-efficient paging process in the future.(2) QoS-Guaranteed handoff rerouting: In SoftAir, hand-off rerouting happens when a user is moving from one SD-BS to another SD-BS. Since the SD-BS is associated a large number of RRHs covering a broad geographic area, the handoff management, including BS association and handoff rerouting, will not be triggered frequently, thus leading to considerably reduced signaling overhead. On the other hand, due to the strict QoS requirements of real-time traffic, the handoff rerouting scheme needs a more sophisticated design to incorporate delay, jitter, and bandwidth requirements. In particular, our key objectives for optimal handover re-routing of realtime traffic are to achieve per-flow QoS guarantees, seamless mobility and network-wide performance guarantees. Using the SoftAir architecture, per-flow and network-wide information at the central controller can be utilized to achieve fine-grained per-flow QoS and network-wide performance guarantees. The control and data plane separation allows us to simultaneously setup forwarding rules on all switches instead of hop-by-hop signaling to enable seamless mobility. To further guarantee seamless mobility, we propose a proactive re-routing approach where new routes are computed even before the users arrive at a location under the new serving SD-BS using mobility prediction, which tells the highest possible cell a mobile user can move to. This can be realized by exploiting our predictive user mobility profile framework<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[7]</ref>, which has been demonstrated to have superior prediction accuracy.Formally speaking, several variables are first given to the rerouting problem as the set of flows rerouting request, the set containing all links in the SoftAir, the link capacity and the occupied data rates by the existing flows, and the end-to-end delay and the average data rate. The objective of the QoSguaranteed handover rerouting problem is to find the optimal flow allocation so that the corresponding rerouting paths satisfy the QoS requirements and provide the maximum network utility at the same time. In particular, the objective utility function can be formulated as the the total residue link resources with respect to allocated resources. Moreover,</figDesc></figure>
