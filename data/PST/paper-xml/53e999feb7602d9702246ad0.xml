<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Harmony Search (HS) is one of the newest and the easiest to code music inspired heuristics for optimization problems. Like the use of chaos in adjusting note parameters such as pitch, dynamic, rhythm, duration, tempo, instrument selection, attack time, etc. in real music and in sound synthesis and timbre construction, this paper proposes new HS algorithms that use chaotic maps for parameter adaptation in order to improve the convergence characteristics and to prevent the HS to get stuck on local solutions. This has been done by using of chaotic number generators each time a random number is needed by the classical HS algorithm. Seven new chaotic HS algorithms have been proposed and different chaotic maps have been analyzed in the benchmark functions. It has been detected that coupling emergent results in different areas, like those of HS and complex dynamics, can improve the quality of results in some optimization problems. It has been also shown that, some of the proposed methods have somewhat increased the solution quality, that is in some cases they improved the global searching capability by escaping the local solutions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Classical optimization algorithms are inflexible to adapt the solution procedure to an optimization problem. Generally a given problem is modeled in such a way that a classical algorithm can handle it. This generally requires making several assumptions and/or modifications which might not be easy to validate in many situations. These modifications and/or assumptions on the original problem parameters (rounding variables, softening constraints, etc.) certainly affect the solution quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. They are insufficient if integer and/or discrete decision variables are required in optimization models <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Solution strategies of classical optimization algorithms are generally depended on the type of objective and constraint functions (linear, nonlinear, etc.) and the type of variables used in the problem modeling (integer, real, etc.). Their efficiency is also very much dependent on the size of the solution space, number of variables and constraints used in the problem modeling, and the structure of the solution space (convex, non-convex, etc.). Briefly, they do not offer general solution strategies that can be applied to problem formulations where, different type of variables, objective and constraint functions are simultaneously required by the optimization problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Inefficiency of classical optimization algorithms in solving larger scale and/or highly nonlinear problems forced researchers to find more flexible and adaptable general purpose novel algorithms. Problem and model independent heuristic optimization algorithms have been proposed by researchers to overcome the drawbacks of the classical optimization procedures. These algorithms are efficient and flexible and they can be modified and/or adapted to suit specific problem requirements. Researches on these algorithms are still continuing all around the globe. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the classifications of the heuristic algorithms.</p><p>A meta-heuristic algorithm, mimicking the improvisation process of music players, has been developed and named Harmony Search (HS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. HS has several advantages with respect to traditional optimization techniques such as the following:</p><p>(a) HS imposes fewer mathematical requirements. (b) HS is free from divergence. (c) HS does not require initial value settings of the decision variables, thus it may escape the local optima. Furthermore it may be easily adapted for multi-modal problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. (d) As the HS uses stochastic random searches, derivative information is unnecessary. HS has novel stochastic derivative <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. (e) HS can handle both discrete and continuous variables. (f) HS algorithm could overcome the drawback of genetic algorithm's building block theory by considering the relationship among decision variables using its ensemble operation. HS generates a new vector, after considering all of the existing vectors, whereas the genetic algorithm only considers the two parent vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>These features increase the flexibility of the HS algorithm and produce better solutions.</p><p>HS is good at identifying the high performance regions of the solution space at a reasonable time, but gets into trouble in performing local search for numerical applications. Researchers are still trying in order to improve the fine-tuning characteristic and convergence rate of HS algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</p><p>Nonlinear dynamic systems have been iteratively used to generate chaotic sequences of numbers that are then mapped to various note parameters (pitch, dynamic, rhythm, duration, tempo, instrument selection, attack time, etc.) in real music. Four pioneers of these methods are Jeff Pressing, Michael Gogins, Rick Bidlack, and Jeremy Leach <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Chaos has also been used in sound synthesis and timbre construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Many chaotic maps in the literature possess certainty, ergodicity, and the stochastic property. Recently, chaotic sequences have been adopted instead of random sequences and very interesting and somewhat good results have been shown in many applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. They have also been used together with some heuristic optimization algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> to express optimization variables. The choice of chaotic sequences is justified theoretically by their unpredictability, i.e., by their spread-spectrum characteristic, non periodic, complex temporal behavior, and ergodic properties.</p><p>In this paper, sequences generated from different chaotic systems substitute random numbers for different parameters of HS, musical inspired heuristic algorithm, where it is necessary to make a random-based choice. For this purpose, different HS methods that use chaotic maps as efficient alternatives to pseudorandom sequences have been proposed. By this way, it is intended to enhance the global convergence and to prevent to stick on a local solution. However, in general, it is hard to estimate how good most chaotic random number generators by applying statistical tests are, as they do not follow the uniform distribution. The simulation results show that the application of deterministic chaotic signals instead of random sequences may be a possible strategy to improve the performances of HS. The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. Review of HS is summarized in Section 2. Section 3 offers a short introduction on improvements for HS. Section 4 describes the proposed methods, Chaotic Harmony Search Algorithms, shortly CHSAs. Section 5 describes the benchmark problems used for comparisons of the proposed methods. In Section 6, the testing of the proposed methods through benchmark problems are carried out and the simulation results are compared with those obtained via other algorithms that have been reported to have good performance. Finally, the conclusion is drawn based on the comparison analysis reported and presented in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Harmony search algorithm</head><p>Harmony Search (HS) algorithm, originated by Geem et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, is based on natural musical performance processes that occur when a musician searches for a better state of harmony <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The resemblance, for example between jazz improvisation that seeks to find musically pleasing harmony and the optimization is that the optimum design process seeks to find the optimum solution as determined by the objective function. The pitch of each musical instrument determines the aesthetic quality just as the objective function is determined by the set of values assigned to each design variable. Aesthetic sound quality can be improved practice after practice just as objective function value can be improved iteration by iteration <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</p><p>The analogy between improvisation and optimization is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Each musician (double bassist, guitarist, and saxophonist) has some notes in their memories and they can correspond to each decision variable ðx 1 ; x 2 ; and x 3 Þ. The range of each music instrument (double bass = {Do, Re, Mi}; guitar = {Mi, Fa, Sol}; and saxophone = {La, Si, Do}) corresponds to each variable value (x 1 = {1.2, 2.2, 3.1}; x 2 = {3.2, 2.4, 1.8}; and x 3 = {1.7, 2.8, 2.3}). If the double bassist plucks the note Mi, the guitarist plucks Sol, and the saxophonist toots Do, their notes together make a new harmony (Mi, Sol, Do). They intend to improvise a new harmony by considering which note to play in their minds. If the new harmony is better than existing worst harmony, the new harmony is kept. Likewise, the new solution vector (1.2, 3.0, 1.6) generated in optimization process is kept if it is better than existing worst harmony in terms of objective function value. Just as the harmony quality is enhanced practice after practice, the solution quality is enhanced iteration by iteration. HS algorithm was originally developed for discrete optimization and later expanded for continuous optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</p><p>According to the above algorithm concept, the HS algorithm optimization procedure of which is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> consists of the following five steps. </p></div>

Five steps of HS are described in the next five subsections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Problem and algorithm parameter initialization</head><p>The optimization problem is specified as follows:</p><p>Minimize f ðxÞ subject to x j 2 X j ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; N;</p><p>where f ðxÞ is an objective function; x is the set of each decision variable x j ; N is the number of decision variables, X j is the set of the possible range of values for each decision variable, that is x min j and x max j are the lower and upper bound of the jth </p></div>

The HS algorithm parameters are also specified in this step. These are the harmony memory size (HMS), or the number of solution vectors in the harmony memory; harmony memory considering rate (HMCR); pitch adjusting rate (PAR); bandwidth distance (bw); and the number of improvisations (NI), or stopping criterion. Recently the bandwith (bw) term has been changed as fret width (fw) due to its being a more musical term <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. However, in this paper bw will be used. The harmony memory (HM) is a memory location where all the solution vectors (sets of decision variables) are stored. This HM is similar to the genetic pool in the genetic algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Here, HMCR, PAR, and bw are used to improve the solution vector. They are defined in Step 2.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Harmony memory initialization and evaluation</head><p>In Step 2, the HM matrix is filled with as many randomly generated solution vectors as the HMS. This matrix has N columns where N is the total number of decision variables and HMS rows which are selected in the first step. This initial memory is created by assigning random values that lie inside the lower and upper bounds of the decision variable to each decision parameter of each vector of the memory as shown in (1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x 0 i;j ¼ x min j þ r j Â x max j À x min j ; i ¼ 1; . . . ; HMS; j ¼ 1; . . . ; N;<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where x min j and x max j are the lower and upper bound of the jth decision parameter respectively, and r j 2 ½0; 1 is an uniformly distributed random number generated anew for each value of j. Pseudo-code of memory initialization can be shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>.</p><p>Thus, HM form can be shown as in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>: Candidate solution vectors in HM shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> are then analyzed and their objective function values are calculated ðf ðx i;: Þ; i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; HMSÞ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">New harmony improvisation</head><p>In Step 3, a new harmony vector, x 0 i ¼ ðx 0 i;1 ; x 0 i;2 ; . . . ; x 0 i;N Þ is generated based on three rules. They are memory consideration, pitch adjustment, and random selection. The value of a design variable can be selected from the values stored in HM with a probability of harmony memory considering rate (HMCR). It can be further adjusted by moving to a neighbor value of a selected value from the HM with a probability of pitch adjusting rate (PAR). Or, it can be selected randomly from the set of all candidate values without considering the stored values in HM, with the probability of (1-HMCR). The improvisation process of the HS algorithm is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The for. . .do-end do loop in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> depicts this step of HS. Memory consideration, pitch adjustment or random selection is applied to each variable of the new harmony vector in turn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Memory consideration</head><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the first musician in the figure has a memory containing 3 notes, {Do, Re, Mi}. He decides to choose Do in his memory and plays it, directly. Likewise, if the first decision variable represents the first musician, the value of 1.2 can be chosen from a memory. Likewise, in the memory consideration part of the HS, the values of decision variables x 0 i;j for the new vectors are chosen from any of the values in the specified HM range. The HMCR, which varies between 0 and 1, is the rate of choosing one value from the historical values stored in the HM, while (1 -HMCR) is the rate of randomly selecting one value from the possible range of values as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Pitch adjustment</head><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the second musician also has a 3-notes memory, {Mi, Fa, Sol}. Differently from the first musician, he first chooses the note Mi. Then, he can play its neighbor pitch such as Mi Sharp. Likewise, the value of 3.2 is chosen from the memory, and then it can be adjusted into a neighbor value 3.0 in this step.</p><p>Likewise, in the pitch adjustment step of the algorithm, every component obtained by the memory consideration is examined to determine whether it should be pitch-adjusted. The second if-end if part of the pseudo code shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> explains this step of HS. This operation uses the PAR parameter, which is the rate of pitch adjustment and pseudo-code can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>.</p><p>r is a random number between 0 and 1; and bw is an arbitrary distance bandwidth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Random selection</head><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the last musician has some notes in his memory, {La, Si, Do}, as well. Although this memory was used during the past improvisations, due to his musical knowledge he can also play all possible pitches, {Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si, Do+}. Thus,  when he decides to play a note randomly, he can choose any of these notes, Sol as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. As being in the possible data set, 1.6 can be chosen in this step, randomly, even if it doesn't exist in the memory. After each musician has decided what to play, the new harmony is composed of (Do, Mi#, Sol). Similarly, a new solution vector is determined as (1.2, 3.0, 1.6).</p><p>This step of HS has been shown in else part of Memory Consideration step. The value of decision variable x 0 :;j is randomly chosen within the value range X i .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Harmony memory update</head><p>If the newly generated harmony vector gives a better function value than the worst one, the new harmony vector is included in the HM and the worst harmony is excluded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Termination criterion check</head><p>The HS algorithm is terminated when the termination criterion (e.g. maximum number of improvisations) has been met. Otherwise, Steps 2.3 and 2.4 are repeated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Improvements on convergence of HS</head><p>Some works have been performed in order to improve the convergence of the HS. Mahdavi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> proposed a new variant of the HS, called the improved harmony search (IHS). The IHS dynamically updates PAR according to (2):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">PARðtÞ ¼ PAR min þ PAR max À PAR min ð Þ NI Â t;<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>where PAR(t) is the pitch adjusting rate for iteration t, PAR min is the minimum adjusting rate, PAR max is the maximum adjusting rate, NI is the umber of iteration, and t is the iteration number.</p><p>In addition, bw is dynamically updated as (3)</p><p>bwðtÞ ¼ bw max e ln bw min bwmax</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">NI Ât 0 @ 1 A ;<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>where bw(t) is the bandwidth for iteration t, bw min is the minimum bandwidth and bw max is the maximum bandwidth.</p><p>In IHS algorithm, four new extra parameters (PAR min , PAR max , bw min , and bw max ) should be adjusted for different problems and it is not easy to initialize these terms. Selecting the best variables is very difficult and may be optimization problem.</p><p>Another work is called as global-best harmony search (GHS) and is inspired by the concept of particle swarm optimization (PSO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. It modifies the pitch adjustment step of the HS such that the new harmony can mimic the best harmony in the HM. Thus, this approach replaces the bw parameter altogether and adds a social dimension to the HS <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. GHS has exactly the same steps as the IHS with the exception that New Harmony Improvisation step as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>.</p><p>However, another research result has shown that this PSO feature works well only for small-sized problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. According to the obtained results in this work, HS outperformed PSO-HS, GA, SA, and SA + TS for a large-scale real-world problem with 454 variables.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, a more rational PAR function using the idea of simulated annealing has been proposed which increase the robustness of algorithm and therefore leads to a highly reliable algorithm. Their PAR function is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">PARðtÞ ¼ PAR max À PAR max À PAR min ð Þ NI Â t:<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, some improvements on convergence of HS have also been performed. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Chaotic harmonic search algorithms</head><p>In simulating complex phenomena, sampling, numerical analysis, decision making and especially heuristic optimization needs random sequences with a long period and good uniformity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Chaos is a deterministic, random-like process found in nonlinear, dynamical system, which is non-period, non-converging and bounded. Moreover, it has a very sensitive dependence upon its initial condition and parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. The nature of chaos is apparently random and unpredictable and it also possesses an element of regularity. Mathematically, chaos is randomness of a simple deterministic dynamical system and chaotic system may be considered as sources of randomness <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</p><p>A chaotic map is a discrete-time dynamical system</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">x kþ1 ¼ f ðx k Þ; 0 &lt; x k &lt; 1; k ¼ 0; 1; 2; . . .<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>running in chaotic state. The chaotic sequence fx k : k ¼ 0; 1; 2; . . .g can be used as spread-spectrum sequence as random number sequence. Chaotic sequences have been proven easy and fast to generate and store, there is no need for storage of long sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Merely a few functions (chaotic maps) and few parameters (initial conditions) are needed even for very long sequences. In addition, an enormous number of different sequences can be generated simply by changing its initial condition. Moreover, these sequences are deterministic and reproducible.</p><p>Recently, chaotic sequences have been adopted instead of random sequences and very interesting and somewhat good results have been shown in many applications such as secure transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, nonlinear circuits <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, DNA computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, image processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and etc. The choice of chaotic sequences is justified theoretically by their unpredictability, i.e., by their spread-spectrum characteristic and ergodic properties.</p><p>One of the drawbacks of the HS is its premature convergence, especially while handling problems with more local optima <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</p><p>The classical HS algorithm uses fixed values for HMCR, PAR and bw. These values that are the key factors to affect the convergence of HS are adjusted in initialization step (Step 1) and cannot be changed during new iterations. The main drawback of this method appears in the number of iterations to find an optimal solution.</p><p>Small PAR values with large bw values can cause to poor performance of the algorithm and too many iterations needed to find optimum solution. Small bw values in final iterations increase the fine-tuning of solution vectors by local exploitation and in early iterations bigger bw value can increase the diversity of solution vectors for global explorations. Furthermore large PAR values with small bw values usually cause the improvement of best solutions in final iterations which algorithm converged to optimal solution vector. With these considerations, IHS has been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>However for example decreased bw value is subject to trap the algorithms into the local optima and slows the convergence speed when it is near a minimum. Furthermore, HMCR parameter and randomly initializing of HM may affect the convergence speed. In fact, however, these parameters cannot ensure the optimization's ergodicity entirely in phase space, because they are random in classical HS. That is why; these parameters may be selected chaotically by using chaotic maps. In this paper, sequences generated from chaotic systems substitute random numbers for the HS parameters where it is necessary to make a random-based choice. By this way, it is intended to improve the global convergence and to prevent to stick on a local solution.</p><p>This paper provides new approaches introducing chaotic maps with ergodicity, irregularity, and the stochastic property in HS to improve the global convergence by escaping the local solutions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Test problems</head><p>Well-defined benchmark functions which are based on mathematical functions can be used as objective functions to measure and test the performance of optimization methods. The nature, complexity and other properties of these benchmark functions can be easily obtained from their definitions. The difficulty levels of most benchmark functions are adjustable by setting their parameters. From the standard set of benchmark problems available in the literature, two important functions which are multi-modal (containing many local optima, but only one global optimum) are considered to test the efficacy of the proposed methods. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> shows the main properties of the selected benchmark functions used in the experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Experimental results</head><p>Selected two benchmark problems are solved by simulating the HS, IHS and GHS algorithms. Two criteria are applied to terminate the simulation of the algorithms: reaching maximum number of iterations which is set to a constant number and the second criterion is getting a minimum error.</p><p>All HM was initialized in regions that include the global optimum for a fair evaluation. The algorithms were run for 100 times to catch their stochastic properties. In this experiment, maximum iteration number was set to 500 and the goal is not to find the global optimum values but to find out the potential of the algorithms. Algorithm success rate defined in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">20</ref>) has been used for comparison of the results obtained from different HS algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S ¼ 100</head><p>NT successful NT all Q level : ð20Þ using different chaotic maps for Rastrigin function for N = 2 is shown in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>. CHS algorithms have somewhat shown better performance than other HS algorithms. The performances of CHS3, CHS4, and CHS6 algorithms are better than others.</p><p>From the result demonstrated from these tables, it can be concluded that adjusting of bw values with chaotic maps have improved the convergence property of the HS algorithm. Table <ref type="table">6</ref> depicts the success rates of HS algorithms for the second benchmark function, Griewangk function for N = 2. The same values selected to for Rastrigin function have also been used for this function. Success rates of CHS algorithms using different chaotic maps for Griewangk function for N = 2 is shown in Table <ref type="table">7</ref>. CHS algorithms have somewhat shown better performance than other HS algorithms as in Rastrigin function. The performances of CHS3, CHS4, and CH6 algorithms are better than others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, different chaotic maps have been embedded to adapt the parameters of music inspired HS algorithm. This has been done using the chaotic number generators each time a random number is needed by the classical HS algorithm. Seven new chaotic HS algorithms have been proposed and different chaotic maps have been analyzed in the benchmark functions. It has been detected that coupling emergent results in different areas, like those of HS and complex dynamics, can improve the quality of results in some optimization problems and also that chaos may be a desired process as in real music. It has been also shown that, these methods especially CHS3, CHS4, and CHS6 algorithms have somewhat increased the solution quality, that is in some cases they improved the global searching capability by escaping the local solutions. These proposed methods are new and more elaborated experiments may be performed with parallel or distributed implementation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
