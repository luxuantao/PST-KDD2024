<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In group decision making (GDM) with multiplicative preference relations (also known as pairwise comparison matrices in the Analytical Hierarchy Process), to come to a meaningful and reliable solution, it is preferable to consider individual consistency and group consensus in the decision process. This paper provides a decision support model to aid the group consensus process while keeping an acceptable individual consistency for each decision maker. The concept of an individual consistency index and a group consensus index is introduced based on the Hadamard product of two matrices. Two algorithms are presented in the designed support model. The first algorithm is utilized to convert an unacceptable preference relation to an acceptable one. The second algorithm is designed to assist the group in achieving a predefined consensus level. The main characteristics of our model are that: (1) it is independent of the prioritization method used in the consensus process; (2) it ensures that each individual multiplicative preference relation is of acceptable consistency when the predefined consensus level is achieved. Finally, some numerical examples are given to verify the effectiveness of our model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Over the past few decades, a number of multiple criteria decision making theories, methods, and applications have been developed in the fields of management science, operational research, and industrial engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. Because of the increasing complexity of the socio-economic environment nowadays, many decision-making processes in the real world take place in group settings. Preference relations are popular and powerful techniques to model experts' preferences in group decision making (GDM). The three commonly used preference relations are multiplicative preference relations (also known as pairwise comparison matrix in the Analytical Hierarchy Process) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, fuzzy preference relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>, and linguistic preference relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>.</p><p>Pairwise comparison focuses exclusively on two alternatives at a time and facilitates experts in expressing their preferences. However, this way of providing preferences limits the experts' global perception of the alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. As a consequence, the provided preference relations may lead to irrational or inconsistent conclusions. Therefore, it is important to study the conditions under which consistency is satisfied. For GDM using preference relations, the consistency measure itself includes two sub-problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> When can a decision maker, considered individually, be said to be consistent? <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> When can the aggregated group as a whole be considered consistent and in consensus? It is important to differentiate group consistency from group consensus. Group consistency explores the rationality of the aggregated group preference relation itself and group consensus measures the degree of agreement between individual opinions and the group opinion. Therefore, in essence there are three problems: an individual consistency problem, a collective consistency problem and a consensus problem.</p><p>When carrying out rational decision making, consistent information is more appropriate than information containing some contradictions. If we were to secure consensus and only thereafter consistency, we would destroy the consensus in favor of individual consistency and the final solution might not be acceptable to the decision makers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Clearly, it is preferable that the set of decision makers reach a high degree of individual consistency and group consensus before applying the selection process. In a rational GDM process, both consensus and consistency should be pursued and sought after. A solution with a high level of consensus is desirable, but also that solution should be derived from information that is consistent enough <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. There are cases where each individual is consistent, but the group solution is not in accordance with any one of the group. We assume that the decision makers expect an internal logic to their judgments, but at the same time they expect a consensus in the group.</p><p>The aim of this paper is to propose a consistency and consensus based support model to support the consensus reaching process in GDM with multiplicative preference relations. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the related work on consistency and consensus of preference relations. Section 3 develops a consistency measure of multiplicative preference relation and supplies a method to deal with inconsistency. Section 4 discusses the consensus measure and the consensus reaching process. Section 5 is devoted to presenting a complete support model for GDM. In Section 6, three illustrative examples are provided. Concluding remarks are made in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature review</head><p>In this section, we first review the pertinent literature on the consensus models of GDM with preference relations. Then we discuss the basic methodology and motivation of our work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Consistency measures</head><p>Preference relations are a common format for expressing preferences by using pairwise comparisons. The decision maker makes a direct choice of one object over another when comparing two objects. However, inconsistencies are not unexpected, as making value judgments can be difficult in some situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Hitherto, many authors have paid attention to the individual consistency problems of preference relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. For multiplicative preference relations, there are two well established methods to create a consistency index. One of these is the consistency ratio based on Saaty's eigenvector method <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. The other method proposed by Crawford and Williams <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> is the geometric consistency index based on a row geometric mean prioritization method (RGMM). Furthermore, many methods have been shown to modify multiplicative preference relations with unacceptable consistency to ones of acceptable consistency (see for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>). The first issue addressed in this study provides an alternative method to help decision makers improve the consistency of their multiplicative preference relations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Consensus models</head><p>The consensus measure is used to measure the difference among decision makers and is a vital element of consensus models. A consensus process can be viewed as a dynamic and iterative group discussion process with several consensus rounds, in which the decision makers agree to change their preferences following advice given by a moderator. The moderator knows the agreement at each moment of the consensus process by means of the computation of various consensus measures and is in charge of supervising and moving the consensus process towards success <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Different models that guide the moderator and the decision makers in achieving the consensus process have been developed for GDM problems (see for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>). For preference relations, the well-known consensus models are the ones for multiplicative preference relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>, fuzzy preference relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>, and linguistic preference relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. These studies have made great progress in GDM consensus models.</p><p>Saaty <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> developed a metric for the compatibility of two multiplicative preference relations. Bryson <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and Yeh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> presented two indicators to estimate the level of group consensus: the group strong agreement quotient and the group strong disagreement quotient. Dong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> proposed interesting consensus indexes to measure consensus degree among multiplicative preference relations for AHP group decision making using RGMM. <ref type="bibr">Kacprzyk et al. [31]</ref> presented 'soft' degrees of consensus for fuzzy preference relations and employed fuzzy linguistic quantifiers to represent a fuzzy majority. Xu <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> presented a number of goal programming models and quadratic programming models based on the idea of maximizing group consensus to determine the importance weight of each preference relation. For incomplete fuzzy preference relations, Herrera-Viedma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> developed a feedback mechanism to generate advice on how experts should change or complete their preferences in order to reach a solution with high consensus and consistency degrees. For GDM using linguistic preference relations, Herrera et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> introduced a consensus model, which is based on the use of a fuzzy majority represented by means of a linguistic quantifier. The model is guided by some linguistic consensus and linguistic consistency measures. Herrera-Viedma et al. developed further a consensus support system model for GDM with multi-granular linguistic preference relations. Cabrerizo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> discussed a consensus process for linguistic preference relations in GDM with an unbalanced fuzzy linguistic context with incomplete information. There are also a few papers that discuss the consensus reaching process for multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">The proposed work</head><p>As mentioned earlier, in GDM with preference relations both consistency and consensus should be addressed. There are a few papers that address both of these, particularly for multiplicative preference relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. Dong et al. presented consensus models dealt with multiplicative preference relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Their consensus models are concise and can be applied to GDM based on the row geometric prioritization method. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, the authors managed consistency and consensus criteria simultaneously for GDM with fuzzy preference relations. They defined a new measure called consistency/consensus level (CCL), CCL =(1-δ) ⋅ CL+ δ ⋅ CR, where CL is the global consistency level, CR is the global consensus degree and δ is the tradeoff parameter between consistency and consensus. These methods are very useful and interesting yet they do not explicitly show if the final individual consistency is limited to an acceptable level.</p><p>We note that it is possible to convert a multiplicative preference relation into a fuzzy preference relation and vice versa, by means of adequate transformation functions such as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. In general, research progress in GDM with one kind of preference relations can benefit research in another kind. Nevertheless, the multiplicative preference relation as a typical preference relation has been widely used and accepted in the field of decision making. It is very important in the decision process to look for consistency and consensus models which directly facilitate decision makers. In addition, it is necessary to develop new simple yet effective consensus models for GDM with preference relations.</p><p>Previous studies have made significant contributions to the consensus models of GDM problems. However, a detailed survey of the literature revealed that consensus modeling of multiplicative preference relations has not been adequately considered. Therefore, based on the fundamental methodology for GDM with preference relations, we focus on a consistency and consensus based support model for multiplicative preference relations. In the designed model, the group multiplicative preference relation is selected as a reference point to modify the decision maker's preference relation which has a maximum group consensus index in each round. Our model has the following characteristics: (1) it is independent of the prioritization method used in the consensus process; (2) it makes each individual multiplicative preference relation still be of acceptable consistency when the predefined consensus level is achieved. Thus, a more flexible and reliable GDM model based on multiplicative preference relations is obtained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Consistency measure</head><p>In this section, in order for this paper to be as self-contained as possible, we first introduce the concept of multiplicative preference relations and their aggregation in the context of GDM, then we focus our discussion on consistency measure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Concepts and properties of the consistency measure</head><p>Denote N = {1,2,⋯, n} and M = {1,2,⋯, m}. Let X ={x 1 , x 2 , ⋯, x n } be a finite set of alternatives, where x i denotes the ith alternative. In a preference relation, an expert provides judgments for every pair of alternatives which reflect the degree of preference of the first alternative over the second one. The concept of the multiplicative preference relation (pairwise comparison matrix) is given below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 1. ([38]</head><p>) A multiplicative preference relation on a set of alternatives X is represented by a matrix, A = (a ij ) n × n ⊂ X × X, being a ij belonged precisely to the Saaty 1-9 scale and is interpreted as the ratio of the preference intensity of alternative x i to that of x j , and multiplicative reciprocity is assumed, i.e., a ij ⋅ a ji = 1, ∀ i, j ∈ N.</p><p>Consider a GDM problem with multiplicative preference relations.

Individual judgments can be aggregated in different ways by aggradation operators such as the OWAlike operators proposed by Yager <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. For multiplicative preference relation in AHP, the methods that have been found to be most useful are the aggregation of individual judgments (AIJ) and the aggregation of priorities (AIP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.

By using the above deviation degrees based on the Hadamard product, the representation of individual consistency and group consensus is unified.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Consensus reaching process</head><p>As consensus is the major goal of GDM, in the GDM process, before aggregation we need to apply consensus models to help decision makers reach consensus. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, a rational consensus model for a GDM problem based on multiplicative preference relations can be shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p><p>In the model, there is often a moderator, via the exchange of information and rational arguments, trying to persuade the experts to alter their opinions to bring these opinions closer. In the following, we give an iterative model to achieve consensus.</p><p>Let {A 1 , A 2 , ⋯, A m } and λ = {λ 1 , λ 2 , ⋯, λ m } be as before. A c is the group multiplicative preference relation utilizing the geometric average operator.

The main step for the proposed consensus model is constructing a new multiplicative preference relation A τ according to A τ .

Step 6. End.</p><p>Remark 2. The main advantage of our proposed consensus scheme is that it does not use any priority methods in the process. In Algorithm 2, the group multiplicative preference relation A h c is considered a reference point in the improvement process in the hth round We modify only one preference relation that has a maximum group consensus level in each round. If there is more than one decision maker simultaneously obtaining the maximum group level, then we can change their preferences in the same round. As mentioned in the first section, the decision makers are assumed to change their preferences following the moderator's advice. All team members agree to support the decision. What if there are extreme outliers still outside the consensus level after the given maximal rounds (rather unlikely, but possible)? If this is the case, as it was recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>, the moderator may prefer as an arbiter and ignore the preferences of the outliers in order to achieve the decision goal. On the one hand, the proposed model can be considered an interactive method, and the decision makers have the right to participate in the consensus reaching process in each round. On the other hand, since the proposed consensus model can run automatically, a minimum requirement for decision makers is that they only need to provide their preferences in the first round. In the following, we discuss the properties of the above consensus model. We show that Algorithm 2 is convergent.</p><p>Theorem 5. In Algorithm 2, suppose the kth decision maker has to change his?/her multiplicative preference relation in the (h + 1)th iteration. Let A k, h + 1 be the preference relation generated by Algorithm 2 for the decision maker k. Then, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">GCI H A k;hþ1 bGCI H A k;h :<label>ð22Þ</label></formula><p>Proof. The proof of Theorem 5 is provided in Appendix A.</p><p>From Theorem 5, we know that in each step, a decision maker who modifies their multiplicative preference relation has a better group consensus index. Generally, the group consensus indexes of those who don't modify their preference relations at this time will not exceed the maximum group consensus index of the last time. Thus, the proposed algorithm is convergent in a general sense. At the same time, the modified multiplicative preference relation has an acceptable individual consistency index under the condition that the consensus reaching process starts with multiplicative preference relations of acceptable consistency. Theorem 6. Let A 1 , A 2 ,⋯,A m and A c be m multiplicative preference relations and the group multiplicative preference relation, respectively. Let {A l, h } and {A h c } be the sequences generated by Algorithm 2. If max l CI H A l ð Þ f g ≤CI, ∀l ∈M, then we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">max l CI H A l;hþ1 n o ≤ max l CI H A l;h n o ≤CI:<label>ð23Þ</label></formula><p>Proof. The proof of Theorem 6 is provided in Appendix A. Therefore, the consistency index for every multiplicative preference relation is still acceptable after the implementation of Algorithm 2. It implies that when we start with preference relations that are acceptable, we end with modified preference relations which not only achieve the predefined consensus level but are also of acceptable individual consistency. These theorems provide theoretical foundations and are of vital importance for GDM problems based on multiplicative preference relations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">A decision support model for the GDM process</head><p>The complete support model for a GDM problem with multiplicative preference relations is depicted as a flowchart in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>.

However, the decision makers are responsible for the final decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, so they decide whether or not to follow the advice generated by the support model. Thus, our decision support model plays a role in assisting the decision makers and the moderator in the decision process.</p><p>The main features of the above support model are emphasized as follows. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> The consensus reaching process proposed in the model is independent of which priority method is used in the process.

( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">4</ref>) Some theoretical results serve as a foundation for the whole group decision model. When the group achieves the predefined level of consensus, the consistency of each decision maker is also guaranteed. After obtaining the final multiplicative group preference relation, either the eigenvector method or the row geometric mean prioritization method can be used in the selection process. As a result, a general decision support model for solving GDM problems with multiplicative preference relations considering consistency and consensus is presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Illustrative examples</head><p>This section presents several examples to show the implementation process and the validity of the proposed approach in practice.</p><p>Example 1. Consider the numerical example which was discussed by Dong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Suppose we have a set of five decision makers providing the following multiplicative preference relations {A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , A 4 , A 5 } on a set of four alternatives {X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , X 4 } which need to be ranked from the best to the worst. Let</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">w (k) = (w 1 (k) , w 2 (k) , w 3 (k) , w 4 (k)</formula><p>) T be the individual priority vector derived from multiplicative preference relation A k using the eigenvector method. It should be noted that other prioritization methods can also be used in the computation process. Srdjevic <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> presented a multicriteria preference synthesis (MPS) procedure across a Euclidean distance (ED) and minimum violations (MV) criterion to choose the most appropriate method for a given multiplicative preference relation. The main conclusion is that there is no prioritization method that is superior to the others in all cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. A k and w (k) (k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are given below.  Let λ = {0.1, 0.3, 0.1,0.2, 0.3} be the weights of decision makers. From the above multiplicative preference relations, we calculate the group multiplicative preference relation A c using (1) and the corresponding priority vector w c =(w 1 c , w 2 c , w 3 c , w 4 c ) T which are listed below. We can see that the ranking order of alternatives in w c is the same as that of w 1 , w 2 , w 3 and w 4 but is very different from that of w 5 . In the following, we show how to apply the GDM support model described in Section 4 to obtain a solution based on consistency and consensus. Stage 1: Consistency control process.</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">A 1 ¼ 1 4 6 7 1=4 1 3 4 1=6 1=3 1 2 1=7 1=4 1=2 1 0 B B @ 1 C C A ; A 2 ¼ 1 5 7 9 1=5 1 4 6 1=7 1=4 1 2 1=9 1=6 1=2 1 0 B B @ 1 C C A ; w 1 ð Þ ¼ 0:6168; 0:2238; 0:0972; 0:0621 ð Þ T ; w 2 ð Þ ¼ 0:6526; 0:2247; 0:0762; 0:0465 ð Þ T ; A 3 ¼ 1 3 5 8 1=3 1 4 5 1=5 1=4 1 2 1=8 1=5 1=2 1 0 B B @ 1 C C A ; A 4 ¼ 1 4 5 6 1=4 1 3 3 1=5 1=3 1 2 1=6 1=3 1=2 1 0 B B @ 1 C C A ;</formula><formula xml:id="formula_37">A 5 ¼ 1 1=2 1 2 2 1 2 3 1 1=2 1 4 1=2 1=3 1=4 1 0 B B @ 1 C C A ;</formula></div>

As A 2 and A 5 do not reach the consensus level, we continue to carry out Algorithm 2. Set γ = 0.9, the algorithm is terminated after ten steps. The consistency and consensus indexes for each decision maker at each step are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>.</p><p>From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>, we find only A 5 is modified. The consistency indexes of the modified multiplicative preference relation are decreasing in the first nine steps but increase a little in the tenth step. The consistency index of the group multiplicative preference relation is no greater than the largest consistency index of the individual multiplicative preference relation at every step. The group consensus indexes for every decision maker at each step are also decreasing. If we use Saaty's consistency ratio (CR), we have CR A 5 ¼ 0:0265, CR A c ¼ 0:0388. We find that the results in this example are in accordance with the theorems in Sections 2 and 3. The modified multiplicative preference relations A 5 are as follows.  The final group multiplicative preference relation is shown above. Thus the ranking of the alternatives is X 1 &gt;X 2 &gt;X 3 &gt;X 4 , which indicates that X 1 is the best option.</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">A 5 ¼</formula><p>Our ranking order of the alternatives is the same as Dong et al.'s paper but with different degrees of one alternative over another <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The consensus model is different from previous papers. The consistency and consensus measures are based on the compatibility of two ratio matrices based on the Hadamard product proposed by Saaty. The consistency and consensus based model is more simple and straightforward. We use the group multiplicative preference relation as the reference point matrix at every step. It is not necessary to compute any priority vector in the consensus reaching process. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, both the consensus measure and the consensus model depend on a row geometric mean prioritization method.</p><p>Example 2. As we have mentioned, the two aggregation methods (AIJ and AIP) discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> are widely used for comparisons in literature. For AIP, a consensus degree was proposed by comparing the position of each alternative in the decision makers' individual priorities and in the group priorities <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Let w (k) and w c be the individual and collective priority vector respectively. Let v (k) = (v</p><p>), where v i (k) is the position of the ith alternative in w (k) . Similarly, let</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">v c = (v 1 c , v 2 c , ⋯, v n c</formula><p>), where v i c is the position of the ith alternative in w c .</p><p>Then, the ordinal consensus index of A k is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">OCI(A k ) = (1/ n) ∑ i = 1 n |v i (k) -v i c |. If OCI A k ð Þ ≤OCI,∀ k,</formula><p>where OCI is a predefined threshold, we conclude that an acceptable ordinal consensus is reached. A similar algorithm to Algorithm 2 can be established based on these indicators. To show the proposed decision support model works under these indicators, we still use the data from Example 1. When setting OCI ¼ 0 and γ = 0.9, we apply the proposed model to adjust the given multiplicative preference relations. The algorithm ends after 8 steps. Resulting indicators are listed in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. We find only A 5 is modified. The modified preference relation for the 5th decision maker and the final group preference relation are denoted as A 5 and A c . The corresponding priority vectors w 5 and w c are also listed below. The results show that the proposed model is suitable for dealing with ordinal consensus. Example 3. Consider the following problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. There are three individuals, who are managers from the design, manufacturing and marketing departments, participating in a group decision about new product development strategy through AHP. The five decision criteria for new product development are cost, manufacturability, quality, technological improvement and market share, denoted as C 1 , C 2 , C 3 , C 4 , C 5 respectively. The three managers give their preferences over the five criteria by multiplicative preference relations. The multiplicative preference relations A k and the corresponding weight vector w k (k = 1, 2, 3) for criteria are calculated accordingly. T Without loss of generality, each manager is assumed to have equal importance and let λ = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) be their weight vector. From the above multiplicative preference relations, we calculate the group multiplicative preference relation A c using (1) and the corresponding priority vector w c which are listed above.</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">A 1 ¼ 1 5 7 3 1=3 1=5 1 3 1=3 1=5 1=7 1=3 1 1=7 1=9 1=3 3 7 1 1=3 3 5 9 3 1 0 B B B B @ 1 C C C C A ; A 2 ¼ 1 1=3 7 1=2 3 3 1 3 1 5 1 1=3 1 1=3 3 2 1 3 1 5 1=3 1=5 1=3 1=5 1 0 B B B B @ 1 C C C C A ;</formula><p>In the following, we show how to apply the GDM support model described in Section 4 to obtain a solution based on consistency and consensus.</p><p>Stage 1: Consistency control process.</p><p>The initial consistency indexes are shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. If we fix a minimum threshold value CI ¼ 1:1, we see that all the multiplicative preference relations are of acceptable consistency, The group consensus indexes for each decision maker are listed in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. Here, the consensus level is set at GCI ¼ 1:1. As all the preference relations do not reach the consensus level, we continue to carry out Algorithm 2. Set γ=0.9, the algorithm is terminated after 20 steps. We find that all three preference relations are modified. Specifically, A 1 , A 2 and A 3 have been modified 4, 14, and 2 times respectively. The final modified individual multiplicative preference relations and group multiplicative preference relation and their corresponding prioritization vectors are given below. The consistency and consensus indexes are listed in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. Stage 3: Selection process.

Our results also verify the consensus criteria based on a group strong agreement quotient (GSAQ) and a group strong disagreement quotient (GSDQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>In a GDM context, prior to the selection of the best alternative, it would be desirable that decision makers achieve a high degree of consensus while keeping their preferences rational. In this paper we have investigated a decision support model which simultaneously addresses the individual consistency and group consensus. The main work presented in this paper is summarized as follows:</p><p>(1) We have proposed a new consistency measure for multiplicative preference relations. An algorithm has been presented to make a multiplicative preference relation of acceptable consistency. We have shown that our consistency improvement method is related to Saaty's consistency index. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> We have also proposed a consensus index to measure the consensus level. For both the consistency and consensus measures, the concept of a deviation measure has been used based on the Hadamard product of two matrices. A consensus reaching process has been put forward to help the group reach a predefined consensus level. (3) A framework for the decision support model has been presented to aid the whole GDM process based on preference relations. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been illustrated by three numerical examples.</p><p>Our model's main improvement is that it is independent of the prioritization method used in the entire consensus scheme. The model guarantees that each of the individual multiplicative preference relation is still rational and of acceptable consistency. As a consequence, the proposed model allows us to achieve a higher level of consistency and consensus solutions for a GDM with preference relations. The consistency concepts and corresponding properties of our GDM model can be extended to deal with other kinds of preference relations.</p><p>Since A (h) ≠ G (h) , there is at least one pair (i, j) such that the above expression strictly holds.
