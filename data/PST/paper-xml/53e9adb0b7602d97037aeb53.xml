<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Jun Zhang</head><p>Abstract-A Markov random field (MRF) model-based EM (expectation-maximization) procedure for simultaneously estimating the degradation model and restoring the image is described. The MRF is a coupled one which provides continuity (inside regions of smooth gray tones) and discontinuity (at region boundaries) constraints for the restoration problem which is, in general, ill-posed. The computational difficulty associated with the EM procedure for MRF's is resolved by using the mean field theory from statistical mechanics. An orthonormal blur decomposition is used to reduce the chances of undesirable locally optimal estimates. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world images show that this approach provides good blur estimates and restored images. The restored images are comparable to those obtained by a Wiener filter in mean-square error, but are more visually pleasing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>MAGâ‚¬ restoration is an important and difficult problem in I image processing applications <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> (for a recent review, see <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>). The difficulty is mainly due to two factors. First, image restoration is often an ill-posed inverse problem, where the inverse does not exist or is unstable. Second, the degradation process is often unknown and has to be estimated from observed data. The problem of simultaneously estimating the degradation model and restoring the image is known as blind image restoration.</p><p>The inverse problem has been attacked by using various Wiener filters [I], Kalman filters <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>, and more recently, MRF model-based Bayesian techniques [4]- <ref type="bibr">[SI and regularization [6]</ref>. The idea here is to bring as many constraints as possible to bear to obtain a unique and robust inverse. The MRF model-based techniques have attracted much attention due to their generality for modeling and their capacity to incorporate various constraints. They can be used to account for casual and noncasual image models <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, smooth regions and boundaries in the image. linear and nonlinear blurs, and various types of noise <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. Furthermore, the MRF models fit naturally in a Bayesian [maximum a posferiori probability (MAP)] formulation of the image restoration problem. Finally, it was pointed out in [SI that the standard regularization techniques <ref type="bibr">Manuscript received February 19. 1992</ref><ref type="bibr">: revised August 18, 1992</ref>. This work was supported in part by an NSF ROA award as an extension of Grant CDA 88059 IO. The associate editor coordinating the review of this paper and approving it for publication was Dr. M. Ibrahim Sezan.</p><p>The author is with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, W1 53201.</p><p>IEEE Los Number 9205218.</p><p>can be considered as special cases of the MRF model-based approach.</p><p>The degradation model estimation problem was previously attacked by blind deconvolution <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, and recently by maximum-likelihood estimation [ 101 and the EM algorithm [ 1 11-[ 121. Blind deconvolution techniques often require that the type of blur (e.g., motion blur, etc.) be known, and hence are somewhat restrictive. The EM algorithm, on the other hand, is a maximum-likelihood (ML) parameter estimation procedure for incomplete data, and it does not, in principle, restrict the type of blur. Through an iterative process, it provides not only an estimate of the blur, but also a restoration of the image. Hence, it attracted much attention recently as a more general approach to blind image restoration.</p><p>Previously, some promising image restoration results have been obtained by using the coupled MRF model with known blur models [4]-[S], and by using the EM algorithm without MRF modeling <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. [ I I]. Hence, an MRF-based EM algorithm may provide a powerful technique for blind image restoration. However, the difficulty here is that when the original image is modeled as an MRF, the conditional expectation in the EM algorithm is difficult to calculate. In recent work <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>, we have proposed a solution based on the mean field theory, and demonstrated its efficacy for unsupervised image segmentation where the MRF is discrete-valued. In this work, we extend this approach to the image restoration problem where the MRF is coupled and continuous-valued. As a byproduct, we will also develop a scheme for calculating mean fields with relatively complex clique structures. The mean field theory has its origin in statistical mechanics (e.g., [ 14]), and was recently used in computer vision applications [ 15]- <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Zerubia and Chellappa [16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Hiriyannaiah et al. [32]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">Bilbro and Snyder [33]</ref> have used this method for noise removal.</p><p>There are several common implementation problems facing most EM-algorithm-based techniques for image restoration, as described by Lagendijk et al. [l 11. For example, the blur model often has a large number of parameters to be estimated, and this makes it easy for the EM procedure to get "struck" in an unwanted local optimum. Furthermore, blur model estimation may itself be an ill-posed problem. In this work, we have studied a blur model decomposition scheme and a smoothness constraint for solving these problems.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. In Section 11, the mean filed theory and the EM algorithm are briefly reviewed. In Section 111, the MRF image models and the mean field equa- However, it is well known that the calculation of 2 and the sum above involve all possible realizations of the MRF which is, in general, exponentially complex and computationally not tions used in the EM algorithm are described. In Section IV, blur decomposition and a smoothness constraint are described in the context of implementation. Finally, experimental results are presented in Section v , followed by a summary in Section VI.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Mean Field Theory</head><p>We will start the discussion with the concept of an MRF.</p><p>Let S be a set of sites with a neighborhood system defined on it. Let c be a subset of S ; then c is called a clique of S if it either contains a single site or several sites that are all neighbors to each other. Examples of S and some associated clique types are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Let U = { u i . i E S} be a collection of random variables defined on S . Then U is called an MRF if 1) all of its realizations have nonzero probabilities, and 2) its conditional distribution satisfies the following Markov property:</p><p>where us-, denotes the field restricted on S -7, and N , denotes the set of neighbors of 7 . Let U be an MRF. Then it is well known (e.g., see <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>) that the joint probability distribution of U is a Gibbs distribution, given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p(u) = 2-1 cxp[-i3U(u)] ( 2 4 feasible [ 141.</formula><p>The mean field theory suggests an approximation to (3) based on the following assumption: the influence of u J . . ~ # I , in the calculation of ( U ? ) can be approximated by the influence of ( u J ) . For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the interactions between sites are painvise, that is, a clique potential may be nonzero only when it contains one or two sites. Using the mean field approximation, (3) can be approximated by (for details, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>) (4) where p,,,f (7r, ) is the mean field approximation to the marginal distribution and JtN, 8 1 , are called the mean field local energy and local partition function at t , respectively. Equations ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)-(5b) are obtained by replacing i i J . , 9 # 7, by ( 7 i J ) in the energy function and partition function in (3).</p><p>The mean field is usually computed iteratively, as can be seen in ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)-(5b) (to find the mean field at /, one needs the mean field at the neighbors of I ) . When the data are discretevalued (each variable takes a finite number of values as is in <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>), (4) can be applied iteratively. However, when the data take continuous values, which is the case in image restoration, (4) is not the most efficient since it involves integration. An alternative, known as the saddle point approximation [ 151, is to minimize the local mean field energy, which amounts to solving the following equation: can be written as2</p><p>(2 =(logP(Ylx) + lOF;P(Z))</p><p>Since the computations of the mean field can be decomposed into local computations, as can be seen from ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">6</ref>), it can be field theory can also be used to provide an approximation to (9) implemented in parallel; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[27]-[29]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The EM Procedure</head><p>Many problems in signal processing can be described as incomplete datu problems, where part of the data is not observable, or hidden, and has to be estimated along with parameters of the data models. For example, in blind image restoration, the original image is hidden and has to be estimated along with blur parameters. The EM algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, reviewed in the following, is an iterative algorithm for solving incomplete problems. We start with the following notation:</p><p>x = {.rl.

Once this can be found for a given problem, such as image restoration, the rest of the problem becomes a relatively straightforward application of the EM algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="111.">MEAN FIELD EQUATIONS FOR IMAGE RESTORATION</head><p>In this section, we derive mean field equations to be used in the E-step of the EM algorithm for blind image restoration. Basically, these equations compute an estimate of the original image based on the observed image and parameters (known or estimated) of the degradation model. Hence, they can also be used for image restoration when the degradation model is known. We start the discussion with image models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. MRF Image Modeling</head><p>In this work, the original image is modeled as an MRF, while the degraded image is modeled as a blurred and noisecorrupted version of the original image.

It has been shown that under some moderate regularity conditions, the estimates converge to ML estimates, at least locally <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>.</p><p>The main difficulty in using EM procedures in applications where x is an MRF is that the Q-function of the E-step is hard to calculate due to the interactions between the hidden variables at different sites.' Now, this difficulty may be overcome by using the mean field theory. The idea here is to calculate the ()-function using the mean field. Specifically, the Q-function where D , is a set of sites containing i , known as the "region of support" of the blur, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The model in ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) can be considered a generalization of many models used previously, such as causal and noncausal linear blur, independent additive or multiplicative noise, and nonlinear blur. Another assumption concerning the above model is that the parameters for the image models are separable in that  </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 O A O 0 O O O ~O O D, = R,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Blind Restoration</head><p>Now, the blind image restoration problem can be formulated as: given the observed image y, estimated the original image 2, as well as the model parameters @. From Section 11, the meanfield-based EM algorithm can be used if we can establish that z is an MRF given y. Indeed, dropping the parameters for convenience, we have where log p(y) is a constant for a given y. In (ll), it is always possible to select a neighborhood system that is sufficiently large so that the terms in the first summation, along with the clique functions in C(z), form clique functions for p(zly), e.g.. let the new neighborhood system be such that D, is a clique. Therefore, p(zly) is always an MRF <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>; hence, the mean-field-based EM algorithm can be used. When the EM procedure converges, the final restoration of the image is obtained by which is the mean field computed with the final estimates of the parameters. This estimate is an approximation of the minimum mean-square error estimate [ 151 of the original image, and it requires no additional computation besides the EM procedure.</p><p>Often, further constraints on the model parameters are needed to obtain meaningful estimates [9]-[ll]. Such constraints may be incorporated easily in the &amp;' -st ep, e.g., by optimizing where (2 represents the (2-function and gl(.) and g * ( . ) are constraints on the parameters.</p></div>

It provides an "adaptive" compromise between the amount of inverse filtering and smoothing-more inverse filtering or sharpening near edges, and more smoothing inset homogeneous regions.</p><p>Similarly, the mean field local energy for the line field can be found.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. IMPLEMENTATION</head><p>In this section, we first discuss some ideas for attacking the common technical problems associated with blur parameter estimation described in Section I, and then describe the implementation of the E-step and the M-step in some detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A . Blur Decomposition</head><p>In many practical applications, the blur process can be effectively modeled by an FIR filter, as is in ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>). However, this might cause problems in the AT-step [ l l ] . For example, there might be too many parameters to estimate, even for a blur model for moderate size (e.g., a 5 x 5 filter has 25 coefficients to be estimated), thereby increasing the chances for the M-step to get stuck in an unwanted local maximum [ l l ] . Although various symmetry conditions have been imposed previously to reduce the number of coefficients, it might still be too large if the size of the blur filter is relatively large (e.g., 9 x 9).</p><p>In this work, we propose an alternative approach inspired by transform image compression techniques (e.g., see <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>). If we regard a 2-D blur filter as an "image," this image is usually very "smooth." Hence, it may be compressed by using a small number of transform coefficients, thereby reducing the number of parameters to be estimated. Another potential advantage of this approach is that each transform coefficient, unlike the original blur filter coefficients, captures some "global" feature of the blur, and the estimates might be more robust.</p><p>Mathematically, the transform technique is simply a decomposition of the blur filter with respect to a prespecified basis.</p><p>Let F D be the space of all of the real functions defined on D , the region of support for b. Then, where the (-&gt;k's are the basis functions and the r k ' s are the coefficients. If the size of D is finite (e.g., 5 x S), F D is finitedimensional (e.g., 25). A basis with good data compression properties is the one for the discrete cosine transform (DCT) <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>(a) shows the DCT basis for a 1-D blur filter of length 5. Since the 2-D DCT is a separable transform, each 2-D basis function is a product of two 1-D basis functions. To use the data compression property of the DCT, one can set the coefficients corresponding to high-frequency basis functions to zero, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4(b)</ref>. Another advantage of the DCT is that the symmetry conditions can be imposed easily by setting certain coefficients to zero, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4(b)</ref> where the 6-function and x = y . Similarly, other unwanted solutions might exist. In the spirit of regularization theory, further constraints (in addition to symmetry) might need to be imposed to overcome this problem. One approach is to restrict the blur filter to a particular family, e.g., the Gaussian blurs <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>.4 In this work, we proposed to use a more general smoothness constraint that restricts the functional form of the blur. This is done by adding the following constraint term to the Q-function [see ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>)]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">!il(b) = dollb11* + dlI/Vbll' + d211V2bl12.

This constraint is widely used in regularization techniques for inverse problems (e.g., see <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>Image restoration experiments were performed on both synthetic and real-world images. Synthetic images were used first to ensure correct implementation and to study the effect of various control parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Sytithetic ImagcJs</head><p>The algorithm of Section IV-E was used to restore a blurred and noisy corrupted 2-D ideal step. The original image is a 20 x 20 array whose first and second ten rows are -1 and +1, respectively, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5(a)</ref>. This synthetic image is then blurred by a 5 x 5 uniform blur [see Table <ref type="bibr">III (b)</ref>]. Realizations of zero-mean white Gaussian noise with variances of 0.0001 and 0.01, respectively, are added to the blurred image to generate two test images, referred to as T1 and T2 and shown in Figs. S(b) and 6(b), respectively. The signal-tonoise ratios (SNR's)' for these two test images are then about 40 and 20 dB, respectively (since the power of the original image is 1).</p><p>The mean-field-based EM algorithm is tested on T1 and T2. In all experiments, the initial estimate of the blur filter is set by using a normalized 5 x 5 Gaussian filter"' with 00 = 2. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref>, this filter has a sharp peak (not smooth). The initial value of the noise variance is set (arbitrarily) to 0. For the purpose of comparison, we also performed restoration using the true blur model parameters and noise variances (one E-step with the true parameters).</p><p>Parameter estimation and image restoration results on T1 are shown in Tables 11-111 and Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, respectively, along with control parameters. The pixels at the borders of the image (two pixels wide) are left the same (not restored), and are used as the boundary conditions for the mean field calculations. From these results. the following observations can be made. First, blur parameter estimates are quite good, even when the blur smoothness constraint is not enforced (XI = 0.0). Second, the edges of the step are sharpened significantly [to allow a more thorough assessment, we have printed out the numerical values of the restored synthetic image in Fig. <ref type="figure">S(e)</ref>], while the reduction in mean-square error (SNR) is about 3 / 8 or greater than 1/3. Third, restoration results obtained by the EM procedures are coniparable to those obtained by using true blur parameters.</p><p>Restoration results for T2 are presented in Tables IV-V and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">6</ref> in the same format. The nature of the results is quite similar to that of results for T1. The only addition is that the restoration is performed twice with A1 = 0.0 and A 1 = 0.025, respectively. The blur smoothness constraint improves the blur parameter estimates and the restoration results slightly (which are good without the constraint).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Real-World Image</head><p>In this part, the proposed algorithm is tested on a blurred and noisy version of the Lena image in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">7(a)</ref>. The degraded image, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">7</ref>(b), is generated by first blurring the Lena image by a 5 x 5 uniform blur, and then adding zero-mean white Gaussian noise with a variance of 27.34. It has an SNR of about 20 dB." The restoration results are shown in the rest of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">7</ref> and Tables VI-VI1 in a format that is similar to the "Successful results on blind restoration of the Lena image with 40 dB SNR can be found elsewhere <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>.</p><p>results on synthetic images. For the purpose of comparison, we have also included the restoration results obtained by a Wiener filter and <ref type="bibr">Jeng and Woods' program [5]</ref>. In both cases, the true blur parameters and noise variances are used. When the true blur parameters are used, the only difference between one Estep of our EM procedure and Jeng and Woods' program is that the former uses the mean field theory, while the latter uses simulated annealing. The Lena image seems more difficult to restore than the synthetic images in Section V-A, which is, of course, not surprising. We found that a nonzero (but small) XI is needed, that is, the blur smoothness constraint is needed. We also found it helpful to use a small A0 for blur parameter estimation, and then a larger AO for the final restoration.</p><p>The following observations can be made from the restoration results. First, when the blur parameters are known, the mean field theory approach provides restorations that are comparable to that of <ref type="bibr">Jeng and Woods' program [5]</ref> with less computation time (the E-step converges within ten update cycles or about SO min of CPU time on a Convex). Second, when the blur parameters are not known, the EM procedure provides good parameter estimates, and the restoration results are close to those obtained with known blur parameters. Finally, all results are visually more pleasing than the result of the Wiener filter which contains much ringing. However, the Wiener filter does provide the best MSE. Interestingly, the MSE obtained by one mean field E-step with known  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>There are two main contributions in this paper. First, the mean field theory is applied in the EM algorithm for blind image restoration where the original image is modeled by a coupled MRF. As a byproduct, a scheme for deriving mean field equations for line fields with more complex clique structures is developed. Second, the ideas for blur decomposition-compression and the blur smoothness constraint are studied for reducing the number of blur parameters to be estimated and for regularizing the blur parameter estimation process. The experimental results show that the parameter estimates are quite good, and the restoration results are comparable to that of <ref type="bibr">Jeng and Woods [5]</ref>, which is an effective technique when the image degradation model is known.</p><p>An important problem for future work is the estimation of the CGM parameters of the original image along with the blur parameters <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>. Another problem is that the computation time for the EM procedures is still too long for real-time processing or interactive restoration on a workstation or a multiuser computer such as the Convex. One solution is to use parallel processing [2Y]; another is to use multiresolution processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. ( 7 1 , ) in (Al).
