<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A sliver is a tetrahedron whose four vertices lie close to a plane and whose perpendicular projection to that plane is a convex quadrilateral with no short edge. Slivers axe both undesirable and ubiquitous in 3-dimensional Delaunay triangulations. Even when the point-set is well-spaced, slivers may result. This paper shows that such a point set permits a small perturbation whose Delaunay triangulation contains no slivers.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>a triangle or tetrahedron has the Ratio Property [~0] if its circumradius divided by the length of its shortest edge does not exceed #o. If the constant is either not important or clear from the context we will drop Qo from the notation. A mesh has the Ratio Property if all its triangles and tetrahedra have it, and a point set S has the Ratio Property if its Delaunay triangulation has it. The most common tetrahedral meshes are Delaunay triangulations. Given a finite set S C R 3 in general position, the Delaunay triangulation is the unique triangulation Del S that contains a tetrahedron iff all points other than the vertices of the tetrahedron lie outside the circumsphere of the tetrahedron. Fast algorithms for constructing Delaunay triangulations can be found in textbooks of computational geometry, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Algorithms that maintain Delaunay triangulations under point insertions until the mesh has the Ratio Property [#0] are given in <ref type="bibr">[10; 11; 12]</ref>. Previous work. The ubiquity of slivers in 3-dimensional Delaunay triangulations has been documented in Cavendish, Field and Frey <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Eliminating slivers seems difficult though, and most meshing algorithms based on Delannay triangulations can generate the Ratio Property but cannot guarantee the absence of slivers. Taimor <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> notes that even wellspaced points do not prevent slivers. The first positive result on slivers was an algorithm by Chew <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> that eliminates slivers by adding new points to generate a uniformly dense mesh. In a recent breakthrough, Cheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> showed how to assign weights to the points so that the weighted Delannay triangulation is free of slivers without adding new points. Similar to the method in this paper, their algorithm assumes that the input data has the Ratio Property <ref type="bibr">[~o]</ref>. The work in this paper is related to techniques that improve the quality of a mesh in a post-processing operation. The recently adopted terminology in mesh generation refers to such an operation as smoothing if only the embedding of the mesh is affected, and as clean-up if the mesh is altered through local changes in the connectivity. Among the most popular smoothing techniques are Laplacian <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and optimization-based smoothing <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Clean-up operations are usually coupled with smoothing techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Results. The main result of this paper is a mesh smoothing and clean-up algorithm that eliminates slivers without adding new points. Most slivers disappear after a mild perturbation of the point set. The remaining slivers migrate to the boundary where they can be peeled off or can be treated with boundary enforcement heuristics. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> we consider periodic sets of the form S = So + Z 3, where So C_ [0, 1) s is a set of n points in the half-open unit cube. The algorithm assumes the input Delaunay triangulation has the Ratio Property [~o] for a constant Qo &gt; 0. The algorithm achieves the improvement in time O(nlogn) with a single processor and in time O(logn) with O(nlogn) processors. The mathematical derivations needed to prove the algorithm correct owe their inspiration to the sliver exudation work of Cheng et aL <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The algorithm in this paper and its proof provide theoretical backing for the experimental observation that mesh smoothing combined with clean-up gives better results than either technique by itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Outline. Section 2 introduces perturbations and proves basic geometric results. Section 3 prepares the proof of the Sliver Theorem, which is presented in Section 4. Section 5 presents the algorithm that removes slivers by perturbing the points. Section 6 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">PRELIMINARIES</head><p>This section introduces perturbations and shows that many geometric properties are preserved after a mild perturbation. Linear relations. We adopt the notation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and call two real quantities X and Y linearly related, denoted as X ,~ Y, if there are constants c, C &gt; 0 with cX &lt; Y &lt; CX.</p><p>For a sample application of this concept consider a tetrahedron pqrs. Denote the volume ofpqrs by V and the length of the shortest edge by L. We use, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, a = a(pqrs) = v as a measure of shape quality of pqrs. Many types of tetrahedra can have small value of a, but only slivers can simultaneously have the Ratio Property and a small value of a. It is useful to relate this measure of shape quality with a distance to radius ratio defined for pqrs. Let D be the distance of point p to the plane passing through qrs, and let Y be the circumradius of qrs. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> illustrates these definitions.</p><p>As proved in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, we have c, D &lt; a &lt; Ct ~ for c, = 1/96Qo s</p></div>

Ifpqrs has the Ratio Property then D ,., Or.</p><p>Observe that the ratio D depends on the ordering of the vertices, and more specifically on which vertex is ordered first. The Quality Lemma implies that all four possible ratios are linearly related to a and therefore to each other.</p><p>Perturbation. Let S be a set of n points in R 3. A perturbation is a function ' : S -~ R 3. We denote the image of S by S' and the image of a point p E S by p'. The effect of a perturbation on S is quantified using a function N = Ns : R s --+ R that maps every point z E R s to the distance from x to the second closest point in S. For example, if z E S then the smallest distance is zero and N(z) = Ns(x) is the distance to the nearest neighbor. Note that N is continuous and Lipschitz with constant one, that is, IN(z) -N(y)I &lt;_ I[x -YlI. The impact of the perturbation is the smallest real number such that HP -P'II &lt;-~N(p) for every p E S. It follows that the sphere of radius ~oN(p) around p contains p'. In this paper we only consider mild perturbations with impact at most some constant ~0 &lt; -~.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RATIO, LENGTH, DEGREE</head><p>This section recalls a result of Talmor <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> and uses it to extend a result of Miller et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> from Delaunay triangulations to complexes formed by taking unions of Delaunay triangulations. Gap Property. It is convenient to denote a sphere with center z E R 3 and radius Z E R by the pair (z,Z). We call a sphere empty of points in S if it encloses none of the points of S. In other words, every point of S either lies on or outside the sphere. Given a constant ~0, we say S has the Gap Property [70] if every empty sphere has readius at most ~foN(z), where x is any point on the sphere. We prove that perturbations with small impact preserve the Gap Property. Specifically, we define ~ox = 1/(4"yo +2) and restrict ourselves to very mild perturbations whose impact is ~ &lt; 9~t.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GAP PRESERVATION LEMMA. If S has the Gap Property [7o]</head><p>and S' is the image of a very mild perturbation then there is a constant 7~ depending only on 70 such that S' has the Gap Property ['y~].</p><p>PROOF. Let x be a point and (z, Z) a sphere passing through</p><p>x that is empty of points in S'. We prove below that Z &lt; 7~N'(x), for 7o = 270 + 2 + 1/27o.

Then the line segment from x to z intersects the sphere (x, N(x)) in a point, which we denote as y.

Since S has the Gap Property [7o],</p><p>we have U &lt; 7oN(y), and because of the Lipschitz property we have ~foN(y) &lt; 27oN(x). Let p E S be a point on the sphere (u, U). Since p and y both lie on this sphere we have lip -yll -&lt; 2U &lt; 470N(x), and therefore</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">N(p) &lt; N(z) + lip -xll &lt; 2N(x) + lip-vii _&lt; (470 + 2)N(z) = N(x)/~,.</formula><p>The distance between p and its perturbed image p~ is therefore at most N(x). But since p~ lies on or outside (z, Z) by assumption, the radius of the sphere around u is U &gt; Union of triangulations. Next we consider a simplicial complex K obtained by mapping the Delaunay triangulation of very mild perturbations back to S. Specifically, a tetrahedron pqrs belongs to K if there is a very mild perturbation such that p'q~r's' is a tetrahedron in the Delaunay triangulation of S ~. The complex K furthermore contains all triangles, edges, vertices of these tetrahedra.</p></div>

We prove the claim for t/1 --Vo • 1-2~.i, the constant bound on the length variation tor a point set S ~ that has the Ratio Property <ref type="bibr">[Q~]</ref>. We simplify the argument by assuming the distance between p and its nearest neighbor in S is N(p) = 1. The Distance Lemma implies 1 -2~al &lt; N'(p') _&lt; 1 + 2~1. N'(p ~) is also the length of the shortest edge with endpoint p' in Del S'. The Ratio Preservation Lemma implies that S' has the Ratio Property [~], so there exists a constant upper bound t/~ on the length variation around p~. The length of the longest edge with endpoint p~ in DelS ~ is lip ~ -v~ll &lt; v~(1 + 2~1). The length of the corresponding edge in Del S is ]ip -vii &lt; v~ • ~1_2~1, which proves the claimed upper bound.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">SLIVER THEOREM</head><p>Sections 2 and 3 provide the technical prerequisites for the proof of the Sliver Theorem II, which motivates the algorithm for sliver removal presented in Section 5. We begin by studying conditions under which a perturbation creates slivers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Circles</head><p>and Tori. Let (z, Z) be the circumsphere of a tetrahedron pqrs and let (y, Y) be the circumcircle of the triangle qrs. Ifpqrs has the Ratio Property [~o~ then Z/2~0 &lt; Y &lt; Z. Call pqrs a sliver if a(pqrs) = ~ &lt; no, where ao &gt; 0 is a constant that we specify later. We now prove that if pqrs is a sliver, then the distance P from p to the closest point on the circle (y, Y) cannot be large. [] Forbidden regions. Keeping q, r, s fixed, the forbidden region Fqr, is the set of points p such that pqrs is a sliver and has the Ratio Property <ref type="bibr">[Q~]</ref>. By the Torus Lemma, Fqr~ is contained in the solid torus of points at distance at most P from the circle (y,Y), as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>.

The number II differentiates the following result from the theorem with the same name in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SLIVER THEOREM II. If S has the Ratio Property [g0] then</head><p>there is a constant ~o &gt; 0 and a very mild perturbation with ~r _~ ~0 for all tetrahedra in Del S ~.</p><p>PROOF. We establish the result for the constant</p><p>We determine the image of each point in some fixed but arbitrary sequence. While considering p E S, we keep the locations of all other points fixed. The image / of p is chosen inside the sphere with center p and radius ~,N(p) and outside the forbidden regions Fqr~ for all triangles qrs that form a tetrahedron with p in K. To prove that such a point exists, we show that the inside of the sphere is not covered by the forbidden regions, as suggested by Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. This is done by comparing the volume of that inside with the sum of volumes of the forbidden regions. By the Forbidden Volume Lemma, each triangle qrs defines a forbidden region with volume at most CsNS~p). The Degree Lemma implies that there are fewer than 6~ triangles qrs. The volume covered by the forbidden regions is therefore less than 63CsNS(p).</p><p>With ~0 as defined above, this is less than the volume of the inside of the sphere, which is ~ • ~a~NS(p).</p><p>[]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">ALGORITHM</head><p>The proof of the Sliver Theorem II is constructive and implies an algorithm that computes the perturbation whose existence is asserted by the theorem. That algorithm assumes the set S = So + Z s has the Ratio Property <ref type="bibr">[go]</ref>. It consists of three steps:</p><p>1. computing the union complex K of S, 2. perturbing the points in So to get S' = S~ + Z 3, 3. constructing the Delannay triangulation of S'.</p><p>Since S contains infinitely many points, we can of course not compute K explicitly, but we can compute a piece that determines the rest by translation along integer vectors. The same applies to computing the Delannay triangulation of S ~. Computing K is difficult, but we can efficiently construct a complex K ~ that contains K as a subcomplex. For every point p E S, the new complex K ~ contains all edges, triangles, and tetrahedra that connect p with all points q E S at distance at most viN(p) from p. The Length Variation Lemma implies K C_ K r. The volume argument proving the Degree Lemma still applies and proves a constant upper bound on the maximum vertex degree in K ~. Each tetrahedron sharing p defines a forbidden region, which we represent by the containing torus described in the Torus Lemma. Since there is only a constant number of tori, we can find in constant time a point pt inside the sphere with center p and radius ~olN(p) and outside all tori.</p><p>Using the divide-and-conquer algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the complex K r for n points can be computed in time O(nlog n) with one processor and in time O(n~°-~--~ ~) with k &lt; n processors. The single processor version implies an O(nlogn) time implementation of the entire algorithm. For the parallel version, we also need to perturb the points in parallel. This can be done by coloring the vertices of K' with a constant number of colors such that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color. A whole color class of points is then perturbed concurrently, which leads to a parallel implementation of the r3¢n~°gn~ using k &lt; n procesalgorithm that runs in time v~ k J sors. The algorithm sketched above is probably too complicated to have any practical relevance. To simplify, we would have to eliminate Step 1, as in the weight assignment algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. There is however a subtle difference between increasing the weight of a point p and moving p to a new location pl: in the former case all new simplices share p while in the latter case the motion may create tetrahedra connecting vertices all different from p. Moving p might introduce a sliver connecting other points, and if these other points are already perturbed images of original points, then we need to backtrack to repair the damage, which takes time. We leave the formulation of an efficient deterministic algorithm that avoids the construction of g as an open question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">DISCUSSION</head><p>Inspired by the sliver exudation method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, this paper shows that slivers in a 3-dimensional Delaunay triangulation with the Ratio Property can be removed by a small perturbation of the points. One serious drawback of the current result are the pessimistic estimates of the constants used to express it. These constants are either too large or too small for the results to have any practical significance. The most serious deterioration of the constant estimates happens in the transition from the Ratio Property to the degree bound in the Degree Lemma. It might be worthwhile to design algorithms that permit a direct analysis of vertex degrees.</p><p>An example of such an algorithm is the biting method of Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, which produces a mesh from a sphere covering. Alternatively, we may gain insights by experimenting with an implementation of the algorithm and measuring its average and worst-case performance. Another drawback is that the result holds only sufficiently fox from the domain boundary, if any. It would be interesting to extend the method to include possibly constrained perturbations of points on the boundary of a meshed domain. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: The solid spheres are empty of points in S and the dashed sphere is empty of points in S ~.</figDesc></figure>

This implies Z &lt; U+N(x), and by the N Lemma, Z &lt; (27o + 1)N(x) 270 + 1 (270 + 2 + ~o)Y'(x), which proves the claim. [] Ratio Property. Talmor proves that if S has the Ratio Property [Qo] then there is a constant V0 depending only on Q0 such that S has the Gap Property [Vo]. The bound on the constant ~'o is rather pessimistic but it exists. Symmetrically, Talmor proves that if S ~ has the Gap Property [~] then there is a constant 0~ depending only on -),~ such that S' has the Ratio Property [#~]. In short, a finite set has the Ratio Property iff it has the Gap Property. Together with the Gap Preservation Lemma this implies that very mild perturbations also preserve the Ratio Property.

If S has the Ratio Property [#o] and S' is the image of a very mild perturbation then there is a constant #~ depending only on #o such that S ~ has the Ratio Property [#~].</figDesc></figure>
