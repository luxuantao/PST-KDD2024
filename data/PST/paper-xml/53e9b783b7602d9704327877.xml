<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A rational agent can express claims and judgements, aiming at reaching a decision, a conclusion, or informing, convincing, negotiating with other agents. Pertinent information may be insufficient or contrastedly there may be too much relevant but partially incoherent information. And, in case of multi-agent interaction, conflicts of interest are inevitable. So, agents can be assisted by argumentation, a process based on three steps: the exchange of arguments, the valuation of interacting arguments, and the definition of the most acceptable of these arguments.</p><p>Argumentation has been applied in various domains and applications such as plausible inference from inconsistent knowledge bases, decision making and negotiation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>).</p><p>In most existing argumentation frameworks, only one kind of interaction, the conflict, is considered between arguments. It is represented by the so-called defeat relation. For example, an argument can take the form of a pair (set of premises, conclusion), where the set of premises entails the conclusion according to some logical inference schema. Then, the defeat interaction occurs between arguments in favour of and arguments against a given proposition.</p><p>However, recent studies on argumentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> have shown that another kind of interaction may exist between the arguments. Indeed, an argument can support another argument. It is the case for instance if an agent gives an argument which confirms a premise used by an argument provided by another agent.</p><p>Both relations, defeat and support, are assumed to be independent (i.e., the support relation is not defined in terms of the defeat relation, and vice-versa).</p><p>So, we obtain a bipolar representation of the interactions between arguments. Bipolarity refers to the existence of two independent kinds of information which have a diametrically opposed nature and which represent repellent forces.</p><p>The notion of bipolarity is essential in order to represent realistic knowledge (see discussions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>). For instance, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, two kinds of preferences are distinguished: positive preferences (what the agent really wants) and negative preferences (what the agent rejects). This distinction between positive and negative preferences is supported by studies in cognitive psychology which have shown that these two types of preferences are independent and processed separately in the mind. However, bipolarity is not always related to the notion of preference.</p><p>Abstracting from the structure of the arguments, our purpose is to revisit the concept of acceptability on the basis of the two kinds of interaction. So, we propose to extend the basic abstract argumentation framework proposed by Dung <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, by taking into account two independent relations: a defeat relation and a support relation. This new framework will be called an abstract bipolar argumentation framework. Then, following Dung's methodology, we establish characteristic properties that a set of arguments must satisfy in order to be an output of the argumentation process. Such a set of arguments must be in some sense coherent and must enable to win a dispute.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly presents the argumentation process as well as the abstract framework proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Section 3 describes the bipolar extension of Dung's framework. In Section 4, we propose new semantics for acceptability. Section 5 is devoted to some concluding remarks and further issues. Proofs are omitted for lack of space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background on Argumentation Systems</head><p>An argumentation process follows three steps:</p><p>1. the exchange of arguments: the notion of argument commonly refers to the concepts of explanation, justification, or proof. Arguments aim to justify beliefs or decisions. They can take the form of a piece of text or discourse, by which one tries to convince the reader that a given claim is true, or they can be seen as a logical proof of a claim. Formally, arguments are built around an underlying representation language. Different basic forms of arguments can be encountered, depending on the language and on the rules for constructing arguments. Moreover, arguments formed from a knowledge base cannot be considered independently. Indeed most of the arguments are in interaction: arguments may be conflicting or on the contrary, arguments may support other arguments. 2. the valuation of interacting arguments: the basic idea is to assign a weight to each argument, in order to make comparisons between arguments. This weight represents the way in which an argument is enforced, or weakened by other arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</p><p>3. selecting the most acceptable arguments: it is necessary to define the status of arguments on the basis of all the ways in which they interact. As an output of the argumentation system, the best arguments must be identified. Beliefs, goals or decisions in favour of which such arguments exist are really justified. Contrastedly, beliefs, goals and decisions relying upon rejected arguments will be discarded. Most often, acceptability is collective in the sense that sets of arguments are proved acceptable if they satisfy particular properties. Different kinds of properties define different semantics for acceptability.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Dung has proposed an abstract framework for argumentation in which he focuses only on the definition of the status of arguments. For that purpose, he supposes that a set of arguments is given, as well as the different conflicts between them.</p><p>We briefly recall that abstract framework:</p><p>An argumentation framework is a pair &lt;A, R def &gt; of a set A of arguments and a binary relation R def on A called a defeat relation. A i R def A j means that A i defeats A j (or A j is defeated by A i ). An argumentation framework may be represented by a directed graph, called the interaction graph, whose nodes are arguments and edges represent the defeat relation. The notion of defence is defined from the notion of defeat by: an argument</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A i defends A j against B iff BR def A j and A i R def B.</formula><p>In Dung's framework, the acceptability of an argument depends on its membership of some sets, called acceptable sets or extensions. These extensions are characterised by particular properties. It is a collective acceptability. The main characteristic properties are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Conflict-free: a subset S of A is conflict-free iff there exist no A i , A j in S such that A i R def A j . Defends collectively: a subset S of A defends collectively an argument A i iff for each argument B, if BR def A i there exists C in S such that CR def B.</formula><p>Then several semantics for acceptability have been defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>: Let &lt;A, R def &gt; be an argumentation framework.</p><p>Admissible: a subset S of A is an admissible set iff S is conflict-free and S defends collectively all its elements. Preferred : a subset S of A is a preferred extension of &lt;A, R def &gt; iff S is maximal for the set inclusion among the admissible sets of A. Stable: a subset S of A is a stable extension of &lt;A, R def &gt; iff S is conflict-free and S defeats each argument which does not belong to S.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Grounded : a subset S of A is the grounded extension of &lt;A, R def &gt; iff S is the least fixed point of the characteristic function of &lt;A, R def &gt; (F : 2 &lt;A,R def &gt; → 2 &lt;A,R def &gt; with F (S) = {A such that S defends collectively A}).</formula><p>The previous notions are illustrated on the following example.</p><p>Example 1. A murder has been performed and the suspects are Liz, Mary and Peter. The following pieces of information have been gathered:</p><p>The type of murder suggests us that the killer is a female. The killer is certainly small. Liz is tall and Mary and Peter are small. The killer has long hair and uses a lipstick. A witness claims that he saw the killer who was tall. Moreover, we are told that the witness is short-sighted, so he is no more reliable.</p><p>We use the following propositional symbols: s (the killer is small), f (the killer is a female), m (the killer is Mary), l (the killer has long hair and uses a lipstick), w (the witness is reliable), b (the witness is short-sighted).</p><p>So the following arguments can be formed:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">A 1 in favour of m, with premises {s, f, (s ∧ f ) → m} A 2 in favour of ¬s, with premises {w, w → ¬s} A 3 in favour of ¬w, with premises {b, b → ¬w} A 4 in favour of f , with premises {l, l → f } A 3 defeats A 2 which defeats A 1 . So A 3 defends A 1 against A 2 : A3 A2 A1</formula><p>Note that a defeat edge is represented by a crossed arrow on the interaction graph.</p><p>3 Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Bipolarity and Interaction</head><p>As already said, due for instance to the presence of inconsistency in knowledge bases, arguments may be conflicting. These conflicts are captured by the defeat relation in an argumentation system, and may be considered as negative interactions. Then, the concept of defence has been introduced in order to reinstate some of the defeated arguments, namely those whose defeaters are in turn defeated. So, most logical theories of argumentation assume that if an argument A 3 defends an argument A 1 against an argument A 2 , then A 3 is a kind of support for A 1 . The fact that A 3 defends A 1 may be considered as a positive interaction.</p><p>In the basic abstract argumentation framework recalled in Section 2, only negative interaction is explicitly represented by the defeat relation, and positive interaction is represented through the notion of defence. So, support and defeat are dependent notions. It is a parsimonious strategy, but it is not a correct description of the process of argumentation in realistic examples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 1 (continued). Consider the argument</head><formula xml:id="formula_4">A 4 in favour of f, with premises {l, l → f }. A 4 confirms the premise f of A 1 . So, A 4 strengthens A 1 .</formula><p>Contrastedly, A 3 defends A 1 against A 2 means that A 3 weakens the attack on A 1 brought by A 2 . So, on one side, A 1 gets a support and on the other side A 1 suffers a weakened defeat.</p><p>So, we need a more powerful tool than the abstract argumentation framework proposed by Dung, in order to formalize situations where two independent kinds of interactions are available: a negative (which modelizes the conflicts) and a positive one (which is not a simple defence). Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, we propose a new framework: an abstract bipolar argumentation framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">An Abstract Bipolar Argumentation Framework</head><p>An abstract bipolar argumentation framework is an extension of the basic abstract argumentation framework introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> in which we use a new kind of interaction between arguments represented by the support<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> relation<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . This new relation is assumed to be totally independent of the defeat relation (i.e. it is not defined using the defeat relation). So, we have a bipolar representation of the interactions between arguments. </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">A j ∈ A, A i R def A j (resp. A i R sup A j ) means that A i defeats A j (resp. A i supports A j ).</formula><p>A bipolar argumentation framework can still be represented by a directed graph, with two kinds of edges, one for the defeat relation and another one for the support relation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Notations: Consider A, B ∈ A, AR def B is represented by A → B and AR sup B is represented by A → B. &lt;A, R def , R sup &gt; defines a directed graph G b called the bipolar interaction graph.</formula><p>Example 1 (continued). A 4 supports A 1 and the bipolar graph is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">A3 A2 A1</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A4</head><p>In the following, we abstract from the structure of the arguments and we consider arbitrary independent relations R def and R sup . Moreover, we assume that the bipolar interaction graph is acyclic.</p><p>Definition 2 (Graphical representation of a bipolar argumentation framework). Let G b be the bipolar interaction graph associated with the abstract bipolar argumentation framework &lt;A, R def , R sup &gt;, we define: A leaf of G b is an argument A ∈ A such that no argument defeats A and no argument supports A.</p><p>A path from A to B is a sequence of arguments</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P = A 1 -. . . -A n such that A = A 1 , A 1 R 1 A 2 , . . . , A n-1 R n-1 A n , A n = B, and ∀i = 1, . . . , n -1, R i = R def or R sup .</formula><p>In order to define acceptability in bipolar abstract argumentation frameworks, we propose to follow Dung's methodology and to use the notion of defence which enables to capture reinstatement. So, first, we generalize the key concept of defeat between two arguments, by combining a sequence of supports with a direct defeat:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 3 (Supported and indirect defeat).</head><p>A supported defeat for an argument B is a sequence <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_9">A 1 R 1 . . .

The following graph represents a bipolar argumentation system. Taking into account sequences of supports and defeats leads to the following definitions applying to sets of arguments:</p><p>Definition 4 (Set-defeat and set-support). Let S ⊆ A, let A ∈ A. S set-defeats A iff there exists a supported defeat or an indirect defeat for A from an element of S.</p><p>S set-supports A iff there exists a sequence of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">A 1 R 1 . . . R n-1 A n , n ≥ 2, such that ∀i = 1 . . . n -1, R i = R sup with A n = A and A 1 ∈ S.</formula><p>The notation "set-defeat" and "set-support" means that the defeat and the support relations apply to sets of arguments. 4 Acceptability in a Bipolar Framework In Dung's framework, the acceptability of an argument depends on its membership of some sets, called acceptable sets or extensions. These extensions are characterised by particular properties. It is a collective acceptability. Following Dung's methodology, we establish characteristic properties that a set of arguments must satisfy in order to be an output of the argumentation process, in a bipolar framework. We recall that such a set of arguments must be in some sense coherent and must enable to win a dispute. Maximality for set-inclusion is also often required. In the following, we first investigate the notion of coherence. Then, we propose new semantics for acceptability in bipolar argumentation frameworks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Managing the Conflicts</head><p>In the basic argumentation framework, whatever the considered semantics, selected acceptable sets of arguments are constrained to be coherent in the sense that they must be conflict-free. In a bipolar argumentation framework, the concept of coherence can be extended:</p><p>reusing the notion of conflict-free set enforces a kind of internal coherence: we do not accept a set S of arguments which set-defeats one of its elements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Set S Set S Set S</head><p>taking into account the support relation leads to define a kind of external coherence: we do not accept a set S of arguments which set-defeats and set-supports the same argument.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Set S Set S</head><p>Consider &lt;A, R def , R sup &gt; a bipolar argumentation framework. Note that the notion of safe set is powerful enough to encompass the notion of conflict-free. We have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Property 1. Let S ⊆ A. If S is safe, then S is conflict-free.</formula><p>If S is conflict-free and closed for R sup then S is safe.</p><p>Example 2 (continued). The set {G, H, I, E} is conflict-free and closed for R sup . So it is safe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Extensions</head><p>From the previous notions of coherence, and extending the propositions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, we can propose different new semantics for the acceptability.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Definition 8 (Stable extension). Let &lt;A, R def , R sup &gt;. Let S ⊆ A. S is a stable extension of &lt;A, R def , R sup &gt; iff S is conflict-free and ∀A ∈ S, S set- defeats A.</formula><p>In this paper, we only consider acyclic bipolar frameworks, in the sense that the associated interaction graph is acyclic. In Dung's basic framework, it has been proved that, in the case of an acyclic defeat graph, there is always a unique stable extension, which is also the unique preferred extension, and the grounded extension. So, Definition 8 ensures the existence of a unique stable extension in an acyclic bipolar argumentation framework<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">8</ref> .</p><p>However, the unique stable extension is not always safe.</p><p>Example 3. Consider the argumentation system defined by A = {A, B, H}, H R def B and A R sup B. The set {A, H} is the unique stable extension, and it is not safe.</p><p>So, an acyclic bipolar argumentation framework may have no safe stable extension. Indeed, the following properties enable to characterize stable extensions.</p><p>Property 2. Let S be a stable extension. If S is safe, then S is closed for R sup .</p><p>As a consequence of the two previous properties, we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Consequence 1. Let S be a stable extension of &lt;A, R def , R sup &gt;. Then S safe iff S is closed for R sup .</formula><p>Now, we are interested in the preferred semantics, which is based on the concept of defence. As in the basic case, we first investigate the concept of admissibility, and then extensions will be defined as maximal (for set-inclusion) admissible sets of arguments. Three different definitions for admissibility can be given, from the most general one to the most specific one. First, a direct translation of Dung's definition gives the definition of d-admissibility 9 .</p><p>Definition 9 (d-admissible set). Let S ⊆ A. S is d-admissible iff S is conflictfree and defends all its elements.</p><p>Taking into account external coherence leads to s-admissibility 10 . Definition 10 (s-admissible set). Let S ⊆ A. S is s-admissible iff S is safe and defends all its elements.</p><p>Finally, external coherence can be strengthened by requiring that an admissible set is closed for R sup . So, we obtain the definition of c-admissibility 11 .</p><p>Definition 11 (c-admissible set) Let S ⊆ A. S is c-admissible iff S is conflictfree, closed for R sup and defends all its elements. From all the previous results, it follows that each c-admissible set is s-admissible, and each s-admissible set is d-admissible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 12 (Preferred extension).</head><p>A set S ⊆ A is a d-preferred (resp. spreferred, c-preferred) extension iff S is maximal (for set-inclusion) among the d-admissible (resp. s-admissible, c-admissible) subsets of A.</p><p>Example 3 (continued). The set {A, H} is the unique d-preferred extension. There are two s-preferred extensions {A} and {H}. And there is only one cpreferred extension {H}.</p><p>Example 2 (continued). The set {G, H, E, F } is s-admissible, but not cadmissible. The set {G, H, I, E, F, D, J} is the unique c-preferred extension.</p><p>One of the main issues with regard to extensions concerns their existence. As said above for stable extensions, the definition of d-admissibility ensures the existence of a unique d-preferred extension in an acyclic bipolar argumentation framework. It is also the unique stable extension.</p><p>The existence of s-preferred (resp. c-preferred) extensions is guaranteed since the empty set is c-admissible. Moreover, the following results enable to characterize s-preferred and c-preferred extensions.</p><p>Property 3. Let S be the unique stable extension of &lt;A, R def , R sup &gt;.</p><p>1. The s-preferred extensions and the c-preferred extensions are subsets of S. 2. Each s-preferred extension which is closed for R sup is also a c-preferred extension. 3. If S is safe, then S is the unique c-preferred extension and also the unique s-preferred extension. 4. If A is finite, each c-preferred extension is included in a s-preferred extension. 5. If S is not safe, the s-preferred extensions are the subsets of S which are maximal (for set-inclusion) s-admissible. 6. If S is not safe, and A is finite, there is only one c-preferred extension.</p><p>Example 3 (continued). {H} is the only s-preferred extension which is also closed for R sup . So, {H} is the unique c-preferred extension. If we add an isolated argument A 3 (for which no interaction exists with the other arguments of the system), then we obtain: {A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , H} is the only d-preferred extension. {A 1 , A 2 , A 3 } and {H, A 3 } are the only two s-preferred extensions. None of them is closed, and {A 3 } is the unique c-preferred extension.</p><p>The above discussion enables to draw the following conclusions. In the particular case of an acyclic finite bipolar argumentation framework, two semantics present nice features: the stable semantics and the c-preferred semantics. If we are interested in internal coherence only, we will have to determine the unique stable extension, which is also the unique d-preferred extension and the grounded semantics. If we are interested in a more constrained concept of coherence, we will choose the c-preferred semantics, for which there also exists only one c-preferred extension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have presented a study of the concept of acceptability in bipolar argumentation frameworks. Following Dung's approach, we have abstracted from the structure of the arguments and proposed a general framework for argumentation, where two kinds of interaction can occur: arguments can be conflicting, or arguments can support other arguments. We have emphasized the idea that support and defeat can be independent relations, contrastedly with classical argumentation frameworks where support between arguments is captured by a notion of defence. Taking into account both relations has enabled us to propose new types of interaction between arguments: a sequence of supports, a direct defeat, an indirect defeat and a supported defeat.</p><p>Then, we have considered collective acceptability in our new abstract bipolar argumentation framework. Collective means that we have established characteristic properties that a set of arguments must satisfy in order to be an output of the argumentation process. It is natural to require a kind of coherence, and a kind of maximality as done in classical frameworks. Other properties, such as admissibility, take into account different levels of conflict, namely the existence of defeaters against defeaters.</p><p>First, we have investigated the notion of coherence and we have brought to light two kinds of coherence: internal vs external coherence. Internal coherence ensures that the considered set of arguments is conflict-free. External coherence is captured by the notion of safe set and ensures that the considered set cannot simultaneously defeat and support a same argument.</p><p>Then, combining a coherence requirement with the classical notion of admissibility, we have proposed new semantics for acceptability of sets of arguments. In particular, we have generalized the well-known stable and preferred semantics. Interesting properties have been obtained in the case of an acyclic bipolar argumentation framework. One of them states the existence of extensions. Moreover, one of the new semantics guarantees the existence of a new extension, which is a nice feature, regarding computational issues. Future works will be mainly devoted to: a thorough study of the new semantics, including computational issues. the investigation of new characteristic properties such as for instance a generalization of "being closed for R sup ". We are interested in sets S of arguments which are closed for R sup and which contain any argument supporting an argument of S. Our idea is to define a meta argumentation system over such sets of arguments.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>J</head><label></label><figDesc>The paths in the graph A-B -C -D and E -C correspond to supported defeats.
