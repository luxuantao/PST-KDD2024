<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A discontinuous Galerkin finite element method has been developed to treat the high-order spatial derivatives appearing in the Cahn-Hilliard equation. The Cahn-Hilliard equation is a fourth-order nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation, originally proposed to model phase segregation of binary alloys. The developed discontinuous Galerkin approach avoids the need for mixed finite element methods, coupled equations or interpolation functions with a high degree of continuity that have been employed in the literature to treat the fourth-order spatial derivatives. The variational formulation of the discontinuous Galerkin method, its implementation and numerical examples are presented. In this communication, it is also shown under what conditions the method is stable, and an error estimate in an energy-type norm is presented. The method is evaluated by comparison with a standard finite element treatment in which the Cahn-Hilliard equation is decomposed into two coupled partial differential equations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Originally derived for phase segregation of a binary alloy system, the Cahn-Hilliard equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> has been applied to a wide range of problems, including multiphase fluid flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, image processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and planet formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Additionally, viewing a single-species solid as a binary atom-vacancy mixture, the formation of void lattices has been modelled as a process of vacancy segregation by the Cahn-Hilliard treatment coupled with elastic effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. These are just a few representative examples of a vast body of literature on applications of the Cahn-Hilliard equation. Numerical solution techniques for the Cahn-Hilliard equation have spanned finite difference methods, spectral formulations and finite element methods. In this paper, the focus is on finite element methods. Previous finite element formulations have focused on the case wherein the Cahn-Hilliard equation has been rewritten as a coupled system of two partial differential equations (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>). In Bansch et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> surface diffusion is treated by decomposing the governing fourth-order equation into a system of four partial differential equations, of which two are second-order and the remaining are zeroth-order. Also of interest is Ubachs et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, where the concentration gradient-dependent free-energy, which forms the basis of the Cahn-Hilliard model, is replaced with a nonlocal free-energy. The resulting problem consists of two coupled second-order partial equations, which are solved using the standard Galerkin finite element method. In contrast stand the works of Elliott and Zheng <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, in which a conforming C 1 finite element method was examined, and Elliott and French <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, who used a non-conforming finite element method, inspired by mixed methods for thin plate problems.</p><p>The decomposition of the Cahn-Hilliard equation into two second-order partial differential equations follows the classical approach for the treatment of high-order differential equations using mixed finite element methods (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> for an overview). It avoids difficulties with the representation of high-order derivatives across element boundaries. Specifically, C 0 interpolations can be applied. Here, an alternate approach is followed in which a discontinuous Galerkin formulation is proposed which avoids the need for C 1 basis functions and allows the use of standard C 0 finite element shape functions. The standard weak form of the Cahn-Hilliard equation contains spatial derivatives up to and including order two in both the trial and weighting functions. A naive implementation with standard C 0 interpolations leads to terms involving the multiplication of Dirac-Delta functions on inter-element edges. Such terms are meaningless, even in a distributional sense. Instead of grappling with these difficulties, we aim to lay down a weak form that allows, at the outset, for fields in which the first derivative is discontinuous across element boundaries, but is consistent with the governing Cahn-Hilliard equation. This is achieved by the definition of suitable flux terms involving the normal derivatives across element boundaries in the weak form.</p><p>The proposed approach for the Cahn-Hilliard equation is inspired by works on discontinuous Galerkin methods for second-order elliptic equations, known as the 'interior penalty method', early examples of which can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. These methods were developed largely separate from discontinuous Galerkin methods for first-order hyperbolic equations and discontinuous Galerkin methods in time. While discontinuous Galerkin methods for advection problems became well-accepted and proved to be effective, work on discontinuous Galerkin methods for elliptic problems was largely dormant. A wish to treat advective and diffusive terms using the same basis functions lead to a recent resurgence in interest for discontinuous Galerkin methods for elliptic problems. Overviews of works on discontinuous Galerkin methods for elliptic problems and extensive literature surveys can be found in Arnold et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and Engel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The approach followed here is a natural extension of recent work on discontinuous Galerkin formulations for fourth-order elliptic problems in structural mechanics (thin beam and plate theories) and strain gradient elasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and strain gradient damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</p><p>The organisation of the paper is as follows: The Cahn-Hilliard equation is introduced in Section 2 and discontinuous and mixed Galerkin formulations are presented in Section 3. The numerical implementation of the discontinuous Galerkin formulation is discussed in Section 4, along with a conventional mixed finite element formulation. Numerical examples are solved in Section 5 to compare the discontinuous Galerkin and conventional formulations. Conclusions and a discussion in Section 6 complete the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The strong form of the Cahn-Hilliard equation</head><p>Consider a binary mixture and let the concentration of one of its constituents, say A, be denoted by c satisfying 0 &lt; c &lt; 1. The composition of the other constituent, B, is 1 À c. Pure phases are obtained for c = 0 and c = 1. Let the mixture occupy an open, simply connected region in space, X &amp; R d , where d = 1, 2 or 3. The boundary of X is supposed to be sufficiently smooth, and is denoted by C = oX, with outward unit normal n. Further, let</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C ¼ C g [ C s ¼ C q [ C r , where C g \ C s = C q \ C r = ;</formula><p>. Mass transport in the mixture is governed by a parabolic partial differential supplemented by initial and boundary conditions. In strong form we have the following problem: find c :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">X Â ½0; T ! R such that c ;t ¼ r Á ðMrðl c À kr 2 cÞÞ in X Â ð0; T Þ; ð1Þ c ¼ g on C g Â ð0; T Þ;<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">Mkrc Á n ¼ q on C q Â ð0; T Þ;<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">Mkr 2 c ¼ r on C r Â ð0; T Þ;<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">Mrðl c À kr 2 cÞ Á n ¼ s on C s Â ð0; T Þ;<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">cðx; 0Þ ¼ c 0 ðxÞ in X:<label>ð6Þ</label></formula><p>Here, M &gt; 0 is known as the mobility, l c is the chemical potential of a regular solution in the absence of phase interfaces (a uniform solution, which may be interpreted as a solution in which c is spatially constant) and is a function of c, and k &gt; 0 is a constant that determines the magnitude of interface free-energy in the presence of a given concentration gradient. Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>) are boundary conditions on the concentration and its normal derivative, respectively. The less familiar Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>) is effectively a boundary condition on a component of the total potential, as will be clarified below, while Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>) is the flux boundary condition. While the boundary conditions have been presented in a general form, the condition $c AE n = 0 on C was assumed in the original derivation of the Cahn-Hilliard equation. To be consistent with the thermodynamic derivation of the equation, C q = C and q = 0 is required.</p><p>In the following sections, two cases for the scalar M are considered. In the first, M = D where D is the diffusivity and is constant. In the second case, the mobility is dependent on the concentration. The commonly adopted relationship</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">M ¼ Dcð1 À cÞ;<label>ð7Þ</label></formula><p>in which D is again constant, is used. This relationship restricts diffusion processes primarily to the interfacial zones, and is commonly known as 'degenerate mobility'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remarks</head><p>(1) Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>) are the appropriate boundary conditions only for k &gt; 0. If k = 0, only (2) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>) are of relevance.</p><p>(2) The problem as posed is nonlinear due to the composition-dependent mobility M, and the nonlinearity in chemical potential l c .</p><p>The Cahn-Hilliard equation is derived by considering additive contributions to the total free-energy W from a chemical term W c and a surface free-energy term W s . A potential l c is given by the functional derivative of the chemical free-energy with respect to the concentration, D c W c , and it is assumed that diffusion is driven by gradients in the total potential. Here, the chemical free-energy of a solution is considered to be given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_7">W c ¼ NkT ðc ln c þ ð1 À cÞ lnð1 À cÞÞ þ N xcð1 À cÞ;<label>ð8Þ</label></formula><p>where N is the number of molecules per unit volume, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature and x is a parameter related to the mixing enthalpy that determines the shape of W c . For x &gt; 2kT, the chemical free energy is non-convex, with two wells which drives phase segregation into the two binodal points. For x 6 2kT it has a single well and admits a single phase only. A typical function for the chemical free-energy for the non-convex case is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>According to the original model of Cahn and Hilliard <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, the surface free energy is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">W s ¼ 1 2 krc Á rc:<label>ð9Þ</label></formula><p>It is this term which leads to the fourth-order derivatives in the Cahn-Hilliard equation. Details of the derivation of the standard Cahn-Hilliard equation can be found in various references <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. The parameters for the numerical examples in Section 5 will be given in dimensionless form. Consider therefore a length scale L 0 , which is representative of the size of the domain X, and time scale T 0 ¼ L 4 0 =Dk. Relevant dimensionless quantities, denoted with an asterisk, are given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">t H ¼ t=T 0 ; x H ¼ x=L 0 ; l H c ¼ l c L 2 0 =k:<label>ð10Þ</label></formula><p>Using these, the dimensionless counterpart of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_46">1</ref>) is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">c ;t H ¼ r H Á br H ðl H c À r H2 cÞ;<label>ð11Þ</label></formula><p>where b is a dimensionless term reflecting the nature of the mobility. In the case of constant mobility b = 1, and in case of degenerate mobility b = c(1 À c).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Galerkin finite element formulations</head><p>In this section, the proposed discontinuous Galerkin formulation is presented. For the later comparison of numerical results, a conventional mixed formulation is also summarised. To this end, we introduce a partition of X into n el open sets, X e , each with boundary C e = oX e :</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">X ¼ [ n el e¼1 X e ; such that \ n el e¼1 X e ¼ ;:<label>ð12Þ</label></formula><p>We will also use the following terminology in the discontinuous Galerkin formulation:</p><p>The union of inter-element boundaries and the boundary C q :</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">e C ¼ [ n el e¼1 C e !- C r ;<label>ð13Þ</label></formula><p>which can also be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">e C ¼ [ ni i¼1 C i :<label>ð14Þ</label></formula><p>where C i is an element edge, excluding those which are part of C r , and n i is the number of edges which are not part of C r . The union of element interiors:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">e X ¼ [ n el e¼1 X e :<label>ð15Þ</label></formula><p>The jump operator on a vector: where the subscripts refer to the face of the element on either side of each inter-element boundary, and n is the unit outward normal to an element boundary.

The jump and average operators operate at boundaries only.</p><p>We also make repeated use of the standard notation for L 2 -inner products:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">ðu; vÞ W ¼ Z W uv dW:<label>ð20Þ</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Discontinuous Galerkin formulation</head><p>Let c h 2 S h be the finite dimensional approximation of the concentration field, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">S h ¼ fc h jc h 2 H 1 ðXÞ; c h 2 P k ðX e Þ 8e; c h ¼ g on C g g;<label>ð21Þ</label></formula><p>with P k (X e ) being the space of the standard polynomial finite element shape functions on element X e where k is the polynomial order. It has been assumed implicitly that g comes from a space such that it can be represented exactly by the finite element basis functions. Let w h 2 V h be the finite dimensional weighting function, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">V h ¼ fw h jw h 2 H 1 ðXÞ; w h 2 P k ðX e Þ 8e; w h ¼ 0 on C g g:<label>ð22Þ</label></formula><p>Note that these function spaces possess less regularity than would be required in a conventional formulation for the Cahn-Hilliard equation. A conventional Galerkin formulation would seek solutions in a subspace of H 2 (X), rather than in subspaces of H 1 (X). An approximate solution to the Cahn-Hilliard equation then involves: find c h 2 S h • [0, T] such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">ðw h ; c h ;t Þ X þ ðrw h ; M h rl h c Þ X þ ðr 2 w h ; M h kr 2 c h Þ X þ ðrw h ; ðrM h Þkr 2 c h Þ X À ðsrw h t; hM h kr 2 c h iÞ C À hM h kr 2 w h i; src h t À Á C þ a hh e i srw h t; M h ksrc h t C ¼ ðw h ; sÞ Cs þ ðrw h Á n; rÞ Cr þ a h e rw h Á n; q C q À ðr 2 w h ; qÞ Cq 8w h 2 V h ;<label>ð23Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">ðw h ; c h ðx; 0ÞÞ X ¼ ðw h ; c 0 ðxÞÞ X 8w h 2 V h ;<label>ð24Þ</label></formula><p>where a is a dimensionless parameter and h e is a measure of the size of element e. Apart from the boundary condition on the concentration (2) that is built into trial and weighting function spaces, all other boundary conditions are weakly imposed. In particular, the boundary condition on the normal derivative of the concentration, Mk$c AE n, has been imposed in a fashion analogous to Nitsche's method <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The same concept has been applied to internal element boundaries to ensure weak continuity of M h k$c h AE n, inspired by the interior penalty method for second-order equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and the later work of Engel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> for fourth-order elliptic equations. The last term on the left hand-side is the so-called interior penalty term, and is essential for stability. Various terms in the weak form ensure consistency with the governing equation and boundary conditions, which is elaborated in Appendix A.1. The need for the stabilising term is elucidated in Appendix A.2 through an existence analysis of the proposed discontinuous Galerkin formulation. Also worth noting is that the presented weak form holds for non-constant M. In particular, the fourth term on the left hand-side of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_21">23</ref>) vanishes for constant mobility, $M = 0. An a priori error estimate for the method is developed in Appendix A.3, which shows in a particular norm that the convergence rate is unaffected by a, although increasing a will have a detrimental effect on the magnitude of the error.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Numerical implementation of the discontinuous Galerkin and mixed finite element formulations</head><p>The proposed discontinuous Galerkin method entails in addition to the usual integration over element volumes, integration over inter-element boundaries. While this step is not standard in continuous Galerkin finite element codes, the structure of the necessary code is not dissimilar to the usual loop over element volumes. Numerical implementation of the mixed formulation is identical to the usual implementation for mixed finite element problems.</p><p>The proposed discontinuous Galerkin formulation involves an element length scale h e which is related to the element size. In all simulations, h e is computed for each element based on the element volume. In the examples presented in Section 5, for triangular elements</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">h e ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2A e p</formula><p>, where A e is the element area, and for quadri-</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">lateral elements h e ¼ ffiffiffiffiffi A e p</formula><p>, where A e is again the element area. All examples are marched in time using the Crank-Nicolson scheme. At this stage, no adaptive time stepping has been used. The use of adaptive time stepping is potentially very attractive since the concentration field typically evolves rapidly at the start of a simulation before slowing, and then speeding up intermittently as 'bubbles' diffuse and vanish. In order to solve the nonlinear equations, the proposed formulation has been linearised consistently and a Newton-Raphson scheme has been used.</p></div>

Boundary conditions are specified on C q = C s = C (see Section 2), with q = s = 0 (see Eqs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Influence of the penalty parameter a</head><p>The same test is now used to study the influence of the penalty parameter a for the discontinuous Galerkin formulation. In a multi-dimensional setting the influence of a cannot be considered in isolation due to the presence of the element-dependent length scale h e , the definition of which is not unique. Ideally, a should be as low as possible while still maintaining stability, since error analysis indicates that large values of a have a detrimental effect on accuracy (see Appendix A.3 and Brenner and Sung <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>). Experience indicates that a = 5 for the tested elements ensures stability. For a &lt; 5, the likelihood of the model being unstable becomes high. The appropriate value of a is dependent on the element type.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> shows the concentration contours at t * = 8 • 10 À5 for the structured T6 mesh and various values of a. For moderate values of a, there is no discernible effect on the results. For the case a = 50, a slight bias can be observed in the direction of the triangle diagonals (bottom left-hand side to top right-hand side). Such effects may be observed for large values of a on meshes with a strong, anisotropic bias. However, the effects reduce with mesh refinement. The concentration contours are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> for the unstructured T6 mesh with a = 5 and a = 50. In this case, there is no discernible difference. The presence of the numerical parameter a, and mesh-dependent length scale h e , is less than desirable. Fortunately, by drawing on developments in discontinuous Galerkin methods for second-order elliptic equations it is likely that a more sophisticated stabilisation technique will avoid this need and lead to an unconditionally stable method (in the linearised case). This aspect, which is an area of ongoing research, does however often come at the cost of extra computational effort. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Evolution from a randomly perturbed initial condition</head><p>The evolution of the concentration field from a randomly perturbed initial condition is now examined on the unit square domain. For this test, the following parameters have been adopted: x/kT = 3, NkTL  concentration is equal to 0.63, with random fluctuations of zero mean and no fluctuation greater than 0.05. For the sake of comparison, the simulations have been performed for both the discontinuous Galerkin method and the mixed Galerkin formulation. For the discontinuous Galerkin technique, the unstructured T6 mesh shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>(b) has been used, and for the mixed method, the Q4Q4 mesh shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3(d</ref>   two series differ slightly due to the different initial random perturbations. However, already at t w = 2 • 10 À6 , similar patterns start to develop. The concentration evolution can basically be categorised in two phases: the first phase, which is predominantly governed by spinodal decomposition and phase separation, and a second phase which is characterised by grain coarsening.</p><p>During the first phase, roughly corresponding to the first four figures of each series, changes in concentration are driven primarily by the minimisation of the local chemical energy W c . This period is basically terminated as soon as the local concentration is driven to either value of the two binodal points. The two different discretisation techniques render statistically similar patterns. Approximately from t w = 8 • 10 À6 onwards, local changes in concentrations are primarily governed by the surface free energy W s . In order to minimise its contribution, the generated patterns cluster and grains tend to coarsen. This Ostwald ripening takes place on a much longer time scale. Accordingly, grain coarsening is a very slow process and concentrations do not change rapidly between t w = 8 • 10 À6 and t w = 2.56 • 10 À4 . Again, Figs. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and<ref type="figure">7</ref> show a statistically similar response as the grain sizes and the number of grains are of the same order of magnitude for each depicted time Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Evolution of concentration contours from a randomly perturbed initial condition using the discontinuous Galerkin method. step. To emphasise this, for the two methods a plot with a single contour at c = 0.5 is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> at t w = 2.56 • 10 À4 . The total length of the contours for the two formulations is very close: 5.26 for the discontinuous Galerkin formulation and 5.00 for the mixed formulation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>The formulation presented in this paper allows for the solution of the Cahn-Hilliard equation in primal form using simple C 0 finite element basis functions. The variational problem has been shown to be consistent with the Cahn-Hilliard equation, stability is assured for a sufficiently large penalty parameter, and an a priori estimate is provided for the error in an energy-type norm.</p><p>While not demonstrated for the Cahn-Hilliard equation in this paper, the proposed formulation represents a promising avenue for development of efficient linear solvers methods for the Cahn-Hilliard equation. Recent developments in multigrid methods for this class of problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> hold significant promise. This is of particular relevance given the computationally intensive nature of this problem, and effective iterative linear solvers will be invaluable tools for well-resolved three-dimensional simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2. Existence of a solution: time continuous case</head><p>The need for the penalty term in order to stabilise the discontinuous Galerkin formulation is justified in this section. The standard L 2 norm over X is denoted ici, and when implying integration over another domain, the domain is given, for example,</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">kr 2 ck 2 X ¼ Z Xðr 2 cÞ 2 dX: ðA:10Þ</formula><p>To prove existence of a solution to the discontinuous Galerkin model, analysis techniques commonly used to prove existence of weak solutions to the Cahn-Hilliard equation are followed (see, for example, Elliott and Zheng <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>) and extended where necessary for the discontinuous Galerkin case. The goal is to show that the concentration field in the proposed formulation is bounded in time, and in terms of a norm on V,</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">kck V ¼ krck þ kr 2 ck X þ X ni i 1 hh e i ksrctk Ci ; ðA:11Þ</formula><p>where n i is the number of element boundaries, which is an energy-like norm. Note that ici V = 0 only for the trivial case of constant c. The use of a logarithmic free-energy complicates the analysis considerably due the lack of continuity on the real line. Furthermore, concentration dependent mobility introduces considerable difficulties which have complicated past mathematical analysis of the Cahn-Hilliard equation. At this point, we restrict ourselves to the case of constant mobility, and for simplicity a continuous free energy, as is often used in analysis. Analysis for the case of logarithmic free energy can be found in Copetti and Elliot <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and Barrett and Blowey <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, and for the case of concentration-dependent mobility in Elliott and Garcke <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and Barrett et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>In examining the existence of a solution, a number of inequalities will prove useful and are presented first. The definition of various constants, denoted C, may vary at each appearance. A subscript 'e' is used to denote element-wise constants. From integration by parts and the application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and Young's inequality, it is clear that for all u, v 2 V h (V h has been defined in Section 3.1): where n e is the number of elements.
